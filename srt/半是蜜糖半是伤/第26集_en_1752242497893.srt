1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,340
little bit of a

11
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,340
little bit of a

12
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,340
little bit of a

13
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,340
little bit of a

14
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,260
Scene 2

15
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,740
No, you...

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,260
Brother, be gentle.

18
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,380
Okay, okay.

19
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,620
Why are you running?

20
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,220
I'm not here to ask you for money.

21
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,660
Why are you running so fast?

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,940
No, brother.

23
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,300
I really don't know anything.

24
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,500
You don't know?

25
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,940
I said I'm not here to ask you for money.

26
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,220
But I didn't say you're safe.

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,620
I remember the last person who told me

28
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,820
that he didn't know

29
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,660
that I took him to the security bureau.

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,460
Security bureau?

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,460
Right?

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,460
What's wrong with your father's love story?

33
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,340
I forgot to introduce you.

34
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,820
This is

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,900
a professional from the Taoist School.

36
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,180
He's a master of the art of swordplay.

37
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,580
He's...

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,940
He's fast and clean.

39
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,540
It hurts.

40
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,700
It hurts.

41
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,140
It hurts, brother.

42
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,180
It hurts.

43
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,900
Since you don't know anything,

44
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,180
I'll make you a man.

45
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,300
No, no.

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,220
No, no.

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,260
Brother Tao.

48
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,340
Don't worry.

49
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,700
Give me some time.

50
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,500
No.

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,460
Brother Tao.

52
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,620
You see?

53
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,500
This brother Tao

54
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,940
has everything.

55
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,420
Yes.

56
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,540
I can't control him.

57
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,740
So now,

58
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,380
there are only two ways for you to do it.

59
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,340
You can't choose

60
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,500
to talk to him.

61
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,260
It hurts.

62
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,340
I'll definitely hurt.

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,380
Brother Tao.

64
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,500
He chooses to hurt.

65
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,020
Yes, I choose to hurt.

66
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,060
You want to hurt?

67
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,820
Yes.

68
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,980
Then just tell him

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,940
everything you know.

70
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,140
I'll tell him.

71
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,300
I'll tell him everything.

72
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,340
It's Linda.

73
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,180
Linda asked me to do it.

74
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,820
It was like this

75
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,180
back then.

76
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,500
Whether we can get Jiang Yaoming this time

77
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,780
depends on Mr. Cao.

78
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,180
If we succeed,

79
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,740
we all have a chance to eat meat.

80
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,980
If...

81
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,020
Of course, there won't be any ifs and buts.

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,140
I don't think you'll fail.

83
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,420
But

84
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,700
isn't it a bit too ambitious?

85
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,860
If you do as I said,

86
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,660
you'll definitely succeed.

87
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,460
Okay.

88
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,820
Mr. Yin.

89
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,580
I heard that your factory

90
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,380
has been receiving a large order recently.

91
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,420
I happen to have a batch of beef.

92
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,820
I just need you to replace the beef

93
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,580
in the original ingredients

94
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,060
with my product.

95
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,980
I know

96
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,460
this is very difficult for you.

97
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
But after all,

98
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,580
it's about your daughter's life.

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
With this money,

100
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,460
take her to the operation immediately.

101
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,580
She's innocent.

102
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,300
Come on.

103
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,940
Have a good cooperation.

104
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,900
Come on.

105
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,980
Congratulations, Mr. Cao.

106
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,900
You've successfully taken Jiang Nan's position.

107
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,020
Have a good cooperation.

108
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,500
Thanks to Mr. Ling's strict arrangement,

109
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
our plan has been successful.

110
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,260
Mr. Cao,

111
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,980
you can go back to your work.

112
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,180
Mr. Ling.

113
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,980
What do you mean?

114
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,180
We agreed to eat meat together.

115
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,980
You're going to kill us?

116
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,420
Mr. Cao, you've misunderstood.

117
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm thinking about it for you.

118
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,340
After all,

119
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,460
Mr. Cao has been handling the whole thing.

120
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,540
If you still stay in Shanghai,

121
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,580
it's too attractive.

122
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,900
Are you threatening me?

123
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,940
Look at what you said.

124
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,660
We're on the same boat.

125
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,220
After you leave Shanghai,

126
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,460
we'll give you some money as a reward.

127
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,300
This number will definitely satisfy you.

128
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,020
And I promise

129
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,820
no one will bother you.

130
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,820
Mr. Ling.

131
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,500
You're really tough.

132
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,180
It seems that I have no other choice.

133
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,540
I just hope you can do what you said.

134
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,220
I like to cooperate with a smart person like Mr. Cao.

135
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,660
I'm so happy.

136
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,460
You said it was all Mr. Ling.

137
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,060
Do you have any evidence?

138
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,660
I do.

139
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,100
I secretly left his account record.

140
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,660
It's in my phone.

141
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,940
Look.

142
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,460
It has been a month.

143
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,980
I'm wondering what you've done withデ dagegen.

144
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,700
We're old friends now,

145
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,060
how could we let him go directly?

146
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,140
Accused?

147
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,900
Accused by his parents?

148
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,300
Without any reason,

149
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,420
he will never notabend it.

150
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,740
coordinated with the members of ourсятdhe.

151
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,580
I always thought he was the boss of C Group.

152
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,460
But he always mentioned us when he spoke.

153
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,860
I wonder if there's anyone else behind him.

154
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,780
If you dare to tell others about us,

155
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,380
I can't guarantee you can live long.

156
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,900
I understand.

157
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,660
But...

158
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,860
But...

159
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,900
But...

160
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,900
But what?

161
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,140
When Brother Du asked me to paint,

162
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
I told him.

163
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,740
Brother, I...

164
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,420
You made trouble yourself.

165
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,060
You should find a way to make up for it.

166
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,860
Of course.

167
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,540
Let's go.

168
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,220
Oh no.

169
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,500
They're here!

170
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,140
So I have to have you understand.

171
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,980
Have you had your sedative lately?

172
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,260
Sometimes things

173
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,500
can't be resolved girlfriends.

174
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,220
Tell me.

175
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,780
What is it?

176
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,060
There is one thing

177
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,940
that I want to discuss with you personally.

178
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,780
Your death is not a coincidence.

179
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,660
You insisted on investigating this matter.

180
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,500
Is it for yourself

181
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,340
or for him?

182
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,540
Sister.

183
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,820
We really can't keep making mistakes.

184
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,740
Tell me what happened back then.

185
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Give us the truth

186
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,300
and our own explanation.

187
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,620
Truth?

188
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,740
If I tell you

189
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,340
that Jiang Yaoming's death

190
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
really has something to do with me,

191
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,900
will you continue to investigate?

192
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,580
I don't believe

193
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,980
you would do such a thing.

194
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,780
Who is that person?

195
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,580
No matter where you are investigating now,

196
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,740
you should stop now.

197
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,180
Because you don't know

198
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,060
how terrible

199
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,660
the enemy is.

200
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,420
I will definitely save that person.

201
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,780
I have already persuaded you.

202
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,580
If you continue

203
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,220
to follow this path,

204
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,260
we will be enemies from now on.

205
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,980
Sister.

206
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,940
Jiang Jun is Jiang Yaoming's daughter.

207
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,060
That person

208
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,500
already knew

209
00:10:35,060 --> 00:11:02,380
that Mr. Wang

210
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
His daughter, Lin Bailiu, has had a bad luck.

211
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
She had already had a surgery to recover.

212
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,060
But she suddenly had a relapse a year ago.

213
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
She is currently in the hospital.

214
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Uncle, I'm sorry.

215
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,060
It's okay. Are you okay?

216
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,060
Uncle, you are so handsome.

217
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
You look like you came out of a TV.

218
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
You really know how to talk.

219
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,060
How many times have I told you not to walk around?

221
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,060
I'll just go get some water.

222
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
You're so shameless.

223
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
Who is she?

224
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,060
Factory Manager Ying.

225
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,060
You are...

226
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,060
It doesn't matter who I am.

227
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,060
But I believe

228
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,060
you must know the person in the photo.

229
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
How much time is left?

230
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,060
The doctor said it's less than a year.

231
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060
So you were bought by Cao Heng

232
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
for his surgery fee?

233
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
I know that even after many years,

234
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,060
those things can't be avoided.

235
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
If you have anything you want to know,

236
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,060
just ask.

237
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,060
As President Jiang's partner,

238
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,060
do you know anything about

239
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,060
Jiangnan's acquisition?

240
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
Ten years ago,

241
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
Jiang made the brand

242
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,060
Yixianqian with his own ancestors' rice and honey.

243
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Because it's delicious and full of ingredients,

244
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
it sold very well.

245
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,060
We old friends made money.

246
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
We were very happy.

247
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
We recommended Jiang to open a branch

248
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,060
and a online store.

249
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,060
But expanding the business

250
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,060
requires money.

251
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,060
So Jiang found a investment bank

252
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
to help us find money and finance.

253
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,060
Everything was going well.

254
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Until a man and a woman came to the factory

255
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
and said they were the person

256
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
in charge of the project.

257
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
President Jiang,

258
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,060
why are you so stubborn?

259
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,060
As long as we change

260
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,060
the production method of Yixianqian,

261
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
the production cost can be reduced by 50 percent

262
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,060
or even more.

263
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,060
With the current Yixianqian's reputation,

264
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
it's enough to make you

265
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,060
double the stubbornness of Jiangnan.

266
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
I said it before.

267
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Before the other ways of security

268
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,060
are mature,

269
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
I won't change the production method.

270
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
I think it's a good idea.

271
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
Then change the way.

272
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,060
Now Yixianqian has a high cost.

273
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,060
And the warranty period is only 15 days.

274
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
And the natural rice line has a similar texture.

275
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,060
The warranty period can be at least

276
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
three times longer.

277
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Isn't it like

278
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
carrying and using with convenience consumers?

279
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
In the current situation

280
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,060
without the same comparison,

281
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
I believe Yixianqian

282
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
can definitely take the lead

283
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
in occupying the market.

284
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
But this will

285
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
make the ingredients of Yixianqian

286
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060
lose freshness and nutrition.

287
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
The key is that

288
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,060
the taste will also be greatly reduced.

289
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,060
I don't want the production method

291
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
to become a garbage food

292
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,060
all over the street.

293
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
You don't have to persuade me.

294
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
I won't agree.

295
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
Mr. Jiang,

296
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,060
why don't you...

297
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Mr. Jiang,

298
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
if you are so

299
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,060
free-spirited,

300
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
you will be able to

301
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
eat the eggs one day.

302
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,060
After that incident,

303
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
the CEO of C Group, Cao Heng,

304
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,060
found me.

305
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,060
He promised to give me a lot of money.

306
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
The condition was

307
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
to let me secretly

308
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
buy a batch of ground beef.

309
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
At that time, my daughter's operation

310
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,060
needed money.

311
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
I had to agree to it.

312
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,060
But why did Mr. Jiang die?

313
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,060
What?

314
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Do you think

315
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,060
there is something wrong with Mr. Jiang's death?

316
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
I'm still investigating this matter.

317
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
Do you remember

318
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
the man who went to the factory

319
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
to find Mr. Jiang?

320
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
I think his name is

321
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Lin...

322
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Lin Taimo.

323
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Congratulations.

324
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,060
You got back the control of MH.

325
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,060
I have to thank you for your reminder.

326
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
I have a close look at

327
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,060
his personality

328
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
when he hugged him.

329
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
Really?

330
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,060
But for a little person,

331
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
you actually went out in person.

332
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
I have to guard against a little person.

333
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,060
Since you can't help me

334
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
after you lost your memory,

335
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,060
I have to figure it out myself

336
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
to be at ease.

337
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,060
So he has already noticed

338
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
this case?

339
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Don't worry.

340
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
He knows little about it.

341
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
But

342
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
I will not let him

343
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,060
have this opportunity.

344
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
You can take this.

345
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
I will be here.

346
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
Let's go.

347
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
I suddenly called you here

348
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
because Mr. Lin

349
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
has some special instructions.

350
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,060
What you are holding now

351
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,060
is information from Hengsheng Group.

352
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
Some time ago,

353
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Mr. Wang from Hengsheng Group

354
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
contacted us.

355
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,820
But at the same time, we also understand that

356
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,340
he is also in contact with this company

357
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,820
while he is in contact with us.

358
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,420
So what you need to do now

359
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,940
is to make this case

360
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,460
stay in our AMH

361
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,420
through your efforts

362
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,220
during the time when Mr. Wang came to Shanghai for business trips.

363
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
Of course, if anyone of you

364
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,900
did a good job,

365
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,980
Mr. Lin can make a speech

366
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,900
to force him to be promoted to the position of manager.

367
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,380
Because this case is particularly important,

368
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,700
Mr. Lin wants you to

369
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,580
cooperate with us as a team.

370
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,180
Don't fight like a scattered soldier.

371
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,660
So you need a team leader

372
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,140
in this team.

373
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,540
You can be the team leader.

374
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,340
Well, Mr. Chang, is there any problem?

375
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,540
No.

376
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,060
Since there is no problem,

377
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,140
let's get to work.

378
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,740
Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

379
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,860
Thank you.

380
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,020
You can bet everything

381
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,540
on relationships.

382
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,060
Come in.

383
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,340
Mr. Lin,

384
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,400
this is a document

385
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,500
from Mr. Bai to you.

386
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,180
Okay, I know.

387
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,140
Well,

388
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,660
during the killing

389
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,620
of Hengsheng Kelly this morning,

390
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,540
Mr. Qiao,

391
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,180
do you have any objections

392
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,780
to the decision of the director?

393
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,860
Why didn't you say anything?

394
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,060
No, Mr. Lin.

395
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,260
You may have misjudged it.

396
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,580
I wanted to say something,

397
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,500
but Mr. Qiao told me

398
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,780
not to say anything.

399
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,860
So I didn't say anything.

400
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,400
No, you are not wrong.

401
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,460
No.

402
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,420
I mean,

403
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,740
you didn't say anything

404
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,480
to say no to him.

405
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:01,940
Did you all

406
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,000
carry out a Secret scenery

407
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,580
just for General?

408
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,700
I arranged

409
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,120
to nominate only one

410
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,440
have a sense of competition.

411
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,800
You mean...

412
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,760
My subordinate

413
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
has always been a person who doesn't dare to show off.

414
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,720
As long as I want to get something, I will never give up.

415
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,840
Even if I have to use all my means.

416
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,400
As long as I have the means and the process,

417
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,800
it's not important at all.

418
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay, I will go alone.

419
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,520
Yes.

420
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,080
Mr. Wang is a person who can not stand one less thing.

421
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,520
As long as someone dates him today,

422
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,600
and the MRT has been delayed,

423
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,200
he will be very angry.

424
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,120
The documents are ready.

425
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,520
Thank you.

426
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,480
How many times was Mr. Wang meeting with you?

427
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
He's on a busy trip to Shanghai this time

428
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,680
It's so tight

429
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,400
I planned to meet him at ten tonight

430
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,640
Well

431
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,680
How about

432
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,240
Going with me?

433
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,840
It's a process by three city partners

434
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
Can you give us a hand?

435
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,240
No, no

436
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,080
Well

437
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,800
I still have something to do

438
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,280
You...

439
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,920
You can go by yourself

440
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,840
What's wrong with you?

441
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
It's okay

442
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,240
Hello

443
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,760
You're at a discount

444
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm leaving.

445
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,400
I have something else to do.

446
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,520
I'll leave now.

447
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,560
Okay, bye.

448
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,360
으

449
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm not leaving.

450
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,480
I told you so

451
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
he called for me.

452
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
I'm going to look for him.

453
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,400
I'll go to the bathroom.

454
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,240
Brother Wang,

455
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,440
someone is outside.

456
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,600
Do you want to go out and have a look?

457
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,240
Go out?

458
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,800
Yes.

459
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,040
I'll go and have a look.

460
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,600
Okay.

461
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,520
What's going on, Yuling?

462
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,840
Listen to me.

463
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,680
What's going on?

464
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,520
The second time.

465
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,360
The first time I slept on the bed.

466
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm so tired today.

467
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,600
Sit down.

468
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,480
No.

469
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:03,880
Take him away.

470
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,680
Don't touch me.

471
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,760
I'll go to the bathroom.

472
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,440
Sit down.

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,440
No.

474
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,040
Don't touch me.

475
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,400
Go.

476
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,080
I'll go to the bathroom.

477
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,920
I'll sleep on the bed.

478
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,120
Done.

479
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,520
Let's go.

480
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,080
Bad time.

481
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,880
Hello.

482
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,560
Are you coming home tonight?

483
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,920
I'm on my way.

484
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
I'm meeting my beta- Early products.

485
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,520
I'll come back later.

486
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,560
I'll drive you back.

487
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,560
No, it's too late.

488
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,760
Okay, I'm going to the elevator.

489
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,720
I'll hang up.

490
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,240
If you miss me too much,

491
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,360
I'll give you an address.

492
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,480
Go pick me up there.

493
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,760
Bye.

494
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,120
Jiang Jun.

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,720
Hello?

496
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,560
What's going on?

497
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,680
Is anyone there?

498
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,160
Open the door.

499
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,360
Is anyone there?

500
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,880
Can you see me?

501
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm sure it's you.

502
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,680
Is anyone there?

503
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,160
What's up?

504
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,520
We were right.

505
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,840
There's someone behind Linda.

506
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,280
I found out.

507
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,400
It's Lin Tai Mo.

508
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,760
He's the real boss of C Group.

509
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,280
Lin Tai Mo?

510
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,600
Oh no.

511
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,720
He knows that

512
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,160
Jiang Jun is Jiang Yang Min's daughter.

513
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,440
What?

514
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,760
I want to know if he's a client.

515
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,800
I'll call you back later.

516
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,480
I'll hang up now.

517
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,880
Sorry, the number you dialed is not available at the moment.

518
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,640
Please try again later.

519
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,440
Is anyone there?

520
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,640
Is anyone there?

521
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,040
Is anyone there?

522
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,040
Is anyone there?

523
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,960
Why is the signal so weak?

524
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,120
Jiang Jun.

525
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,880
Jiang Jun.

526
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,080
Jiang Jun, are you in there?

527
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,600
Jiang Jun.

528
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,120
Jiang Jun.

529
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,120
Jiang Jun.

530
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,240
Jiang Jun.

531
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,840
Jiang Jun.

532
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,880
Jiang Jun, are you in there?

533
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,240
Is anyone there?

534
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,440
No one is in there.

535
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,640
Jiang Jun.

536
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
Jiang Jun.

537
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,680
Jiang Jun.

538
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,240
Jiang Jun.

539
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,520
I...

540
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,800
Jiang Jun.

541
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,080
Jiang Jun.

542
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
General.

543
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
General.

544
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Are you okay?

545
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I'm here.

546
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
General.

547
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Mr. Yuan, don't worry.

548
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Miss Jiang

549
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
was mainly shocked by the accident.

550
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
As long as she rests well,

551
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
she will be fine in a while.

552
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Thank you, doctor.

553
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
No problem.

554
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
No matter how much you pay,

555
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
I will protect you.

556
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Where is the

557
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
doctor?

558
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,520
You are always by my side.

559
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
My promise.

560
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Wait for you to say it.

561
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Who is it?

562
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Do you remember me?

563
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Mr. Du,

564
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
Xi Ke.

565
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
I'm here to see you today.

566
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
I want to negotiate with you.

567
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
You don't need to knock

568
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
my people out

569
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
to negotiate with me.

570
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Besides,

571
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I don't remember

572
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
when we

573
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
had a deal.

574
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
I already knew it

575
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
five years ago.

576
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Including Jiang Yaoming's death.

577
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
You dare to investigate me?

578
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
I'm also involved in that.

579
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
So I'm not scared of you.

580
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
What's scary is that

581
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
there is also Yun Shuai

582
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
who is investigating you with me.

583
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
He also knows it.

584
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,520
He is collecting evidence

585
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
and preparing to report you.

586
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
How can I remember

587
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
you were the one who

588
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
sent me to the hospital?

589
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
I was the one

590
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
who sent you to the hospital.

591
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
How can I remember

592
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
you were always

593
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
the loser of Yun Shuai's men?

594
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
You can cooperate

595
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
with him.

596
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
You are really

597
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
generous.

598
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Mr. Lin doesn't need

599
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
to worry about me.

600
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
I just want to

601
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
know myself and my enemy.

602
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Now the time has come.

603
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
It's time to make him

604
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
pay for it.

605
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
I don't believe it.

606
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
A person who likes to

607
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
fight alone

608
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
suddenly asked me for help.

609
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
It's too deliberate.

610
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I gave you Yun Shuai's blood.

611
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
You gave me Jiang Jun.

612
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
It's for a woman.

613
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
I didn't expect Mr. Du

614
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
to be Mr. Qin.

615
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
But she is

616
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Jiang Yaoming's daughter.

617
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I can't keep her.

618
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Don't worry.

619
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Jiang Jun doesn't know

620
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
anything so far.

621
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I can promise you.

622
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
After it's done,

623
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
I will keep an eye on her for you.

624
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
The enemy we are together now

625
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
is only Yun Shuai.

626
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

627
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
You can tell me lies

628
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
You can make me cry

629
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
You know why

630
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Never been so brave

631
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I won't run away

632
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
You are awake.

633
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
This is what you like

634
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,520
What you want I don't want

635
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
I almost thought

636
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
I almost didn't see you.

637
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Thank you for finding me.

638
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Don't be silly.

639
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
We finally get together.

640
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
I won't let you leave me again.

641
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Even if it's the king of heaven,

642
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
don't want to take you away from me.

643
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Maybe the god is too strong.

644
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Yun Shuai.

645
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
You lie down first.

646
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,520
You have a good rest today.

647
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
I'll help you get up.

648
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,520
Leave all the things behind

649
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Let's sleep for a while.

650
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
End of story

651
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Leave all love nowhere

652
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,520
To find

653
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Jiang Jun.

654
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I checked the surveillance.

655
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,520
You are not surprised.

656
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
It's Shen Xing.

657
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
He took away the brand of the repair.

658
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Shen Xing.

659
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
How do you plan to deal with it?

660
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I'll listen to you.

661
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
I'll give you.

662
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
The real death is real.

663
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
Don't show up.

664
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
I want to solve it myself.

665
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
How can that work?

666
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
It almost killed you.

667
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
As the saying goes,

668
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
first to the end, then to the end.

669
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,520
I must have my own reasons for doing this.

670
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,520
I am not sensitive to office culture.

671
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,520
So I will get the job and the relationship together.

672
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
The death of the car is also a reminder to me.

673
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,520
So I want to try to solve it myself.

674
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Okay?

675
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Okay.

676
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
I believe you can handle it.

677
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
I'm so sleepy.

678
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,520
I'm going to the office this afternoon.

679
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
What office are you going to?

680
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
What you need most now is rest.

681
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Do you hear me?

682
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
I don't believe it.

683
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,520
I want to be an independent woman.

684
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
I can't rely on my husband.

685
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
I'm going to sleep.

686
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
I'm going to sleep.

687
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
I'm going to sleep.

688
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Are you honest?

689
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Say it again.

690
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Jiang Jun.

691
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
I'm going to sleep.

692
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
I'm going to sleep.

693
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
I'm going to sleep.

694
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
Jiang Jun.

695
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
I heard you had an accident last night.

696
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
Are you okay?

697
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Are you hurt?

698
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
I'm curious.

699
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Did you think about me when you were doing this?

700
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
What are you talking about?

701
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
I don't understand.

702
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
You don't understand?

703
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
You deliberately moved the brand in the elevator maintenance.

704
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
Dare to do it, dare not to be me.

705
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
You talk nonsense.

706
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Do you have evidence?

707
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
I don't know.

708
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
You two, come to the office with me.

709
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
You want evidence, right?

710
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
See for yourself.

711
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
Look at the bracelet on this photo.

712
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Is it particularly familiar?

713
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Mr. Qiao.

714
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

715
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
Enough.

716
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I don't want to listen to your nonsense.

717
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,520
You will not only be fired by MH.

718
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
In the future, no matter which bank you enter,

719
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
you will not have a place in the group.

720
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,520
Not to mention that you have been attacked by the law.

721
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Want to cry?

722
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Go to the police station and cry.

723
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Jiang Jun, I'm sorry.

724
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I just thought you were late.

725
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

726
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
I think you forgive me, Jiang Jun.

727
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,520
I beg you, I don't want to do it.

728
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
I'm sorry, Jiang Jun.

729
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,520
You forgive me, I was wrong.

730
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Mr. Qiao.

731
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
I know you are angry about this.

732
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
I am also angry.

733
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,520
He said there must be some misunderstanding in the project.

734
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
I want to talk to him.

735
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I will give you an answer later, okay?

736
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

737
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Jiang Jun.

738
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Jiang Jun, I beg you to forgive me.

739
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
If I have an idea, my life will be over.

740
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
I thought you were just jealous.

741
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
I never thought I was wrong.

742
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
You are not only jealous, but also stupid.

743
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,520
I just want to give myself a chance.

744
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
So I said you are stupid.

745
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
If you want to overtake the front,

746
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
then you have to try hard to fight.

747
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
What's the use of playing this trick?

748
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
Have you ever thought about

749
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
if I really had an accident yesterday,

750
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
how could you escape the legal system?

751
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
What about your parents?

752
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
What about your future?

753
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
I know.

754
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
I have already made a big mistake.

755
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
It's useless.

756
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
I don't want to be a victim.

757
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
I can leave MH.

758
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
I can even leave Tuo Anjuan.

759
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,520
But can I ask you not to sue me?

760
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,520
I don't want to go to jail.

761
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Jiang Jun, I beg you.

762
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Crying is useless.

763
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
You should cry.

764
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,520
And I have something to ask you.

765
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
Don't you want to take responsibility for me?

766
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
I didn't do anything.

767
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
What responsibility can I take from you?

768
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,520
And I asked Mr. Qiao to fire you.

769
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
What's the use of that?

770
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I'd rather keep a person with a handle.

771
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Maybe one day,

772
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
I can take you out as a gunman.

773
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

774
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
Enough. Stop being so mean.

775
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,520
I'll talk to Mr. Qiao later.

776
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

777
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
You are?

778
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
We are the members of MH.

779
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Now someone is reporting it on the spot and talking about bribery.

780
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Please cooperate with us to take the investigation.

781
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
The criminal investigation is over.

782
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
We will continue to investigate.

783
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Let's go.

784
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Okay.

785
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Let's go.

786
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Let's go.

787
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Let's go.

788
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Let's go.

789
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Let's go.

790
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Let's go.

791
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,520
I can never knew you were not mine

792
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,520
Make you satisfied

793
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,520
Wear another mask

794
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,520
You never realize things I do for love

795
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,520
I think I'm tired

796
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,520
I think I'm blind

797
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,520
Don't know how to feel

798
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Don't know how to heal

799
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,520
You walk so fast

800
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Can't catch your light

801
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,520
You fly so high

802
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,520
Leave all the things behind

803
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
And our story

804
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,520
Leave all love nowhere to find

805
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I think I'm tired

806
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,520
I think I'm blind

807
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Don't know how to feel

808
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,520
Don't know how to heal

809
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,520
You walk so fast

810
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
Can't catch your light

811
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,520
You fly so high

812
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,520
Leave all the things behind

813
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
And our story

814
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:11,520
Leave all love nowhere to find
