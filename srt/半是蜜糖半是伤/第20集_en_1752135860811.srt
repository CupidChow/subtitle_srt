Episode 12

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,960
Mr. Jiang, slow down.

5
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,080
No, no.

6
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,200
Don't get me wrong.

7
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,760
Yuan has a girlfriend.

8
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:45,320
謹谭

9
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,480
The audit goes through.

10
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,400
The arrangement is successful.

11
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah!

12
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Yeah!

13
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Yeah!

14
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Congratulations!

15
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
You can be promoted to the top of the list!

16
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Thank you!

17
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Thank you!

18
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Let's take a picture.

19
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
3, 2, 1!

20
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah!

21
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Come in!

22
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Come in!

23
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Is there something wrong?

24
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Mr. Wu from He Zhong

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
wants to treat us to dinner tonight.

26
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Go get him.

27
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Mr. Wu?

28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Why didn't he contact me?

29
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I asked him out for dinner with his wife.

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
You're so nice.

31
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
That's good.

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
It's been a long time since I last met Mr. Wu.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Let's meet tonight.

34
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
See you at 7 p.m.

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I'll send you the address later.

36
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay.

37
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
It's cold today.

38
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Wear more.

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Okay.

40
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Come on.

41
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Don't worry.

42
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
He's feeling better after the surgery.

43
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
He should be awake soon.

44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
How many times did you get it wrong?

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Four times.

47
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
How many points did you get?

48
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
72 points.

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
How many times did you get it wrong?

50
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Four times.

51
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Du Lei, remember this.

52
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Be my son.

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I'll be your son.

54
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I'll be your son.

55
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I'll be your son.

56
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I'll be your son.

57
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
I'll be your son.

58
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Be my son.

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
You have to be the best one.

60
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
No more words.

61
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Hit it.

62
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
How about you?

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Are you feeling better now?

64
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I'll go get some air.

65
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Okay, bye.

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I'll be there soon.

67
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I'll be there.

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Okay, bye.

69
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Goodbye.

70
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Bye.

71
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Goodbye.

72
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Goodbye.

73
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Bye.

74
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Bye.

75
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Bye.

76
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,680
I've already arranged

77
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
to meet you in person.

78
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,080
No.

79
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,520
Don't.

80
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm a little tired.

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,440
I can't hear you.

82
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
The video will be released

83
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,800
on the same day as the press conference.

84
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,720
And other competing companies

85
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,280
have already settled down.

86
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,400
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,440
Thank you.

88
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
If there's nothing else,

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
I'll go back first.

90
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,720
Deng Deng,

91
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
when did you come?

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,320
Where's your sister?

93
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,120
She's a man.

94
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,560
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,360
It's useless to grow up.

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
I want to be mature.

97
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to be sensible.

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
I really want to experience some ups and downs.

99
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,360
Some crises.

100
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm very happy

101
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
that you're sensible.

102
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,560
No matter what,

103
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
I still want to thank you for helping my family

104
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
to overcome this crisis.

105
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,320
Don't misunderstand.

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm not helping you.

107
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm just

108
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,560
doing what I should do.

109
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,880
If you have to thank me,

110
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,920
I hope from today on,

111
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,360
I won't have any ties with the drug lord.

112
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,480
Do you know that?

113
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,040
I still don't know

114
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,640
why I went to find a child

115
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,920
who was the same age,

116
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
the same month,

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the same day,

118
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,960
and the same time

119
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,080
to be able to change her in my lightisation,

120
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
in my taunta刃.

121
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Because the most important thing

122
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,400
was marrying her.

123
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,760
I understand,

124
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,640
you just want to get through it.

125
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,880
Simply,

126
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,280
get along.

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,960
I don't think you can do anything

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,960
that you've been doing these past few days

129
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,960
to pay off your past years of upbringing.

130
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,960
I don't mind.

131
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Boys, when they grow up,

132
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,960
they should be able to be a good daughter.

133
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Xiaolei,

134
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,960
once I'm discharged from the hospital,

135
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I can go to the hospital with you

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,960
and talk about our past.

137
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm serious.

138
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Thank you.

139
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
You should rest well.

140
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,960
It's so cold outside.

142
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Welcome to Minjialing!

143
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Did you get cold?

144
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,960
What?

145
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,960
What? Are you angry?

146
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Can you stop doing this in the future?

147
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I'm just kidding.

148
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Why are you angry?

149
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm not angry.

150
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,960
That's good. I guess you don't have time to buy anything new.

151
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
I bought you a mask.

152
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,960
It can keep you hydrated and prevent you from getting dry.

153
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
And this foot bath pack.

154
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,960
It can cool your skin. Isn't it beautiful?

155
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You're watching that video?

156
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Yes.

157
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:10,960
I didn't expect that the first couple of this video is Yuan Shuai and Jun Jun.

159
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,960
I didn't expect that either.

160
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Xiaochun, is something wrong with your software?

161
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Why do I feel like they're not compatible?

162
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Is there a problem?

163
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
No.

164
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
The compatible system in the western world has no problem.

165
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,960
They will definitely be together.

166
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,960
But I really don't think it's accurate.

167
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,960
What about the people who are compatible with each other?

168
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
It's simple.

169
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,960
One percent means that they are completely impossible because they are completely inappropriate.

170
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Li Xiaochun!

171
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
What?

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm going to clean up the bathroom.

173
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Are you cold?

174
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Why is it so cold outside?

175
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
I almost froze to death when I went out to deliver the information.

176
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,960
The weather forecast said that it might snow today.

178
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Really? It's so early in the morning.

179
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Yes.

180
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Come in.

181
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I forgot to hand in the report of the risk assessment.

183
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm going to get scolded again.

184
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I'll go get it.

185
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
When did Mr. Yuan ask him to do the risk assessment?

186
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
How come I don't know?

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Dr. Da, he was already using the door to the left when you were burying the body.

188
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,960
What about you? You wrote a report and got hit back ten times.

189
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Who cares about the door to the left?

190
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,960
I'll go get it myself.

191
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,960
You're really a master.

192
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,960
I had a lot of fun this afternoon.

193
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Mr. Jiang.

194
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,960
This is your task to make the whole set of the play.

195
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Mr. Yuan, you're not going to be so careless, are you?

196
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Come here.

197
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
What?

198
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Come here.

199
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Take your frozen feet and test them.

200
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Don't get sick.

201
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Okay. Thank you for your concern.

202
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm just afraid that you'll get sick and affect your work.

203
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,960
I won't be easy on you then.

204
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Is it warm?

205
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Mr. Yuan, I heard that you're going out tonight.

206
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
So?

207
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
It's rare to go out in Shanghai.

208
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
Shouldn't it be a bit ritualistic?

209
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
What ritualistic do you want?

210
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Why don't we cook hot pot at home?

211
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Hot pot? Okay.

212
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,960
I have something to do tonight. I'll be home as soon as possible.

213
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
I'll cook it myself then.

214
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,960
There's no way to save it.

215
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
You really know how to cook hot pot.

216
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
I remember that someone couldn't even stand the soup that I made.

217
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Who are you talking about?

218
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I promise that you'll be moved by it.

219
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Okay. I'll be waiting.

220
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Okay. I'm not cold anymore. I'm going out.

221
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Going out?

222
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Wang Cai!

223
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
You're here to pick me up?

224
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,960
Come here.

225
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

226
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm going to laugh to death if I put the candles in.

227
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

228
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
I'm going to the bathroom.

229
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Okay.

230
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Where are Mr. Wu and Mrs. Wu?

231
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
They didn't ask you out.

232
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
I asked them out myself.

233
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
You can't say anything in the office.

234
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
You have to ask them out.

235
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
You can't say anything in the office.

236
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Let's eat first. It's all your favorite.

237
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Actually, I met a girl at the office today.

238
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,960
She told me that you have a girlfriend.

239
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Is that true?

240
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
I don't have a girlfriend.

241
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
I told you. How could you have a girlfriend?

242
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Why can't I have a girlfriend?

243
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Ren Shuai, everyone says that love is an instant impulse.

244
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Do you believe in eternal love?

245
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I believe. Of course I believe.

246
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm like most people.

247
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,960
I believe that instant can become eternal.

248
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Do you think there will be that instant between us?

249
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
No.

250
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Why?

251
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
Everyone thinks that we are the best match.

252
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Qiao Na, you are my best friend at work.

253
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,960
I also treat you as my best friend.

254
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,960
But we have no other option.

255
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
Sorry.

256
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I didn't mean to.

257
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,960
It's okay. I'll go to the restroom.

258
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I'll go to the restroom.

259
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Meng Chan, why hasn't your father come back yet?

260
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
How about I call him?

261
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
It's okay to be concerned about your subordinates.

262
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
It's not safe at night.

263
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Yes.

264
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
Look, there are so many hot pots.

265
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
We can't finish them.

266
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Do you want to try?

267
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Let's eat.

268
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I'll pour you some vinegar.

269
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I'll pour you some vinegar.

270
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Meng Chan, there's no vinegar.

271
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I'll ask your father to bring you some vinegar.

272
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
You love vinegar, don't you?

273
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I'll call him.

274
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Hello, there's no vinegar in the house.

275
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
What vinegar?

276
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Mr. Qiao.

277
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Yes, it's me.

278
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Mr. Yuan doesn't have time to teach you how to work tonight.

279
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
We are busy.

280
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Don't call him again.

281
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
I'll eat it myself.

282
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I'll eat it myself.

283
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Go.

284
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
I have something to do. I'll go first.

285
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Is it something with other girls?

286
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,960
It's my own business, no matter who it is.

287
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
Sit down.

288
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
Try to understand

289
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

290
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
You can tell me lies

291
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
You can make me cry

292
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
You know why

293
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I've liked you for so many years.

294
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Can't you feel it at all?

295
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
If I've been so brave

296
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
I will rise again

297
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
I'd rather you really can't feel it.

298
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
If it's what you want

299
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
It's better than pretending you don't know.

300
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
I don't mind

301
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
But

302
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Am I not good enough?

303
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Am I not worthy of you?

304
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
I don't want to hurt you.

305
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
But I'm really sorry.

306
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
I already have someone I like.

307
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
What do you mean by someone you like?

308
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
From the moment I met you

309
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
You have never had a girl.

310
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Is it the one in the company who is pestering you every day?

311
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
I like her. It's my own business.

312
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
I don't think it has anything to do with her.

313
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
So I'm sorry.

314
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I can't tell you.

315
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Okay.

316
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Then I'll ask you the last question.

317
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
If the person you like doesn't like you

318
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Can you

319
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Look back at me?

320
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Even if the person I like doesn't like me

321
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I won't see anyone else.

322
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
It's really amazing.

323
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
A strong warrior

324
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Who loves to be like me.

325
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
No.

326
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
We are different.

327
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
At least I can say it bravely.

328
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
And you

329
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Don't even have the courage to say it.

330
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
I'm leaving first.

331
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm leaving first.

332
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
It's snowing.

333
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Xiao Chuan.

334
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Hurry up.

335
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Look.

336
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
It's snowing.

337
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Could you turn the暗� on?

338
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
We both have stories.

339
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,960
But there are also military stories.

340
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Takes the kind ofuy.

341
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:12,300
傷痛難過

342
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,100
電風豁回

343
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,100
boyfriend

344
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,800
抚人

345
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,100
director

346
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,580
I just want to say I like you

347
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,260
Let happiness be the first

348
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,180
Those are all lies from little girls

349
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,580
It's not bad to be a little girl

350
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,020
When you see a snowy day outside

351
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,940
Of course you'll have a white head

352
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,740
Because the snow is all over your head

353
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,260
You're not romantic at all

354
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,940
When the snow is falling

355
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,100
You just said

356
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,180
What can be white-headed when you see the snow together

357
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,820
This kind of thing has no data to support

358
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,900
Totally untrustworthy

359
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,380
Can't stop missing

360
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,220
Yes, yes, yes

361
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,180
Your big data is the best

362
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,020
Then ask

363
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,740
Your 100% couple

364
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,380
Why are you still not together?

365
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,340
why

366
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,980
Can't be faster now

367
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,940
Why

368
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,420
I want to set this moment

369
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,540
Wait for you to nod and say yes

370
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
I want to set this moment

371
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Wait for you to nod and say yes

372
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Why

373
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Can't be faster now

374
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Why

375
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Can't be faster now

376
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
Why

377
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Can't be faster now

378
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
Why

379
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Can't be faster now

380
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Why

381
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Can't be faster now

382
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
Why

383
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Can't be faster now

384
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
Why

385
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
Can't be faster now

386
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Why

387
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
Can't be faster now

388
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
why

389
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Can't be faster now

390
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Hello

391
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
Hello president Palestinians

392
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
Send me the pension capital Plans for our vote

393
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,500
How could he

394
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,420
You can only have one week

395
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
Five days

396
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,860
You just want me to give up

397
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,740
I can't

398
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:30,740
Sun, snow, stars glow from silver moon

399
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:40,740
I am missing my only sunlight

400
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,740
I need you to be here

401
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,740
Why you have to leave?

402
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,740
Oh please come back my love

403
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,740
I pray every night you hurry back to me

404
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
The winter turns to spring

405
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,740
I'm standing next to you

406
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,740
To see the flowers grow

407
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,740
How is your dad?

408
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Much better

409
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,740
The doctor said he will be discharged in a few days

410
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,740
I have taken care of the company's business

411
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Don't worry

412
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,740
I am relieved to have you

413
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Do you remember?

414
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
You had a bad exam when you were a kid

415
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
You cried so hard

416
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,740
But your dad beat you up

417
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,740
And then you didn't sleep all night

418
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,740
The next day I saw your dark circles

419
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
You looked exactly like your dad

420
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
You still remember?

421
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,740
I remember you were so cute

422
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
I remember you were so cute

423
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
I remember you were so cute

424
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
You still remember?

425
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
Of course I remember

426
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,740
You said you made me look like a ghost

427
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,740
You look really good when you smile

428
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,740
Du, you left the Du family

429
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,740
We are no longer siblings

430
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Have you ever thought about

431
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,740
Trying another way to get along?

432
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
What way?

433
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
Will you be with me?

434
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
I will

435
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,740
You don't trust me

436
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,740
You are so secretive

437
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
You are so sly

438
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
You gave me the signal

439
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,740
You are so shameless

440
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
You took my house

441
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
You took my sofa

442
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
You took my living room

443
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
You took my bedroom

444
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,740
You took my wardrobe

445
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,740
Why?

446
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,740
You are so beautiful

447
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
I will let you take me

448
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Go away

449
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Go away

450
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,740
Go away

451
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,740
What?

452
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,740
I will go away

453
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Go away

454
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,740
Go away

455
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Go away

456
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Go away

457
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,740
Go away

458
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,740
Go away

459
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,740
Go away

460
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,740
Go away

461
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
Go away

462
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
Go away

463
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
Go away

464
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
Go away

465
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,740
Go away

466
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Go away

467
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
Moca

468
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
You

469
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,740
You are not the Moca from ten years ago, right?

470
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,740
So it is you

471
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
I am crying to the star

472
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
To where you are

473
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
I am holding back the tears

474
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,740
May this broken wish

475
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,740
Will be strong enough

476
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,740
To take me all the way to you

477
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Across the ocean

478
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,740
You will be waiting

479
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
A lighthouse

480
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,740
Shining down forever

481
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,740
Watch me fly so high

482
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,740
See how my colors paint the sky

483
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
I will be waiting

484
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
A lighthouse

485
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,740
Shining down forever

486
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,740
Watch me fly so high

487
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,740
See how my colors paint the sky

488
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,740
Across the ocean

489
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,740
Take my love

490
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,740
I can feel you

491
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,740
If I can do what you want

492
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,740
Where is it?

493
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,740
Little baby, are you okay?

494
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
I am your brother Yuan Yuan

495
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Although you only taught me once

496
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
But I really like you calling me that

497
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
When you see this letter

498
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
I am going to study abroad

499
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,740
I don't know when I can come back

500
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,740
Don't miss me too much

501
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,740
If you really miss me

502
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740
Call me

503
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
Call me when you want to cry

504
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
When someone else bullies you

505
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
Remember to call me

506
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,740
See how my colors paint the sky

507
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,740
Take away the spirit from me

508
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,740
Love

509
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,740
When did you fall in love?

510
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,740
If you don't dare to say it

511
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,740
You can tell me

512
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,740
I will give you a trick

513
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
My name is secret love, do you understand?

514
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,740
It sounds good, secret love

515
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,740
To put it bluntly, it means coward

516
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,740
I'm not afraid to say it

517
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,740
I don't even have friends

518
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Sometimes I dream of you

519
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,740
Tears on my face

520
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,740
All night long

521
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:24,740
Tell me how I live without you

522
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,740
I can't hold you no more

523
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,740
But I do feel you so real

524
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:53,740
Just want you to stay still for me

525
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:04,740
Sometimes I dream of you

526
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:12,740
I can't my pray all night long

527
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:20,740
Sometimes I ask myself

528
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:28,740
Why I lost the way of my life

529
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Tell me how I live without you

530
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,740
I can't hold you no more

531
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,740
But I do feel you so real

532
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:08,740
Just want you to stay still for me

533
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:16,740
Sometimes I dream of you

534
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:25,740
I can't my pray all night long

535
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,740
Sometimes I ask myself

536
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,740
How I live without you

537
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,740
I

538
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
Zhang Jun

539
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,740
I don't want to wait any longer

540
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,740
The sky is gray

541
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,740
The moment I miss you

542
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,740
I want to cry

543
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,740
What complicated methods

544
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,740
Prove that love is worth it

545
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,740
You are the all of my life

546
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,740
The book I can't finish reading is still like a book

547
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,740
The song I listen to is like a river

548
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,740
I compose the complete plot with you

549
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,740
I love you, it's true

550
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,740
I can't stop thinking of you

551
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,740
Every minute, every second

552
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,740
Baby I love you, it's true

553
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Because you exist, I understand

554
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,740
Love is everything falling for you

555
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,740
The sky is gray

556
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,740
The moment I miss you

557
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,740
The rain is telling me

558
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,740
You are my only one, only love for

559
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,740
What complicated methods

560
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,740
Prove that love is worth it

561
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,740
You are the all of my life

562
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,740
The book I can't finish reading is still like a book

563
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,740
The song I listen to is like a river

564
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,740
I compose the complete plot with you

565
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,740
I love you, it's true

566
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,740
I can't stop thinking of you

567
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,740
Every minute, every second

568
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,740
Baby I love you, it's true

569
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,740
Because you exist, I understand

570
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:07,740
Love is everything falling for you

571
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:16,740
Love is everything falling for you

572
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:37,740
Actually, we can be any kind of relationship

573
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,740
But not this kind

574
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,740
I like her again

575
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,740
I love you, it's true

576
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,740
I can't stop thinking of you

577
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,740
Every minute, every second

578
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,740
Baby I love you, it's true

579
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,740
I can't stop thinking of you

580
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,740
Every minute, every second

581
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,740
Baby I love you, it's true

582
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,740
I've been so brave

583
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,740
I will run away

584
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,740
If it's what you want, what you like

585
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,740
I don't mind

586
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,740
I can close my eyes

587
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,740
I can stay behind, waste my time

588
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,740
Walk into your plan

589
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:52,740
Like I never knew you were not mine

590
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Make you satisfied

591
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,740
Wear another mask

592
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:05,740
You never realize things I do for love

593
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,740
I think I'm tired

594
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,740
I think I'm blind

595
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Don't know how to feel

596
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Don't know how to heal

597
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,740
You walk so fast

598
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,740
Can't catch your light

599
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,740
You fly so high

600
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,740
Leave all the things behind

601
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,740
And our story

602
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:45,740
Leave all love nowhere to find

603
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,740
I think I'm tired

604
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,740
I think I'm blind

605
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,740
Don't know how to feel

606
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,740
Don't know how to heal

607
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,740
You walk so fast

608
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,740
Can't catch your light

609
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,740
You fly so high

610
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,740
Leave all the things behind

611
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,740
And our story

612
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:25,740
Leave all love nowhere to find
