1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,580
you

3
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,340
Tell him

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,600
Yeah.

5
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,660
Yeah.

6
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,560
Yeah.

7
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,560
No.

8
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,960
Mh They.

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,160
As long as I'm still alive.

10
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,680
Holly.

11
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,140
Holly.

12
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,540
I can feel the steam.

13
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,060
Let me see you.

14
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,440
What are you looking at?

15
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,320
What?

16
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Your lips are getting closer and closer.

17
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Stop reading it! Give it back to me!

18
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Give it back to me! My books!

19
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Give it back to me!

20
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Are you crazy?

21
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Jiang Jun.

22
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Hey.

23
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
You...

24
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Jiang Jun.

25
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
Don't cry.

26
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
No.

27
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
You can't cry, Jiang Jun.

28
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Tilt your head.

29
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Breathe.

30
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Hold on. Don't cry.

31
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Breathe.

32
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Jiang Jun.

33
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Close your eyes.

34
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Close your eyes.

35
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Breathe.

36
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Hold on. Hold on.

37
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Don't cry.

38
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Don't cry.

39
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Don't cry.

40
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm so annoyed.

41
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Old man.

42
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
You're finally awake.

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,320
I can't see you anymore.

44
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Really?

45
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
How is it?

46
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
No. My face is fine.

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Did you send me to the hospital last night?

48
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Didn't you ask me to come?

49
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Me?

50
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Oh my god.

51
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
You must be mad at me.

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,320
I haven't seen you cry in seven years.

53
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,320
I can't believe you cried.

54
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
I'm so annoyed.

55
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
I didn't blame you.

56
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I cried because of you.

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Why?

58
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Because...

59
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Forget it.

60
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
It was just an accident.

61
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Don't worry.

62
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I've never had a hard time with your sister.

63
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,320
It's the same this time.

64
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Right. Take the medicine.

65
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
I'll pour you some water.

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Are you crazy?

67
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
How could I post on my WeChat?

68
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Hello.

69
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Junjun.

70
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I think this is you.

71
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
This is your hairpin.

72
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Oh my god.

73
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,320
BYU投行联盟就会上上海举办...

74
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
What's this?

75
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
So many people.

76
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
No one is here.

77
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
It's so nice to be protected.

78
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
What are you doing?

79
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Assistant Su.

80
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,320
Didn't you go to the BYU party with Director Yuan yesterday?

81
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Did you see anything?

82
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I was dragged by Yuan and Laxue...

83
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
to deal with various company's relationships.

84
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
You're so close to Director Yuan.

85
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
You know he has a secret girlfriend.

86
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
He admitted it yesterday.

87
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Girlfriend?

88
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Yes.

89
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Let me see.

90
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
You can't even see his face.

91
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
And you're wearing a hairpin.

92
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
What can you recognize?

93
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Even you don't know.

94
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,320
It seems Director Yuan has hidden his secret girlfriend.

95
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
You're gossiping too much.

96
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,320
You like to be a paparazzi.

97
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Why don't you get a job as soon as possible?

98
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Delete all the photos immediately.

99
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Don't let me hear these gossip again in the company.

100
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
What are you doing here?

101
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Dad, it's such a big wedding.

102
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Why don't you share it with me?

103
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
I didn't know until I heard the gossip.

104
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Spring in the corner of your eyes.

105
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
The plum blossoms are in full bloom.

106
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,320
It seems your ten thousand-year-old iron tree is about to bloom.

107
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
This is the iron flower.

108
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
I've been looking at it for a day.

109
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
I can't pull it out.

110
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
If you really like her,

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
you can get her back.

112
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,320
After all, our MH doesn't lack such a position.

113
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
The water is the stage.

114
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
The moon is the moon.

115
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,320
I think you're seriously ill-fated.

116
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Okay, since you're so idle.

117
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Re-replace all these materials.

118
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Boss, I just finished tidying up.

119
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
You're talking back to me?

120
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
The water is the stage. The moon is the moon.

121
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,320
The moon is the stage.

122
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Boss, this is it.

123
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
This is a good card.

124
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
The house is about to be built.

125
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Congratulations, big sister.

126
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Call me big sister.

127
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Why is yours everywhere?

128
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
It's all cards.

129
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Do you want to make money?

130
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Really.

131
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Who are you?

132
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Do you like the landlord?

133
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
I am.

134
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I want to rent your house.

135
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Sir,

136
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
do you really want to rent my house?

137
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
The rent is 20%.

138
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Two years is not bad.

139
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Sir, we rent houses to be honest.

140
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
The girls who rent my house are very nice.

141
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
They always prepare gifts for me.

142
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I just randomly took the house back.

143
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
They're just little girls.

144
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
They're homeless.

145
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
40%.

146
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Deal.

147
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
I'll go prepare the contract.

148
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Right away.

149
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
This house can be rented immediately.

150
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
The house on the 79th, 702,

151
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
please put it online.

152
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
The price

153
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
is three thousand yuan.

154
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Three thousand?

155
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
That's a lot.

156
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Mr. Yuan, if you really want to be a charity,

157
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
why don't you give it to me?

158
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I've prepared all the furniture

159
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
you and your team have stolen.

160
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
And I'm looking for a team of decoration team.

161
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Okay, don't worry.

162
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
I promise to complete the task.

163
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
I've received all the information I sent you.

164
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
I can only rent it to this one person.

165
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Yuan Ma Pip.

166
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Your clothes, you just washed it.

167
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
It's clear now.

168
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Keep an eye on thesoil,

169
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
it's the most basic hydrochlorid in this discipline.

170
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
What's up with your face?

171
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
You know that I don't ask it.

172
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
What's wrong with your face?

173
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
You know it.

174
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Stop.

175
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I have something to tell you.

176
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
See?

177
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
You've stopped buying.

178
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
I was the only one who got it right that day.

179
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Why did you eliminate me?

180
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I knew you would come and tell me this.

181
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
What do you mean?

182
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
You did answer correctly.

183
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
But that was only temporary.

184
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
You think Ma Yike is only buying

185
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
to buy out the stock.

186
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
But in fact,

187
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
she's not.

188
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
She's doing this

189
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
to gain the right to speak

190
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
for the board of directors

191
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
and the decision-making authority.

192
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Do you understand?

193
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
You must remember one thing.

194
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Don't believe in yourself,

195
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
but you must believe in me.

196
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,320
You're not fit for M&H.

197
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Impossible.

198
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
You're so confident.

199
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Okay.

200
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I'll give you another test.

201
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
If you can do it,

202
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
I'll let you join M&H.

203
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Okay.

204
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
I'll do it.

205
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
You're just not buying.

206
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Are you a devil?

207
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
What a bad test.

208
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Excuse me.

209
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Can I try this again?

210
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Thank you.

211
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,320
You really can't complete the task.

212
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Why not?

213
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
You tried seven different clothes.

214
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
But you didn't mean to buy them.

215
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I'm sure you're not happy

216
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
with your sister.

217
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
But you?

218
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
You're embarrassed

219
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
as if you were shot.

220
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
But you're happy.

221
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
What kind of test is this?

222
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
You're just playing with me.

223
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
From this test,

224
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
I can tell

225
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
that you're a person

226
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
who's very sensitive

227
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,320
and very weak.

228
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
I told you.

229
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
You're like a battlefield.

230
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
You...

231
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
You can't do it.

232
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
But Jiang Jun,

233
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
although you're not intelligent enough,

234
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
you're still a person who does things.

235
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I think

236
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,320
consulting is more suitable for you.

237
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Actually,

238
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I've been preparing for you.

239
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
V-Smart consulting company,

240
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
the top three consulting companies in China,

241
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
a director's assistant,

242
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
with a annual salary of less than 30 years,

243
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
and a high salary.

244
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Don't thank me.

245
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I won't give up.

246
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
I will enter the Rianmatch.

247
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
I told you.

248
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
You can't come in.

249
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Other girls will cry

250
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
when they're sad.

251
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
But you?

252
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
You can't even

253
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
shed a tear.

254
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
I hope you can

255
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
learn to respect others.

256
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
I hope you won't be so weak.

257
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
I can't forgive you.

258
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
We won't contact each other anymore.

259
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
We won't be friends anymore.

260
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Jiang Jun,

261
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
in your heart,

262
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
I've always been a bad guy.

263
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Yes.

264
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,320
I finally see your true colors.

265
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay.

266
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Don't be so kind in the future.

267
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
If someone spills your cold water,

268
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
you spill it back.

269
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
If someone spills half of it,

270
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
you get double the reward.

271
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
You have to learn to protect yourself.

272
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Do you understand?

273
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
You're a bad guy.

274
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
I'm not as cruel as you.

275
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
You're different from other girls.

276
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Other girls can cry to solve the problem.

277
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
But you?

278
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,320
You're a person who even cries.

279
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,320
You're the one who made me cry.

280
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I don't want to see you anymore.

281
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,320
I can't believe this.

282
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
You're so bad.

283
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,320
You can't be the bad guy.

284
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
No.

285
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
I can't believe it.

286
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
I can't believe it.

287
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
You're a bad guy.

288
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,320
You're a bad guy.

289
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm not.

290
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
I'm not.

291
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
You're a bad guy.

292
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
No.

293
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
I'm not.

294
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,320
She said she was getting married.

295
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Really?

296
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Yes.

297
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
She asked me to find her a house.

298
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
You know, I've been waiting for this day for so many years.

299
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,320
So, Jiang, I'm sorry.

300
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,320
I'll return all the rent and deposit of this house to you.

301
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
You don't have to pay the water and electricity bills this month.

302
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
So anxious?

303
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Isn't your son abroad?

304
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,320
He is abroad, but he'll be back tomorrow.

305
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,320
He's going to be homeless soon.

306
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
It's not convenient to be with me, an old woman.

307
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Isn't it?

308
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Aunt Zhang, do you want to raise the rent?

309
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
If so, we can talk.

310
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Look what you said.

311
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Look at me, I'm so powerful.

312
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I'm not.

313
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Okay, okay.

314
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Jiang, I'll return all the rent and deposit of this house to you.

315
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
You should pack up and move out.

316
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,320
We can be a good couple.

317
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
No, Aunt Zhang, I have so many things.

318
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,320
You can pack up your things.

319
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
That's it, you should pack up and move out.

320
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Okay?

321
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
That's it, Jiang.

322
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,320
You're so beautiful, I like you.

323
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Come in.

324
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
My friend heard it.

325
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
He's moved.

326
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Is it good?

327
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Why do you eat instant noodles?

328
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Are you on a diet?

329
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Is it good?

330
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,320
Yes.

331
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
I wanted to swim, but it was raining.

332
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
It's going to rain.

333
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
I can't even stand up, how can I fight with you?

334
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
How can you not fight?

335
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Jingxuan, I'm sorry.

336
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I didn't see Lin Taimu.

337
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
So, to make up for my mistake,

338
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,320
I used my entire model group of eight hundred people to dig Lin Taimu out.

339
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
So much money.

340
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
I thank your group for the reward.

341
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Okay.

342
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
What are you doing?

343
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
I'm looking for a house.

344
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Hey.

345
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Isn't this for me?

346
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
You're so emotional.

347
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Leave me some.

348
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Sit.

349
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
President Yuan, it's rare that you don't work overtime on weekends.

350
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
The layout is almost done.

351
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Are you satisfied?

352
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
You've had some feelings before, have you?

353
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:58,840
They're

354
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,680
Come on, like you have요

355
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,680
I'll see if you marry me

356
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,360
Hey, trash

357
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,760
Tell me about your needs

358
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
5,000 yuan.

359
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,920
The furniture should be simple.

360
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,120
Don't be too fancy.

361
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,840
The bed is made of iron.

362
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,400
If there's a balcony

363
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,640
that can see Shanghai's night view,

364
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,440
it'll be better.

365
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,520
Sister Jun Jun,

366
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,160
your requirements are really not high.

367
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,920
What about the seats?

368
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,640
If there's a subway,

369
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,760
it doesn't matter if it's a little far.

370
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
Bed of iron.

371
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,760
The balcony.

372
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,440
Shanghai's night view.

373
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,000
They all match.

374
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,920
Where?

375
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,000
Longting District.

376
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,200
Don't think about it.

377
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,960
It's not worth it.

378
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,480
The name of the district is

379
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,360
the back garden of the Mo Du investment bank.

380
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,840
Many investment banks live there.

381
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,960
At least the price is the same.

382
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,960
Are you going to the next level?

383
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,240
So cheap?

384
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,840
Are you going to advertise?

385
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,920
It's none of your business.

386
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,200
Don't talk nonsense.

387
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,160
Hello, who is this?

388
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,560
Hello,

389
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,240
I want to ask you

390
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,160
if you rent a house

391
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,360
in Longting District.

392
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes.

393
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,840
I want to ask

394
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,360
if it's really 7,000 a month?

395
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,440
Yes.

396
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,440
Can we go to the house tomorrow morning?

397
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,280
May I ask your name?

398
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
My name is Xu.

399
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,600
Sorry, Miss Xu.

400
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Well...

401
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,920
No, no, no.

402
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm a friend of his.

403
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,000
But I'm a friend of his.

404
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,800
His name is Jiang.

405
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,480
Jiang?

406
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,000
Did you just say

407
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,360
the house has been rented?

408
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,880
No, no, no.

409
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
The house is still there.

410
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,560
Is your friend's phone number

411
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,520
3097?

412
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,080
Yes, yes.

413
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,320
That's the number.

414
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,560
I'll take you to the house

415
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,840
at 1 o'clock this afternoon.

416
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Okay, I'll see you in the afternoon.

417
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,600
Thank you.

418
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,360
Come with me.

419
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,880
Wait.

420
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,680
fourth day

421
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,920
Boss, a reliable report has come.

422
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,840
Jiang Jun is taking in stray dogs at the scene.

423
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,000
I feed them everyday.

424
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,600
That vousy fellow

425
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,120
Once you get over your feelings,

426
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,320
if you don't see each other again,

427
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,280
you'll cry to death.

428
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,520
No, I have to prevent the virus from spreading.

429
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,400
Mocai.

430
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,120
Mocai.

431
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
I... I'll save you.

432
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
Mocai, don't be afraid.

433
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Mocai. Mocai.

434
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Jiang Jun.

435
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
What are you doing?

436
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,000
What's wrong?

437
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,200
You're stuck in there.

438
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
Don't move. Let me do it.

439
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Come on.

440
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Mocai.

441
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Come on.

442
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Slowly.

443
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
It's okay.

444
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Come on. Get up.

445
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Let's go.

446
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Come on.

447
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
It's okay, Mocai.

448
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
It's okay.

449
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Poor thing.

450
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Your hand...

451
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Why are you so stupid?

452
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Why are you here?

453
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I heard you're raising a dog.

454
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
So I brought a nest here.

455
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
You're so...

456
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
There are people everywhere.

457
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
There are chicken and water.

458
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
You don't know where to find a better place to raise a dog?

459
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Here.

460
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Be careful in the future.

461
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Do you hear me?

462
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I know.

463
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Look.

464
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Mocai.

465
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
Mocai.

466
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Mocai.

467
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Mocai.

468
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Mocai.

469
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Mocai.

470
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Mocai.

471
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Mocai.

472
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Mocai.

473
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Mocai.

474
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Mocai.

475
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Mocai.

476
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
Mocai.

477
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Mocai.

478
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Mocai.

479
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Mocai.

480
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Mocai.

481
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Mocai.

482
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Mocai.

483
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Mocai.

484
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Mocai.

485
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Mocai.

486
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Mocai.

487
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Mocai.

488
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Mocai.

489
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Mocai.

490
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Mocai.

491
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Mocai.

492
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Mocai.

493
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Mocai.

494
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Mocai.

495
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Mocai.

496
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Mocai.

497
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Mocai.

498
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Wang Cai, come here.

499
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Look at you.

500
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Are you happy?

501
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Are you happy?

502
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Hello, Mr. Yan.

503
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
The rental plan you have ordered has been contacted.

504
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
The appointment is at 1 o'clock this afternoon.

505
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Hello, Wang Cai.

506
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Hello.

507
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
It's not right.

508
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
It's already 1 o'clock.

509
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Why isn't he here yet?

510
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
This house is very well-priced.

511
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
The rent is very good.

512
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
If you rent this house,

513
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
your business will surely be very good.

514
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Who is it?

515
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Who is it?

516
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Look at the house. Are you satisfied?

517
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Junjun, this is the style you like.

518
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
This sofa is the style you like.

519
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
This house is the first time I've rented it.

520
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
All the furniture is new.

521
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
The lighting is very good.

522
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
To be honest, this house is a bit better than I expected.

523
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
And the rent is cheaper than the ones around here.

524
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
It's only 1,000 or 2,000 yuan.

525
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Is there any special reason?

526
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Is this a house for the people who live in the countryside?

527
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
The countryside?

528
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
There's definitely nothing like that.

529
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
I'm telling you, since this house was posted online,

530
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
my phone has never stopped.

531
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
The point is, our landlord doesn't need money.

532
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
He just wants to find a clean rental house.

533
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Miss Jiang, all your projects are in accordance with the landlord's requirements.

534
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
That's why I brought you here today to see this house.

535
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
How is it?

536
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
You rent it.

537
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Didn't you say this is the back garden of the first house?

538
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Think about it.

539
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
What if after you live here, you can't afford to buy the rent?

540
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Okay.

541
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Miss Jiang, if you really want to rent it,

542
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
we can sign the contract today.

543
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
We can settle the rent today.

544
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh, that...

545
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm still...

546
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Junjun, I found it.

547
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,400
It says that Mo Yiming has been keeping it safe.

548
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
But...

549
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
every month, he will go back to his house.

550
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,400
And it's today.

551
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Really?

552
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
I'll go now.

553
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Hello, I booked this house.

554
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
And you can tell him about the rent.

555
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Okay.

556
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
It didn't work?

557
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
You can also use your friend's ID card to copy the documents.

558
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
And I'll take you to the process.

559
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
If there's no problem, you can stay here tonight.

560
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Okay, thank you.

561
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Excuse me, miss.

562
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Our book store is reserved.

563
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Only members can enter.

564
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Reserved?

565
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Yes.

566
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Can I still go in today?

567
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Sorry, it's already full.

568
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
But...

569
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Hello, Mr. Du.

570
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Hello.

571
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Do you have an appointment?

572
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
No.

573
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
I have an appointment here. I'll give it to you.

574
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Add me on WeChat.

575
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Thank you.

576
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I'll transfer it to you.

577
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Okay.

578
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Thank you.

579
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
We don't know each other.

580
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Why are you helping me?

581
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
You probably don't remember.

582
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
I bumped into you at the last meeting.

583
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
I'm sorry.

584
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm sorry.

585
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
I remember now.

586
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Thank you.

587
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
It's nothing.

588
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm just a little bit tired.

589
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Thank you.

590
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Actually, I'm just an old lady.

591
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
This book store is reserved.

592
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
There are hundreds of people every day.

593
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
So remember to make an appointment next time.

594
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Okay.

595
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
I'll go shopping now.

596
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Bye.

597
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I'm sorry.

598
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
I'm sorry.

599
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
I'm sorry.

600
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Miss.

601
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
You've been following me since just now.

602
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
What's the matter?

603
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Mr. Lin.

604
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
I'm here to see you.

605
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
My name is Jiang Jun.

606
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I took the interview of the MSH headquarters last week.

607
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
And I entered the final round.

608
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
But in the end, I may have some personal grudges.

609
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
In the interview,

610
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I was eliminated.

611
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
MSH is a place of dream for me.

612
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't want to leave any regrets.

613
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
But I have no other way.

614
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
So I had to come here to see you.

615
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm in charge of the headquarters.

616
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
But the personnel are managed by the administration.

617
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
The company's management has already decided.

618
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
I don't interfere or question.

619
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
The public relations book in your hand,

620
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Wei Chunqiu,

621
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
states that the law of the Chinese government

622
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
is the most important thing in the world.

623
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
It shows that the law of the Chinese government is more important than the personnel.

624
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I can see you today.

625
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I used the personnel.

626
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
You don't want to interfere with the management's decision.

627
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
It's also about the personnel.

628
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
How about we skip the personnel?

629
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
You give me a fair interview opportunity.

630
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Okay.

631
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
I'll give you an opportunity.

632
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Tell me,

633
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
for this bookstore,

634
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
should we invest in it?

635
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
This bookstore is located in the golden area.

636
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
The scale, design, and service

637
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
are all modernized.

638
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
But it is a pre-ordered system.

639
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
200 people are limited every day.

640
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
The more time is free, the more.

641
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
So the owner of this bookstore is doing public service.

642
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
He never thought about making money.

643
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
So according to you,

644
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
the owner of this bookstore is a real asset.

645
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
But you haven't answered my question.

646
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
He is a charity,

647
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
but also a businessman.

648
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
The bookstore owner first made this place

649
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
a hot spot.

650
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
200 people are limited every day, causing a sales of bad sales.

651
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Then he trained a large number of V and reading stars

652
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
to recommend this store and the books inside.

653
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
He sold through e-commerce channels.

654
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Because the books in this store can be bought.

655
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
It seems that you are

656
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
a very careful observer.

657
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
This is my first time here today.

658
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
But I just saw someone shipping out of the store.

659
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
So I guess the books in this store

660
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
are sold through e-commerce channels.

661
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
If we invest,

662
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I suggest we can also expand the business of

663
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
publishing books and signing writers.

664
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Okay.

665
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Your interview is over.

666
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
But I still have to consider

667
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
your request.

668
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
You can go back first.

669
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
No matter what the result is,

670
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
I am very grateful to Mr. Lin for giving me this opportunity.

671
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
I am leaving.

672
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Mr. Lin, this is the sales record

673
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
of this month's bookstore. Please have a look.

674
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Okay.

675
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Why are you so late?

676
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
It's almost over.

677
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
No problem.

678
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I can't do it.

679
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
He is starting to show off.

680
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Do you know who he is?

681
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
You are so annoying.

682
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Who is he?

683
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
It's too hard to tell.

684
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Look at him. He is doing it again.

685
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Look at him.

686
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
He is just a model.

687
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
You are so annoying.

688
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I am so angry.

689
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Put your hands on your waist.

690
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Put your hands on your waist.

691
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Boss, have a cup of coffee.

692
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
No coffee.

693
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Boss, this coffee is specially prepared for you.

694
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
It's a waste if you don't drink it.

695
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
I said no coffee. Go away.

696
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay.

697
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
What are you doing?

698
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
What did I do?

699
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
You are so annoying.

700
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
You are so annoying.

701
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Don't go.

702
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
What do you mean? Tell me.

703
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
I am complaining to you. Don't do it here.

704
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Don't you dare to touch me.

705
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
What are you doing?

706
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Okay. Go complain to him.

707
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
I told you I don't want to do it.

708
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
I told you to stop.

709
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
You are so annoying.

710
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Go away.

711
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Go away.

712
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
I am sorry.

713
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
I succeeded so easily.

714
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
I am sorry.

715
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
I can't stand it.

716
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I can't stand it.

717
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Hello, Lin Xia.

718
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Hello, Lily.

719
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
I am in M.H.

720
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
What are you doing?

721
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
You are so annoying.

722
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
You are like a high-class woman.

723
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
You are going to be a woman's lover.

724
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Be quiet.

725
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
You should go back to the company.

726
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Aren't you afraid of being scolded by your boss?

727
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Don't be so quiet.

728
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I have given you a chance.

729
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Why?

730
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
You are a smart client.

731
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
He is a model.

732
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
I broke his coffee.

733
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Then I got a complaint.

734
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
You are so smart.

735
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
It's okay. I will find you a job tomorrow.

736
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
No need.

737
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
I

738
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
used a pack of cookies.

739
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
I have figured it out.

740
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Thank you.

741
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
I am different from you.

742
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
These two years,

743
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I have been forced to work as a lady.

744
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
You know,

745
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
my dream is to write novels.

746
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
I want to write the most perfect man in my mind.

747
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
He is as tall as 250 cm.

748
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
His skin is white.

749
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
His eyes are big.

750
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
His eyebrows are long.

751
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
His eyebrows are long.

752
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
He has a long neck.

753
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
What's wrong?

754
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
This is a total disaster.

755
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I gotHEART.

756
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I can't go on looking for him.

757
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,400
I'll send you the code. I have to go now. Bye.

758
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Wait for you to nod and say yes.

759
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Excuse me, could you please excuse me?

760
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Is the guy over there coming often?

761
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
Yes.

762
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Yes, he often comes to our office.

763
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Thank you.

764
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,400
I'm so lucky. I can't wait for anyone.

765
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I can do anything to get rid of that bastard.

766
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
How did you know I was here?

767
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Miss Jiang, you're thinking too much.

768
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I heard a new neighbor moved in to say hello.

769
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
How come it's you? What a coincidence.

770
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,400
I was wondering why this house was so cheap.

771
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,400
So it's because there's a ghost in the house.

772
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,400
You should be glad you didn't pass the interview.

773
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Otherwise, we'd be together in the morning.

774
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I'm afraid you'll be mad at me.

775
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
You're thinking too much.

776
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,400
I can't help but do it. It's a merit.

777
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,400
What? You don't want to invite the new neighbor in?

778
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
It's late. You should go home and rest.

779
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Otherwise, you'll get old.

780
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
What's this beauty? It's going to get worse.

781
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Good night.

782
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
Excuse me.

783
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,400
I'm so tired of this.

784
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
I don't want to argue with you.

785
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
We'll see.

786
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,400
I'm going to be someone I only want to know

787
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Someday

788
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
I'm going to be happy

789
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,400
And strong enough to love

790
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,400
I'm going to be someone I only want to know

791
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Then you'll be staying every day of my life

792
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
Go. Go, go.

793
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
Go. Go.

794
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Zheng Jun

795
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Close your eyes. Take a deep breath.

796
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Take a deep breath.

797
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Don't cry. Don't cry.

798
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Take a deep breath.

799
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Take a deep breath.

800
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,400
I heard from the general that you were bullied

801
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
for making money for me.

802
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Right?

803
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Uncle, do you know philosophy?

804
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Philosophy? I know a little. What's wrong?

805
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
The cause is the root cause of the change in things.

806
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Right?

807
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Yes.

808
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
To make him not cry,

809
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,400
the basic solution is to increase his mental endurance.

810
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,400
He'll be strong and won't cry anymore.

811
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
I did tell him to be bullied.

812
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,400
But I didn't do it to make him cry.

813
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,400
I did it to strengthen his mental quality.

814
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,400
I made him difficult.

815
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
I did it to make him stronger.

816
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Why did I do it?

817
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,400
To make you pay me every penny.

818
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm so sorry.

819
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,400
You did the right thing. I misunderstood you.

820
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Uncle, you haven't paid me for last month's salary.

821
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
You bastard.

822
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Here you go.

823
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
Thank you, uncle.

824
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,400
I tried to say goodbye a thousand times

825
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,400
You can tell me lies, you can make me cry, you know why

826
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,400
Never been so brave, I will run away

827
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,400
If it's what you want, what you like, I don't mind

828
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:54,400
I can close my eyes, I can stay behind with my time

829
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Walk into your plan, like I never knew you were not mine

830
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Make you satisfied, wear another mask

831
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,400
You never realize things I do for love

832
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:26,400
I think I'm tired, I think I'm blind

833
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Don't know how to feel, don't know how to heal

834
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,400
You walk so fast, can't catch your light

835
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:49,400
You fly so high, leave all the things behind

836
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:57,400
And our story, leave all of nowhere to find

837
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:04,400
I think I'm tired, I think I'm blind

838
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:12,400
Don't know how to feel, don't know how to heal

839
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:19,400
You walk so fast, can't catch your light

840
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:27,400
You fly so high, leave all the things behind

841
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:37,400
And our story, leave all of nowhere to find
