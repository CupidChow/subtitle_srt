Sister,

Tell me what happened back then.

181
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,720
Let Jiang Jun know the truth

182
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,380
and give us a sense of closure.

183
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,320
The truth?

184

If I told you

185
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,770
I had something to do with Jiang Yaoming’s death,

186
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,920
would you continue the investigation?

187

I don’t believe at all that you’d do such things.

Who’s behind the whole thing?

189

No matter how much you’ve found out,

190
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,280
you’ve got to stop now.

191
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,880
Because you have no idea what a powerful enemy

192

you are about to confront.

193

going down this road,

197
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,050
we’ll be enemies in the future.

Five years ago, when Jiang Yaoming’s company

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,520
was taken over by C Group,

207

he didn’t choose to join C Group.

208

Instead, he opened a store himself.

that you must know the people in this picture.

How long will she live?

The doctor said it’d be less than one year.

232

So you took the bribe from Cao Heng

for her surgery fee back then?

it’s been years,

236
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,840
I know I can never escape from those things.

Just ask away.

239
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,480
As Mr. Jiang’s partner,

240
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,160
do you know any details

241
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,940
about Jiangnan Flavor’s acquisition deal?

242
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,640
10 years ago,

243
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,320
Jiang used his family’s secret rice noodle recipe

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,930
to create the brand “Yixianqian”.

245
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,040
Due to its good taste and rich ingredients,

246
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,800
it became very popular.

247
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,320
We all made money

248
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
and felt so happy.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
So we suggested Jiang

250
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,660
open new factories

251
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,740
and online stores.

252
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,080
But we needed money to expand the business.

253
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,800
So Jiang turned to

254
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
the investment bank for financing.

255
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,160
Everything was going well, until one day

256
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,160
a man and a woman came to our factory.

257
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,640
They said they were in charge of the project.

258
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,840
Mr. Jiang,

259
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
why are you so stubborn?

260
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,040
Just a small change

261
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,440
to the production mode of the rice noodle

262
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,800
will reduce the production cost by 50%

or even more.

265
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
With the current reputation of “Yixianqian”,

266
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,600
Jiangnan Flavor's value will definitely be

267
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,440
doubled.

268
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,640
I’ve said it.

269
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,840
I won’t change the production mode
before the other

270
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,620
preservation methods are proved to be safe.

271
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,520
Then think of it this way.

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
“Yixianqian” is of high cost for now,

273
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,040
and it has a shelf life of only 15 days.

274
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,880
The instant rice noodles
have the similar taste,

275
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,560
but the shelf life can be at least tripled.

276

In that case,

277
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,720
wouldn’t it be more convenient
for the customers to carry and enjoy?

278
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,360
While there are no similar competitors,

279
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,840
I believe that “Yixianqian”

280
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,240
will quickly take over the market.

281
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,640
But in that way, the freshness and nutrition

282
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,160
of the ingredients will have to suffer.

283
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,880
Most importantly, the taste won’t be
as good as before.

284
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
I’m sorry.

285

345
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,320
Of course,

346
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,080
if any of you does a great job,

347
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,320
Mr. Lin said

348
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,490
that he’d promote that person to be a manager.

349
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,520
Since it’s such an important case,

350
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,720
Mr. Lin hopes that you can work

351
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
as a team

352
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,920
instead of working on it individually.

353
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,960
So, you need a team leader

354
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,680
to lead this case.

355
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,560
Jiang Jun,

356
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,460
I’ll name you the team leader.

357
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,000
But, Ms. Qiao…

358
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,960
Any problem?

359
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,520
No.

-No.
-No.

361
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,589
Since we are all on the same page,

362
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,849
let’s get back to work.

363

As one climbs up relying on personal relationship,

366
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,170
why bother pretending to be a hard worker?

368
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,640
Mr. Lin,

369
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,440
Secretary Bai asked me to bring these files to you.

370

Okay. I see.

371

By the way,

372
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,680
when Ms. Qiao briefed you guys

373
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,320
on Hengsheng Group’s case,

374
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,620
you seemed to have a problem
with the team leader arrangement.

375
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,420
Why didn’t you say something?

376
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,180
I have no problem, Mr. Lin.

377
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,890
I think it was a misunderstanding.

378
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,360
I wanted to say something. But

379
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,800
Ms. Qiao told me not to talk with her eyes.

380
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,880
So I didn’t say anything.

381
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,400
You stopped just because

382
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,860
she wouldn’t let you talk?

383
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,920
Isn’t it just a play through which

384
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,850
you pave the road for Jiang Jun?

385
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,640
I provide you guys

386
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,640
with only one promotion opportunity,

387
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,360
and ask you to work together

388
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,840
under the management of a team leader,

389
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,920
because I want you to form

390
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
a sense of crisis

391
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,330
and a sense of competition.

392
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,400
So, you mean…

Jiang Jun! Are you in there?

521

Anybody out there?

I’m here.

Jiang Jun!

Are you alright?

534
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,680
I’m here.

535
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,800
Jiang Jun!

536
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,920
Mr. Yuan. Don’t worry.

537
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,680
Miss Jiang

538
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,400
is mainly in a state of shock.

539
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,520
She’ll be recovered

540
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
after a good rest.

541
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,860
Thank you, doctor.

542
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,850
You are welcome.

543
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,120
I will protect you

544
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,040
no matter what it takes.

545
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,740
Where’s Jiang Jun’s ward?

546
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,480
Over there.

547
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Who are you? Why do you block the way?

548
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,000
Mr. Lin, remember me?

549
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,120
Mr. Du.

550
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,730
Long time no see.

551
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,400
I’m here today

552
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,040
to make a deal with you.

553
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,040
Then is it necessary

554
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,160
to knock my driver out?

555
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,480
Plus,

556
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,330
I don’t remember we have

557
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,680
any deal to talk about.

558
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,720
I’ve found out what happened five years ago,

559
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,650
including Jiang Yaoming’s death.

560
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,880
You dare to investigate me?

561
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,480
I was also involved.

562
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,890
So it’s not scary that I investigated you.

563
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,050
What’s scary is that Yuan Shuai

564
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,660
investigated you with me.

565
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,460
He also knows everything.

566
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,960
He’s collecting evidence
and going to report you.

567
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,480
As I recall,

568
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,120
you are always defeated by him.

569
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,400
Even so, you could still work with him.

570
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
You are such a broad-minded person.

571
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Mr. Lin, you don’t have to mock me.

572
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,040
I approached him

573
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,080
so that I could know him better.

574
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,800
And now it’s the perfect timing

575
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,080
to take him down.

576
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I don’t trust you.

577
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,480
As one who always acts alone,

578
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,400
why do you suddenly need my help?

579
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,050
It’s not convincing at all.

580
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,660
I’ll tell you Yuan Shuai’s weakness.

581
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,140
And I need you to give me Jiang Jun.

582
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,960
So it’s all for a girl!

583
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,640
I’m surprised that you have a romantic soul.

584
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,920
But,

585
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,340
she’s Jiang Yaoming’s daughter.

586
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
I can’t let her live.

587
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,170
Don’t worry.

588
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,880
Jiang Jun knows nothing so far.

589
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,880
I can promise you that.

590
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,520
When things are done, I’ll help you watch her.

591
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Our common enemy for now

592
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,440
is only Yuan Shuai!

593
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,040
You are awake.

594
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,240
I thought I’d never see you again.

595
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,840
Thank you for finding me.

596
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,720
Don’t be silly.

597
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,680
We are finally together.

598
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,280
I won’t let you leave me again.

599
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,240
Even God

600
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,560
cannot take you away from me.

601
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,240
Dare to steal a girl from God.

602
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,860
That’s quite impressive.

603
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,880
Lie down.

604
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,320
Here.

605
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,440
Just

606
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,360
take a good rest today.

607
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,530
I’ve helped you to ask for a day off.

608
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,770
Lie down with me for a while.

609
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,160
Jiang Jun.

610
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,800
I’ve checked the surveillance tape.

611
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,280
It wasn’t

612
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,520
an accident.

613
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Shen Xin did it to you.

614
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,960
She removed the repair sign on purpose.

615
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,970
Shen Xin?

616
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,320
How do you want to deal with this?

617
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,720
I’ll listen to you.

618
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,960
About this matter,

619
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,880
you don’t have to get involved.

620
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,800
I’ll solve it myself.

621
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
No way!

622
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,680
She almost killed you.

623
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,840
As the saying goes,

624
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,780
“Sweep before your own door”.

625
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,670
I’m sure I also have my own problem.

626
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,710
I’m too insensitive to the office culture, making

627
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,920
my workplace relationships such a mess.

628
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,590
This incident is actually a reminder to me.

629
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,710
So I wanna try to solve it by myself first.

630
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,150
Okay?

631
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,810
Alright.

632
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
I’m sure you’ll do a good job.

633
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,040
So sleepy.

634
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,190
I’ll sleep for a while,
and go to work in the afternoon.

635
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,440
Why are you going to work?

636
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,960
You need more rest.

637
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,880
Got it?

638
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,400
No.

639
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,600
I want to be an independent woman.

640
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,930
I can’t just rely on my husband…

641
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,480
Your what?

642
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,800
Say it again.

643
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,520
Jiang Jun?

644
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,960
Jiang Jun!

645
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,250
I heard you had an accident last night.

646
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,320
Are…

647
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,040
Are you alright?

648
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,200
Did you get hurt?

649
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,840
I’m curious.

650
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,240
When you did this,

651
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,260
have you considered my feelings?

652
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,610
What are you talking about?

653
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,330
I don’t understand.

654
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,360
You don’t?

655
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,440
You removed

656
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
the sign on purpose.

657
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,060
Are you too afraid to admit it?

658
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,400
That’s a lie!

659
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Do… Do you have evidence?

660
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,280
You two,

661
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,920
come to my office.

662
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,220
You want evidence, right?

663
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,460
Take a look at this.

664
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Doesn’t the bracelet in the picture

665
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,600
look quite familiar to you?

666
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,080
Ms. Qiao!

667
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,880
Ms. Qiao! Sorry! I was wrong!

668
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,360
Enough!

669
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,620
I don’t wanna hear your nonsense.

670
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,520
You will be dismissed by MH because of this,

671
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,880
and you won’t be accepted

672
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,040
by any other investment bank in the future.

673
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,320
Moreover, what you did is a crime.

674
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,130
If you wanna cry,

675
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,170
save your tears for the police.

676
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,080
Jiang Jun!

677
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,680
Jiang Jun, I’m sorry!

678
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,840
I just wanted you to be late
for your appointment.

679
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,200
I didn’t expect things would end up like that.

680
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,040
Please forgive me, Jiang Jun!

681
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,720
I’m begging you!

682
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,280
I don’t wanna leave here!

683
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,960
Jiang Jun, please!

684
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,720
Please forgive me! I shouldn’t have done that!

685
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,960
Ms. Qiao.

686
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,680
I know you are angry.

687
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,920
So am I.

688
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,290
But I think there must be
some misunderstanding.

689
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,520
I want a moment with her.

690
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
I’ll get back to you later,

691
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,240
okay?

692
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,690
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

693
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,800
Jiang Jun!

694
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,440
Jiang Jun! Please forgive me!

695
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
If I left a paper trail,

696
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,860
my whole life would be ruined.

697
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,960
I thought you  were just jealous,

698
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,040
but I was so wrong.

699
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,440
Turns out you were jealous

700
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
and stupid.

701
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,800
I just wanted to fight for an opportunity.

702
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,820
That’s why I said you were stupid!

703
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
If you want to surpass the others,

704
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,240
you should strive for it.

705
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,000
Why play all the tricks?

706
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,400
Have you thought

707
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,600
that if anything really
happened to me yesterday,

708
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,460
how could you escape from the law?

709
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120
What about your parents?

710
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,730
And what about your future?

711
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,880
I know

712
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,120
even if I apologize to you,

713
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,720
it’s already pointless.

714
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,200
I can leave MH,

715
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,080
even the investment bank field.

716
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
But could you please not to turn me in?

717
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,840
I don’t want to go to prison.

718
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,920
Jiang Jun!

719
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,560
I’m begging you!

720
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,000
Cry!

721
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,240
How would that help?

722
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,840
Should you be the one crying?

723
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,320
Plus,

724
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,620
when did I say that I’d turn you in?

725
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,640
You…

726
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,320
You won’t hold me accountable?

727
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,160
I didn’t get hurt.

728
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
What would I hold you accountable for?

729
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,920
And

730
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,760
how would it be beneficial to me
if I asked Ms. Qiao to fire you?

731
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
I’d better keep someone

732
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,920
whom I got the goods on around.

733
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,650
Maybe one day

734
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,440
I can use you as a scapegoat.

735
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,040
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

736
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,680
Stop it. You are making me uncomfortable.

737
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,210
I’ll talk to Ms. Qiao later.

738
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,900
[MH Securities Co., Ltd.]

739
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,210
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

740
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,720
Who are you?

741
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,520
We are from the Compliance Dept of MH.

742
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
Someone reported that you took a bribe.

743
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,260
We need you to cooperate with us
for the investigation.

744
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,340
Love Is Sweet
