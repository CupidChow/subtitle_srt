[Welcomes
New Members]

6
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,960
Give me your spare button.

7
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
What do you want this for?

8
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
The Maya people have a saying

9
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,130
that if you wanna go back to a place,

10
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,320
bury a button there.

11
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
Does it work?

12
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,560
Of course.

13
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,210
The Maya people will bless you. Good Luck.

14
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,720
Thank you.

15
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,159
The button thing you told him,

16
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,000
was it true?

17
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,520
I lied

18
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
to encourage him.

19
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,480
Hello.

20
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,320
I’m Shen Xin.
I was after you in the last interview.

21
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
I'm Jiang Jun.

22
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,720
In the recruitment season every year,

23
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,120
MH will get tens of thousands of resumes.

24
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,100
You’ve entered the fourth round,

25
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,060
which means you’ve surpassed

26
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
ninety-nine percent of your competitors.

27
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,880
But

28
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
this isn’t the end.

29
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
I have a question for you.

30
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
If you join MH in the future,

31
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,090
what kind of person will you be?

32
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,170
Soros once said that

33
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,840
the financial world was volatile and chaotic.

34
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,200
If we regard the financial market

35
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
as part

36
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
of a mathematical formula,

37
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,200
it won’t work.

38
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,520
Thus,

39
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,320
math cannot control the financial market.

40
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Psychology is

41
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
the key to market control.

42
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
Time's up. Next.

43
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,400
Well... Sorry.

44
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
I... I haven’t finished.

45
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,480
MH is the top investment banking department

46
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
among Shanghai securities dealers,

47
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,640
managing assets valuing tens of billions of Yuan.

48
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Our time is too valuable for you

49
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
to waste.

50
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,280
Fifteen seconds for each person. Next.

51
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,960
The financial world is like a forest.

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I wanna be a breeder-like investor,

53
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,250
whipping the strong

54
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
and taming the weak.

55
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,520
Success is defined as defeating your opponents.

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,480
To succeed,

57
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
you should find others’ loopholes.

58
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
Find the loopholes and attack them,

59
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,180
like Sherlock Holmes did.

60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
That’s why I want to

61
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,840
be an investor like Sherlock Holmes.

62
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,000
The workplace should be filled
with peace and respect,

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,260
but not slaughtering.

64
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
I wanna be the Mo-tse of MH.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Love without wars. Respect talents and seniors.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,330
For the interest of all.

67
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,760
To be MH’s Mo-tse?

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,920
What a great mind.

69
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,920
Investment banking is a playground
for aspirants,

70
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,680
for Su Qin and Zhang Yi, not Mo-tse.

71
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,320
Be careful.

72
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
I

73
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,410
don't like guys without ambition.

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,360
You don’t look like an elite.

75
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,320
But

76
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,640
you're the first one to benefit

77
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,970
from MH’s diverse recruitment policies.

78
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,580
Congratulations.

79
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,140
You can attend the interview at 2 p.m.

80
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
By the way,

81
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,170
don't be happy too early

82
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,600
The interviewer in the afternoon will be

83
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,680
the invincible God of War of MH.

84
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,120
He

85
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,360
will be much stricter than me.

86
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,480
Currently,

87
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,320
600 million yuan of the 800 million yuan

88
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600
raised by GE for Hualun Culture Group
through bond issuance

89
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,120
has been spent.

90
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,810
If they buy 2% more of stake,

91
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,400
they’ll have

92
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,280
absolute control over VTV.

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
It’s time to act, isn’t it?

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,120
Be quiet. Just wait.

95
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,960
Hey, boss. Still waiting?

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
You are noisy.

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,920
Mr. Du, with two more points,

98
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
we’ll be able to help Hualun Culture hold VTV

99
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,120
and complete the acquisition.

100
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,280
MH won’t be able to fight back

101
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,480
in this surprising operation.

Still two points short after such a long time.

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,669
Are you happy?

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,320
We’ll work harder.

106
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,370
Go and tell Mr. Yuan.

107
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,000
Mr. Yuan. One point to go.

108
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
Do it.

[VTV (Suspension)]

110
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,370
Mr. Du. Bad news.

111
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,040
VTV suddenly suspended trading

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
and announced follow-on offering.

113
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,970
The stakes bought by Hualun

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,920
are diluted.

115
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,360
How could it be?

116
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,720
VTV’s CEO just resigned.

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
The board is in a mess.

118
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,040
How could they have the follow-on offering?

119
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,720
Mr. Du.

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,660
There must be another way out.

121
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,840
Don't bother.

122
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760
We’ve been tricked.

123
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
You may all leave.

124
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,800
OK.

126

and some resigned.

132

Not only GE was led by the nose,

133
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,320
but also the whole industry was cheated by you.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,540
Using strategies is the best.

135
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,520
Using social connections is mediocre.

136
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,680
Attacking the opponent

137
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,800
is the worst.

You have my admiration for your strategy.

The well-known Mr. Du Lei

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,440
was defeated by your simple plan,

Flip-in Poison Pill.

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,800
I assume he went crazy.

The more you want to win,

the more likely you’ll lose judgment.

But I can tell you a secret

It's not in his public information at all.

There’s big news
in Hong Kong stock market two days ago.

239
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,560
Shimao Technology planned to acquire
Yangsheng Power

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,800
and quoted.

241

You guys may analyze

242
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,560
whether MH should buy

243
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,290
Yangsheng Power’s stocks now.

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,160
I think we should.

245
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,560
Yangsheng Power’s stock price is

246
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,520
35 Hong Kong dollars now.

247
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,320
After the merger, it’s conservatively estimated

248
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,080
to rise by 17 percent.

249
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
Mere three million shares

250
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
will give us great influence in the market.

251
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,560
After the merger,

252
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,160
Ma Yuke, Shimao Technology’s major shareholder,

253
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,600
will become Yangsheng Power’s

new chairman.

He's an investment master.

256
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,120
If we buy now,

257
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,360
the annual profit per share will exceed

258

442 Hong Kong dollars.

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,260
I don’t think this deal will succeed.

260
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,920
Yangsheng Power has declined
for 3 consecutive years,

261
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,000
yet the leadership's wage doubled.

Ma Yuke is crafty.

He won’t be optimistic about Yangsheng Power.

264
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
If he isn’t optimistic about Yangsheng Power,

265
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,440
why would he acquire it for Shimao Technology?

266
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,240
Ma Yuke is Shimao Technology’s shareholder.

267
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,640
His ex-wife had five percent stake

268
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,770
in Yangsheng Power.

269
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,800
I assume his quotation on behalf of Shimao

270
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,400
is just a make-believe shot.

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,720
Jiang Jun.

346
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
Look.

347
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
We did a full examination.

348
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,320
It’s confirmed that

349
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
your daughter’s tear allergy gets worse.

350
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,840
Worse? How bad is it?

351
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,160
That is, if she sheds tears again,

352
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,360
she’ll go into shock.

353
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,200
She may die if not treated timely.

354
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,360
You mean she will...

355
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,080
Don’t worry.

356
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,610
As long as she isn’t exposed to allergens,

357
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,960
it won’t be a problem.

358
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,040
That is,

359
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
as long as she doesn’t contact tears,

360
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,560
her daily life

361
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,080
won’t be affected.

362
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,490
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

363
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,240
My pleasure.

364
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,920
Yuan Shuai.

365
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,920
Thanks for protecting Jiang Jun.

366
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,080
No big deal.

367
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,080
You're two years older than Jiang Jun.

368
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,680
So you’re her elder brother.

369
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,680
I’ve watched you grow up.

370
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,480
You’re the smartest of all the kids.

371
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
Can I

372
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,380
ask you for a favor?

373
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,400
What is it?

374
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,930
At school in the future,

375
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,720
no matter what happens,

376
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,640
you’ll help me protect Jiang Jun.

377
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,480
Do not let her cry.

378
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,440
Alright?

379
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,680
You have my word.

380
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,240
Thank you, sir.

381
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,320
But, will you pay me 10 yuan

382
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,160
every month in the future?

383
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,360
Of course.

384
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
Rest assured, sir.

385
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,000
You can count on me.

386
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,840
Every penny you pay me

387
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,920
will be worthy.

388
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Deal.

389
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,200
Deal.

390
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
What did you say?

391
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,460
The interviewer today was the boy

392
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,440
who lived opposite your home

393
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,200
and was bribed by your father to protect you?

394
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,920
I can recognize him even if he turns into ashes.

395
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,000
Seriously?

396
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,410
How could your childhood guardian

397
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,200
reject you?

398
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
He wasn’t my guardian.

399
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,160
He’s a thug.

400
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,840
My dad paid him for nothing.

401
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,920
To earn pocket money from my dad,

402
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,680
he asked others to bully me in the dark.

403
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
I was too timid

404
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,720
to fight back.

405
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,320
From elementary school to high school,

406
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,000
he’d been a nightmare to me.

407
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,130
What happened then?

408
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,000
Then he did something

409
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,880
that made me hate him forever.

410
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,160
My father transferred me to another school then.

411
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,720
If that’s the case,

412
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,720
he’s supposed to feel guilty to you.

413
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,440
Why did he drive you out of MH?

414
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,080
Babe.

415
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,800
Will a hungry wolf feel sorry

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,330
for a sheep in his belly?

417
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,600
It’s OK if I’m rejected for incompetence.

418
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,480
I swear there was no problem with my interview.

419
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,800
I could absolutely pass it.

420
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,930
He did it on purpose.

421
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,000
I won’t let it go.

422
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,680
Who is it?

423
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,880
No idea.

Yuan Shuai.

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
I am Yuan Shuai.

430
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
Is he nuts? He added me on WeChat!

431
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,850
Today I rejected you for your own good.

432
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,760
A smart guy

433
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,580
should do things properly in a proper position.

434
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,800
You’re lucky.

435
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,480
A company needs a director assistant,

436
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
with annual salary at least 300,000 yuan,

437
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,240
and huge chance for promotion.

438
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,720
I can recommend you there.

[You’re not her friend yet.

Revenge is a dish best served cold.

441
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
I will get into MH in an upright way.

442
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,680
I’ll let him know

443
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,740
he can never determine others’ fate.

444
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,680
Exactly.

445
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,800
Where there's oppression, there's resistance.

446
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Jiang Jun. I support you.

447
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
Cheers.

448
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,280
But we’re nobody.

449
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,640
How should we resist?

450
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,040
My connection is no joke.

451
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,600
I asked our top model’s

452
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,280
sister’s pursuer’s fellow’s

453
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,080
classmate’s brother’s neighbor for help.

454
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,640
The Mr. Wang got us the tickets to BUI.

455
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,280
I also heard that

456
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
the one who has been recuperating,

457
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,400
namely Vice President of MH,

458
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,880
manager of the Investment Banking Department,

459
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,760
Lin Taimo,

460
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,050
would also be there.

461
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,880
He’d be there, too!

462
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,920
You admire him most, don't you?

463
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,220
Think about it.

464
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,360
In case that you meet him

465
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,240
and tell him about the internal unfair business,

466
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
then...

467
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,080
Then what?

468
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,400
Make a scene

469
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,990
and complain that I was bullied by Yuan Shuai?

470
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,480
Uh-huh.

471
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,560
No way.

472
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,480
Many people are rejected every year.

473
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,800
Even if I meet Lin Taimo,

474
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
he cannot remember me. What to say?

475
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,280
Trust me.

476
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,560
Just

477
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,440
get dressed up for the party.

Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

You lost to Mr. Yuan of MH again.

Do you have any story to share with us?

486

Sorry, everyone.

487
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,480
We’re just here for the party.

488

Follow GE’s official media for more news,

489
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
as well as press conference.

490
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,560
Ms. Ling. You had worked for MH

491
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,240
before you joined GE.

492
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,120
Does this loss mean

493
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,400
there’s still disparity between the strength

494
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
of two companies?

495
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,880
Investment banking is a battlefield.

496
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
It’s common to win some or lose some.

497
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,480
We’ve been keeping a friendly partnership

498
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,800
with MH.

499
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,480
We’re rivals but also friends.

500
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,960
A business case won’t affect

501
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,820
the goal of win-win cooperation.

502
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,320
Mr. Du. Because of you,

503
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,160
Hualun Culture lost nearly one billion yuan.

504
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,280
Shouldn’t you be responsible

505
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,640
for such a failure?

506
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
One billion?

507
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,640
Do you have any basis to say that?

508
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,280
We didn’t get the controlling interest,

509
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,360
but we still hold VTV’s stocks.

Excuse me.

Sorry.

513

Never mind.

Do you have anything to say?

517
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,200
MH never meant to beat anyone.

518
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,330
Our principle is

519
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,080
to benefit our clients the most,

520
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,840
preventing the market and companies

521
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,640
suffering from unscrupulous capitals.

522
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,360
Mr. Yuan.

523
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,560
This morning VTV abruptly suspended trading
for follow-on offering,

524
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,120
-defeating Hualun’s malicious acquisition.
-The big devil.

525
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
It’s said that you were behind all this.

526
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,560
Do you have anything to say about that?

527
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,440
Keep going

528
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,570
in a low profile.

529
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,540
I heard that it’s Director Du Lei of GE

530
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,800
who helped Hualun with the acquisition.

531
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,520
He's been your old rival.

532
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,160
This time you defeated him again.

533

Do you have anything to say to him?

534

Sure.

Mr. Fan. What's the new plan for MH this year?

537
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,320
Could you tell us something about it?

538
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,080
-We have a huge acquisition plan.
-I won.

539
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,410
It’s still in progress.

540
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,800
If there’s any news,

541
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,240
we’ll tell you as soon as possible.

542
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Alright?

543
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,840
Just ignore him.

544

You’ll win back.

545
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,520
Got it.

546
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,880
The business goes well this year.

547
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
The company is also doing very well.

548
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,240
So I hope we can keep up the good work

549
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,080
and do better.

550

Excuse me.

554

Yeah. What are you gonna do?

Yuan Shuai. Why didn’t you reply my message?

Who are you?

You don’t love me anymore, do you?

You're pretending you don't know me.

What's my phone number?

00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,440
after so many years.

689
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,720
You should know

690
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,920
in the circle of investment banking,

691
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,600
females account for less than 20 percent.

692
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,920
This job requires capability, endurance,

693
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,280
and stress resistance.

694
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,680
Even many men can’t do it.

695
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,240
Not to mention you.

696
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,680
You’re even allergic to tears.

697
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
What made you exclude me

698
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,080
from the 20 percent?

699
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,080
Since they can do it, why can’t I?

700
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Whatever you say,

701
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,410
I won’t escape anymore.

702
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,170
Let me tell you, Yuan Shuai.

703
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,800
I will get into MH.

704
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,060
What are you doing?

705
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,840
Don’t.

706
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,960
Don't move.

707
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,540
Go back with me.

708
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,680
I have no time

709
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,100
to take you to the hospital if you cry.

710
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,560
Be good.

711
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,320
Let me go, Yuan Shuai!

712
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,040
Let me go, Yuan Shuai!

713
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Let me go!

714
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,320
Be good.

715
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
Yuan Shuai, let me go!

716
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,280
Let go of me!

717
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,200
Watch out!

718
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,080
Yuan Shuai and his girlfriend!

719
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,680
Here Yuan Shuai is!

720
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,320
Go! Go!

721
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,440
-Coming!
-Hurry.

722
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,170
Yuan Shuai, is she your girlfriend?

723
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,320
No photos!

724
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,600
Stop it!

725
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,480
Shoot again

726
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,600
and I’ll sue you for privacy violation!

727
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,120
Leave!

728
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,160
Jiang Jun!

729
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,120
Jiang Jun!

730
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,440
Jiang Jun!

731
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:45,840
Jiang Jun!

732
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,920
Jiang Jun!

733
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,920
Jiang Jun.

734
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,000
Yes?

735
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,640
I’ve made detailed statistics and analysis

736
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,970
of your responses to various emergencies

737
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,960
over the last year.

738
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,160
I divide quarrels into nine levels,

739
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,200
school bullying into 6 categories and 18 types.

740
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,840
After the experiment of one year,

741
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,520
I find that

742
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,180
you can only bear argument-level conflict.

743
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,160
You're absolutely defenseless

744
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,840
against various bullying in school.

745
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,960
Your resistance

746
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,040
against insects and invertebrates

747
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,500
has no improvement at all.

748
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,040
Jiang Jun.

749
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
Jiang Jun.

750
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,680
Hey.

751
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,720
You have to listen to me.

752
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,760
You like drawing.

753
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
But look at these.

754
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,520
You only draw

755
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,680
little rabbits, sheep, puppies,

756
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,480
these weak and cute animals.

757
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,600
I suggest that

758
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,640
you can start with your hobby

759
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,840
and draw some aggressive animals

760
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,170
to improve yourself

761
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Jiang Jun. You hear me?

762
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,360
A wolf?

763
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,900
Love Is Sweet
