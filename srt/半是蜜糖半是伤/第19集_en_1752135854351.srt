Novel

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,760
An Li, Niu Cui Lai

3
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,240
invites you to watch

4
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
the half-life secret house and half-life business.

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,240
To invest,

6
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,400
invest in your beauty first.

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
Do you know the secret of the natural beauty of Jiang Jun?

8
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
The answer is An Li, Niu Cui Lai.

9
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
Natural nutrition, natural health,

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
beautiful, eat it up.

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,720
Mr. Du,

12
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,880
today is your birthday.

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
It's nothing.

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,160
It's hot,

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,560
but I can take it.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
Stop playing games with your wound.

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
Give it back to me.

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,880
What are you doing?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Xiao Yan, why are you so fierce?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you angry?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hello, dear Westworld users.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you for your support during the internal test.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
At 2 p.m. this Sunday,

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
we will hold our first date at the ocean museum.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We look forward to your arrival.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Date?

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's it.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The time and location of our offline activities have been set.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The system should have been sent to you.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I, Xiao Chuan and Mr. Du will be there.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
As a part of Westworld, you must come.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I see you are tired of being in MH, right?

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can't wait to jump into the tide, right?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is it just an outdoor event on the weekend?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or, Mr. Yuan, you come with me.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
By the way, look at Xiao Chuan's entrepreneurial achievements.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Maybe it can change your thoughts on Westworld.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not going.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What? The ocean museum?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to see the fish.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not going.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to sleep.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Your phone.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Take it yourself.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You talk too much.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are so boring.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to sleep.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mr. Du.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are here.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Jingjing, this way.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Mr. Du, you are here.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Mr. Du, you are here so early.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Today is the first time in the world that we have an offline event.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have to come early.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Jingjing, your task today is to keep Mr. Du company.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll go to work with Xiao Liang.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you need my help?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go over there.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's so beautiful.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is called the ocean and moon.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Actually, they are transparent.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But when the light hits them, they become colorless.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I used to hear a story about the ocean and moon.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's said that long ago, there were two satellites on the earth.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
One is called the moon and one is called the stars.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They were a couple who loved each other.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then one day, a meteorite hit the earth.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The moon will be out of orbit.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In order to protect the moon, the stars chose to sacrifice themselves.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They hit the meteorite without hesitation.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
After the stars disappeared, the moon left sad tears.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Then these tears fell into the ocean.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Finally, they became the ocean and moon.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Actually, people are the same sometimes.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When you fall in love with someone,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you will be like the stars,

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
care for that person.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I love you.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's so beautiful.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,180
they went to

84
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:17,820
the moon

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Do they like to live in the dark?

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Maybe.

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,520
They've evolved in the dark for so many years.

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,760
They may have gotten used to it.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But I think

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
if they want to see the sun,

91
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,440
they may not want to live in the dark

92
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,640
and live in the sun.

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,440
If it were me,

94
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,040
I think I would do the same.

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,640
That sound is powerful.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,560
Jiang Yao.

97
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,880
Come on.

98
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,560
I don't want to see you.

99
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
I'm not going to see you again.

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,760
Uncle, what are you staring at?

101
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Good.

102
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,540
It looks like a

103
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,020
I'll treat you to a lollipop later.

104
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,860
How about it?

105
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:27,980
Sure.

106
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,380
But, what do I do?

107
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,900
Uncle.

108
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:38,980
Uncle.

109
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,940
Uncle.

110
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,620
Uncle.

111
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Uncle.

112
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
Uncle.

113
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
Uncle.

114
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
Uncle.

115
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
Uncle.

116
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
Uncle.

117
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Uncle.

118
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,940
Uncle.

119
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Uncle.

120
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Stop yelling.

121
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,380
Am I pretending to be a good boy?

122
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Where's my candy?

123
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,020
More candy?

124
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
Go away.

125
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,180
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

126
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm here to buy fish.

127
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,380
To buy fish at the ocean.

128
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
Do you have any problem?

129
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
No.

130
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
I want to correct you, Mr. Du.

131
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,740
The water mother of the Minghe River is different from the ordinary water mother.

132
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,300
Biological studies have a guess.

133
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,500
Their light sensors

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,620
have been lost

135
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,740
in the process of evolution.

136
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,460
So,

137
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,460
the dark environment

138
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
is where they rely on survival.

139
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
Just like some people,

140
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
they are only suitable to live in the dark.

141
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,900
If the water mother of the Minghe River comes to life,

142
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
maybe

143
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,140
it will also evolve a new life mechanism

144
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,140
to adapt to the environment.

145
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,020
We can't be blinded by the fact that they used to live in the dark.

146
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,500
It seems that Mr. Du is quite knowledgeable

147
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,580
about the poisonous water mother.

148
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
A little.

149
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,060
Do you know

150
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,820
what is the most poisonous water mother?

151
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,140
Australia believes in water mothers.

152
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,100
They grow in the northern seas of Australia and New Guinea for a long time.

153
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,460
If people touch them, they will die immediately.

154
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,020
They are the most poisonous water mothers in the world.

155
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,500
No doubt.

156
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Am I right, Mr. Yuan?

157
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,780
I also want to ask Mr. Yuan.

158
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,340
What is the smallest water mother in the world?

159
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:46,620
The first

160
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,620
and the second

161
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,660
Do you feel thirsty?

162
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,340
Do you want to drink some water?

163
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,940
I'll go get it.

164
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,700
What do you want to drink?

165
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,940
I'm not warm.

166
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,020
We are done.

167
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,820
This is fast.

168
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,300
It's almost time.

169
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,260
Are they coming?

170
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,740
I think so.

171
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,780
After they sign up,

172
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,300
all the users will watch the show first.

173
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,540
After the show,

174
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,860
we will arrange a different dating area for them.

175
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,900
What about the 100% team?

176
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,860
They will be arranged to

177
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,620
meet at the Beijing Baijing Museum in the Ice Mountain.

178
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,420
Don't worry.

179
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,060
The water mother of the Northern Ji family

180
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,580
is the largest in the world.

181
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,020
The water mother of the Dengta

182
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,540
has the same power as the old one.

183
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,860
What do you mean?

184
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,140
Don't you know what I mean?

185
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,940
I really...

186
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,900
You two.

187
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,140
You are here to support Li Xiaochuan,

188
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
not to make trouble, right?

189
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:54,900
Here.

190
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,820
Mr. Du.

191
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,180
Thank you.

192
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,020
Come closer.

193
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,660
Just give me water.

194
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,860
Why are you so close?

195
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,980
Do you know that men and women are not close?

196
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,460
Men and women are...

197
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,020
Do you understand?

198
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,500
Doesn't Mr. Du care about your water?

199
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,140
Yep.

200
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,540
Mr. Du has told you

201
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,980
to take a shower first.

202
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,740
Ok?

203
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,140
Dad.

204
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,660
Du.

205
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Dad is in the hospital.

206
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,420
Can you see him?

207
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,180
What did he do?

208
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,060
He passed out suddenly at home,

209
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,140
he's in critical condition now.

210
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,460
Send me the clip.

211
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,740
What's wrong, Mr. Du?

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,060
Something urgent came up at home.

213
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,820
I need to go back immediately.

214
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,280
I appreciate everything you do for me.

215
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,920
Are you satisfied?

216
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Yes.

217
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,880
Dear Western users,

218
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,960
the show is about to start.

219
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Please come to the show area.

220
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,760
Let's go.

221
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:58,960
What?

222
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
Watch the show.

223
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,840
This way.

224
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,840
Is he a fool?

225
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,120
Thank you for your time

226
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
to join the event

227
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,840
of the One Day Date

228
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,680
in the Western World.

229
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,760
I wonder if you found

230
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,520
the one you're most compatible with

231
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
in the free activity just now.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It seems that you're still very happy.

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Thank you.

234
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,760
Thank you.

235
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,800
Thank you.

236
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,760
Thank you.

237
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,880
Thank you.

238
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,920
Thank you.

239
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,880
Thank you.

240
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,920
Thank you.

241
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
Thank you.

242
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,160
Thank you.

243
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,120
Thank you.

244
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
Thank you.

245
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
Thank you.

246
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,400
Thank you.

247
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,320
It seems that you're still very shy.

248
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
Be brave.

249
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
The Western World

250
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,320
is a dating platform

251
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,000
that provides you

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
the only true love in the world.

253
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
Next,

254
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,920
please go to the romantic date

255
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,560
that we arranged

256
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,160
according to the 70% to 100%

257
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
of different comments.

258
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,720
I wish all users

259
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,520
can meet their destiny.

260
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,120
Let's get started.

261
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Go.

262
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,880
I think

263
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
Xiaochun's software

264
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,600
should not be registered

265
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,320
in the Western World.

266
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
You're not

267
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
compatible with Ye Pi, are you?

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,360
How is that possible?

269
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm here as a relative

270
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,640
to ask you to be my girlfriend.

271
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,920
I'm not your girlfriend.

272
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm your girlfriend.

273
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm your girlfriend.

274
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,440
I'm your girlfriend.

275
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
I'm your girlfriend.

276
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm your girlfriend.

277
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm your girlfriend.

278
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
She is your girlfriend.

279
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
There's nothing you don't know.

280
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,920
I didn't notice until now

281
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,200
that you don't know.

282
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,480
I didn't even know

283
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,520
about you.

284
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,400
You're your girlfriend.

285
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,920
Can you tell me

286
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,600
how was it with you?

287
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,560
What's the big deal?

288
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
You're my girlfriend

289
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,680
anyway.

290
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,000
And all you do

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,200
during isolated time

292
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,840
are you're so looked down on

293
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,160
Thus,

294
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,060
Her

295
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,280
cartridges Jewish

296
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,440
gold

297
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,040
fancy

298
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,560
golden

299
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
counter

300
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,800
found

301
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,880
Why didn't you say anything

302
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,880
Wine

303
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
What should we do now?

304
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,720
What?

305
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
We'll go in, of course.

306
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,000
Anyway, you're worried, right?

307
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,440
What if Xiao Chuan

308
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,480
can find a software

309
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
that can be used

310
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
to set up a date?

311
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
But I don't really want to go on a blind date.

312
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
What should I say when I see him?

313
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,040
Just go in first.

314
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,320
You're really the only one

315
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
in our software

316
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,440
who has 100% of the users.

317
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,240
This data is really

318
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,440
important to our company.

319
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,680
Please, don't go.

320
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
You're so nice.

321
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,600
I won't go.

322
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,800
Go.

323
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Go.

324
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,560
Jiang Jun,

325
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,800
look at the bag I bought for you.

326
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,480
I'll definitely...

327
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,520
You're so talented.

328
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,280
So,

329
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,600
you're really the one who has 100% of the users?

330
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,840
That's me.

331
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,880
Wait.

332
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,720
Don't you believe

333
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,320
my Western World?

334
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm just helping you.

335
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,960
You brat.

336
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,160
This

337
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,360
is the data I've been using

338
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,640
to summarize my Western World.

339
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,840
I can improve it.

340
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,280
You can use it as a reference.

341
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,400
In general,

342
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,560
your app

343
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,080
is still worth it.

344
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,880
Keep up the good work.

345
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,600
Thank you, bro.

346
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Keep up the good work, bro.

347
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,920
By the way,

348
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,520
I won't go to your

349
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,680
100% of the users experience.

350
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,960
I'm leaving.

351
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,600
No.

352
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,520
You're the only one

353
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,800
who has 100% of the users experience.

354
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
You have to go.

355
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,680
If I don't go,

356
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
do you have to force me to go?

357
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,200
Even if you upload that video,

358
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,880
you have to go.

359
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,680
Go.

360
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,560
Hello.

361
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
Dear Miss Juno,

362
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
you're going to be late.

363
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
You're late. Be polite.

364
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,840
Hello.

365
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Hello.

366
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,800
Dear Mr. Jules,

367
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,080
you're going to be late.

368
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Don't be shy.

369
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,200
Don't be hasty.

370
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,320
Don't try to run away.

371
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,080
Please follow the rules.

372
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,160
Please follow the rules.

373
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm leaving.

374
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,400
Please enter the park.

375
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,960
Thank you.

376
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,160
Please enter the park.

377
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,580
Thank you.

378
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,640
Hello, I'm�soo jun.

379
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,080
I wish you good luck for the new product.

380
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,720
Thank you.

381
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,600
Just go ahead.

382
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,680
It doesn't matter.

383
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Tell her that you don't want to

384
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,760
dificult for a while.

385
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,640
They already kicked me out.

386
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,560
Let's have a talk.

387
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,840
Ok.

388
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,240
challenges.

389
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Welcome to the West World, Juno Jones.

390
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Welcome to the show.

391
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Please stand under the spotlight.

392
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Next, I will give you a tacit test.

393
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
If the answer is yes, you will step back.

394
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
If the answer is no, you will step forward.

395
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Excuse me, are you single?

396
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Do you believe in love?

397
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Do you believe that you can only love one person in your life?

398
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Do you believe in destiny?

399
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
I believe in love.

400
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Congratulations!

401
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
You passed our tacit test.

402
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Now you can turn around and meet.

403
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
What?

404
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
What's going on?

405
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
It's you.

406
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Fine.

407
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Then, according to the rules, you can stay here for a while and then go out.

408
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Hello.

409
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,240
I don't know how to feel.

410
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,240
I don't know how to heal.

411
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
You walk so fast.

412
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
Can't catch your light.

413
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,240
You fly so high.

414
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Leave all the things behind.

415
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
And our story.

416
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
I believe in love.

417
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Nowhere to find.

418
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I think I'm tired.

419
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I think I'm blind.

420
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Don't know how to feel.

421
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Don't know how to heal.

422
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,240
You walk so fast.

423
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Can't catch your light.

424
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,240
You fly so high.

425
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Leave all the things behind.

426
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
And our story.

427
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Leave all of nowhere to find.

428
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Junjun and Yuan Shuai, your software is different from my CPU.

429
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm surprised too.

430
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
But my software is impossible to make.

431
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
So you see, they will be together.

432
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,240
What's your user ID?

433
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,240
I'm a system developer.

434
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Your name is...

435
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,240
So creative.

436
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,240
System developer?

437
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,240
System developer.

438
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,240
So thoughtful.

439
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,240
My cousin is here.

440
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Thank you.

441
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Thank you.

442
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Me.

443
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,400
I don't have a phone.

444
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,080
Liang Xiaochuan.

445
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm leaving.

446
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,240
Yes, that's it.

447
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,880
Li Xiaochuan.

448
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,040
Li Xiaochuan.

449
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,520
Li Xiaochuan.

450
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,200
I'm leaving.

451
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,880
Okay.

452
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,320
Okay.

453
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
Thank you.

454
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,320
Put it here.

455
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,240
Put it here.

456
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,720
Okay.

457
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,880
Zhou Zhou, right?

458
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,520
You ignore me.

459
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm leaving.

460
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,640
This is mine.

461
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,160
Bye.

462
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,680
Thank you.

463
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,360
Bye.

464
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,080
Bye.

465
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,520
Xue Li.

466
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,680
You...

467
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,000
Xue Li.

468
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,160
Xue Li.

469
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,160
Sorry.

470
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,920
The number you dialed is not available.

471
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,200
Please try again later.

472
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,000
Sorry.

473
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,560
價值

474
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,720
Coming soon.

475
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,000
Mr. Du, Mr. Du.

476
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,840
But still,

477
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,240
I only have a small ego.

478
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,280
What's going on now?

479
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,960
Just finished the surgery.

480
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,040
Are you an employee?

481
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,760
Dad suddenly fell down.

482
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,600
The news has been spread.

483
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,600
The company is very kind.

484
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,200
Suddenly,

485
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,200
I can't handle it alone.

486
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,600
How could I not be concerned about mom?

487
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
Why did you say that?

488
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,720
I'll handle it.

489
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
the rumors have been controlled.

490
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,120
But today's sale

491
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,240
has created a new history.

492
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,880
The press conference prepared by the PR Department

493
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,640
will be held one day earlier.

494
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,800
If the chairman wakes up,

495
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,640
we'll find a suitable time to meet

496
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,920
a media company

497
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,200
to do a face-to-face interview.

498
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,640
Okay.

499
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,240
Wait.

500
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,200
They'll do it together.

501
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,320
I see.

502
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,240
We'll sign each other's name.

503
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,640
In case the others say we spend money to control the media.

504
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,320
Go.

505
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,320
I see.

506
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,040
We'll go back first.

507
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,600
Okay.

508
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,240
Liao Chuan.

509
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,200
Stinky Liao Chuan.

510
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,680
If you don't come to me,

511
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,360
I'll secretly

512
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
throw your computer into the bathtub.

513
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,720
No.

514
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,160
The computer seems to be very important to Xiaochun.

515
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,760
Then I'll take your return ticket.

516
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,760
But it seems that it won't work.

517
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,280
Then I'll take the delete ticket.

518
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,840
Xu Li.

519
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,560
Where have you been?

520
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,360
Do you know I've been looking for you for a long time?

521
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,760
It's already closed.

522
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,920
It's about to close.

523
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,720
Do you know?

524
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,280
I...

525
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,920
I've looked everywhere.

526
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,880
You can't reach me.

527
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,600
I can't find you.

528
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,640
I'm going to call the police.

529
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,280
I'm lost, I'm brave, I'm still pulling.

530
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,240
How many passers-by in this world

531
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,560
prove your uniqueness.

532
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,080
Love can be miracle.

533
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,200
I want you to be in my everything

534
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,240
to untie the silence

535
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,360
and heal my wound.

536
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,600
You're my miracle.

537
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,760
You're my miracle.

538
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,600
Why is your heart beating so fast?

539
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,720
I just ran here.

540
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,400
Wait for a moment to tell me.

541
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,880
Let's go back.

542
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,920
What I want is not much.

543
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,360
I have you who will be with me

544
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,840
during the Heroes tattoo.

545
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,480
leader Yesterday

546
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,880
I treat not what I do

547
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,560
this is the 70th day of the

548
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,240
brave still pulling

549
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,440
how many passersby

550
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,480
prove your uniqueness.

551
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,920
Love can be miracle.

552
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,120
You're my miss everything

553
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,360
My promise

554
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,720
Wait for a moment to say good-bye

555
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,280
How come it's been called back again?

556
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,600
Ten times?

557
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,840
I haven't been called back so many times in my thesis.

558
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,560
In your competitive and related transactions,

559
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,800
you have to emphasize that the Yanyang Group, which is controlled by foreign funds,

560
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,200
although it has the same business as the publisher's subsidiary company,

561
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,680
doesn't actually exist.

562
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,200
It's a real business competition.

563
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,760
Understand, Dr. Stan?

564
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,680
Yes.

565
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,200
Go ahead.

566
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,440
Hello, baby.

567
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,760
Hello, baby. Guess where I am.

568
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,000
Baby, why do you like to play the game of guessing?

569
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,360
I guess you're on your way to dinner with your best friend.

570
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
No.

571
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm at the door of your company.

572
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,360
What?

573
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,440
You're at the door of my company?

574
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,320
Baby, don't move. Wait for me.

575
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,480
Our company doesn't allow outsiders to enter.

576
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,640
Wait a moment.

577
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,760
I'll send someone to pick you up.

578
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,840
Hello.

579
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,680
Miss, do you have an appointment?

580
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,960
Of course. I'm looking for your big leader.

581
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,280
Then, sit next to me.

582
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,760
Okay.

583
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,400
Big leader.

584
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,360
You're not even knocking. You're rude.

585
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,440
Xinxin is here.

586
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,200
What kind of internal management are you doing?

587
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,360
Big leader, I didn't expect Xinxin to come.

588
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,800
Can you help me one last time?

589
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,240
One last time.

590
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,760
Okay.

591
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,640
Then, bring her to my office.

592
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
What are you doing?

593
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,640
Closing the curtains.

594
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,480
Why?

595
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,800
I don't dare to pick her up.

596
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,520
I think you should go and pick her up.

597
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,120
After all, I'm ED now.

598
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,240
If I really go out to pick her up,

599
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,040
I'm afraid that Chuanbang...

600
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,600
Come here.

601
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
You brat.

602
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,280
Thank you, boss.

603
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,680
You'll go to the finance office yourself later and get a half-year's salary.

604
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,360
Thank you, boss.

605
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,880
One point.

606
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,040
Miss Xinxin.

607
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Yuan.

608
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,600
Hello.

609
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,280
Hello.

610
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,760
You're looking for Mr. Su, right?

611
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,120
Come, this way, please.

612
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,960
Okay.

613
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,720
Let me help you.

614
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,640
Okay, thank you.

615
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,800
You're welcome. This way, please.

616
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,360
Yuan, where is Mr. Su?

617
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,000
He's in the office. I'll take you there.

618
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,880
Oh my god, what's going on?

619
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,400
Oh my god.

620
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,840
Mr. Yuan just came to pick up a girl.

621
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,080
He's going to the office now.

622
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,720
Do you know what's going on with him?

623
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,160
Did you see it?

624
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,040
I saw it.

625
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,360
Hurry up.

626
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,240
Yeah, what's going on?

627
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
Why would Yuan bring a girl?

628
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
It's a thousand years of hard time.

629
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,640
Miss Xinxin, this way, please.

630
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,720
Hello.

631
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,600
Hello.

632
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,720
Wait.

633
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,160
Why didn't I see Mr. Jiang?

634
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,600
Mr. Jiang went to the client company to do financial computing.

635
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,160
He'll be back to M&H later.

636
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,280
I see.

637
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,960
I brought you two some delicious food.

638
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,560
Thank you, Miss Xinxin.

639
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,880
This way, please.

640
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,920
Oh my god.

641
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,880
What kind of trick is this?

642
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,400
How could Mr. Yuan be so desperate?

643
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,720
There's only one truth.

644
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,200
It must be that Mr. Yuan won a big prize

645
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,400
with his own strength.

646
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,680
I don't think so.

647
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,280
What kind of client is so young?

648
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,360
She's the daughter of a big client.

649
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,800
That makes sense.

650
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,000
Mr. Yuan is so handsome.

651
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,760
He doesn't need to be so handsome.

652
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,600
It seems that

653
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,920
God of War needs to be handsome.

654
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,720
Stop gossiping.

655
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,480
Mr. Yuan is so bad-tempered.

656
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,720
You're so smart.

657
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,200
You're so stupid.

658
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,600
Hello, Mr. Yuan?

659
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,520
Hello, Miss Xinxin.

660
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,440
Mr. Sun, Miss Xinxin is here.

661
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,800
Baby.

662
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,880
Let me know my salary next time.

663
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,080
I see.

664
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,640
It's next time?

665
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,040
There's no next time.

666
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,200
I was wrong.

667
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,280
What's going on?

668
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,640
Beach of perk of vikings with me in place.

669
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Yes but I第1

670
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,280
I didn't recommend here.

671
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,520
Run straight.

672
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,800
Bye.

673
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,680
I'm sorry.

674
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,080
Miss Xingxu is here too.

675
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,440
Actually, I'm not in a hurry

676
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,160
to find Mr. Su.

677
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,560
I won't bother you.

678
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,400
Wait.

679
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,160
I've prepared lunch for you.

680
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,120
Come and eat together.

681
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,240
And Yuan is also here.

682
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,440
Okay.

683
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,480
Thank you.

684
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,640
Thank you.

685
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,400
Yuan, I'm thirsty.

686
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,640
Pour me a glass of water.

687
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

688
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,240
By the way, Mr. Jiang,

689
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,240
you and Mr. Yuan

690
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
are in a relationship

691
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,440
so secretly.

692
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,480
Is it exciting?

693
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,680
Mr. Jiang, slow down.

694
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,040
Don't choke.

695
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,120
It's okay.

696
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,120
I'm still shy today.

697
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,240
It's true.

698
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,640
Hurry up and eat.

699
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,560
Eat.

700
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,400
Yuan, open it.

701
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,880
Mr. Jiang calls you Yuan.

702
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,040
It's so sweet.

703
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,080
Of course.

704
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,040
Yuan is so sweet.

705
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,320
I like to eat separately.

706
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,520
And I don't eat carrots and soybeans.

707
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,120
He always

708
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,440
helps me to separate them.

709
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,440
Right?

710
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,360
So sweet.

711
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,440
Why are there so many soybeans?

712
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,640
There's another one.

713
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,440
I didn't think about it.

714
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,000
It's really sweet.

715
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,200
I'm not hungry.

716
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,880
Don't force yourself.

717
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,040
Have a good meal, Mr. Jiang.

718
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,000
Thank you.

719
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,240
Your chopstick gets carried away.

720
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,840
Yuan, please hold it for me.

721
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,120
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

722
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
I suddenly don't want to use chopsticks.

723
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
How about you

724
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
feeding

725
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
me

726
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
with chopsticks?

727
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,920
It's my honor to feed Mr. Jiang.

728
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
By the way, Mr. Jiang,

729
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,760
I'm not going to eat.

730
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,680
I heard from our Su Chang

731
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,400
that he's a boss.

732
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,000
He's really hard to deal with.

733
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,200
He's very fierce.

734
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,960
Yes.

735
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,760
He's really fierce.

736
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,360
He's narcissistic and domineering.

737
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
I don't dare to mess with him.

738
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,960
You're exaggerating.

739
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,440
I heard from our Su Chang

740
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,040
that he's old

741
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,400
and single.

742
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,880
He's always jealous and angry at our Su Chang.

743
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,360
He's so bad-tempered.

744
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,920
He must be very bad-tempered.

745
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,400
Maybe he doesn't have any hair.

746
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,400
And you said

747
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
he could sit in that position

748
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,200
according to the principle.

749
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,360
There's no way

750
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
that there's no woman around him.

751
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,560
So I guess

752
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,840
it's him.

753
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,640
Baby,

754
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,800
it's cold.

755
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,880
Have a bite.

756
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,720
Mr. Jiang,

757
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
our Su Chang

758
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,520
sometimes doesn't talk with his head.

759
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,600
He's easily offended.

760
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,080
Especially if his boss

761
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,200
bullies him,

762
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,800
you can take care of him

763
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,240
in the company.

764
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,880
How could I?

765
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,080
Mr. Su

766
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,880
is the most lovable person

767
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,640
in the company.

768
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,960
No matter he's a boss or a subordinate,

769
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,920
he loves him very much.

770
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,960
How could he bully him?

771
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,720
Right, Mr. Su?

772
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,840
Yes.

773
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,960
And now you're supporting him.

774
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,320
I believe

775
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,680
Mr. Su will be more popular

776
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,320
in the company.

777
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
I'm late.

778
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,680
I have an appointment with my best friend.

779
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,760
You two go back to work.

780
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,560
I'm leaving.

781
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,240
Bye.

782
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,320
Bye.

783
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,280
By the way, baby,

784
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,320
my best friend asked us

785
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,840
to have dinner together tonight.

786
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,080
Her husband is back from a business trip.

787
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,640
He wants to meet you.

788
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,040
Don't forget it.

789
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,640
If I can get off work alive,

790
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
I'll go back.

791
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,200
No.

792
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,160
I'll send you back.

793
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,200
Mr. Su.

794
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,040
I have something to tell you.

795
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,960
How about

796
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,520
letting Yuanyuan send you back?

797
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,360
Yuanyuan,

798
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,640
go ahead.

799
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,120
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

800
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,440
Miss Xinxin, please.

801
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,440
This way, please.

802
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,360
Xiao Ran, go back.

803
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,000
Print this out and send it to me.

804
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,960
Okay.

805
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,640
Work hard.

806
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,640
Go for it.

807
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,560
Okay, Miss Xinxin.

808
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,640
I'm leaving.

809
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,600
Please.

810
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,040
Bye.

811
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,360
Hello.

812
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm Qiao Na, the MHVP.

813
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,960
Are you the representative of your company?

814
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,920
I'm not a client.

815
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,400
I'm here to see my boyfriend.

816
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,560
Your boyfriend?

817
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,560
Yuan Shuai?

818
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,320
No.

819
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,440
Don't get me wrong.

820
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,280
Yuan has a girlfriend.

821
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,160
I've been his colleague for so many years.

822
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,920
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.

823
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,840
Who is it?

824
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,400
Tell me.

825
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,240
Don't go to see them.

826
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,360
If you don't find out,

827
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,400
he's keeping it a secret.

828
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,400
He's in the company.

829
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,680
He's not wearing shoes.

830
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
I don't know who it is.

831
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,000
I just heard.

832
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,720
I have something urgent.

833
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,360
I'm leaving.

834
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,200
Bye.

835
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
You're not mine

836
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Make you satisfied

837
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,240
Wear another mask

838
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,040
You never realize things I do for love

839
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,640
I think I'm tired

840
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,440
I think I'm blind

841
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,240
Don't know how to feel

842
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,040
Don't know how to heal

843
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,840
You walk so fast

844
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,440
Can't catch your light

845
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,040
You fly so high

846
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,240
Leave all the things behind

847
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,440
And our story

848
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,240
Leave all of nowhere to find

849
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,440
I think I'm tired

850
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,240
I think I'm blind

851
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,040
Don't know how to feel

852
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,240
Don't know how to heal

853
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,040
You walk so fast

854
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,640
Can't catch your light

855
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,240
You fly so high

856
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,240
Leave all the things behind

857
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,840
And our story

858
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:06,440
Leave all of nowhere to find
