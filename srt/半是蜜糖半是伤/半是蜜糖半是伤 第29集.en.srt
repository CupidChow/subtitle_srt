00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,470
you just want me to testify against Lin Taimo.

176
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,870
After all,

177
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,860
it’s your best way to atone for your sin.

178
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,580
If you do so,

179
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,840
all Du Lei’s efforts will be worth it.

180
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,100
No matter what,

181
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,500
you made a mistake first.

182
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,100
By doing this,

183
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,620
we just hope

184
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,020
that you can correct your mistake soon.

185
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,260
By “We”, do you mean you and Du Lei?

186
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,480
There’s another thing

187
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,180
I wanna ask you, Miss Ling.

188
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,900
How did Jiang Yaoming

189
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,820
die exactly?

190
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,360
I guess it was also related to you, right?

191
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,260
How did Jiang Yaoming
die of heart attack suddenly?

192
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,500
What happened before he died?

193
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,780
He only met you and Lin Taimo on that day.

194
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,350
Why did his blood pressure suddenly rise?

195
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,020
And what made him

196
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,780
so angry that he

197
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,220
suddenly died?

198
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,750
I’m sure you know it better than anybody else.

199
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,740
This is the signed contract of Jiangnan Flavor.

200
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,620
Miss Ling,

201
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,280
you made a great contribution this time.

202
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,260
We should celebrate

203
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,190
our victory.

204
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,380
Sir, you can’t go in!

205
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,740
Get out of my way!

206
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,340
-Sir!
-Get out of my way!

207
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,380
Sir! Sir! Sir!

208
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,140
Let me through!

209
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,540
Sir! You can’t go in! Sir!

210
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,700
Let go of him!

211
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,220
Leave us.

212
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,150
Yes, Mr. Lin.

213
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,420
Mr. Jiang, come here.

214
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,780
Let’s have some tea.

215
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,260
You bastard!

216
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,320
Jiang Yaoming!

217
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,340
I fully trusted you two,

218
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,730
but you set a trap for me!

219
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,260
You are both brutes!

220
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,390
Mr. Jiang,

221
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,020
it’s merrier to make money together.

222
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,220
Because of your stubbornness,

223
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,880
I had to use some tricks

224
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,120
to help you expand your business.

225
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,000
You are shameless!

226
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,020
What you did was the hostile takeover!

227
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,260
It was a business fraud!

228
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,060
That's right.

229
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,630
But, Mr. Jiang,

230
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,900
you should know

231
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,580
that we’ve signed a contract.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,030
Frankly speaking,

233
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,320
Jiangnan Flavor

234
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,860
is not yours anymore.

235
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,940
You are in no place to say that

236
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,460
to me at all!

237
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,260
I’m calling you Mr. Jiang

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,380
because I want to save your face!

239
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,940
Anyway,

240
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,300
you are the founder of Yixianqian.

241
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,140
You rejected me

242
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,420
because you wanted to maintain the fresh taste

243
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,260
and the original texture of the rice noodle.

244
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Then let me tell you clearly

245
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,140
that from now on,

246
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,700
Yixianqian will not only become an instant food,

247
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,780
but will also contain preservatives

248
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,380
to extend the shelf life.

249
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,060
The junk food that you abhor

250
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
will appear right

251
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
in front of you from today on.

252
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,020
You’d better get ready for that.

253
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,060
You son of a bitch!

254
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,020
Mr. Jiang.

255
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,180
You’d better take good care.

256
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,060
It’s not over yet!

257
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,380
What’s that?

258
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,140
It dropped.

259
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,220
What are you doing?

260
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,460
Pills, pills!

261
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,460
Pills!

262
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,260
Pills!

263
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,380
Call an ambulance.

264
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,660
Hello.

265
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,820
Someone had a heart attack!

266
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,660
Please send an ambulance right now!

267
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,380
That’s what happened.

268
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,780
Jiang Yaoming

269
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,740
died in front of me.

270
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,980
But my intention was to save him.

271
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,540
You two actually

272
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,120
watched a man

273
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,740
die right in front of you?!

274
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,860
It wasn’t my intention.

275
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,310
Back then, I…

276
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,260
Okay.

277
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,420
In that case,

278
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
I hope you can

279
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,860
give me the proof of all interest exchanges

280
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,500
between you and Lin Taimo.

281
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,460
It will be answerable

282
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,660
for Jiang Yaoming’s death, too.

283
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,420
Since they are

284
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,040
looking into Jiangnan Flavor’s matter,

285
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,980
I suggest

286
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,470
you get rid of the shares

287
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,240
of C Group as soon as possible.

288
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,180
What?

289
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,060
You are worried that Yuan Shuai

290
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,210
will make trouble?

291
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,940
Yuan Shuai is not

292
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,410
a big threat to us for now.

293
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,210
But if he finds the evidence,

294
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,579
both of us

295
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,250
will be screwed.

296
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
No worry.

297
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,079
I’ve had someone watch him.

298
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,870
And I’ve got the goods on him, too.

299
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,900
His qualifications

300
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,420
and connections are

301
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,240
nowhere near ours.

302
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,380
He won’t be able to harm us.

303
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,960
But aren’t you worried

304
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,580
that someone is helping him?

305
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,420
You mean Fan Qichang?

306
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,780
Fan is simply an old fox.

307
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,100
Seeing his fair-haired boy

308
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,660
bear the blame and leave,

309
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,660
he’s been busy with protecting himself.

310
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,220
Plus, he had nothing

311
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,900
to do with this matter.

312
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,470
He wouldn’t get himself involved.

313
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,260
By the way,

314
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,490
what about that document?

315
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,620
Are you sure it’s safe?

316
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,340
The most dangerous place

317
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,610
is the safest.

318
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,540
The safest place?

319
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,060
Don’t worry.

320
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,580
Of course.

321
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,260
I’m relieved

322
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,980
hearing you say that.

323
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,300
Hello.

324
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,220
She told me

325
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,340
Lin Taimo said

326
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,740
“The most dangerous place is the safest”.

327
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,270
So the document shouldn’t be kept in his home.

328
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,860
It’s such an important document.

329
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,070
If he doesn’t keep it home,

330
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,620
it must be put in a place

331
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,580
where he can see it every day.

332
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,380
He has a safe in his office.

333
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,480
But I don’t know the combination.

334
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,980
Do you want to bet?

335
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,660
Mr. Du.

336
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,680
You are also here, Secretary Bai.

337
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,140
Want some coffee?

338
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,720
No, I’ll have some tea.

339
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,120
By the way,

340
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,510
when will you have time?

341
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
What’s up, Mr. Du?

342
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,990
You are such an expert in wine.

343
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,380
My friend happened to bring me
a few bottles of good wine.

344
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,780
Would you like to taste it when you are free?

345
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,340
I’m not that busy these days.

346
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,940
You can pick any day you want.

347
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,620
Then why don’t we just do it

348
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,340
today?

349
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,420
Today?

350
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,700
We’ll have the annual conference tomorrow morning.

351
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,830
I don’t think tonight is the best time.

352
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,700
As you know, tomorrow’s meeting

353
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,700
is just to give

354
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,180
the management an opportunity

355
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,500
to praise each other’s work.

356
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,300
It’s all for a show.

357
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,620
All we need to do

358
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,680
is to prepare the conference.

359
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,060
But…

360
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,180
Just relax.

361
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,540
I’m asking you to taste the wine.

362
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,860
I won’t get you drunk.

363
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,240
How about this?

364
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,230
If anything happens tomorrow,

365
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,470
I’ll take full responsibility for it.

366
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,980
Alright.

367
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,620
Since you insist,

368
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,570
I’m looking forward to your nice wine.

369
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,560
Okay. See you tonight.

370
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,290
See you then.

371
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Sounds like you are having quite a good time.

372
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,840
Even in the mood for wine tasting.

373
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,090
Seeing that my opponent

374
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,600
is beaten down

375
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,320
and can’t even fight back,

376
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,240
I wanna celebrate it.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,680
Sure.

378
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,800
The annual conference tomorrow

379
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
is all about others’ merits and demerits.

380
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
It’s totally irrelevant to you.

381
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,240
But here’s a kind reminder.

382
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,570
Drunkenness could get you in trouble.

383
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,970
Thank you for reminding me.

384
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,440
Mr. Du, you prepared so much liquor for me.

385
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,480
This one

386
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,040
should be a limited edition of LOUIS XIII.

387
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
This one

388
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,730
is the top-notch

389
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,180
Martell extra-old cognac.

390
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,020
And this one is Macallan Lalique,

391
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,780
65 year old whisky.

392
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,220
It’s so rare to see.

393
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,340
Mr. Du, your collection is so impressive.

394
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,260
You are indeed an expert.

395
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,380
Now, let’s enjoy it today.

396
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,300
Okay.

397
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,140
Here.

398
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,780
Let me fill it for you.

399
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,180
Thank you, Mr. Du.

400
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,020
You really can drink.

401
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,900
Thank you.

402
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,060
Waiter.

403
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,460
He’s drunk.

404
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,750
Find a hotel nearby and send him there.

405
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,490
Thanks.

406
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,730
Dear shareholders,

407
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,460
ladies

408
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,620
and gentlemen,

409
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,660
welcome

410
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,500
to the annual conference

411
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,260
of the Investment Banking Department of MH.

412
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,220
Thank you

413
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,300
for your support and trust

414
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,900
in our department for the last year.

415
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,540
Of course,

416
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,400
our outstanding performance

417
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,620
didn’t let you down.

418
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,200
Let’s cut to the chase.

419
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,740
I announce

420
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,260
that our conference

421
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,260
will begin now.

422
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,340
First of all…

423
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,300
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

424
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,180
Please hold on for a sec.

425
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,580
Dear shareholders, ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,020
before the conference, please allow me

427
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,260
to report an executive member of MH.

428
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,320
Five years ago,

429
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,540
by taking advantage of his position,

430
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,060
he sought personal gains

431
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,580
during the case of Jiangnan Flavor.

432
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,540
As a result, Jiangnan Flavor underwent

433
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,940
a hostile takeover by C Group.

434
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,500
And this person

435
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,500
is Lin Taimo, Vice President of MH.

436
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,660
Mr. Fan,

437
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,540
you’d better be careful

438
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,140
with what you say,

439
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,600
especially in this grand situation.

440
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,380
I’m afraid you’ll take legal responsibility

441
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
for slandering an innocent person.

442
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,820
Mr. Lin,

443
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,500
since I brought it up,

444
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,380
of course I have evidence.

445
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,300
So where is it?

446
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,860
Why don’t you

447
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,500
show it to everybody?

448
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
It’s coming.

449
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,060
Where am I?

450
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,500
Shit!

451
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,380
I’m late for the conference!

452
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,580
Mr. Fan,

453
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,100
is this guy who was dismissed

454
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,060
by the company for taking bribes

455
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,980
your so-called evidence?

456
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,420
Mr. Yuan,

457
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,700
it’s all yours.

458
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,420
Mr. Lin,

459
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,180
What?

460
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,940
Are you afraid of me?

461
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,500
I did nothing wrong.

462
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,260
Why should I be afraid of you?

463
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,740
I’m just worried that someone

464
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,260
may be accused of bribe

465
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,300
aside from the crime

466
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,100
of slanders

467
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,340
Good.

468
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,180
Since you

469
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,020
did nothing wrong,

470
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,740
would you please

471
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,780
answer a few questions for me?

472
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,380
Of course.

473
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,500
Then let me ask you,

474
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,410
was Linda, GM of
the Investment Banking Department

475
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,700
of GE Securities,

476
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,740
your ED five years ago?

477
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,410
Yes.

478
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

479
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,220
this is

480

[Special seal for electronic receipt
of China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd.]

481
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,340
a remittance receipt

482
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,100
showing Linda transferred money

483
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,060
to Cao Heng, former President of C Group,

484
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,460
five years ago.

485
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,900
Based on Cao Heng’s confession,

486
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,500
it was Linda who asked him

487
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,740
to buy off the manager
of Jiangnan Flavor Food Factory

488
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,140
and force the manager to purchase

489
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,420
a batch of beef of poor quality,

490
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,780
resulting in the severe loss

491
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,040
of Jiangnan Flavor

492
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,540
and a hostile takeover by C Group.

493
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,900
Linda left

494

MH five years ago

495
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,540
and joined GE.

496
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,780
How’s that matter related to me?

497
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,860
I’m not finished, Mr. Lin.

498
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,820
This document

499
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,500
[Renmin East Road Branch of Bank of China]

via an offshore account five years ago.

502
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,220
And this one

[Huixing Industrial Co., Ltd.

510

I’m wondering

511
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,460
how you’ll explain

512
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,620
these documents to us.

513
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,820
What?

514
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,700
That’s all you have?

515
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,830
Now, answer me a question.

516
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,540
Mr. Yuan.

517
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,310
Which one of your documents

518
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,230
can prove that I have something

519
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,820
to do with this matter?

520
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,660
This is just a deal

521
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,780
between Linda and Secretary Bai.

522
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,510
It’s totally irrelevant to me.

523
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,500
Lin Taimo,

524
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,620
you planned very well.

525
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,700
That’s right.

526
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,430
The evidence here
doesn’t point at you directly.

527
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
But if I guess right,

528
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,500
you should have a Share Entrustment Agreement

529
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,260
that you signed with Linda.

530
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,500
Am I right?

531
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,460
Yuan Shuai,

532
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,060
you committed a bribe-related dereliction
of duty.

533
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,540
I didn’t punish you severely

534
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,580
for old time’s sake.

535
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,980
I only had you dismissed.

536
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,700
But now you are here confronting me

537
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,060
and defaming me!

538
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
Our Shareholders’ General Meeting

539
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,980
is not a place

540
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,980
where you can talk nonsense!

541
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,560
Please leave here.

542
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,300
Mr. Lin,

543
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,220
since you can prove that you are innocent,

544
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,480
why are you in a hurry to get me out of here?

545
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,000
Why don’t we make a bet?

546
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,140
From this moment on,
we’ll neither leave nor talk.

547
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,660
10 minutes.

548
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,820
In 10 minutes,

549
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,780
the Compliance Department from CSRC
will send people here.

550
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,300
According to the company’s policy,

551
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,420
your home

552
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,820
and your office,

553
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,460
including your safe,

554
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,220
will be searched thoroughly.

555
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,100
I promise

556
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,380
if there’s not any evidence,

557
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,100
I’m willing to be punished

558
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,220
and clear Mr. Lin’s name.

559
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,060
But, if they find the evidence,

560
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,740
Mr. Lin,

561
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,020
don’t even think about escaping the law!

562
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,780
10 minutes.

563
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,500
Okay.

564
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,620
I’ll see what you can find

565
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,540
from my home and my office

566
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,100
in 10 minutes.

567
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,140
[Jiang Jun]

568
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,220
Yuan Shuai is back.

569
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,590
He’s confronting Lin Taimo right now.

570
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,180
Shen Xin,

571
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,640
stop Secretary Bai for me!

572
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,680
Secretary Bai!

573
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,340
You wouldn’t even say sorry?

574
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,300
Sorry.

575
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,860
What’s that about?

576
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,140
A “sorry” won’t solve the problem!

577
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,940
Excuse me, I don’t have time!

578
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,780
What do you mean?

579
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,980
You need to take me to a doctor. You…

580
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,910
-You don’t have time?
-Let go of me!

581
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,510
Are you alright?

582
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,700
I’m fine.

583
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,580
Did he hurt you?

584
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,400
Do you need to see a doctor?

585
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,220
No.

586
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,940
Are you sure?

587
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,860
Secretary Bai is here!

588
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,660
Hide!

589
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,500
What were you doing?

590
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,300
Well…

591
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,430
Mr. Lin asked me to bring him a file.

592
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,310
Give me. I’ll give it to him.

593
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,540
Jiang Jun!

594
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,820
Stop!

595
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,700
Give me the file!

596
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,980
Give me!

597
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,540
Let go!

598
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,140
Give me the file!

599
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,620
It’s empty.

600
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,720
Is that necessary?

601
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,739
You don’t seem

602
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,300
to be afraid

603
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,300
of the Compliance Department.

604
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,380
You’d better confess your crime now.

605
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,449
Maybe the result won’t be that ugly.

606
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,020
Instead of talking nonsense,

607
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,940
you should check

608
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,820
the conviction and sentencing for libel.

609
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,780
Time’s up.

610
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,610
Mr. Fan,

611
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,820
Yuan Shuai,

612
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,380
where are the people from
the Compliance Department?

613
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,240
Are you fooling the shareholders

614
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,380
and the management?

615
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,700
Yuan Shuai,

616
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,380
it’s such a good idea.

617
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,320
Once the Compliance Department was mentioned,

618
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,480
this old fox gave himself away immediately.

619
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,540
Du Lei, what are you doing?

620
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,940
The document I’m holding

621
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,140
is the Share Entrustment Agreement

622
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,780
signed by Lin Taimo and Linda.

623
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,900
This file

624
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,580
[Party A Lin Taimo Party B Du Ling]

625
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,460
is also a hard evidence showing that Lin Taimo

626
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,340
is the real shareholder of C Group!

627
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,260
Mr. Lin,

628
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,780
you think it’s over?

629
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,500
Sister.

630
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,180
This is not

631
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,260
all he did.

632
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,900
When Jiang Yaoming, Chairman

633
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,740
of Jiangnan Flavor,

634
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,420
had a heart attack,

635
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,490
not only did he stop me
from calling an ambulance,

636
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,550
he also took away

637
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,020
the medicine that could’ve saved his life.

638
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,220
He just watched him suffer,

639
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,150
made him miss the best rescue time,

640
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,220
and let him die in front of us.

641
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,980
You are lying!

642
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,460
It’s you who caused Jiang Yaoming’s death!

643
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,700
Do you still

644
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,820
remember this?

645
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,580
Call an ambulance.

646
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,060
There are only your fingerprints

647
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,020
and Jiang Yaoming’s on this bottle.

648
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,140
It proves

649
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,700
that the one who took away the medicine

650
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,560
and caused Jiang Yaoming’s death

651
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:08,860
was you.

652
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,380
I’ve turned myself in.

653
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,720
If you have more things to say,

654
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,220
save them for the police.

655
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,160
Mr. Lin Taimo,

656
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,640
you are suspected of corruption in PE

657
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,840
and violating the Securities Law.

658
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,240
Please come to the CSRC

659
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,410
for investigation.

660
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,840
Wait.

661
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,080
You’ve got

662
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,850
what you wanted.

663
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,240
Why didn’t you save him?

664
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,510
Because he knew something he shouldn’t have.

665
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,260
That’s your reason?

666
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,860
If you were me,

667
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,260
you would have done the same thing.

668
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,780
I wouldn’t!

669
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,460
Jiangnan Flavor was a brand

670
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,870
that my father built from scratch.

671
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,260
Just like MH to you.

672
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,260
I used to see you as my role model

673
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,950
and a respected leader.

674
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,820
I wanted to become a person like you.

675
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,300
But now I realize I was so wrong.

676
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,700
I wouldn’t do such things

677
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,900
in my whole life!

678
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,540
My father

679
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,860
never cheated any of his customers!

680
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,900
He honored this brand!

681
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,220
My father was an honest and righteous man!
But you…

682
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,460
Just go to that dark and cold place

683
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,780
to reflect your sins.

684
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,060
I’m sure my father

685
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,630
can witness this in heaven.

686
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,700
Jiang Jun.

687
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,740
Love Is Sweet
