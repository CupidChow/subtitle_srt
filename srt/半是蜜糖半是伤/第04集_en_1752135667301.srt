1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,720
Are you okay?

2
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:46,860
You are okay baboon?

3
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,380
your

4
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,060
come

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,940
Wp

6
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,320
long

7
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,380
on

8
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:44,060
You can come here anytime.

9
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,060
Boss, where are you?

10
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,060
We're out.

11
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,060
Leave us alone.

12
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,060
You go back first.

13
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,060
I've never seen a handsome man like him.

15
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,060
He's just a small piece of gold.

16
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
A small kiss.

17
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Hello, welcome to...

18
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,060
Oh my god.

19
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,060
It can't be.

20
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,060
What a coincidence.

21
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
I didn't know that he would come here.

22
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
There are so many things in the toilet.

23
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
Mr. Ma is right.

24
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060
If you catch a woman, you'll catch the market.

25
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Oh no, I can't recognize him.

26
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,060
His suit looks expensive.

27
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,060
If I really want to lose money,

28
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,060
it will cost me half my life.

29
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
No, the revolution is not successful.

30
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,060
I even thought of my son's name.

31
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
I can't just stay here.

32
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,060
Other people's boyfriends never let others talk.

33
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,060
He's so warm.

34
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,060
Ma'am.

35
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,060
Hello, welcome.

36
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
You...

37
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
What's wrong?

38
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
What's going on?

39
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,060
Do you have a cup?

40
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,060
Of course, please wait.

41
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Sir, your cup.

42
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,060
Pour me a cup of hot water.

43
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,060
Okay, please wait.

44
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,060
I'm so honored to serve you.

45
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Thank you.

46
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Okay.

47
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Here.

48
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Tell me,

49
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,060
if this cup of hot ginger tea

50
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
falls on your face,

51
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,060
how would you feel?

52
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,060
My dear girlfriend.

53
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,060
Oh my god.

54
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,060
Oh my god.

55
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,060
You...

56
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,060
Are you my twin sister?

57
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,060
The handsome guy you met at the last party?

58
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Oh my god.

59
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,060
You're right.

60
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
After what happened last time,

61
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,060
my sister came back home and I regret it.

62
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
But our advice

63
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
is very good.

64
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
She's so stubborn.

65
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,060
She's so stubborn.

66
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,060
She's so stubborn.

67
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
She's so stubborn.

68
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,060
She's so stubborn.

69
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
Please forgive her.

70
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,060
Please.

71
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
It's simple.

72
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,060
You'll know if you're a real couple if you call the police.

73
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,060
Can I have your clothes?

74
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
How much is the police call?

75
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,060
One, one...

76
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Brother Kai, I'm wrong.

77
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm really wrong.

78
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,060
You can have whatever you want.

79
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
I'll pay.

80
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
I'll pay.

81
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
Dear god.

82
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,060
Thank you.

83
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,060
You're welcome.

84
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
Goodbye.

85
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
Goodbye.

86
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,060
Goodbye.

87
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,060
I was so scared.

88
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,060
My white-haired prince didn't wait for me.

89
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,060
He waited for a devil.

90
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,060
One, two, three.

91
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Just leave a laugh out of my mind.

92
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
Be free.

93
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Prove we're dancing in my dream.

94
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Take my love back home to me.

95
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
You're awake.

96
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,060
You can wake me up.

97
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,060
I'm not done yet.

98
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
I didn't mean to wait for you.

99
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,060
Don't be so self-willed.

100
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,060
Oh.

101
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
It's over there.

102
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,060
That's a lot.

103
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,060
I bought it on the way home.

104
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,060
Here.

105
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,060
What?

106
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
Red sugar ginger tea.

107
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
Thank you.

108
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Drink slowly.

109
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
It's hot.

110
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
How is it?

111
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
I'm done.

112
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,060
See how my colors paint the sky.

113
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
I'm done.

114
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,060
Junjun, you're back.

115
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,060
What did you buy?

116
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
You're so small.

117
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,060
Really?

118
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,060
Why are these all sanitary pads?

119
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
You're making a review.

120
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
I didn't buy them.

121
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
Isn't this...

122
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Isn't this what Yuan Shuai asked me to buy?

123
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
And this temperature cup.

124
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,060
Is this red sugar water?

125
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,060
And this jacket.

126
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
It's Yuan Shuai's, right?

127
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Oh my god.

128
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
What's going on between you two?

129
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
What's going on?

130
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
Nothing.

131
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
It's just...

132
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
You know what?

133
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,060
I think I should go and say bye-bye.

134
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Every time I meet Yuan Shuai,

135
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
there's nothing good about it.

136
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Do you believe it?

137
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Such a big building,

138
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,060
but it's our floor.

139
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,060
And then they locked me and Yuan Shuai

140
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
in the meeting room.

141
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,060
But at this time,

142
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
I'm still in the bathroom.

143
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,060
So when you were in the snow,

144
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,060
Yuan Shuai not only lent you his clothes,

145
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,060
but also bought you so many sanitary pads

146
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
and red sugar water.

147
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,060
Well, he's kind.

148
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
He helped me out this time.

149
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
Oh my god.

150
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
He's so nice.

151
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,060
Oh my god.

152
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,060
What kind of

153
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,060
domineering president is this?

154
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
The male hero is being kicked by the female hero.

155
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
The female hero has a fear of the male hero.

156
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
Alright.

157
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,060
Stop thinking about it.

158
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
Even if he's a domineering president,

159
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
I'm not a stupid woman, okay?

160
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,060
What?

161
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Why are you here?

162
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,060
Oh, right.

163
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
I just wanted to tell you.

164
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
My roommate said

165
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,060
she had a meeting

166
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
and the host had a three-day meeting.

167
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
So I'm going to be at your place

168
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
for three days.

169
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
I'm so happy to welcome you.

170
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,060
Finally, you, the little dork, are here to accompany me.

171
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Why am I the little dork?

172
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
Isn't it the weather these days?

173
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,060
I'm using a mask to introduce the little dork.

174
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
I think the name is quite big for you.

175
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
Aren't you also a little dork?

176
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
Oh, right.

177
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
I have one more box of these.

178
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
Take it and use it.

179
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Apply one sheet every day.

180
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
It's good for your skin.

181
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
Love you.

182
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
I want to see.

183
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
Yili,

184
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,060
you cooked?

185
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
It smells good.

186
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Oh, my soup!

187
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm so full.

188
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,060
No, no, no.

189
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,060
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,060
Boss,

191
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,060
this is the arrangement for next week's guest.

192
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
If you don't have any problems,

193
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
you can sign it.

194
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
I'll go to order some chicken wine.

195
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
Okay.

196
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
Boss, I'll take a call.

197
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,060
Go ahead.

198
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
I'll be there in two days.

199
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
Have you checked the resignation form I told you to check?

200
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
I've contacted them.

201
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
I'll go to the interview this afternoon.

202
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
Hurry up.

203
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,060
I'll return it to you.

204
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
It's not mine.

205
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,060
Mr. Li,

206
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
I'm here on behalf of M.H.

207
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
I have a few questions about the drug industry in Kuala Lumpur.

208
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
I want to confirm with you.

209
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
M.H.?

210
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,060
I've already resigned.

211
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
So,

212
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,060
you shouldn't ask me about Kuala Lumpur.

213
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
I know.

214
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,060
The process of your resignation in Kuala Lumpur is not pleasant.

215
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,060
It is said that they fired you.

216
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,060
You think it's all over?

217
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,060
There's no need to mention it again.

218
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,060
Although it's over,

219
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,060
I believe that this matter has not yet ended with your impact.

220
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,060
According to what I and Kuala Lumpur people know,

221
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,060
they say you have a stain on your job.

222
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
Is that true?

223
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,060
I found out that they have stains on their jobs.

224
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
How did it become me?

225
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,060
You found out about other people's stains,

226
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
but you were fired.

227
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
Forget it.

228
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Let's just do it this way.

229
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,060
I really don't want to cause trouble anymore.

230
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,060
Please go back.

231
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
If you're afraid of causing trouble,

232
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,060
you wouldn't have been fired.

233
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,060
I was fired because I wanted to stick to the right thing.

234
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
But is it useful to stick to the right thing?

235
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,060
Is it fair that I got this kind of return?

236
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Mr. Li, there are some costs that are worth paying.

237
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
Worth?

238
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Okay, then look at me now.

239
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,060
I can only eat and die in a credit company every day.

240
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,060
I manage a few companies.

241
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,060
I get zero salary every month.

242
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,060
My life now has no future, no hope, no future.

243
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
I live to make a living.

244
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
So you tell me,

245
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,060
is the price I pay worth it?

246
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

247
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
I really...

248
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Stop talking. Go away.

249
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
No, listen to me.

250
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,060
I'm not listening.

251
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,060
I'll say one last thing.

252
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
Say it.

253
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,060
If you decide to be a silent person today,

254
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,060
more people will become the next victim because of your silence.

255
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,060
I came here today because I believe that this might be a problem.

256
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
This is the best chance for you.

257
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
You're the only chance.

258
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,060
Are you done?

259
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,060
Wow, you came earlier than I did.

260
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,060
I came earlier?

261
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Such a gentleman.

262
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,060
He must be a responsible and strong man.

263
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,060
His face is so perfect.

264
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
And he's so professional.

265
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,060
He can work so hard without any supervision.

266
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,060
I must get his WeChat or phone number today.

267
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,060
But he thinks I'm annoying when I give him something.

268
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,060
Are you okay?

269
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,060
I'm okay.

270
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,060
This is your phone.

271
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,060
Let me help you with it.

272
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,060
It's a bit difficult to get a phone with a precise dial.

273
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
What if it's on the computer?

274
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
The cost is too high.

275
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
Boss, is the red bull gone?

276
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
Wait a minute. I'll get it for you.

277
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,060
I'll get it for you.

278
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,060
Hello, the red bull you asked for...

279
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
Hello?

280
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Where is he?

281
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
Wait a minute.

282
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,060
Hello, give it to me.

283
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Do I pay with my phone?

284
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,060
Thank you.

285
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
I can get him a change of cash.

286
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,060
If he doesn't have that much, I can get a better price.

287
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,060
Where's the money?

288
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
Why is my money gone?

289
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,060
Where is he?

290
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,060
I'm sorry. Did you see someone steal my money?

291
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
No.

292
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
But...

293
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,060
From this morning until now, you've left the counter three times.

294
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Two times were when my father wanted to get my attention.

295
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
The last time was when he went to get the red bull.

296
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
If the first two times were okay,

297
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,060
then this thief must have been the one who did it when you went to get the red bull.

298
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,060
That should be enough. I'll call the police first.

299
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
You want to call the police?

300
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,060
There's evidence in the police report.

301
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,060
There are four cameras in the store.

302
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
Do you know how to get the surveillance footage?

303
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,060
I know. There's a surveillance camera that can capture the sound system.

304
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
But I haven't been able to fix it.

305
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,060
I'll go take a look.

306
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
I'll go take a look.

307
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,060
The surveillance camera.

308
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,060
When you went to get the red bull,

309
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,060
it was less than three minutes ago, right?

310
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,060
The only person I have in mind is him.

311
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Yes, it's him.

312
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
He's the one who sent me here.

313
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
I'll call the police now.

314
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,060
If you want to get the money, come with me.

315
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,060
You mean...

316
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,060
You mean that Ke Lang's dad needs our help

317
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,060
to replace the current chairman, Deng Ke?

318
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,060
Three years ago, Deng Ke took over the company's assets.

319
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,060
Such a stain will eventually become a bomb.

320
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,060
This old fox is Ke Lang's second shareholder.

321
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,060
He's forcing us to take his side.

322
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
We also have Ke Lang's shares.

323
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060
If Deng Ke's stain is exposed,

324
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,060
it's a loss for us too.

325
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Does Deng Ke have any evidence?

326
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,060
He has evidence.

327
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
The evidence is still in the box.

328
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,060
The business is like a battlefield.

329
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
The battlefield is like a chess game.

330
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,060
If you play chess, you have to grab the first hand.

331
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,060
You should know how to handle Ke Lang's business.

332
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:31,060
You mean that at the meeting with the chairman tomorrow,

333
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,060
you'll force Deng Ke to step down?

334
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,060
It's indeed a good opportunity.

335
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,060
But will it be too tight?

336
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
The opportunity has come.

337
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
The battle is full.

338
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,060
You decide what to do.

339
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I know what to do.

340
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,060
I'll go.

341
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,060
How was your afternoon?

342
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
I'll talk to him later.

343
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,060
He's a bit impatient.

344
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,060
It seems that your work is not going well.

345
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
You have a meeting with Ke Lang tomorrow.

346
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,060
At this time, there's still a problem with the witness.

347
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,060
Congratulations.

348
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,060
You have two chances left.

349
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Now there's only one left.

350
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Wait.

351
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,060
President Yuan, Li Xiang will attend the meeting tomorrow.

352
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
The meeting is over.

353
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
This is him.

355
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,060
Hey, give me back my money.

356
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Are you crazy? Who took your money?

357
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,060
You're still pretending?

358
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,060
I'll give you three more seconds.

359
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
I'll call the police.

360
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
If you keep talking like that, I...

361
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,060
The camera and the police are connected.

362
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
We called the police when we came out.

363
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:47,060
The face recognition system can confirm your identity in 15 seconds.

364
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,060
And you, the clothes you stole just now,

365
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,060
you put them inside.

366
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,060
So if you insist on running,

367
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,060
I'll clean it up.

368
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,060
But how did you know he was a cleaner here?

369
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
I've seen him a few times.

370
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,060
Every Monday night, before your store closes,

371
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,060
he would come to buy a discounted sushi and bread.

372
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
The property here is actually quite strict.

373
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,060
If it's not the owner,

374
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
the unregistered tenant can't come in at will.

375
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,060
So I guess he must be a local employee.

376
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,060
So you're the owner here?

377
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
This is the most important question card.

378
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
It's rare to buy a room here.

379
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
Oh my god.

380
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,060
He's so handsome, so smart, and so caring.

381
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,060
He's a perfect boyfriend.

382
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
On behalf of MH, I have a new question.

383
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,060
To ensure that the purchase goes smoothly,

384
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,060
I suggest that we remove the position of Chairman Deng.

385
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,060
The purchase has been made so far,

386
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
and the price is going to be reduced.

387
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,060
This joke is a bit too big.

388
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Chairman Deng, three years ago,

389
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,060
you set up a security account and transferred your assets.

390
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,060
To avoid the risk of the future,

391
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
you have to resign.

392
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,060
It's all a trick.

393
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,060
How is that possible?

394
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,060
You can't just say it without evidence.

395
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
We found the ID.

396
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
The ID? Where is it?

397
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,060
He?

398
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,060
What right does he have to be the ID?

399
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
Of course you don't want me to be the ID.

400
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
Because I know so much about you.

401
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,060
Let me introduce myself.

402
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
My name is Li Xiang.

403
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,060
I used to be a volunteer at the financial department.

404
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Later, I found out that Deng Ke had some problems at work,

405
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,060
so I was fired.

406
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I'm Li Xiang.

407
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
I'm a lawyer.

408
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
I'm a lawyer.

409
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
I'm a lawyer.

410
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,060
You started with a wrong address.

411
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Wrong address?

412
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
That's what I am.

413
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:20,060
Indeed, there are wrong addresses in our company.

414
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
But who are they?

415
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
I can tell you,

416
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
among them,

417
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,060
there's also her husband.

418
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Why are you taking my husband's name?

419
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,060
I'm here today to talk about you.

420
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,980
Okay, let's talk about it.

421
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,140
He and his lover

422
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,500
were both in our company before.

423
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,140
That's right.

424
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,780
They were in the financial department.

425
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,260
But during the time of their employment,

426
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,940
they deliberately hid their relationship.

427
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,060
They were together to destroy the tickets.

428
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,540
That's why I fired them.

429
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,940
You came here today

430
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,740
to take revenge on me, right?

431
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,860
You can ask him if you want.

432
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,180
His lover is still in prison.

433
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,300
I'm not wrong.

434
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,980
He's the one who made the mistake, not me.

435
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,420
It has nothing to do with me.

436
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,300
Really?

437
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,340
I don't believe that you know nothing

438
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,620
about the two people who slept together.

439
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,020
Or...

440
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,020
He blamed you for his own fault

441
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,260
and did it for you.

442
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,700
You really have a good wife.

443
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,020
Let me tell you again.

444
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,100
He's the one who made the mistake.

445
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,460
It has nothing to do with me.

446
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,060
So, in order to get rid of the relationship,

447
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,900
you finally chose to divorce him.

448
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,980
This kind of person is a scumbag.

449
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,020
You also believe in this kind of person?

450
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,660
Then I really doubt

451
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,580
the ability of MH to do things.

452
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,460
I will tell you everything

453
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,860
that happened today

454
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
to your boss, Mr. Fan,

455
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,740
and I hope you can

456
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,860
give me a reasonable explanation.

457
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,100
You've already started the game.

458
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,660
There's no reason for the players

459
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,300
to quit the game on the way.

460
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,580
Right?

461
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,700
Yes.

462
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,500
How is Jiang Tian?

463
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,020
He hasn't come out for half an hour.

464
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,500
I think he's going to be fired this time.

465
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,660
He hasn't been in the office for less than a week.

466
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,700
This is also a record

467
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,420
that MH has created.

468
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,700
I think there's no one else.

469
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,700
I think this will be

470
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,260
a record that will be hard to break.

471
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:58,220
The chairman of Klan's

472
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,500
will be responsible for this.

473
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,380
You will be responsible?

474
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,780
How are you responsible?

475
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,900
Give me some time.

476
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,780
I will definitely be able to confirm

477
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,260
that Deng Ke has transferred assets.

478
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,780
I give you time.

479
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,900
Who will give me time?

480
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,900
Your best way to be responsible

481
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,420
is to put your resignation letter

482
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,260
on my desk.

483
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,180
You and I have been friends for many years.

484
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,180
You never let me down.

485
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,500
Today is the first time.

486
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,740
The battle hasn't ended yet.

487
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,100
Now you're saying who wins and who loses.

488
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,660
It's too early.

489
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,700
I heard that today's matter

490
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,540
was picked up by a new general.

491
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,260
He seems to be

492
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,620
a guarantee from Lin Tai Mo.

493
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,260
I know this person.

494
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,620
He will never be Lin Tai Mo's man.

495
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,620
Lin Tai Mo is best at rolling snowballs.

496
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,300
He can use a person

497
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,140
who is not at all suspicious

498
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,020
to make a small opportunity

499
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,300
a result that he can get.

500
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,700
There are too many such lessons.

501
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,500
I give you five days

502
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,740
to find Deng Ke's stain.

503
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,380
This should be no problem for you, right?

504
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,220
Two days.

505
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,540
Two days to give Mr. Fan

506
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,900
a satisfactory answer.

507
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,460
So the principle of the interview today

508
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,620
can be left to Yang Likai.

509
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
I heard that Yuan Shuai recently

510
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,380
made a big loss in the Deng Ke's love life.

511
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,820
Although Deng Ke is good at computing,

512
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,420
he shouldn't have pushed Yuan Shuai

513
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,820
to the point of losing.

514
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,540
It seems to be related to

515
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,180
a wish of Yuan Shuai's subordinate.

516
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,140
This intern

517
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,220
is looking for this person at a critical moment.

518
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,740
He is bothering them.

519
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,620
Intern?

520
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
Intern?

521
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
Intern?

522
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,140
Intern?

523
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Intern?

524
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,940
Intern shouldn't have

525
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,300
encountered such a case.

526
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,420
I am surprised.

527
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,540
This rule was set by Lin Taimo

528
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,500
and Fan Qichang

529
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,700
when I was still in MH

530
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,140
to break the trust.

531
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,860
But I didn't expect that after so long,

532
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,380
they still use

533
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,060
such a high-risk rule.

534
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,140
It seems that this intern

535
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,060
has a very close relationship with Yuan Shuai.

536
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,860
Otherwise,

537
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,700
how could it affect his judgment?

538
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,780
I am sure

539
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,620
that I won't do anything

540
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,980
after this game.

541
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,740
It seems that

542
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,780
is she called General?

543
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,060
By the way,

544
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,100
I just remembered

545
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,660
I have contacted that firm already.

546
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,180
I won't drive you to be back home soon.

547
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,540
Mm.

548
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,060
I mean,

549
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:18,020
You should know that women in the field of investment

550
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:27,940
are less than twenty percent less likely to fail.

551
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,580
Hello.

552
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,300
You shouldn't do it.

553
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,160
My paying is 20%!

554
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,100
Here's your money.

555
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,580
Get the car.

556
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,300
You can leave without listening to your boss.

557
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
You can leave after three times.

558
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
You can leave without listening to your boss.

559
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
When I was in Japan,

560
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
I visited a psychology master,

561
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Zuo Zhonghao.

562
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,300
I asked him,

563
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,300
when a person is about to cry,

564
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
is there any way to stop the tears quickly?

565
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
He told me,

566
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
he said if you feel like you're about to cry,

567
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
imagine yourself as a donkey,

568
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,300
and the tears will stop very quickly.

569
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,300
imagine yourself as a donkey, and the tears will stop very quickly.

570
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
Why?

571
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Donkeys are the animals that don't like to cry.

572
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
Because their faces are too long.

573
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
It's not funny at all.

574
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
It's not funny at all.

575
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
If you really want to cry, tell me.

576
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,300
I'll call an ambulance.

577
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
I finally made up my mind.

578
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
The only person who knows your true self,

579
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
is probably going to leave the M&M.

580
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,300
is probably going to leave the M&M.

581
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
Surrender is like a battlefield.

582
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
Now I understand.

583
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,300
The situation of the little ant being brought to the pan

584
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
is the situation of all the investors in the financial world.

585
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
I've never thought of crying so much.

586
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
I've never thought of crying so much.

587
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
You don't deserve to be a little ant.

588
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
You don't deserve to be a little ant.

589
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
The little ant will not give up.

590
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
It will keep going forward.

591
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,300
A car that has no feelings

592
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
will not understand the sadness of the little ant.

593
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,300
will not understand the sadness of the little ant.

594
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,300
General, I do want you to leave the M&M.

595
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
But it's definitely not leaving in the way of carrying the pot.

596
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
But it's definitely not leaving in the way of carrying the pot.

597
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
You remember,

598
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,300
I will not let anyone else go back to my place.

599
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Do you have new clues?

600
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
For now, retreat is not a failure.

601
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,300
For now, retreat is not a failure.

602
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
Little ant,

603
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
please keep going forward.

604
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
The battle has not ended yet.

605
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Don't worry.

606
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
I won't give up until the last moment.

607
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
Let me ask you.

608
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Why must you stay in the M&M?

609
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
Shuai Shuai,

610
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
do you think you know me well?

611
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,300
Of course I know you.

612
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
But that was before.

613
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
In my youth, you still lacked a period of time.

614
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
So you don't know what kind of people I met in these years.

615
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,300
So you don't know what kind of people I met in these years.

616
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,300
What kind of things happened.

617
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
You don't know why I must go to the M&M.

618
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
You don't know what kind of person I became.

619
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,300
You don't know why I must go to the M&M.

620
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Just like now,

621
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
you think I will suffer because of unfair treatment.

622
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,300
But I won't.

623
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,300
I will be depressed.

624
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,300
But I won't give up.

625
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
You are still staying in the past.

626
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Maybe,

627
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
you should try to know me again.

628
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
I love you.

629
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I need to go.

630
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,820
Miss.

631
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,020
Miss, why are you crying?

632
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,020
We don't want to cry.

633
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,020
I just hope you can be strong in this life.

634
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
Mom.

635
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Why did you leave me?

636
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
Mom.

637
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,020
Dad.

638
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
Did you see that?

639
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
I finally entered MH.

640
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
I became a leading investor.

641
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Don't worry, I'm strong now.

642
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,020
No matter how cruel this industry is,

643
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
I will try to hold on.

644
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,020
I love you, dad.

645
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,020
I love you.

646
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,020
I love you.

647
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
I love you.

648
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020
I love you.

649
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,020
I love you.

650
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
I love you.

651
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,020
I love you.

652
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,020
I love you.

653
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,020
I love you.

654
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,020
I love you.

655
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,020
I love you.

656
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,020
I love you.

657
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,020
I love you.

658
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,020
I love you.

659
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,020
I love you.

660
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,020
I love you.

661
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,020
I love you.

662
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,020
You walk so fast.

663
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,020
Can't catch your light.

664
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,020
You fly so high.

665
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,020
Leave all the things behind.

666
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,020
End our story.

667
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,020
Leave our love nowhere.

668
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,020
To find.

669
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,020
To find.
