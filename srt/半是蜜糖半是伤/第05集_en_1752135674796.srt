00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Episode 18

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,100
I didn't know

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
how helpless I was

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,100
at that time.

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,100
Luckily, my white hair

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,100
suddenly appeared in front of me.

25
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,100
I'm so happy.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
I feel excited

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
whenever I think about it.

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Hello, mom.

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Junjun, how's your work?

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,100
Is it going well?

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,100
It's going well.

32
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
The colleagues are very friendly.

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Everything is fine.

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
That's good.

35
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
Junjun, let me tell you.

36
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Don't cry

37
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
when you're wronged.

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
You have to tell me,

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
okay?

40
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Or you can find a boyfriend.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
I can't take care of you.

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
I'm worried about you.

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,100
Okay, mom.

44
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Don't worry.

45
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
I'll do it.

46
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Okay.

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
I won't urge you.

48
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
Junjun,

49
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
let me tell you.

50
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
You're alone in Shanghai.

51
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
No one is by your side.

52
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
You must be careful.

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,100
Okay?

54
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Take care of yourself.

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
I'll visit you when I get off work.

56
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Bye.

57
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Bye.

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,100
I'll call you.

59
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
Junjun,

60
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,100
how about

61
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
we find another job?

62
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
I can support you.

63
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,100
I can even support you with instant noodles.

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Junjun.

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Okay.

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Anyway,

67
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
you don't like the devil.

68
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
It's a good thing

69
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
that you left him.

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
You should change your perspective.

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Right?

72
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Stop it.

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Don't look at him.

74
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
You need to be full

75
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
to have the strength

76
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
to fight with others.

77
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
I'll wait for you at the back.

78
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,100
If you treat MH

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
as a online game,

80
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
how many episodes are there now?

81
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
I'm about to be kicked out of the newbie village.

82
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Oh.

83
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,100
It seems that

84
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
you need a newbie tutor.

85
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
You're not talented.

86
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Although you're not the best in the industry,

87
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
you're at least a good supervisor.

88
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
I wonder if you have the chance

89
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,100
to become your newbie tutor.

90
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Anyway,

91
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't have a plan now.

92
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Even if I have a chance,

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
I have to try it.

94
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Master is here.

95
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Please accept the disciple's bow.

96
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
It's too insincere to

97
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
stand in front of the phone.

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
Great.

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
I haven't eaten yet.

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
How about

101
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
having a meal with me?

102
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
The noodles are here.

103
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Lily,

104
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
you eat it yourself.

105
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I need to go out.

106
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Don't wait for me.

107
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
You eat it first.

108
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
You can leave.

109
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
It's so late.

110
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Where can I go alone?

111
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,100
You're a girl.

112
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
Why are you going out alone at this time?

113
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Will it be too dangerous

114
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
to care about her?

115
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
Are you going out alone

116
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
to assassinate Deng Ke at this time?

117
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
It's a good idea.

118
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
But it seems to be too expensive.

119
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
Don't worry.

120
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
If I want to assassinate,

121
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
you will be the first target.

122
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Not others.

123
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Then you should be careful.

124
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Come back alive.

125
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
I'll wait for you to return to the mirror.

126
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
I'll wait for you to return to the mirror.

127
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
I'll wait for you to return to the mirror.

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Xia Yuan,

129
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
I just can't wait to see you again.

130
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Pei, Pei, Pei.

131
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Hello.

132
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Thank you.

133
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
Mr. Tu,

134
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
shall we change another place?

135
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,100
I always feel that

136
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,100
this place

137
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
is not quite suitable

138
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
for your identity.

139
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,060
while you're eating.

140
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,780
Since you can eat,

141
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,140
why do you have to separate the high and low?

142
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,500
It smells good.

143
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,500
Okay.

144
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,580
Whether you can learn

145
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,380
the essence of Dao Wulin today,

146
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,620
I'm very grateful to you

147
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,500
for helping me

148
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,140
at the critical time.

149
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,620
I'm here to say goodbye.

150
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,460
Alcohol will affect one's judgment.

151
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,620
Besides,

152
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm not the best teacher.

153
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,900
What's the situation

154
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,580
you've been talking about recently?

155
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,380
The little ants are in great danger.

156
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,340
They can still be transformed.

157
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Is it related to

158
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,220
the contract with Klan?

159
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,140
You know?

160
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,580
They've been moving

161
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,380
quite a lot recently.

162
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
It's about the acquisition

163
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,940
and the joint board meeting.

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,180
I heard about it.

165
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,860
I thought I was in control of the situation.

166
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,460
I didn't expect to find a team.

167
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,700
What team?

168
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,420
Simply put,

169
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,260
it's our suspicion

170
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
that there's a stain

171
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,340
on a senior in Klan.

172
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,060
I didn't expect the witness we found

173
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,700
to drop the chain at the critical time.

174
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,100
As a result,

175
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,580
we were directly killed.

176
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,580
The person who dropped the chain at the critical time

177
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,500
still has important evidence in his hand?

178
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,140
You mean

179
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,060
he did it on purpose?

180
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,620
Deng is a good calculator

181
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
and a good person.

182
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,540
A boss like him

183
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,380
is unlikely to exist.

184
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,860
What do you mean?

185
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,340
You have to remember.

186
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,380
No matter what company it is,

187
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,220
in the face of great interests,

188
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,260
they will be the first

189
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,220
or subconscious

190
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,580
to cover their shortcomings

191
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,460
and find peace.

192
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,140
You want to find out the truth about them.

193
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,340
You can't just look at the material they gave you.

194
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,860
The material can be fake and be false.

195
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,500
But the background and data

196
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,780
are still possible to find.

197
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,740
You're right.

198
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,700
This is not that simple.

199
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,300
Hello, ma'am.

200
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,340
This is the anniversary of our store.

201
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,180
Every lady will get this gift.

202
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,100
Please accept it.

203
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,380
Thank you.

204
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,420
Please express your gratitude to your boss for me.

205
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,140
Okay.

206
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,140
There's such a good thing?

207
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,540
Look, mom.

208
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,180
Your good luck is coming.

209
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,940
Na na na na.

210
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,700
Na na na...

211
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,160
Someone who is determinant

212
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,200
and date with other men.

213
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,720
Don't forget your good luck.

214
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,360
Thank you.

215
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
She even sent flowers.

216
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,920
Drive safe.

217
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,920
Good, General.

218
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,400
You said you wanted me to know you again.

219
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,240
Is that how you want me to know you again?

220
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,680
Fine.

221
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,920
Wait for me.

222
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
How can I know you again?

223
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,680
People are better than people.

224
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,160
They're both good at it.

225
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
Why are they so different?

226
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,280
I heard that

227
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,440
you found a chicken restaurant

228
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,240
after you left my place.

229
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,960
That kind of company

230
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,720
is just a place to hang out.

231
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,720
It's not worth much.

232
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,320
Mr. Deng,

233
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,680
you asked me here

234
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,760
to humiliate me, right?

235
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,480
Humiliate you?

236
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,360
Humiliate you?

237
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
Do you deserve it?

238
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,360
You're in need of money, right?

239
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,760
500,000.

240
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
I'll give you 500,000.

241
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,960
Do me a favor.

242
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,640
Who is it?

243
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,760
Why are you here?

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,160
What are you doing?

245
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,760
Did I ask you to come in?

246
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,840
You're still in the mood to drink?

247
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,920
You're in a good mood.

248
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,160
I think you were really bought by Deng Ke.

249
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,040
Nonsense.

250
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,080
Deng Ke is my biggest enemy.

251
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,880
How could I let him buy me?

252
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,160
You can even let your wife down.

253
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,600
Of course you can be bought by your enemy.

254
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,920
Listen,

255
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,000
this is my house.

256
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,920
You're not welcome here.

257
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,720
Leave now.

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,800
If you don't leave,

259
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,840
I'll call the police.

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,840
Do you understand?

261
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
You haven't read these books for a long time, right?

262
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,840
Your faith is growing.

263
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,400
Your passion for the past is stinking.

264
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,480
I checked your bank account.

265
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
After the board meeting,

266
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
there was a 500,000

267
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
extra payment on your account.

268
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,920
Do you want to tell me

269
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,560
that Deng Ke found out

270
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,120
and gave you a compensation?

271
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
You think

272
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,720
you're too low-class

273
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,120
to be bought by your enemy?

274
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
How's it going?

275
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,120
Are you okay?

276
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,120
How long is your relationship with Ye grand questioning?

277
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,040
I'm going to see them our.

278
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
Now go and get in.

279
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,200
Go.

280
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,440
You're going to see me?

281
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,320
Vampire first.

282
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,420
Vampires are

283
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,140
good for nothing.

284
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,320
What you do is killing me.

285
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,360
No.

286
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,320
Absolutely no.

287
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,120
Deng has my hint.

288
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,520
Sure.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,880
You think I have no hint?

290
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,640
I'll give you three comeback times.

291
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,920
I am al Europe.

292
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,160
Wait!

293
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,800
I didn't expect

294
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
there would be an other girl.

295
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
metre

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,080
put

297
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
Zinzhen, are you crazy

298
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,460
Zinzhen

299
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,500
Zinzhen

300
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,420
JinZhen

301
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
You... You didn't sleep all night, did you?

302
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Are you crazy?

303
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Is it worth working all night?

304
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
And you're still a part-time employee.

305
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
If you want to work, you don't want to die.

306
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Do you know that many people will be jealous if they stay up all night?

307
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Open your Weibo and check it out.

308
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,160
It's him! It's him!

309
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
It's him! I finally found him!

310
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
I love you, my baby. I'm going to work.

311
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I love you, my baby. I'm going to work.

312
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Zhan Jun, I'm so sorry.

313
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
I thought you were going to resign.

314
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
We did a great job for you.

315
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Ke Lang sent someone to sign an agreement this afternoon.

316
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Otherwise, they will contact the people in the memory.

317
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,160
President Qiao asked us to get Ke Lang's information out as soon as possible.

318
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Since you're here, please help us collect the trash in the storage.

319
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
What did you say?

320
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I said since you're here, please...

321
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
No, the last sentence.

322
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Ke Lang asked to sign an agreement this afternoon.

323
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
This afternoon?

324
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,160
We just had a meeting yesterday and we're going to work together today?

325
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Do you know that?

326
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
How would I know if President Yuan doesn't know?

327
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I only know that this is President Qiao's order.

328
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Zhan Jun, I'm being strict.

329
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
It's because you got the meeting,

330
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
we three will be caught doing things that belong to you.

331
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
My mentor in Stanford once said

332
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
that we should face every challenge bravely.

333
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
We shouldn't find any excuses.

334
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
You're right.

335
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,160
If someone is assigned a task because of a temporary job,

336
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,160
and he or she is not qualified to stay in MH,

337
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
then he or she is not qualified to

338
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
be in MH.

339
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,160
President Yuan, I will do my best to complete this new challenge.

340
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,960
PMH

341
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Wen Shuang.

342
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
They're telling the truth, did Ke Lang show up in下午去道 To have an agreement?

343
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Yes.

344
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
But I already found the person involved yesterday.

345
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Li Qiang is a liar.

346
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
He is the only person from East hills,

347
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
he worked behind in 人事 by standing in someone's way and

348
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
he didn't discharge Treasurerら

349
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,440
He has already resigned.

350
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,520
Now he works at another accountant's office.

351
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,880
Isn't it too stupid?

352
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
I thought you were just a person

353
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,440
who would take flowers in the middle of the night

354
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,560
and go out to have fun.

355
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,880
I didn't know you were a liar.

356
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,760
You knew it?

357
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,480
Deng Ke will sign the contract at 2.30 pm.

358
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,400
What you have to do

359
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,240
is to stop him before I come back.

360
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,560
How can I stop him?

361
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,200
That's your problem.

362
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,840
No.

363
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,680
I...

364
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Why hasn't he come back yet?

365
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,000
The people who are going to Kola will sign the contract

366
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,440
and take out the contract.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,240
Mr. Deng, this way, please.

368
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,680
I'll send him to the meeting room.

369
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,800
Deng Ke came in advance.

370
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,840
What's the situation?

371
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,880
How long will it take?

372
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,800
Li He.

373
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,000
I told you

374
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,080
I don't want to get involved in this.

375
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,800
You and I are no match for each other.

376
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,640
A hot-blooded person

377
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,840
who uses a brake.

378
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
A person who pursues extreme speed

379
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,800
shouldn't leave like this.

380
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,560
Although you found a new job

381
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,960
after you resigned from Kola,

382
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,120
your treatment is not as good as before.

383
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,560
Why don't we have a match?

384
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,680
If you lose,

385
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,480
you'll go back to the office with me.

386
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,400
If you win,

387
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll help you to get back to Kola.

388
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,080
You are

389
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,000
a bit interesting.

390
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,520
Do you want to have a match?

391
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,160
I admit defeat.

392
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,360
Let's go.

00:20:33,120 --> 00:21:03,120

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
it doesn't matter

It's urgent.

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,240
The offer is not режим!

408
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,320
How did she get the offer?

409
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,880
Ms. Yuan NSD said

410
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
we can't fall down

411
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,840
but get up right away.

412
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,280
Mr. Fan,

413
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,440
you're a big aspect in MH.

414
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,440
is to let him know more about his mistakes.

415
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,960
Dating

416
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,960

No need

419
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,800
I am used to

420
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,480
Two hands ready

421
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,280
Ms.utech.

422
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,620
I'll just tell you soldiers andいいise.

423
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,440
These are perfusely inspected photos.

424
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,240
Lin He is the enthusiastic former worker.

425
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,760
He is the real lover.

426
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,100
He knows the evidence of Deng's operation

427
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,980
3 years ago before he myselfressive insurance.

428
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,400
His healthy joint fillcks?

429
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,480
Miss Jiang seems not to know her mistake.

430
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,080
can be a good person.

431
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,080
Mr. Fan,

432
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,160
I can hope

433
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,920
that I won't save you last time.

434
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,880
But your employees

435
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,160
are slandering me again and again.

436
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,240
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

437
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,320
Mr. Fan,

438
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm sorry.

439
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,960
I'm not a good manager.

440
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,280
Su Chang,

441
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,160
ask him out first.

442
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,280
Tell the administration

443
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,920
to take him to the resignation process.

444
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,880
At the same time,

445
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,680
the company has the right to pursue him.

446
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,480
Mr. Fan,

447
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
I'm sorry.

448
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,720
I'm sorry.

449
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
I'm sorry.

450
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I'm sorry.

451
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
I'm sorry.

452
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
I'm sorry.

453
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm sorry.

455
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,200
If you don't go out,

456
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,920
I'll call the security.

457
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,440
You're not the one to leave.

458
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,440
I'm sorry.

459
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm sorry.

460
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm sorry.

462
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm sorry.

463
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,120
I'm sorry.

464
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,120
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,280
I'm sorry.

467
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,360
Mr. Deng,

468
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,520
the collaboration between M&H and Klan Pharmaceutical

469
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,120
should be established based on mutual recognition,

470
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,080
isn't it?

471
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
But Klan Pharmaceutical

472
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,920
has been faking for a while,

473
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,120
You want to prove it?

474
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,600
Sorry, Mr. Deng.

475
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,880
I've sent the evidence and information

476
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,160
to the board of directors of Ke Lang.

477
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,040
Everything you did

478
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,160
will prove the truth.

479
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,240
It's a pity that

480
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
the signing of the contract this afternoon

481
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,600
can only be cancelled.

482
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,880
And the follow-up question is

483
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,920
whether MH will continue to work with Ke Lang.

484
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,200
It depends on whether you

485
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,360
will still sit on the position of

486
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,920
the chairman of the board of directors.

487
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,640
We need to work together to find the leads.

488
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,880
Be on strike!

489
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,080
Be on strike!

490
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,680
Okay.

491
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,720
Lin Ke!

492
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
I'm sorry.

495
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Thank you.

497
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
So vulgar?

498
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,480
How is it vulgar?

499
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Isn't this your favorite novel?

500
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,960
Well, thank you.

501
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm going to die this time.

502
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
How is it? Is it good?

503
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
You came to MH just for a trip.

504
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,840
Of course I want to show you the scenery.

505
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So you won't regret leaving.

506
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Since you think I'm a tourist, why are you still helping me?

507
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,000
You think I'm helping you?

508
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,640
I haven't lost in the first round.

509
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,120
Of course I can't ruin my reputation because of Deng Ke.

510
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
What are you looking at?

511
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,640
Anyway, thank you for taking me to this class.

512
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,640
And I'll stay even if I see the scenery.

513
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,040
You seem to be colder than I thought.

514
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,120
You seem to be stronger than I thought.

515
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
I'm not a bad person.

516
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

517
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
You can choose the place.

518
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
What do you want to eat?

519
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
I just sent it to you.

520
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Michelin!

521
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
What the hell?

522
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
You're lying.

523
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,800
A Michelin restaurant with a self-sufficient stopwatch.

524
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,800
The customers who consider group shopping are destined not to be their target audience.

525
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Like you.

526
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,760
It seems that this restaurant is the target audience of the people of Boxue.

527
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Yes.

528
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Don't you know that I've always been happy with Boxue?

529
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm not as cold as your husband.

530
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,760
He only sends flowers to Yidu.

531
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Whose husband?

532
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
The one who sent you home last night.

533
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
I saw it.

534
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Congratulations.

535
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Come on.

536
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
If you say you're cold, who can compare with you?

537
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,600
When did I ever be cold?

538
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Yes.

539
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
In the first half of my third grade,

540
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
you asked Cui Le Le to marry you in front of all of our class.

541
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Do you forget that?

542
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Cui Le Le?

543
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes.

544
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Who?

545
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Our little fat girl's parents are a tuxedo shop.

546
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,800
You asked her to marry you just to eat the half-cooked pig's trotters in the pack.

547
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,720
What a pity.

548
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Did you eat the half-cooked pig's trotter?

549
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,000
Yes.

550
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,280
You've made it.

551
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,560
You both bit the pig's trotter and the old man.

552
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,480
You both have a mouthful of it.

553
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
It's so funny.

554
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,520
You remember it so clearly.

555
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes, I do.

556
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,480
I don't remember anything.

557
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,160
You're defaming my company.

558
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
I'll sue you for slander.

559
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,200
You ruined it.

560
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,720
I've been scolding you in the office.

561
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,040
I haven't had time to understand your personal situation.

562
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,200
Are you going to have a second child?

563
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,400
I'm single.

564
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,720
Stop talking nonsense.

565
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Your ex-wife is doing very well, right?

566
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,600
Is her new husband

567
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,280
a million times better than you?

568
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,640
I'm sorry.

569
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I'm single like you.

570
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
I understand.

571
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,200
I'm a petty husband.

572
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,320
I'm a playboy.

573
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,040
You're right.

574
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,160
This is the way Shanghai is.

575
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
It's a beautiful city.

576
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
Every girl is beautiful.

577
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,760
I'm not good at playing the piano.

578
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,600
Take your time.

579
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,040
Qin Jiping, Li Qilin.

580
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,280
I'm sorry.

581
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,760
I didn't mean to hurt your eyes.

582
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,440
Let's go.

583
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,760
Here you are.

584
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,960
What's this?

585
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
The most expensive cold noodles.

586
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,360
He bought it.

587
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,080
116 yuan.

588
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
It's from an old customer. It's 110 yuan.

589
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,520
Turn it over and scan it.

590
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,880
Okay.

591
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,600
Okay.

592
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,560
Wait a moment.

593
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,960
Are you going to

594
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,600
go to the next round?

595
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,320
You're still thinking about Qin Jiping?

596
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,520
Let's go.

597
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,360
We still have time.

598
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,360
This is it.

599
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,320
This is good.

600
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,320
It's good for your health.

601
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,040
It's expensive.

602
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,040
Take a look.

603
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,040
Here's the expensive cold noodles.

604
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Here you are.

605
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,760
Thank you.

606
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,880
Enjoy your meal.

607
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,640
Thank you.

608
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Thank you.

609
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,680
Enjoy your meal.

610
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,920
Try it.

611
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,120
How is it?

612
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,800
You wanted to eat Chinese food

613
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,320
when you were abroad.

614
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,600
You learned to cook by yourself.

615
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,320
You can still do it

616
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,360
in the future.

617
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,480
But you still remember

618
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,880
what your father cooked.

619
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,680
I tried it many times.

620
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,760
But I couldn't do it well.

621
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,200
After returning to China,

622
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,280
I found this restaurant

623
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,160
and thought it tasted good.

624
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,400
Although it's not as good as

625
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,880
what my uncle cooked,

626
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,960
I think it's already very rare.

627
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,080
So I brought you here to try it.

628
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,880
My dad always calls you to come home for dinner.

629
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,280
He wants you to take care of me.

630
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,920
Who knows you eat very well.

631
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,160
You're bullying me in school.

632
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,920
You helped me in the class.

633
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,640
You really want me to see the scenery.

634
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,400
You want to hear the truth or the lie?

635
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I want to hear the truth.

636
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,360
I want to apologize to you.

637
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,400
I owe you

638
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,360
a word of apology.

639
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,160
You dare to listen to the speech?

640
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,520
I almost died.

641
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,760
You're so mean.

642
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,080
I know that the speech

643
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,000
has caused serious consequences.

644
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,840
But that's not my original intention.

645
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,600
Okay.

646
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,920
Tell me

647
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,120
what your original intention is.

648
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,520
I wanted to take the love letter.

649
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,560
Who knew you would put the love letter

650
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,200
and the speech together?

651
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
Love letter?

652
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,080
Why do you take my love letter?

653
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,040
Mom.

654
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,240
Mom.

655
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,240
Son.

656
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,280
Your visa has been moved.

657
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,920
I booked the flight to the next day.

658
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Mom, I don't want to go to study abroad.

659
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,880
It's not a matter of your will.

660
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,480
Let's stop

661
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,760
the mess, okay?

662
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,040
Drink the milk.

663
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,040
Okay, I'll go to work.

664
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,960
Mom.

665
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,360
Little crybaby.

666
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,000
Hello.

667
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm your brother, Yuanyuan.

668
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,320
Although

669
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
you only called me that once,

670
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
I really like

671
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,040
your calling me that.

672
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,400
When you see this letter,

673
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,440
I'm going to study abroad.

674
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,360
I don't know when I can come back.

675
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,320
Don't miss me too much.

676
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,880
If you really miss me,

677
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,560
call me.

678
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,600
What's the matter, Tao Xue?

679
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,640
I...

680
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,120
I...

681
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,240
Your shoelace is untied.

682
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,920
Just say it if you like it.

683
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,720
He's the host of the school's lecture competition.

684
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,280
You can take the chance to register

685
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
and write a love letter to him.

686
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,120
Write a love letter?

687
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,000
Who gave you this understanding?

688
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,280
We're all fine with this now.

689
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,960
I won't mind this anymore.

690
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,080
Go home if you're not going.

691
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Sure, I'll go home.

692
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,880
I still need him,

693
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,200
unless I can treat him enough.

694
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,840
What's up?

695
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,480
All the cutlery and embroideries

696
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:55,920
is gone.

697
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,200
It's gone.

698
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,320
My work filter machine

699
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,120
is underneath it.

700
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,240
The first candidate

701
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,040
from Class 1, Class 3,

702
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,000
Ms. Jiang Zhiyuan...

703
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,120
It's fine.

704
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,440
Come on, give me something.

705
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,120
Mr. Yu.

706
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,760
Come on, drive the car.

707
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,080
Excuse me,

708
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
The topic of today's lecture is

709
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
My Chinese heart

710
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Chang... Changchen

711
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Jun... Junlong

712
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
He is

713
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Can you do it?

714
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Yes, if you can't talk, just go down

715
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Don't waste everyone's time

716
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Go down, go down

717
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Come down and bow

718
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Be careful

719
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Bow

720
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Bow

721
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
World Village

722
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
Today,ata big plan

723
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,020
再來

724
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,740
please

725
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,680
Miss Jiang QUESTION

726
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,400
What is it?

727
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,080
You...

728
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,280
Are you okay?

729
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,300
Has someone taken it from you?

730
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,180
No use!

731
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,220
What do you want from me?!

732
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,660
General!

733
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,600
General!

734
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,300
General!

735
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,000
Don't cry.

736
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,260
Yourvadantσε is信 correspondent.

737
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,420
Look.

738
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,700
Your eye drops are here.

739
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,580
You lost them.

740
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,780
Look.

741
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,900
It's you.

742
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,180
Wake up, General.

743
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,540
General.

744
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,700
General.

745
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,740
General.

746
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,620
Enough.

747
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,220
Stop crying.

748
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,180
I told you, mom.

749
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,100
If Jun Jun wakes up,

750
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,900
he'll be so sad when he sees this.

751
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,860
You know he can't cry.

752
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,300
Jun Jun is so poor.

753
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,380
He doesn't know who he offended at school.

754
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,620
Why did he steal his speech?

755
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,860
Maybe

756
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,140
it's a prank between classmates.

757
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,980
It can't be.

758
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,300
Don't you know Jun Jun's condition is special?

759
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,700
Yes.

760
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,980
It's already like this.

761
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,540
Don't be sad.

762
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,660
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

763
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,860
You're welcome.

764
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,380
What did the doctor say?

765
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,700
He said it's okay.

766
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,620
He's fine.

767
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,340
But you must be careful.

768
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,580
It'll be very dangerous if it keeps happening.

769
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,860
Thanks to the classmate who sent Jun Jun to the hospital.

770
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,820
Jun Jun.

771
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,980
You're awake.

772
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,940
Dad.

773
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,180
I want to transfer.

774
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,180
That's good.

775
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,100
I'll contact the school that suits you later.

776
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,660
It's not so stressful

777
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,500
to change the environment.

778
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,360
Thank you, dad.

779
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,740
Our company researchers

780
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,140
is looking forward to this passage'll take even a little bit of time.

781
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,060
Do it.

782
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,100
Mr. Dingmin is stupid.

783
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,420
His dad forcefully rejected it.

784
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,300
That's so sad.

785
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,260
Don'tengage him too hard.

786
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,100
Thank you, dad.

787
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,100
Thanks.

788
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,500
I'm going to be late. I'll go first.

789
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,460
Yuan Shuai.

790
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,900
It's too late.

791
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,140
Hurry up. Get in the car.

792
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,740
Try to understand.

793
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,940
Try to say goodbye a thousand times.

794
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,420
You can tell me lies.

795
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,620
You can make me cry. You know why.

796
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,660
Never been so brave.

797
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,380
I will run away.

798
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,220
If it's what you want, what you like, I don't mind.

799
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,100
I can close my eyes.

800
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,100
I can stay behind with my time.

801
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
Walk into your plan.

802
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:09,100
Like I never knew you were not mine.

803
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,100
Make you satisfied.

804
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,100
Wear another mask.

805
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:23,100
You never realize things I do for love.

806
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,100
I think I'm tired.

807
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,100
I think I'm blind.

808
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,100
Don't know how to feel.

809
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Don't know how to heal.

810
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,100
You walk so fast.

811
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,100
Can't catch your light.

812
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,100
You fly so high.

813
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,100
Leave all the things behind.

814
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,100
And our story.

815
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Leave all of nowhere to find.

816
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,100
I think I'm tired.

817
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,100
I think I'm blind.

818
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,100
Don't know how to feel.

819
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,100
Don't know how to heal.

820
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,100
You walk so fast.

821
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,100
Can't catch your light.

822
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,100
You fly so high.

823
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,100
Leave all the things behind.

824
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
And our story.

825
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Leave all of nowhere to find.
