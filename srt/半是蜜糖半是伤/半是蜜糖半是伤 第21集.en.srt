In fact,

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,120
the two of us could be

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,720
in any kind of relationship.

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,680
But not this one.

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,360
Why?

10
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
Because you are

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
always a sister to me.

12
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,090
I don’t just want to be your sister!

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,640
Can’t you feel it?

14
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
For all these years,

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,960
I’ve always been with you and protecting you.

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,200
Everything I’ve done is for you!

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,120
No one would love you

18
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,730
more than I do in this world!

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,680
Don’t reject me again, okay?

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,480
Don’t be so cruel to me.

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,079
I’ll say yes to whatever you want.

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,079
I can change the things

23
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,410
you don’t like about me.

24
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
I know I’m stubborn and bossy,

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
but I can change for you!

26
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
As long as you don’t leave me!

27
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Don’t leave me.

28
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,360
Sister.

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,120
I have someone I like.

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
She gave me hope to start over.

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,000
What hope?

32
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,040
I can’t give you such hope?

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,480
You can’t.

34
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,960
Miss Du.

35
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,730

Sorry.

Give me!

55
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,240
Now, tell us.

56
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,040
What are you doing here tonight?

57
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
I’m just here

58
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400

61
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,880
But when I was about to knock the door,

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,520
I saw…

63
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,280
Shut up!

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,720
Delete the video you took.

65
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,560
Delete it!

66
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
I can’t.

67
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,120
Do it!

68
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
So you are here for an interview.

69
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,760
How can we help you with that?

70
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,140
It’s very easy.

71
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
You just need

72
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
to answer some simple questions.

73
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,120
But,

74
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
you’ve got

75
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,760
to be honest.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
You can’t lie.

77
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,940
Okay, Brother?

78
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,050
Go ahead.

79
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,730
Alright.

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,120
Let’s get it started.

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,890
The first question.

82
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Why did you two stop

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,000
using West World?

84
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Wait! You don’t have to answer this.

85
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
Because you two have

86
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,120
been matched up successfully.

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,400
It means my data are quite accurate.

88
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,330
I’ll delete this question.

89
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
The second one. Hurry!

90
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Okay, the second question.

91
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,520
When did you start

92
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,480
having feelings for each other?

93
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,600
I… It’s just…

94
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,440
It’s just happened recently.

95
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,100
He’s lying!

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,650
He’s been into me for over 10 years.

97
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,560
How… How did you know?

98
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,720
“Before I go, I want to tell you a secret.

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,440
A secret that only a silly girl like you

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,560
can’t find out.

101
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,520
I’ve always had a crush on you.”

102
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,960
Sorry.

103
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,170
I found your treasure box by accident.

104
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,810
What about you then?

105
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,240
When did you have feelings for me?

106
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,440
Just… Just recently.

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,290
I’m not sure.

108
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,480
Now, next question.

109
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,160
Are you planning

110
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,520
on taking your relationship

111
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,160
to the next level?

112
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,909
What’s the next level?

113
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,120
You know.

114
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,000
You’re going to…

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,720
Stop it!

116
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,600
Stop asking.

117
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,309
It’s time for us to sleep.

118
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Just… Get out.

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
Shut up!

120
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,880
I haven’t finished yet!

121
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,610
Stop asking!

122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,500
What do you…

123
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,960
Just get out!

124
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,120
Get out!

125
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,200
Please… Give me more time next time!

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
There’s no next time!

127
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,240
Out!

128
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,560
Get out, now.

129
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,760
And delete the video you took.

130
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,920
Got it?

131
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,120
Delete it!

132
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,700
I won’t!

133
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Li Xiaochuan!

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
You punk!

135
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,080
What’s the next level?

136
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,740
Do you wanna know about it?

137
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Kinda!

138
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,760
May I?

139
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,400
Don’t leave me ever again!

140
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,000
We’ve kissed.

141
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,040
No one can leave.

142
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,880
Morning.

143
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Did you sleep well?

144
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,520
Very well.

145
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,240
You?

146
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,280
Not bad.

147
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,880
Good.

148
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Go freshen up.

149
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
I’ll cook breakfast.

150
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,480
Okay.

151
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
I’ll be out soon.

152
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,680
We are just having breakfast.

153
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,480
Why are you all

154
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,000
dressed up?

155
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,040
It shows a woman’s taste in fashion.

156
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,420
You don’t understand.

157
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,600
Let me take care of it.

158
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,780
You wanna cook breakfast?

159
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,840
Okay.

160
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,370
Then I’ll wait for the first

161
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,920
breakfast you cook for us.

162
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,090
Go ahead.

163
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,760
I was going to cook for you.

164
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,600
But turns out it was the other way round.

165
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you, Yuan.

166
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,330
Have a taste.

167
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,650
How is it?

168
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,320
To be honest,

169
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,680
I do like your cooking.

170
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,120
Of course!

171
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,040
As long as you like it.

172
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,280
Dig in.

173
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Then please try the milk

174
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,440
I heated up for you in person.

175
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,610
How is it?

176
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,620
Doesn’t it also taste fantastic?

177
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,240
The microwave did a good job.

178
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,200
Cheers!

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,000
Cheers!

180
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,580
I’ll cook you breakfast every day in the future.

181
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
Morning, Mr. Yuan.

182
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,850
Morning.

183
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,220
Morning, Mr. Yuan.

184
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,080
Chen Yicheng.

185
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,320
Your suit

186
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
is quite nice today! Very handsome!

187
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,280
Especially your tie. Look!

188
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,410
It’s the highlight.

189
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,760
Nice!

190
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,160
Keep it up!

191
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,730
Thank you, Mr. Yuan!

192
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,260
Morning, Mr. Yuan!

193
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,320
Shen Xin, the color

194
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,640
of your lip gloss is so pretty! Is it new?

195
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,920
A friend of mine helped me
to get this maple color.

196
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,180
Good choice, isn’t it?

197
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,600
It’s perfect for you!

198
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,060
Really?

199
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,240
Keep using it!

200
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,600
I will!

201
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,960
Jiang Jun.

202
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,820
Morning, Mr. Yuan.

203
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,610
You look good today.

204
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
I bet you slept very well last night.

205
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,560
Thank you for asking, Mr. Yuan.

206
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,760
I did sleep very well.

207
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,770
Hope you’ll sleep well again tonight.

208
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Go to your office!

209
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,240
Even the air is fresher today.

210
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,720
It’s going to be a perfect day.

211
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,349
Boss.

212
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,280
Kelang just gave us some new documents.

213
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,520
I need you to sign it.

214
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,640
Sure.

215
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,020
One more thing.

216
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,640
You know that Xinxin is visiting.

217
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,040
I want to take a few days off to be her company.

218
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Of course!

219
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,880
You should spend more time with her.

220
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,400
Boss,

221
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,280
I mean I wanna take my annual leave.

222
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,000
What else could it be?

223
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,120
Just go submit your application later.

224
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,650
Go ahead.

225
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,240
Enjoy yourself.

226
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,840
OMG!

227
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,120
Is this really Yuan Shuai?

228
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,180
Could it be that there’s a breakthrough
in your relationship?

229
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,760
I just knew it!

230
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
After living together

231
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
for so long,

232
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,600
something’s gotta happen sooner or later.

233
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,360
Cut it out!

234
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
I said nothing.

235
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,460
It’s all your assumption.

236
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,480
Boss.

237
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,280
Am I of a great help to you this time?

238
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
You owe me one!

239
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,320
Su Chang.

240
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,360
Do you still want to take your annual leave?

241
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,320
Is it nice to stay in 701?

242
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,280
I do have Xinxin’s phone number.

243
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,760
Boss! Boss!

244
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,930
Don’t forget there’s a meeting later.

245
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,720
I know.

246
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,050
I’m leaving.

247
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,280
You look so happy today.

248
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,260
Anything you wanna share with me?

249
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,240
Nothing special. It’s just the good weather.

250
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,570
It puts me in a good mood.

251
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
It’s okay if you don’t wanna tell me.

252
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,840
Petty!

253
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,090
Mr. Yuan.

254
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,800
Mr. Yuan.

255
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,840
Hi.

256
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,890
Mr. Yuan!

257
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,980
Jiang Jun, which cup is for me?

258
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,300
This. This one.

259
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,360
Thank you.

260
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680
Jiang Jun makes good tea.

261
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,640
Go on.

262
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,880
Have some more

263
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,760
since she makes very good tea.

264
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,760
Jiang Jun!

265
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,960
When we have the meeting,

266
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,520
make a cup of tea for

267
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,970
each and every one of us.

268
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,440
Drinking more tea in this weather
is good for health,

269
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,000
you know?

270
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,280
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

271
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,920
Make the tea.

272
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,500
Okay.

273
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,520
Tea.

274
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,320
Then go ahead.

275
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,200
Ms. Qiao.

276
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,010
Mr. Yuan.

277
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,370
Alright.

278
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,360
We are all here. Let’s begin.

279
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,460
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

280
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,240
Now, today’s report

281
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,480
is about the market research

282
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,560
we are going to carry out

283
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,720
regarding the IPO

284
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,520
of Wanxing Entertainment Group.

285
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,280
Wanxing already had a market value

286
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,200
of 30 billion yuan in 2003.

287
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,000
Its IPO has grown by more than

288
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,320
10% in the first quarter.

289
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,800
In the second and third quarters,

290
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,160
it’ll increase to 215.2 billion yuan.

291
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,200
Besides,

292
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,680
as the largest online music streaming platform,

293
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,920
the number of Wanxing’s users

294
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
has reached

295
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,640
579 million.

296
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,560
This is the part of them.

297
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,200
In a word,

298
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,680
the company put a lot of efforts

299
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,840
into the case of Wanxing Entertainment.

300
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,960
I believe that we can

301
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,360
accomplish the mission.

302
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,880
Good.

303
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,440
Well done, everybody.

304
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,760
A few days ago,

305
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,120
you were asked to find more clients

306
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
for IPO and the refinancing business.

307
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,000
Remember to submit the file and list.

308
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,840
Okay.

309
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,960
That’s all for today.

310
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,960
I don’t know why,

311
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,440
but when I sat next to Ms. Qiao just now,

312
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,700
I felt the atmosphere was quite intense.

313
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,080
How did you feel that?

314
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,260
It’s a woman’s sixth sense. You won’t get it.

315
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,720
To tell you the truth,

316
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,560
when I met Mr. Yuan’s eyes,

317
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,180
I was a little scared, too.

318
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,420
They both look strange today.

319
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,440
Thank God that I played up to Mr. Yuan in time

320
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,360
and escaped a big trouble.

321
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,760
Otherwise, my report wouldn’t be approved

322
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
until next year.

323
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Maybe there’ll be a big change
in the management team.

324
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,480
I don’t think so.

325
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,240
I think it’s all because of the mood.

326
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,040
No way.

327
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,180
It’s not that easy.

328
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,200
Chen Yicheng.

329
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,720
Bring a copy of your report

330
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,780
to my office later.

331
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,740
I’ll sort it out

332
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
and give it to you soon.

333
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,120
Okay.

334
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,200
Life and death are the two noblest ways

335
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
of showing courage.

336
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,080
I’ve got to choose one today.

337
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,720
It’s not that serious.

338
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,800
Let me sound him out for you first.

339
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,220
Come in.

340
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,640
Mr. Yuan, this needs your signature.

341
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Why are you looking at me? Sign it.

342
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,080
What’s the rush?

343
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,980
[Yuan Shuai]

344
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,800
Done.

345
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,050
Stop looking at me! The others will see us!

346
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
They’ll see us!

347
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,640
They can’t!

348
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,970
Mr. Yuan.

349
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,920
It’s the report. Please review.

350
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,560
Just a sec.

Okay. Go back to work.

Watch it! You are so careless!

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,000
Sorry, Ms. Qiao!

357

You look great today.

Nice makeup, new clothes,

You are in love?

362
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,120
Since your boyfriend chooses

363
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
to date a girl who works in the investment bank,

364
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,120
hope he can understand

I’ve read the files you submitted.

367
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,320
I think you did a good job.

368
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
But I need more information
about a few companies.

369

How about this?

370

I need you to work overtime today

to sort out all the materials.

372

We’ll have a meeting tomorrow to discuss them.

Okay?

374

What? You’ve had a plan for tonight?

375
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,160
No.

376
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,560
Okay, Ms. Qiao,

I need to work overtime.

381

Do you need me to stay and be your company?

382
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,530
No need.

383
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,510
I can take care of it myself.

384
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,260
Okay.

385
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,940
Then try to be home early, Miss Perfect.

386

You scared me!

392

With your pace,

393
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
these companies might already

394

go public when you finish sorting them out.

395
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,100
I thought I asked you to go home first.

396
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,080
I’m worried

that someone can’t get her job done,

What’s wrong with your lips?

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,640
It’s so tasty!

524
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
I think someone just said

525
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,160
that I was

526
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,240
a devil.

527
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,000
Really?

528
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,080
How short-sighted!

529
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Bah!

530
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,960
How can our Chef Yuan be a devil?

531
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,720
You are an awesome guy.

532
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,960
Well said!

533
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,760
Here.

534
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Have some soup.

535
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,060
Very tasty.

536
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:02,920
Here.

537
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,380
Thanks.

538
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,000
Try it.

539
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,520
Wait a sec.

540
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,140
You are also Xiaochuan’s cousin.

541
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,640
Family members are always alike.

542
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,900
It’s such a perfect arrangement.

543
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,320
Hadn’t Jun told me

544
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,570
that you were weird,

545
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,000
hard to deal with, and…

546
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,040
I would’ve already matched you guys up!

547
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,560
Weird? Hard to deal with? Huh?

548
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,760
Let’s eat.

549
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,760
Let’s eat.

550
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,800
But, with that being said,

551
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,280
since you are seeing each other,

552
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,120
why did you keep it from me?

553
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,720
I won’t hide it from you anymore.

554
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,080
It’s okay. We are family.

555
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,480
Come on, let’s eat! Go on!

556
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,600
Have some more

557
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,840
since you like it.

558
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,280
The soup is so yummy!

559
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,000
I’ll bring Xiaochuan here next time

560
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,480
and try more of your cooking.

561
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,010
Anytime!

562
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,740
Tell me what you wanna eat.

563
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I’ll cook for you.

564
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,800
No problem. Jun’s home is my home.

565
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
I will come again.

566
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,280
Okay. I’m full.

567
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,600
I won’t be a third wheel now.

568
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,640
Enjoy your couple’s time.

569
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,080
You are really full?

570
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,290
Are you leaving?

571
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,960
Thank you.

572
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,840
You are?

573
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,880
Come again!

574
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,680
Okay!

575
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,960
Clean your mouth!

576
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
Okay! I will!

577
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
I’m leaving! Bye!

578
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,640
Bye!

579
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
Be safe on the way!

580
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,360
Okay!

581
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,840
Are you full?

582
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,330
Pretty much.

583
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,920
So it’s my turn next.

584
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,420
Your turn for what?

585
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
What do you think?

586
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,680
Run?

587
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
Does it have to be 100%

588
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,680
to be together?

589
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,740
[Garbage Can]

590
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,000
I don’t believe I can’t throw it in!

591
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
There’s no goal I can’t score in this world!

592
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,600
I’m sure of it!

593
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,960
There’s no way that an outstanding girl

594
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,090
like me can’t be Li Xiaochuan’s match!

595
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,360
It’s just some app data.

596
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,360
I’m sure I can work my way up

597
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,640
from 1% to 100%

598
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,880
through my hard work!

599
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,700
Keep fighting!

600
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,840
1% girl

601
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,640
can change West World, too!

602
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I’ll change the world!

603
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,920
Ms. Qiao.

604
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,100
Mr. Fan wants to see you in his office.

605
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,720
Mr. Fan.

606
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,920
Have a look at this first!

607
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,080
Are you unhappy

608
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,280
about our company?

609
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,760
Mr. Yuan.

610
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,530
Is this how you manage your subordinates?

611
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,290
Ms. Qiao, you’ve been in charge

612
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,840
of the financing plan of Yuanyang Group.

613
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,120
How could such a ridiculous situation happen?

614
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,360
Dealing with numbers is

615
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,700
what we do in the investment bank.

616
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,200
A miss is as good as a mile!

617
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,720
How could you give the plan to the client

618
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,560
without reviewing it?

619
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,120
The client has already carried

620
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,320
out their work accordingly,

621
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,080
and a big mistake has been made!

622
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
Tell me,

623
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,760
who should take

624
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,060
responsibility for the loss?

625
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,490
I need to take

626
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,530
inescapable responsibility for what happened.

627
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,810
Ms. Qiao and I will go apologize

628
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,080
to the client later

629
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,080
and

630
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
give them a new financing plan.

631
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,680
A new plan?

632
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,920
You made it sound so easy!

633
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:49,960
First,

634
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,560
the time for financing has been released.

635
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,280
Second,

636
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,800
the competitor has known about this plan,

637
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,360
which can’t be used anymore.

638
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,080
Third,

639
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,560
it’d take at least

640
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,730
a week to come up with a new plan.

641
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
So tell me,

642
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,560
how should I explain this to the client?

643
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,200
Sorry, Mr. Fan.

644
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,800
This happened because of my dereliction of duty.

645
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,640
Mr. Yuan has nothing

646
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,800
to do with this.

647
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,740
I’m willing to take the blame and resign.

648
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,480
And I’ll take the responsibility

649
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,720
for our company’s loss and the client’s.

650
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,320
How can you manage to do that?

651
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,520
Just drop it, Qiao Na.

652
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,720
Mr. Fan.

653
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,300
As Ms. Qiao’s supervisor,

654
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,890
I also failed in managing my subordinate.

655
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,520
I promise

656
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,200
I’ll give the client a new

657
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,120
financing plan in 24 hours.

658
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,120
Rest assured.

659
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,240
If we make

660
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,880
any mistake again,

661
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,960
I will leave MH

662
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,720
together with Ms. Qiao.

663
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,080
24 hours?

664
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,520
24 hours.

665
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,800
Okay.

666
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,280
So, you’ve made me a promise.

667
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,210
Alright.

668
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,440
I’ll wait

669
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,280
for the new plan tomorrow.

670
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,410
If the client is not satisfied with it,

671
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,400
you’ll both

672
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,200
get fired!

673
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,580
Love Is Sweet
