To have more people try his rice noodles,

20
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,320
he found a few friends

21
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,640
and built a rice noodle brand together.

22

In the end, for the livelihood
of all his employees,

he had no choice but sign the contract.

that the food safety issue

might not be an accident?

He had high requirements for food quality.

62

He wouldn’t use inferior materials.

63

And the cause of his death

64
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,520
was also quite suspicious to me.

65
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,520
He did have hypertension.

66
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,480
But he took medicine regularly
and it was always under control.

67

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,680
People are watching! Why did you do that?

176
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,240
What?

177
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,720
We are adults.

178
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,440
How could you be jealous of those little girls?

179
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,580
You just found out?

180
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
If you go on like this,

181
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,340
you’ll be jealous all the time in the future.

182
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,600
Are you able to hold

183
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,760
your tears back?

184
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,840
Will you be okay if I cry?

185
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,680
Yuanyuan,

186
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,640
can you promise me one thing?

187
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,620
Mrs. Jiang,

188
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,920
go ahead.

189
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,160
I hope that

190
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,600
no matter how

191
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,280
your relationship changes,

192
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,280
or what happens between you two in the future,

193
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,320
you should always treat her nicely

194
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,960
and not be the one who makes her cry.

195
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,160
Jiang Jun,

196
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,560
if something makes you

197
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,600
feel really, really sad,

198
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
just cry out loud.

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
I will catch you

200
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
the moment you pass out.

201
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,120
Why are you being so sweet today?

202
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,260
Because I love you.

203
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,440
I love you, too.

204
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,360
I’m not a ma’am!

205
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,560
You are a ma’am!

206
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,690
And I’m a mister!

207
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,120
Let’s go there again, okay?

208
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,560
Excuse me. Can I help you?

209
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,040
Hi. I’m with the Property Management Company.

210
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,840
I’m here to deliver New Year’s gifts to the owners.

211
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,080
Hey, baby,

212
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,280
I just remembered that we need to get our mails.

213
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Let’s go.

214
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,960
It’s okay. You can give it to me.

215
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,640
Well,

216
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,520
look, he’s busy with

217
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
delivering gifts.

218
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,340
Now, the one who lives next door is my friend.

219
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
You can leave the gift with me. I’ll give it to him.

220
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,340
I can’t do that.

221
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,800
The gifts are for Mr. Yuan of 701

222
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
and Miss Jiang of 702.

223
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
Mr. Yuan of 701?

224
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,320
Shouldn’t the owner be Mr. Su?

225
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,220
It’s a misunderstanding!

226
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,760
Seriously.

227
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,080
I’m their friend. You can leave the gifts with me.

228
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,560
Speaking of that, Mr. Su,

229
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,160
which apartment do you live in?

230
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,960
-I…
-We live in 701!

231
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
I think you made a mistake.

232
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,880
Mr. Yuan owns both 701 and 702.

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,920
He’s the executive director
of a top investment bank in Shanghai.

234
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
He’s the only owner who owns two apartments

235
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
on the same floor in this community.

236
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,600
I can’t be wrong.

237
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,960
Executive director?

238
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
Mr. Yuan?

239
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,280
Yes.

240
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,920
Su Chang!

241
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,400
I gotta go.

242
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,490
I’ll go upstairs to deliver gifts.

243
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,240
Listen, baby, don’t be mad!

244
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,080
Let me explain!

245
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
-Can we… Can we go inside first?
-I don’t want to!

246
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,610
I don’t want to hear your explanation!

247
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,760
What’s wrong?

248
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,960
Cover is blown!

249
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,320
Xinxin!

250
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,540
Come here! Come on!

251
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,240
Well…

252
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,840
What happened?

253
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,570
He didn’t lie to you on purpose.

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,080
Su Chang really regrets that he lied to you.

255
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,050
But, you know

256
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,280
that men can’t swallow their pride easily.

257
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,080
He was afraid that you’d look down upon him.

258
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
But I’ve never looked down upon him!

259
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,800
Why would he lie to me?

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,800
Later…

261
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,900
Please try to understand him.

262
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,880
Actually, Su…

263
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,000
Baby.

264
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,840
Could you please let me explain?

265
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,280
I know it’s my fault.

266
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,200
I don’t wanna hear it!

267
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,640
Su Xinxin! Stop!

268
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,800
I dare you take another step!

269
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,460
If you leave, I’ll…

270
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
You’ll what?

271
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,720
Su Xinxin.

272
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,400
Listen up!

273
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,170
Don’t ask

274
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:34,960
and don’t talk.

275
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,360
I’ve loved you for 10 years!

276
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,240
You are the only girl I wanna marry!

277
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,520
I know I lied to you,

278
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,530
and I really regret about that.

279
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,840
But if you don’t forgive me,

280
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,000
the day you leave Shanghai will be my deathday!

281
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,520
I… I know that I’m not rich,

282
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,260
but I will work hard for us!

283
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,200
Please give me another chance.

284
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,280
Xinxin!

285
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,880
Baby,

286
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,040
I trust you.

287
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,000
I won’t leave you again.

288
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,600
Come on. Let’s go to our home!

289
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,130
Let’s go.

290
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,200
See?

291
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
This move

292
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,960
works for everybody!

293
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,480
Good for you!

294
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,320
But let me warn you.

295
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,040
Don’t try to fool me.

296
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,860
I’m not that easy to be fooled.

297
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,120
I promise

298
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,360
I won’t lie to my queen.

299
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
That’s good.

300
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,520
Mr. Yuan, Miss Jiang.

301
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,720
You are finally back.

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,640
I wish you happy ever after.

303
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,760
This is your New Year’s gift.

304
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,720
Thank you.

305
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
I guess you won’t forget
to pay the water bill anymore.

306
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,829
No. I won’t.

307
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I’ll go upstairs now.

308
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,540
Happy New Year!

309
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,160
Now I know

310
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,130
why Su Chang’s cover was blown.

311
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,280
Who is he?

312
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,560
He’s good at seeing through lies.

313
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,069
Anyway,

314
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,560
now that your apartment is available,

315
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,760
you should move back.

316
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,240
Dream on!

317
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,240
I’ll live wherever I like.

318
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
There’s nothing you can do about it.

319
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,280
What if I don’t agree?

320
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,280
Then I’ll sell 701 right away.

321
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,040
I’ll see if you have the heart to kick me out.

322
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,360
I don’t.

323
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,120
Let’s go.

324
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,600
Okay.

325
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,020
[Financial Statements of C Group]

326
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,460
What are you doing?

327
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
Get back to work already?

328
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
It was Mr. Luo.

329
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,280
He asked me to sort out some materials.

330
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,680
I might need to take another business trip.

331
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,960
So the new year has just started,

332
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,760
and I already become “empty nested”.

333
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Silly girl!

334
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,040
I’ll be back soon.

335
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,800
What did you say to my mom and how did you

336
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,720
make her allow me to work in MH?

337
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,720
It’s a secret.

338
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,810
I won’t tell you.

339
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,360
Fine!

340
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,680
I don’t wanna know anyway!

341
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,960
I’ve got what I wanted.

342
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,340
I don’t care about how.

343
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,600
Okay.

344
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,680
Go to bed now.

345
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,520
You’ll go to the New Year’s party tomorrow.

346
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
You need to look stunning!

347
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,900
Be good.

348
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,500
Come on.

349
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,570

Here.

Sleep early.

354
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,250
It’s good for your skin.

Here.

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,880
I love you.

357
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,760
I love you, too.

Hello? Su Chang.

Boss.

364
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,160
I’ve checked.

365
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,480
C Group was still a small company five years ago.

366
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,120
Cao Heng was the President.

367
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
But he was dismissed later

368
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,220
for embezzlement.

369
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
He’s never showed up again ever since.

370
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,090
I found out that he owns a bar in Suzhou.

371
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
I’ll send you the name and location now.

Of course.

It’s the latest design of this brand.

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I waited for a long time for my order.

392
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,480
By the way,

393
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,440
you know what?

394
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
Our Investment Banking Dept.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,640
outperformed ourselves again last year.

396
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,840
The shareholders are very happy.

397
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,560
I guess

398
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,340
Mr. Fan will try his best today

399
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,680
to encourage us and draw us a pie in the sky.

400
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,940
That’s not a bad thing.

401
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,220
Drawing a pie means we are competent.

402
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
Otherwise, no matter how big the pie is,

403
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,800
no one can take it.

404
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,000
Moreover,

405
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,520
you see,

406
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
he provides us with such a good platform

407
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,560
to show our talents.

408
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
So, we may just show ourselves as well.

409
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,400
It’s a win-win situation.

410
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,800
I admire that you have such a good platform

411
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
to show your talent.

412
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Why don’t you give your salary and bonus to me?

413
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,800
I don’t think you need them that much.

414
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Salary and bonus

415
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,620
are my reward for making money

416
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680

428
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,120
Yes.

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,200

430
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay. I see.

I heard

438
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,680
the receptionist said

439
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
that someone named Lin

440
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
came to see Mr. Fan this morning.

441
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
It’s the first working day of a new year.

442
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,360
Who is so active?

443
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,000
You don’t know him?

444
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,610
How are you supposed to survive in MH then?

445
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
He’s our Vice President of Securities,

446
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
Mr. Lin, Lin Taimo!

447
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,640
So he’s the Mr. Lin that people talked about.

448
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,480
Jiang Jun,

449
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,980
you know Mr. Lin very well, don’t you?

450
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,640
I…

451
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,200
Mr. Fan.

452
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,090
Long time no see.

453
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,200
Mr. Lin, welcome to the Investment Banking Dept.

454
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,700
It’s such a big honor to have you here.

455
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,050
Mr. Lin, do you feel better?

456
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,820
Thank you for asking, Mr. Fan.

457
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,180
I feel much better now.

458
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,640
During my recuperation,

459
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,360
you had to take care

460
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,840
of all the matters of the company.

461
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,960
I really feel sorry for that.

462
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
So, I think it’s time

463
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,520
to unload the burden

464
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,280
from you.

465
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,380
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Lin.

466
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,800
I’m sure after you are back,

467
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,050
you’ll lead the Investment Banking Dept.

468
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
to a higher level.

469
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,760

Mr. Lin.

473

After all, you were just recovered.

474
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Working too hard will harm

475
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
your hard-won health

476
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,400

First of all, let’s welcome the return
of Mr. Lin, Lin Taimo!

Welcome! Welcome!

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,440
Now, we’ll invite Mr. Lin,

484

Dear fellows of the Investment Banking Dept.,

488
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Happy New Year!

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,280
I’m Lin Taimo.

490
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Thank you for your hard work last year.

491
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,240
You made a great contribution
to our company’s performance.

492
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,000
This year, the global economic situation

493
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,400
will continue to recover.

494
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,600
Investment banks are crucial

495
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,240
for the market economy, influencing the broad

496
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,480
financial resources by matching

497
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
sellers and investors.

498
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,680
Hope you can keep up the good work

499
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,840
and bring our company to a new level!

500
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,200
Thank you for your speech, Mr. Lin.

501
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,260
I’m sure under Mr. Lin’s leadership,

502
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,600
our company will have a brighter future.

503
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,560
Last but not the least,

504
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,840
I wish all of you a big success

505
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
in your work!

506
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,280
-Thank you, Mr. Fan!
-Thanks, Mr. Fan!

507
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,340
Thank you! Thanks!

508
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,720
Mr. Lin, this way.

509
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,180
Please.

510
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,440
Looks like somebody’s backer is back!

511
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,400
Yep.

512
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,200
In front of all the people,

513
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
he only greeted her.

514
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,160
How flattering that was!

515
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,840
Mr. Lin!

516
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,760
Mr. Lin!

517
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,920
Mr. Lin!

518
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
I’ve heard so much about you!

519
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,320
I’m Ma Xiuran, Vice President
of the Investment Banking Dept.

520
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,360
I learned so much

521
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,800
from your speech!

522
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,480
So I’m here to introduce myself.

523
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,440
Mr. Ma.

524
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,480
I know you.

525
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
You are a rare talent

526
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,520
of our company.

527
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,040
You know me?!

528
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,640
I’m so flattered!

529
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,480
I really appreciate your coffee.

530
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,280
It’s been my

531
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,520
favorite brand.

532
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,760
Their coffee beans

533
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,120
-are selected…
-Mr. Ma.

534
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,920
May I go to your office for a chat?

535
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,800
I’d be honored!

536
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,480
Please! Please!

537
00:27:59,480 --> 00:27:59,840
Okay.

538
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,520
This way!

539
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,640
Miss.

540
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,440
Are you the one in this picture?

541
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,960
Who are you?

542
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,920
I’m Cao Heng’s friend.

543
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,760
Could you please tell me

544
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,720
where he is?

545
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,040
Don’t ask me! I’m also looking for him!

546
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
He escaped from the debts

547
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,080
and left me here alone!

548
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,680
What kind of man is he?

549
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,500
Don’t get me wrong.

550
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,440
I’m not here to collect debts.

551
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I’m here

552
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,000
to pay my debts.

553
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,980
Pay your debts?

554
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,240
You owe him money?

555
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,400
How much?

556
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,880
Is it enough to pay off his gambling debts?

557
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,440
Pretty much, I think.

558
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,720
Excuse me.

559
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,280
I’m here to see someone.

560
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,160
Sorry, sir.

561
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,280
It’s not our business hour yet.

562
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,540
I want to see your boss.

563
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,480
Our boss?

564
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,130
Brother Hua is not here yet.

565
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,930
Brother Hua?

566
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,120
Isn’t your boss named Cao?

567
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,880
Cao Heng?

568
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,200
Are you here to collect debts?

569
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I’m actually here to give him money.

570
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,000
I met him five years ago.

571
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
I wouldn’t have been with him

572
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
if he hadn’t had money.

573
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,320
But he said he wanted to start a business,

574
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,040
and he borrowed money from everybody he knew.

575
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,200
I even lent him a lot.

576
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,080
But turns out

577
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
he used the money to gamble.

578
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,120
Hadn’t I had the key to his home

579
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,560
and taken some money to pay his debts,

580
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
he would’ve already been beaten to death
by the creditors!

581
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,080
Besides,

582
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,160
he always gambles every penny he has.

583
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,360
I saw some money in his home again today.

584
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
Who knows where he got it?

585
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,800
If I didn’t take it away,

586
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,570
he’d use it to gamble again.

587
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,100
It’s not all his fault.

588
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,840
That’s how gambling works.

589
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Once you are involved,

590
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,900
it’s quite easy to fall off the wagon.

591
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,220
How about this?

592
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
I’ll give you the money I owe him.

593
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,320
Please give it to him for me.

594
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,840
I actually am quite curious.

595
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,320
Where does he go to gamble?

596
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,080
How come he’d lose so much money?

597
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,160
I’m not sure about that.

598
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,400
But I heard

599
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,000
it was near a bar he once owned.

600
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,780
It could be an illegal casino,

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,640
which doesn’t allow outsiders to go in.

602
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,020
So where does he usually hang out?

603
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,840
I don’t think I can tell you that.

604
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,680
The casino is in the alley

605
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,810
10 meters
to the right from the KTV.

606
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,240
Then you’ll see a steel stairway.

607
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,440
The casino is right on the second floor.

608
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,480
Take this.

609
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,680
Show it to the gatekeepers.

610
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,440
Tell them that you are Brother Hua’s friend,

611
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,880
and they’ll let you in.

612
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,920
Thank you.

613
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,280
Mr. Du?!

614
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,400
You are just everywhere, aren’t you?

615
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,730
You’d never disappear.

616
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
No wonder my eyelid has been twitching

617
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,800
since I left home.

618
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,890
I thought I’d see something dirty.

619
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
Turns out it’s you, Mr. Yuan.

620
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,650
What are you doing here?

621
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,080
I’m looking for Cao Heng.

622
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,880
Why?

623
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,680
Help Jiang Jun to find out the truth
of her father’s death.

624
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,640
Aren’t you here for the same reason?

625
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,040
I think you are here to tie up the loose ends.

626
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,400
I’ve told you.

627
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,260
I’m here to find out the truth.

628
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,280
Then go on.

629
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,720
We’ll both continue.

630
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,050
Why don’t we work together?

631
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,520
Since we are both looking for Cao Heng,

632
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,480
let’s find him together.

633
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,640
I’m just one step away from the truth.

634
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,700
I just don’t know where the casino is.

635
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Work together?

636
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,810
Are you kidding, Mr. Du?

637
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,980
You aren’t capable enough

638
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,240
to find it.

639
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,000
Why should I lower myself to work with you?

640
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,480
Because I know more secrets than you do.

641
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,240
How so?

642
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,160
I once dealt with this case

643
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,120
when I was in GE.

644
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,760
I know a lot of things the others don’t.

645
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,400
More importantly, I do want to help Jiang Jun.

646
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,210
That’s very kind of you.

647
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,260
But why should I trust you?

648
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,160
It doesn’t matter whether you trust me or not.

649
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,280
But I’m telling you,

650
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,160
if we wait for him

651
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,520
in the casino today,

652
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,100
he’ll definitely show up.

653
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,600
Wanna bet?

654
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,880
Why not?

655
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,240
Are you sure the illegal casino is here?

656
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,490
Don’t come along if you don’t trust me.

657
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,940
I’m Brother Hua’s friend.

658
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,600
Secretary Du,

659
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,800
is this Brother Hua’s casino you told me about?

660
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,720
It’s so small

661
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,600
and shabby.

662
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,800
How am I supposed to gamble here?

663
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,330
I know, Mr. Yuan.

664
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,400
We are only here for business anyway.

665
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,460
Let’s just kill some time here and have some fun.

666
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,040
Alright.

667
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,690
Did you bring that one million yuan

668
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,640
in cash?

669
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,820
I’ve sent someone to fetch it.

670
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,010
This gentleman is quite responsible.

671
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,680
Give him some tips.

672
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,489
Share with him.

673
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,670
Thank you, Mr. Yuan!

674
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,920
Please, go in!

675
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,760
Let’s go, Secretary Du.

676
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,880
This way, please.

677
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,480
There was 3,000 yuan in cash,
and the wallet is worth 5,000 yuan.

678
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,080
Remember to pay it back to me.

679
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,400
You are so petty, Secretary Du.

680
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Because it’s you.

681
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,620
Show some sincerity if you wanna work together.

682
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,280
What’s going on?

683
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,020
[Lin Taimo Vice President]

684
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,600
How come Mr. Ma’s office

685
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,840
is Mr. Lin’s now?

686
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,640
Haven’t you heard?

687
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Ma Xiuran is transferred to the headquaters.

688
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
It’s said he’ll work there as the Manager

689
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
of the Admin Office for three years.

690
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,600
Admin Office?

691
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,240
Yes.

692
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,560
Isn’t it to manage the secretaries

693
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,080
and day-to-day activities of the company?

694
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,380
It appears to be a promotion,
but actually it’s a demotion.

695
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,600
[According to the requirements of the company’s
business development and strategic plan,]

696
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,260
[upon deliberation, the Board of Directors
decided from today on,]

697
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,500
[1. Lin Taimo, VP of Securities of MH,
will serve as GM of Investment Banking Dept.]

698
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,720
It’s going to be a big change!

699
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,660
[2. Ma Xiuran, former VP of Investment Banking Dept.,
will serve as GM of Admin Office of the Headquarters.]

700
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,360
Once Mr. Lin is here,

701
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,400
Mr. Fan will become a figurehead.

702
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,520
It’s a sign of an impending storm.

703
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,480
You know what?

704
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,040
I think Mr. Lin is trying to threaten

705
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,720
Mr. Fan by transferring Mr. Ma.

706
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,690
Makes sense.

707
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,480
However,

708
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,120
someone will be happy

709
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
about Mr. Lin’s return.

710
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,740
Come on! Let’s go back to work!

711
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,400
Mr. Ma,

712
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,640
you are…

713
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,960
Hold back your sympathy.

714
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,170
I just lent my office

715
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,080
to Mr. Lin.

716
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
I’m transferred to the headquarters.

717
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,160
I can take the time to alleviate the pressure of work

718
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,620
and relax myself a little.

719
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,770
Oh, I see.

720
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,040
Then, congratulations, Mr. Ma!

721
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,760
Jiang Jun, Mr. Lin wants to see you.

722
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,240
Okay.

723
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,410
You’d better

724
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,040
pick your words wisely.

725
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
I’ll be back after all.

726
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,760
Then I wish you

727
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,040
a big promotion in the headquarters.

728
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,640
And hope you’ll come back soon!

729
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,400
See you.

730
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:51,980
[Lin Taimo Vice President]

731
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,400
Come in.

732
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,680
Mr. Lin, you wanna see me?

733
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,720
Jiang Jun.

734
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,240
Here.

735
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,960
Come here. Take a seat.

736
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,880
How do you like my new office?

737
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,920
It’s a little small,

738
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,040
but it has the best geomantic quality

739
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,840
in the Investment Banking Dept.

740
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,690
How do you like the decoration?

741
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,560
It’s nice.

742
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,400
By the way,

743
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,000
how are you adapted to your new job here?

744
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,960
Do you get along with your coworkers?

745
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,720
Yes.

746
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,290
They are all very nice to me.

747
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,440
I heard

748
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
that your performance was quite good.

749
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,680
You even signed the job contract
earlier than the others.

750
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,320
Well done!

751
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,020
You didn’t let me down.

752
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,320
I didn’t want to let you down,

753
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,520
so I told myself to work harder.

754
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
If your dad

755
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
knew you are doing

756
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,800
such a good job,

757
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,920
he’d definitely be proud of you.

758
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
You knew my dad?

759
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,240
Your dad was Jiang Yaoming, the founder

760
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,240
of Jiangnan Flavor, right?

761
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,760
Yes.

762
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
We were friends for years.

763
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,920
He was a positive person.

764
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,480
We always enjoyed our conversations.

765
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,320
Unfortunately, he died so young.

766
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,780
I didn’t expect

767
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,120
that you knew my dad.

768
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,900
But I was in college back then.

769
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,380
I didn’t get to see him
before he passed away.

770
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,480
He was also a client of our MH.

771
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,320
For the brand “Yixianqian”,

772
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
we all put a lot of efforts in it.

773
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,440
I know it wasn’t easy for my dad
to start the business.

774
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,700
He and my mom tended not to share bad news.

775
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,880
So, even to the very end,

776
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,080
I didn’t get to help them with anything.

777
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,200
Mr. Lin,

778
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,920
what exactly happened back then?

779
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,480
Could you please tell me?

780
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,880
Back then, your dad’s company

781
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,720
was lacking money.

782
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,840
I tried my very best to help him.

783
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,320
In the end, we found C Group.

784
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,360
Actually, they were very generous with their terms.

785
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,730
After our serious consideration,

786
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,760
we decided to sign the acquisition contract.

787
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,680
But not long after,

788
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,840
I heard that your dad

789
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,560
suddenly died of a heart attack.

790
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,440
I think he must have been very sad

791
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,170
about giving his company away.

792
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,640
If I had known something like that would happen,

793
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,530
I wouldn’t have…

794
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,280
Mr. Lin,

795
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,290
it’s not your fault.

796
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,600
You just finished an acquisition case

797
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
according to the protocols.

798
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,440
Jiang Jun,

799
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,680
if you need any help

800
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,320
at work in the future,

801
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,060
just come to me at any time.

802
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,720
In fact, considering the friendship
between your dad and me,

803
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,040
you could even

804
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,200
call me uncle.

805
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,520
I’m already quite thankful

806
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,920
that you approved me to enter MH.

807
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,050
I won’t ask for more.

808
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,680
Okay.

809
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,680
Anyway, let me know if you need any help.

810
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,520
You can go back to work now.

811
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,980
Then I’m leaving, Mr. Lin.

812
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,760
Brother Hua!

813
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,360
I’m here.

814
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,360
Get him!

815
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,240
Get him!

816
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,720
Sir!

817
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,920
I’m sorry!

818
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,600
Run?

819
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,680
It’s…

820
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,200
Run!

821
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,460
Love Is Sweet
