2
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,539
Love Is Sweet

3
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

4
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 16

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,240
Is this a painting?

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,120
Why did you scribble on this?

7
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,120
Well...

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,940
Those were the marks I made during practice.

9
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,410
You’re so childish!

10
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,160
Sleep!

11
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,160
08:37 am.

12
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,840
My gosh!

13
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,440
My gosh!

14
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,079
Seriously!

15
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,480
Who’s there? Coming.

16
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,660
Your house is of poor quality. It’s leaking!

17
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,520
Leaking?

18
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,000
Hurry up.

19
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,690
Pincer pliers.

20
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
Do you really know how to do this?

21
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,820
Adhesive tape.

22
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
It’s done.

23
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,440
Thank you.

24
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,360
What’s wrong?

25
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,410
I have an upset stomach.

26
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,240
Again?

27
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,170
Are you trying to trick me
into cooking porridge and reading to you?

28
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
I really don’t feel well.

29
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,280
Give me some water.

30
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,960
Well.

31
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,540
I will walk you to the sofa.

32
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,520
Here.

33
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,280
But...

34
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,680
Is this

35
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,600
appendicitis?

36
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
It’s not that bad.

37
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,200
It’s because you don’t rest and eat on time.

38
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
Depending on medicine won’t work.

39
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,200
Get up.

40
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
Let’s go to the hospital.

41
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,840
I’m not going.

42
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,100
I am afraid of the pain.

43
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,840
Seriously?

44
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,440
If it is appendicitis,

45
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,100
it’s going to kill you if it’s getting worse!

46
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
I will ask for a leave for you.

47
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,680
No!

48
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,500
I still have important work to do.

49
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,740
I have to finish it.

50
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,600
What’s more important than your health?

51
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,720
How about this?

52
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,440
When I finish my work,

53
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,170
you send me to the hospital.

54
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
It’s fine. Go get dressed.

55
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,060
Let’s go to the company together.

56
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,120
I’m fine now.

57
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,200
Wait a moment.

58
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,330
Baby, the class is over?

59
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,240
Yeah, babe.

60
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,840
I have some good news.

61
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,400
I can stay with you during the winter holiday.

62
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,280
That’s great! When will you come back?

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,640
Soon. I haven’t decided the specific date.

64
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,200
By the way,

65
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,320
my best friend’s husband is also
in the investment bank.

66
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,680
She got so envious

67
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,400
after hearing you’re the ED of MH.

68
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,930
They would like to know you.

69
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,920
ED?

70
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,680
What do you mean?

71
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah!

72
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,360
I’m the ED.

73
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,490
I do remember it.

74
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,760
Well, baby.

75
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,640
Tell me if you come back in advance.

76
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,640
Okay, babe.

77
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
I’ll hang up now.

78
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,040
Love you.

79
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,520
ED?

80
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
How can I forget it?

81
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,320
When did I brag about this?

82
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
Why hasn’t boss come yet?

83
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,360
Drive faster. It’s late.

84
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,940
Slow down! You’re going to tailgate!

85
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
You said to drive faster before,
but now you want me to slow down.

86
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,010
What do you want me to do?

87
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,909
Drive at the speed

88
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,240
you need to.

89
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,860
Do I have to teach you that?

90
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,280
I said I would drive.

91
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,610
You had to take my place.

92
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,880
Get over it.

93
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
How can I let a patient drive?

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Or I would be irresponsible for others.

95
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,520
Be responsible for yourself.

96
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,960
I don’t really want to sit in your car.

97
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,880
I’m anxious!

98
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,000
So, our invincible Yuan Shuai,

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,880
what’s the great mission

100
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,040
that urges you to work when you’re unwell?

101
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,720
Do you remember Chenxin Technology,

102
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,050
which I told you before?

103
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

104
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
Their sales were poor.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,280
Yet the newly-developed system
hasn’t been published.

106
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,800
People are not positive about it.

107
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,640
The leader of the project

108
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,770
is the founder of Chenxin, Doctor Zhu.

109
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,280
His team is great.

110
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,210
But the R&D needs lots of money.

111
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
They can’t pay their debts.

112
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,520
And the creditor doesn’t allow a loan extension.

113
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,250
So, it’s going to be purchased.

114
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,280
I want to raise money for them

115
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,760
and take back the control over the company.

116
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
I’ve found some potential investors.

117
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,050
They come to the company today.

118
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,360
So, is this the reason why

119
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
you don’t go to the hospital?

120
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,640
I’m positive about his project.

121
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,480
So,

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,600
I promised I will help him.

123
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
But you don’t look like

124
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,280
a man who acts impetuously.

125
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,920
He’s ready to lose everything.

126
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,090
I have every reason to help him.

127
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,960
What?

128
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,280
So, the successor of Mo-tse

129
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,960
could help the world,

130
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,920
while I’m not allowed to help someone?

131
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,400
Speak less. Rest more.

132
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,000
Your friend needs you.

133
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,680
Let’s go!

134
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,720
If I can’t persuade the new investors

135
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,520
during the meeting,

136
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,900
Chenxin will be destroyed in my hand.

137
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,720
Doctor Zhu.

138
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,840
Listen to me.

139
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,960
You’re pressuring yourself too much.

140
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,360
All of your nerves and worries
are negative energy.

141
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,520
Doctor Zhu, getting nervous

142
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,960
can’t solve any problems.

143
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,200
You have to calm down.

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,040
But

145
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,080
I’ll get nervous when I see many people.

146
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,800
I was the No.1 in GPA.

147
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,600
But I failed at my Graduation Thesis
Defense twice.

148
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,680
It’s because I was nervous seeing
all of them.

149
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,340
The more I think about it,
the more nervous I get.

150
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,760
Doctor Zhu.

151
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
Listen to me.

152
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,680
When we go to the meeting room,

153
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,160
don’t regard it as Defense or Road Show.

154
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,640
Just look at me.

155
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Imagine the time

156
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,240
when you first introduced

157
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
your project to me.

158
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,370
Your status was so good.

159
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,480
You were confident, energetic

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,410
and passionate.

161
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,240
Be like that later.

162
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,760
Okay!

163
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,800
His condition is not right.

164
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,440
Yes.

165
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,400
He even asks to work when having a stomachache.

166
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,920
Work is his No.1 priority

167
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,360
Did he take any medicine today?

168
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,400
Anti-inflammatory, yes.

169
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Pain killers, no.

170
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,560
Yeah.

171
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
The invincible man is also a man.

172
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,980
A man needs regular maintenance.

173
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,520
You can have two hours’ rest.

174
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,880
Now, calm yourself down.

175
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
Don’t be nervous.

176
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,360
Take a rest.

177
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,400
Okay?

178
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,720
Okay, I will.

179
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Don’t be nervous.

180
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,560
I’ll leave now.

181
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,810
Take a good rest.

182
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,440
You can do it.

183
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,400
You...

184
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,480
Come back as soon as you can.

185
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,290
Doctor Zhu seems to be nervous.

186
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,840
It looks like he does that habitually.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,040
He’s too nervous.

188
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,660
But there’s no way out.

189
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,080
He is already here.

190
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,840
It’s on him now.

191
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,480
Can you let me work on that?

192
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,600
You?

193
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,200
Okay.

194
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,740
It’s on you now.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
Su Chang, do me a favor.

196
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,760
Thank you.

197
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,600
And lower the heat by the way.

198
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,920
Boss.

199
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,000
Why the air conditioner?

200
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,280
In psychology,

201
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,020
lowering the temperature

202
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,400
could let people’s guard down.

203
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,040
Zhu Youyi. Zhu…

204
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,320
Hello, Doctor Zhu.

205
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,200
I’m the analyst who checks
the materials of the Road Show.

206
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
I’m Jiang Jun.

207
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,560
Hello.

208
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,320
March 18, 2011

209
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,720
is a Wednesday.

210
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,560
Do you remember that date?

211
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,880
I...

212
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,320
I don’t.

213
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,220
It is the day

214
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,320
when you’re awarded
the Outstanding Electrical Engineer

215
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,050
of Australian National Academy of Engineering.

216
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,800
I can’t remember the date.

217
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,880
On July 15, 2013,

218
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,080
you’re awarded the Pioneer Award

219
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,400
by the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers.

220
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,480
Is it a Wednesday, too?

221
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,930
What a coincidence.

222
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,450
All of them happened on Wednesday?

223
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
The image and video compression
technology invented by you

224
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,680
won you a big prize on Committee of 100.

225
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,650
It happened on Wednesday, too.

226
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Well...

227
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,680
What day is it today?

228
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,640
Wednesday?

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Yeah, it is.

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,330
It seems like Wednesday is your lucky day.

231
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah, the lucky day.

232
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,420
This is a cup of imported Theanine juice.

233
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,900
It helps calm you down.

234
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,360
Mr. Yuan has someone
add some traditional Chinese medicine in it.

235
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,620
You will fall asleep after finishing it.

236
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,200
But the meeting is about to begin.

237
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,480
I shouldn’t sleep.

238
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,640
No worries.

239
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,880
Time is slow.

240
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
It’s enough for you to take a rest.

241
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,520
Well,

242
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,240
I will check the materials for you.

243
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,300
You can take a rest.

244
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,280
Okay.

245
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
It tastes weird.

246
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,440
I turned off your cell phone, too.

247
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,700
You can take a rest now.

248
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,320
I will notify you in advance.

249
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,330
-Okay.
-I’ll go out.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is the Wednesday thing serious?

251
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,520
I lied to him.

252
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
I knew it.

253
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,200
He does need someone

254
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,370
to give him positive mental hints.

255
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
Good job.

256
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,890
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

257
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,960
I put all the fruits

258
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,400
in the juice extractor.

259
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,680
I have no idea how it tastes.

260
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,040
How can he swallow it?

261
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
I told him Mr. Yuan put some

262
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,260
TCM that helps sleep in the juice.

263
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,800
She did something to my hourglass, too.

264
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
The sand in the hourglass

265
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
doesn’t move at all.

266
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,920
Good job, you two!

267
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
There’s only one thing I care about.

268
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,660
Mr. Yuan, did you take your medicine?

269
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,280
I am going now.

270
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
Are you going to rent this as your office?

271
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,880
Yeah.

272
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,880
This is a commercial and residential house.

273
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,480
Look.

274
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
We can work in this area.

275
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,760
When we are tired, we can go up there
to have a rest.

276
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,320
There’s a mall nearby.

277
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,010
And a subway station. It’s super convenient.

278
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
And we have lots of famous

279
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,640
IT companies nearby.

280
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,720
The point is...

281
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,240
Look.

282
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,450
The thing I like the most

283
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,960
is this floor.

284
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,880
Floor?

285
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,330
You do have a good taste.

286
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,200
I think the location

287
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,160
and the interior facilities are great.

288
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
What about the price?

289
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Four yuan per square meters for a day.

290
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,720
So expensive?

291
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,170
Can you accept that, Mr. Du?

292
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,980
I don’t think the environment

293
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,240
matches with its rent.

294
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
Have you talked about the price?

295
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,200
Not yet.

296
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,640
I’m bad at that.

297
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,560
The three factors in a bargain.

298
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,690
Acting cute, making a comparison
and finding the flaws.

299
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,280
Hello.

300
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Mr. Li. Mr. Du.

301
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,680
And this beautiful lady.

302
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,760
I've got the lease.

303
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,160
Are you satisfied with the house?

304
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,069
Yeah, pretty much.

305
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,640
Wait for me. I need to check the price.

306
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
Okay.

307
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,560
So expensive?

308
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,310
Hey,

309
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,760
we’re all college students.

310
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,040
And we’re about to start our own business.

311
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,000
We don’t have that much money.

312
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,360
Can you help us

313
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,600
and lower the price, okay?

314
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,000
Young lady.

315
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,680
You’re all going to be bosses.

316
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,200
You can’t make it difficult for a working class.

317
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
Again,

318
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,400
I will lose money

319
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,320
if I lower the rent.

320
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,240
To be honest,

321
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,080
we went to see the house next door.

322
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,480
It has a better location.

323
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,560
And it’s cheaper than this.

324
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,680
Without Mr. Li’s preference over this one,

325
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,480
we would have

326
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,600
rented that one.

327
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,240
Young lady, actually,

328
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
the house next door

329
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,480
is ours, too.

330
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
Please tell me who the agent is.

331
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
I will check who

332
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,080
told you the wrong price.

333
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,320
Never mind.

334
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,720
Actually, I think your house

335
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
has a lot of problems.

336
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,000
Mr. Du.

337
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
This is the best commercial

338
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,930
and residential house nearby.

339
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,860
Do tell me where the problems lie.

340
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,560
Like the parking space outside,

341
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,520
it’s narrow.

342
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,120
It isn’t adequate at all.

343
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,440
The mass has taken almost all the space.

344
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,480
We will solve this problem as soon as possible.

345
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,010
We will persuade the customers into
parking at the right place.

346
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,360
And

347
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,580
the property management.

348
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,000
Look at this.

349
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,240
The mop

350
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,960
is so dirty.

351
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,360
You don’t want to buy a new one?

352
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,800
It’s just the cleaning tool...

353
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,480
And...

354
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,300
And it’s leaking up there.

355
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,200
So, you know,

356
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,000
four yuan per square meters for a day

357
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,000
is too expensive.

358
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,920
Well…

359
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,420
Well...

360
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,420
No matter what,

361
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
you have to lower the price.

362
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Yeah!

363
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,880
Please.

364
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,080
Fine, come on.

365
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,540
Let’s talk about it here. Come on.

366
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,130
This way.

367
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay.

368
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,600
Hello.

369
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,720
Dad wants you home now.

370
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
I’m busy.

371
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,180
Dad is still mad at you.

372
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
And he knows you’re starting a business

373
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,420
with your friends.

374
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,280
If you don’t come back now,

375
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,170
you know what will happen when dad gets mad

376
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,080
Okay.

377
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,850
I will come back right away.

378
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,160
Xiaochuan.

379
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,080
I gotta go. You two can go on.

380
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,320
Thank you, Mr. Du.

381
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,000
Bye, Mr. Du.

382
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,400
Okay, bye.

383
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,000
He… Hello.

384
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,770
I’m one of the founders of Chenxin.

385
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,360
Not one of.

386
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,360
I’m Zhu Youyi.

387
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,820
I believe you’ve already noticed

388
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,920
the IoT assessment system

389
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,050
developed by my team

390
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
values 200 million yuan before it goes public.

391
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
What does it mean?

392
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,160
It means my R&D is valuable!

393
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,640
It’s innovative!

394
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,280
And promising!

395
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,240
I promise

396
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,360
the project will be launched

397
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,080
within two months.

398
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,440
At that time,

399
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,840
I can

400
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,370
use it in my own product.

401
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,160
I can also lower the price

402
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,760
and make it accessible to the world.

403
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,640
Then all people and enterprises

404
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,440
could purchase it and use it.

405
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,560
Please believe

406
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,050
that my team and I

407
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,800
will make it...

408
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,530
Are you okay?

409
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,890
... An important factor

410
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,340
in building the Iot social platform.

411
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,760
That’s all.

412
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,980
Please have faith in me

413
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,280
and Chenxin.

414
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,680
Please keep this project

415
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,000
alive.

416
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,840
Please!

417
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,680
Yuan Shuai, are you okay?

418
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,720
Yuan Shuai?

419
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,320
Yuan Shuai!

420
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,860
Yuan Shuai!

421
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,800
Yuan Shuai!

422
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,080
Call an ambulance!

423
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,640
Exhale.

424
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,570
Does it hurt?

425
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,520
Yeah!

426
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,000
-Here.
-Here, doctor.

427
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,080
This hurts, too.

428
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,440
Okay.

429
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,160
It hurts!

430
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,040
Get up.

431
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,860
Come, and sit here.

432
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,690
Is it still hurting now?

433
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Yeah!

434
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Doctor.

435
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,000
Can we have the surgery today?

436
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,000
Surgery?

437
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,260
No, doctor.

438
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,240
I just need some medicine

439
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,240
and receive some conservative treatment.

440
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,960
No!

441
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,400
Only a surgery will eliminate it.

442
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,000
Listen to me first.

443
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,560
Go on, doctor.

444
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,380
What you have is the acute appendicitis.

445
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,880
According to the current pathological report,

446
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,360
you do need a surgery as soon as possible.

447
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,420
Okay, we will do everything you said.

448
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,360
What?

449
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,720
I won’t do it!

450
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,440
Doctor.

451
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,160
It doesn’t hurt that much anymore.

452
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
I think medicine is enough for me.

453
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,720
Doctor.

454
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,080
Don’t believe him.

455
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,520
It has been hurting for days.

456
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,080
My disease...

457
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,000
Young man,

458
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
listen to me.

459
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,480
If you don’t consider a surgery now,

460
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,810
and only take medicine,

461
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,940
it’s likely to reoccur in the future.

462
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,120
And there will be more complications,

463
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,560
which make the future surgery harder.

464
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,320
Right.

465
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,080
We won’t wait. We’ll do it now.

466
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,040
I’m not doing it.

467
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,040
You have to!

468
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,960
You’re so annoying…

469
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,880
Let’s start today!

470
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,800
Today?

471
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
I don’t think we can do it today.

472
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,480
Because you can’t eat food

473
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,520
in the 24 hours before the surgery.

474
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,280
Yeah, you’re right, doctor. I…

475
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,000
He can.

476
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,000
It hurts so much

477
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,880
that he hasn’t eaten from yesterday.

478
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,120
No, I can’t.

479
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,560
Young man, you’re lucky.

480
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,000
Your wife has considered everything for you.

481
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,130
She’s considerate.

482
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,480
I’m not...

483
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,040
Why not?

484
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,320
Are you shy?

485
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,760
You’re right, doctor.

486
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,000
She’s shy.

487
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,920
I’m not.

488
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,320
You haven’t got married?

489
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
I know.

490
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,210
She’s your girlfriend.

491
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,440
Doctor, you do know a lot.

492
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,120
When we get married, I will invite you.

493
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
What’re you talking about?

494
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,880
What?

495
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,320
Enough about the joke.

496
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,400
Here. Do an examination first.

497
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,260
If there’s nothing wrong,

498
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
you can do it today.

499
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Okay, doctor.

500
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,840
Help me, honey.

501
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,180
Doctor.

502
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,960
We’re going to get

503
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,860
a premarital checkup now.

504
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,250
Premarital...?

505
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,680
Let’s go, honey.

506
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,840
Help me.

507
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,260
She’s acting like a child.

508
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
I’ll wait for your invitation!

509
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,300
[The Fifth Ward of Surgery]

510
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,840
That hurts!

511
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,080
Why did you say I’m your wife?

512
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,200
You were so determined to

513
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,120
make a decision for me, weren’t you?

514
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,480
Of course I need to see you as my wife.

515
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,740
Or it would be awkward.

516
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,620
That’s what comes naturally.

517
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,820
You have to sign for me anyway.

518
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,780
Why do I bother to explain so much?

519
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
It hurts!

520
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,920
It hurts so much.

521
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Hello, we want to do an examination.

522
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
Which one is the patient?

523
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,880
Me.

524
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,840
Go change your clothes with me.

525
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
And your family should pay the bill
on the third floor.

526
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,080
The family should pay the bill.

527
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Did you hear that?

528
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,680
Go, honey.

529
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,410
Where are you going?

530
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,800
Is our invincible boss getting nervous?

531
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,360
It’s just a surgery.

532
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,060
Why would I be nervous?

533
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,320
You’re underestimating me.

534
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,920
Jiang Jun.

535
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,000
I will go in soon.

536
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,120
Yeah.

537
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,680
What do you think we’re doing here?

538
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,400
Play a game?

539
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
You know, the surgery

540
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,160
is risky.

541
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,460
But I think doctors can

542
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,000
do this surgery

543
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,490
with their eyes closed.

544
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,920
It is still a surgery!

545
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
Can you be serious?

546
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,200
I’m comforting you already!

547
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,560
You won’t understand

548
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,960
how I feel being sent to the operating room.

549
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,560
No worries.

550
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,840
I will pray for you out there.

551
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,240
Jiang Jun,

552
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,640
if my eyes were closed

553
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,960
when I come out,

554
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,600
please remember to

555
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,520
call my parents.

556
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,280
They’re easy to be found since their numbers
are in my phone.

557
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,200
If you can’t reach them,

558
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,040
call Li Xiaochuan.

559
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
And,

560
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,720
remember to feed Wealth for me.

561
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,320
If you want,

562
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,370
she can become your family.

563
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
She will be named

564
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,000
Jiang Wealth.

565
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,040
Then do you want to tell me all of your passwords

566
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
of bank accounts?

567
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,440
What else do you want to say?

568
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,920
Do it now, Wealth Yuan.

569
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,000
I don’t care.

570
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,840
You have to be there

571
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,440
when I’m done.

572
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
The first person I want to see is you.

573
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,360
Okay, I got it.

574
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,560
Rest assured.

575
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,260
You have to be there for me.

576
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,800
Excuse me, I’m sending the patient
to the operating room.

577
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,680
Wait!

578
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,280
I have one last question.

579
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
I love you!

580
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,240
Lie down. Come on.

581
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,920
Go.

582
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,320
Go now.

583
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,400
Wait for me.

584
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,320
I got it.

585
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,210
Remember to wait for me.

586
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,880
My password is 12345678.

587
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,560
Like I'd believe that

588
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,680
It’s true.

589
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,200
Dad.

590
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,400
Retreat without fighting for it.

591
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,460
Is it your attitude or your strategy?

592
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,970
How do you expect me to answer this?

593
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,720
Do you know why I

594
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,940
like trimming the bonsai so much,

595
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,400
Du Lei?

596
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,760
To trim a bonsai

597
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,080
with the viewing value,

598
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,320
you have to cut off some
extra branches and leaves.

599
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,640
In this way,

600
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,760
you can make a perfect artwork.

601
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,040
Likewise,

602
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,160
I have cultivated you carefully

603
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,490
and been strict with you for so many years.

604
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,160
But now I suddenly found

605
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,240
you’ve grown up.

606
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,680
You want to fly yourself.

607
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,920
I’m a human being,

608
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,920
not a bonsai.

609
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,720
Let alone the perfect artwork

610
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,560
mentioned by you just now.

611
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Great!

612
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,920
My son.

613
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,680
Now I found we haven’t

614
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,180
talked to each other so honestly before.

615
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,960
With your sister’s presence,

616
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,720
I hope you can tell me your dissatisfaction

617
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,200
about me frankly.

618
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,680
Go on.

619
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,680
From today on,

620
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,080
I will be myself.

621
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,240
Be yourself?

622
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
My son.

623
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,880
I didn’t expect you to be so naive

624
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,760
since you’re already an adult.

625
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,600
Do you think you have achieved all this

626
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,040
on your own?

627
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,280
Ask your sister.

628
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,760
She knows better!!

629
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,240
Without me…

630
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,320
You!

631
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,400
You!

632
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,480
You are nothing!

633
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
I’ve had enough being a substitute!

634
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,560
Okay.

635
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
You’ve had enough, right?

636
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,300
Do you have any idea

637
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,240
you will pay the price

638
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,640
by betraying me?

639
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,960
I can help you with that.

640
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,160
But I can also

641
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,040
destroy you

642
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,290
like killing an ant!

643
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,360
How?

644
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,400
I bet you will

645
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000
take back all you gave me.

646
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,440
Wealth.

647
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,880
Status.

648
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,200
Reputation.

649
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,920
I can give them back to you.

650
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Including the name of that dead kid!

651
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,560
-I can give back that name as well!
-You!

652
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
You!

653
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,180
How can you speak to dad like that?

654
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,600
Dad!

655
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,400
Dad! Dad!

656
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,400
Get out.

657
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,360
Dad!

658
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,320
Get out!

659
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,080
Get out!

660
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,720
Get out!

661
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,680
Get out!

662
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,800
I’ll get him back.

663
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,040
Don’t be angry.

664
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,120
Ignore him.

665
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,610
Tell him to get away.

666
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,360
Wait.

667
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,600
Du!

668
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,680
Wait!

669
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you know what you were talking about?

670
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,850
Dad said that for your good!

671
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,360
For my good?

672
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,490
He planned my life step by step.

673
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,040
He told you to instill in me

674
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,720
his so-called way of survival.

675
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,280
I can’t have my own emotions.

676
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,840
I can’t have my own sentiments.

677
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,560
Since my childhood,

678
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,640
I've been like a puppet
whose soul has been taken away!

679
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,900
That’s “for my good”?!

680
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,960
I actually envied you when I was little.

681
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,560
It’s true.

682
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
You can act freely

683
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,000
and do whatever you want.

684
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,120
So,

685
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,120
I tried so hard to become you.

686
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,560
But after I did it,

687
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,600
I found that’s not what I want.

688
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,800
We’re born to be different.

689
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,120
Your last name is Du.

690
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,240
But mine isn’t.

691
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,480
Du.

692
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,720
Sister,

693
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,740
do you still remember what my name is?

694
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,600
It’s okay.

698
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,630
Hello.

699
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,620
After how long will he wake up?

700
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,840
It takes two hours normally.

701
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,040
But it may be longer for your boyfriend.

702
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,060
He’s so scared.

703
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,920
He asked for a general anesthesia.

704
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,780
It may take him four to five hours.

705
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,960
He isn’t...

706
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,800
Never mind. Thank you.

707
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
But...

708
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,560
Aren’t you invincible?

709
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,200
Now you’re defeated by the appendicitis

710
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
and lying there.

711
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,960
Your physical health sucks.

712
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,880
You have to eat on time.

713
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,360
Your health is everything.

714
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,440
Alright,

715
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,540
now you can only

716
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,800
lie here quietly and be a handsome man.

717
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,120
Now that I look at you carefully,

718
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,680
you really have a high nose bridge.

719
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,960
When I was little,

720
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,420
why didn’t I find that you look handsome?

721
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,260
The face is as small as my palm.

722
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,600
This is so unfair.

723
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,080
You know, you’re so mild

724
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,280
when you are quiet,

725
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,290
are not angry and don’t bicker.

726
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,260
Why do you like to pull a long face?

727
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,410
Isn’t it nice to be harmonious?

728
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,960
But it’s so hard

729
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,560
to see you to be quiet and obedient like now.

730
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
From now on,

731
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,080
you need to eat on time and can’t stay up late.

My biggest regret is that

736
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,880
I didn’t get to meet my dad

737
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,760

00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,720
He was busy with the company,

741
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,080
and hadn’t slept for days.

742
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,880
He passed away

743
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,490
when he had a recurrence of an old illness.

744
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,600
It was late after I ran over from school.

Be yourself?

746
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,400
Do you think you have achieved all this

747
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,520
on your own?

748
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Ask your sister.

749
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
She knows better of it.
