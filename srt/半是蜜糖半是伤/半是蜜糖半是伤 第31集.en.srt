00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,640
Looks like I need to think

175
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,170
about what to get you on my next business trip.

176
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,640
I’ll go back to work now.

177
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,040
Okay.

178
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,960
You know what?

179
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
There’s an Internet-famous restaurant
named Moon House.

180
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,520
The food is quite nice there. Have you tried it?

181
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,320
No.

182
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
Will you take me there?

183
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,040
Sure.

184
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,840
Really?

185
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,960
Mr. Chen!

186
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,680
Mr. Chen!

187
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,460
I heard that you graduated
from an elite school.

188
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
No wonder you are so successful
at such a young age.

189
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,920
Your girlfriend must feel pressured.

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,960
I don’t think so.

191
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,280
Mr. Chen is such a considerate gentleman.

192
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,760
Whoever gets to date him

193
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,240
must have saved the world in another life.

194
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,400
I’m so flattered.

195
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,620
It’s not like that.

196
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,000
-It’s exactly like that!
-You are being modest!

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
Don’t you have work to do?

198
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,490
-Miss Shen!
-Miss Shen!

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Let me!

200
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,040
My dearest Xin,

201
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
are you angry with me?

202
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,210
Why would I be angry?

203
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,360
Listen.

204
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,760
I was just here to get some water.

205
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,200
I heard them talking about

206
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,480
how nice the new restaurant

207
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,720
Moon House is.

208
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,000
-And then they praised you.
-I…

209
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
So you were on cloud nine,

210
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,880
right?

211
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,600
No! No!

212
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,250
I wasn’t!

213
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,440
Seriously! That wasn’t the case!

214
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,720
It’s not like what you thought!

215
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,360
Because I…

216
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,880
I heard there was a nice restaurant.

217
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,690
So I wanted to treat my girlfriend some nice food.

218
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,160
How about this?

219
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Let’s go there together after work?

220
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I don’t have time.

221
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,040
It’s okay.

222
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,280
We can go home after work

223
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,090
and I’ll cook you Western food.

224
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
Let go! We are at work!

225
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,960
I overheard that Mr. Chen would cook in person.

226
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,240
Why am I not invited?

227
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,400
Hey, you scared me!

228
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,690
Go away, single guy!

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,720
It’s not up to you.

230
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,850
The hostess hasn’t said anything yet.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,720
Well,

232
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,780
my hostess,

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,920
seriously,

234
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,120
I swear in the name of my doctorate
from Stanford University.

235
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
I didn’t betray you.

236
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,220
Xiang Ding,

237
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,780
come visit us this weekend for a meal.

238
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay.

239
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,440
This Sunday,

240
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
at 6:00 p.m.

241
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,560
Thanks, bro!

242
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,180
[TOWER 1]

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
Hello, Mr. Du.

244
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,260
I’ll be their office soon.

245
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,480
It’s said GE is also involved in this Fengchao case.

246
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,200
Be alert.

247
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,320
Okay, I got it.

248
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,490
I’m so sorry,

249
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,960
but Mr. Dong’s schedule is very tight recently.

250
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,320
I’ll make you an appointment
as soon as he’s free.

251
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,040
It’s alright.

252
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,560
You can call me at any time.

253
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:12,960
Okay.

254
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,440
Bye.

255
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,140
Mr. Yuan, it’s such a small world.

256
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,610
Morning, Ms. Jiang.

257
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,280
Mr. Yuan, you are quite an actor.

258
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,720
You play my lover at night,

259
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,040
but my rival during the day.

260
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,000
For all this time,

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,860
you didn’t blow your cover at all.

262
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,960
Life is life, and work is work.

263
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
I’m just trying to be professional.

264
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,520
Okay.

265
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,610
Then from now on,

266
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,580
let’s play fair with no cheating.

267
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,000
By the way,

268
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,360
Fengchao has caught the attention
of many investment banks.

269
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,680
But it’s very difficult to meet
its founder Dong Qi.

270
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,200
How about you?

271
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Do you have any idea?

272
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,320
I’m just an insignificant VP.

273
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,800
What kinda idea would I have?

274
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,480
Isn’t Dong Qi your alumnus?

275
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,120
Don’t you have the alumni association?

276
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
Dong Qi is my alumnus?

277
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,040
You don’t know?

278
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,520
Of course, I do!

279
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,800
But he graduated early.

280
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,730
Seldom do people know him
in our alumni association.

281
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,480
Okay.

282
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,120
If nothing else, I’ll hang up now.

283
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,560
Bye.

284
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,160
It’s my phone.

285
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,400
I know it’s yours.

286
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,050
I’m cleaning the table, so I have to remove it.

287
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,360
Miss Jiang,

288
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,800
according to Article 24 of the rules of Room 702,

289
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
it’s your turn to clean the dishes today.

290
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,060
Please watch your attitude and finish your job.

291
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,120
Okay, Landlord Yuan.

292
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,130
Please answer it for me.

293
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,760
Wait!

294
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,560
Is it Ms. Jiang?

295
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,160
New apartment building! You can buy
one apartment for 980,000 yuan!

296
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,290
Are you interested?

297
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,880
No, thanks.

298
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,060
Miss Jiang.

299
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,280
I thought it was Mr. Dong calling you

300
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,920
since you were so anxious.

301
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,690
How could I get a hold of him?

302
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,280
It’s mine.

303
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,600
Hello?

304
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,240
Okay.

305
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
I don’t think the morning would work.

306
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,360
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

307
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,890
Okay. Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

308
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,080
Alright. Bye.

309
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,280
Who wants to meet you?

310
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,680
Mr. He of Rongxing.

311
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,000
We’ll have a video conference
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,800
Why do you ask?

313
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,040
Nothing.

314
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,930
Who’s calling, Miss Jiang?

315
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,160
It’s that realtor again.

316
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,800
He always calls to sell me an apartment.

317
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
How can I afford that?

318
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,260
I’ll go change my clothes.

319
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,720
Wealth.

320
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,360
Today is your opportunity to prove your loyalty.

321
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,880
I’ll

322
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,560
count on you.

323
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Hello? Senior Sister,

324
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,480
how is it going?

325
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,800
You are lucky.

326
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,840
One of the persons in charge
of our alumni association

327
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,440
was Dong Qi’s college roommate.

328
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,200
He heard that Dong Qi would

329
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,240
go to DT Aid tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

330
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,560
to promote his public welfare plan.

331
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,880
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.,

332
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,760
DT, right?

333
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
That’s great! Thank you so much.

334
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,520
I really appreciate your help.

335
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,840
You are so welcome.

336
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,480
When we were in the college association,

337
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
you also helped me write the reports.

338
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
It’s just a small favor. Don’t mention it.

339
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,200
By the way,

340
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,400
the activity tomorrow requires tickets.

341
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,000
You’d better get one online.

342
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,800

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,200
But you are already out, Ma’am.

515
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,360
But I’m the Ma’am you love,

516
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,960
Mister!

517
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,050
Then let the Mister take good care of you
when we are home.

518
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,930
What are you doing here?

519
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,640
Allow me to introduce.

520
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,520
This is Jia Yuanji,

521
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,410
my administrative assistant.

522
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,120
You… You are the son of GE’s CEO!

523
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,680
You are okay to be his administrative assistant?

524
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
It’s my pleasure

525
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,240
to serve Mr. Yuan.

526
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,410
Mr. Yuan,

527
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,040
you still have a video conference

528
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,800
with Mr. He of Rongxing.

529
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,490
Let’s go.

530
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,760
I’m leaving, Ms. Jiang.

531
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,800
You’ll be dead when you are home!

532
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,880
Hello? Li, what’s wrong?

533
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
You feel sick?

534
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,540
Don’t panic! I’ll be right there!

535
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,940
[Outpatient Department]

536
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,820
[Scientific Testing]

537
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,960
Slow down! Slow down!

538
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,980
You’ll hurt my nominal daughter!

539
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,040
My God! You…

540
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,000
Slow down.

541
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,440
No. 11.

542
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,880
Don’t make it a big deal.

543
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,680
It’s just a size of a pea.

544
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,770
Since you are pregnant,

545
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,480
you must need more nutrition.

546
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,720
Do you want chicken soup, or…

547
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,400
Stop! Stop!

548
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,800
Don’t mention chicken!

549
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,440
Xiaochuan cooks chicken soup for me every day.

550
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
And now, as soon as I hear the word chicken,

551
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,500
I feel like I’m a bowl of chicken soup.

552
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,760
You have no idea

553
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,440
how lucky you are!

554
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,000
Do you know

555
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
what Yuan Shuai and I have eaten the most

556
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,480
at home these months?

557
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,440
Rice and scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

558
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,180
And I have to clean the dishes.

559
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,520
Women have different ways to realize their

560
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,250
self-value.

561
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,040
Think about it. With or without me,
there’s no difference to our company.

562
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,360
But my Xiaochuan

563
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,530
definitely can’t live without me.

564
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,490
So, family is my stage for realizing my value.

565
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,700
You, however, are a career woman.

566
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,490
So the workplace is your stage.

567
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,880
Therefore,

568
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,240
the two stages are good in different ways.

569
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,800
Right?

570
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,160
Good for you, Li!

571
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,680
Where did you learn

572
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,260
to make a speech like that?

573
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,520
It’s because my Xiaochuan is a
good influence on me.

574
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,280
But, I do need

575
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,320
to have a serious talk with you.

576
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,280
You have to learn to balance your life.

577
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,360
Think about it. You and Yuan Shuai

578
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,880
are always on business trips,

579
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,160
as though you were in
a long-distance relationship.

580
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,080
Aren’t you worried

581
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,040
that it’d affect your relationship?

582
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,680
Moreover,

583
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,640
unlike us, the girls

584
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
nowadays tend to

585
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,680
be very proactive.

586
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,040
Yuan Shuai is handsome and rich.

587
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,440
If another girl steals him from you,

588
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,680
plus his single image…

589
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,240
Stop it!

590
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,920
You made it sound like we were

591
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
about to break up.

592
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,300
I didn’t mean that.

593
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,980
I do believe Yuan Shuai

594
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,050
is a faithful and responsible man.

595
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,880
I was talking about you.

596
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,680
Will you stop being a workaholic

597
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
and care more about your boyfriend,

598
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,840
Jiang Jun?

599
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Do you hear me?

600
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,240
Yes, I do.

601
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,000
No. 12.

602
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,080
Yes. I’m here.

603
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,760
Careful!

604
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,720
Slow down!

605
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,680
Doctor,

606
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,680
is it serious?

607
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,410
It’s okay. You are fine.

608
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,330
Don’t worry.

609
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,650
I don’t. I don’t.

610
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,040
So is there anything I can do

611
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
to make it better?

612
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,050
Don’t eat cold and spicy stuff.

613
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,280
Pay attention to your food,

614
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,740
which is ignored by most of people nowadays.

615
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,840
I will!

616
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,020
And I’ll watch her.

617
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,840
Jun,

618
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,800
do you think I should

619
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,760
call Xiaochuan

620
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,810
and tell him he’ll become a father?

621
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,760
Doctor,

622
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,440
why do you shake your head?

623
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,800
You are not pregnant.

624
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,040
What?

625
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,320
Then…

626
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,920
Why did I feel nauseated

627
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,040
and sick?

628
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,760
They were symptoms

629
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,880
from eating unclean food.

630
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,760
It’s not serious.

631
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,220
You’ll recover after taking some medicine.

632
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,680
It must be a dream.

633
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,520
It was a dream.

634
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,400
Just a dream.

635
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,680
You were dreaming.

636
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,680
You were dreaming.

637
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,000
Our Li was dreaming.

638
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,520
Look.

639
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
I bought your favorite cake for you.

640
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,450
I won’t eat it. I’m on a diet.

641
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,800
What?

642
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,000
You are angry because

643
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
I ruined your meeting with Mr. Dong?

644
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,800
I am not.

645
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,200
Business is business.

646
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,280
I said it myself.

647
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,080
I’m glad that you are not angry.

648
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,980
I’ll go change my clothes now.

649
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,960
Stop!

650
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,520
Sit down.

651
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,380
What? You said you weren’t angry.

652
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,800
Be honest,

653
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,050
whom did you have dinner with tonight?

654
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,520
Mr. He of Rongxing.

655
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,640
And when did Jia Yuanji

656
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,090
become your assistant?

657
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,760
Jia Yuanji?

658
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,680
Half a year ago.

659
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,520
So where’s Su Chang?

660
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,660
I can’t let him

661
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,520
be my assistant forever, right?

662
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,920
He’s been promoted as VP.

663
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,290
And Chairman Jia

664
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,120
wants me to train

665
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,320
Jia Yuanji.

666
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,880
Mr. Yuan, you really can keep secrets.

667
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,560
If I didn’t happen to see him today,

668
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,920
I’d still have no idea.

669
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,200
Because Jia Yuanji is by my side,

670
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,720
no girls come to bother me anymore.

671
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
You don’t know how many girls

672
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,860
Jia Yuanji has stopped from getting close to me.

673
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,680
Actually, I’m worried even more
while Jia Yuanji is with you.

674
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,520
Why?

675
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,800
Because you guys will be surrounded
by more girls.

676
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,040
How can those girls

677
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,560
compare to my girlfriend?

678
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
You’re the sweetest.

679
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Where?

680
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,440
Here.

681
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,560
So smooth-tongued!

682
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,810
Come on. Let’s go to bed.

683
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,840
Yuan Shuai.

684
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,360
Do you think

685
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,760
I spend too little time with you?

686
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,520
Why do you ask that?

687
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,240
Nothing.

688
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,000
When I chatted with Li this afternoon,

689
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,760
she said I worked too hard.

690
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:10,960
Your career

691
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,000
has just taken off.

692
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,480
Getting busier is normal.

693
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,920
I respect all your decisions.

694
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,120
But, as your boyfriend,

695
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,880
I do wanna make your life easier.

696
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,720
Easier? So you’ll support me?

697
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
I will!

698
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,540
I can afford it anyway.

699
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,970
I can afford to support more actually.

700
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,440
Dream on! You wanna support more?

701
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,160
I mean daughters

702
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,160
and sons!

703
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
That’ll be more, right?

704
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,970
Let’s sleep now.

705
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,380
Goodnight.

706
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,940
Goodnight.

707
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,200
I love you.

708
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,980
I love you, too.

709
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,880
I know that.

710
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,480
The bank hasn’t approved

711
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,120
the M&A loan for Baxi, right?

712
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,240
I will meet Director Liu and talk to her today.

713
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,320
Wait for my update.

714
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,320
Okay, we’ll talk about the other things

715
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,920
when I get back to the office.

716
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,720
Bye.

717
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,250
Where are you going?

718
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,610
I’ll give you a ride.

719
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Global Harbor.

720
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,490
Don’t forget to turn the meter on, sir.

721
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,540
Is the Director Liu you mentioned

722
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,640
in charge of the loan approval in the bank?

723
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes.

724
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,300
We’ve been waiting

725
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
for an approval from the bank.

726
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,280
I’ll have a meal with Director Liu today,

727
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,140
and I’ll ask her

728
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,160
about it.

729
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,000
I see.

730
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,600
What? Do you know her?

731
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,880
I met her before.

732
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,320
We are friends, actually.

733
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,800
So,

734
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,240
do you need my help?

735
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,710
You wouldn’t help me for no reason.

736
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
What’s the catch?

737
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Since I ruined your meeting with Mr. Dong,

738
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,520
I should at least make it up to you.

739
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,000
If you need my help,

740
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,400
I’m here for you at any time.

741
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,520
But, you have to follow my lead.

742
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
When we are there,

743
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,600
follow my lead

744
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,710
and play along.

745
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,920
Okay. Looks like my love for you is worth it.

746
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,639
Then I’ll count on you later.

747
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,440
Okay, my queen!

748
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,760
Do you guys know each other?

749
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,880
Yes.

750
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,670
She’s my distant cousin.

751
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,670
She’s also in an investment bank.

752
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,469
Director Liu.

753
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,980
Hope she’ll have your support in the future.

754
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,239
That’s right.

755
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,800
Mr. Yuan is truly my distant cousin!

756
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,200
-Mr. Yuan, what’s wrong?
-What’s the matter, Yuan?

757
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,850
Nothing. It’s just…

758
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,290
They set the A/C temperature too high.

759
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,200
-I’ll have some water.
-You see,

760
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,520
it’s such a small world.

761
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,120
Since you are Yuan’s cousin,

762
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,380
then I’ll consider you as my family, too.

763
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,120
Listen to me.

764
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,680
Due to the issue of the guarantor,

765
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,520
the M&A loan you applied

766
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,400
hasn’t been

767
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,040
approved yet.

768
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,200
I will ask them to call you later

769
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,800
to talk about the details.

770
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
Okay, thanks.

771
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,130
You are welcome.

772
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,360
Yuan,

773
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
I think you lost weight again.

774
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
Here, have some more!

775
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,500
Ms. Liu.

776
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,320
-Don’t worry about me.
-Come on, have more!

777
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,240
-You should have more!
-Go on.

778
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,840
Thank you!

779
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,740
Here! Try this!

780
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,960
Please try the beef.

781
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:36,880
Here.

782
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,240
Yuan,

783
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,500
how is it going with your girlfriend?

784
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,240
She… She’s on a business trip in Hong Kong.

785
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,100
She’ll be back in a couple of days.

786
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,240
You said last time

787
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,160
that she was quite short-tempered.

788
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,120
You are right, Ms. Liu.

789
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,440
She really is.

790
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,400
She’d stab things for no reason!

791
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,960
Listen to me, Yuan.

792
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
You should find a girlfriend

793
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,720
who’s mature and graceful.

794
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,520
Right?

795
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
First,

796
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
she has her own income.

797
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,640
Second,

798
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,880
she won’t be like those young girls

799
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,520
who get angry

800
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,660
and ask for gifts all the time.

801
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,480
Ms. Liu, you are right!

802
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,880
Of course.

803
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
You are right indeed!

804
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,080
When did your girlfriend go to Hong Kong?

805
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,340
How come I didn’t know?

806
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,250
We’ve talked about it earlier.

807
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,980
Why didn’t you follow my lead?

808
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,720
Since I am short-tempered,

809
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,200
I will not follow your lead.

810
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,000
Instead, I’ll get even with you!

811
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,620
That was all for a show.

812
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,280
How could you take it seriously?

813
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,740
I’m just afraid that someone would
suck himself into the show.

814
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,600
Suck himself into the show?

815
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,000
Where did you get this watch?

816
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,200
It’s a gift from my boss,

817
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,240
Du Lei.

818
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,770
I won’t hide it from you.

819
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,580
Take it off.

820
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,560
Why?

821
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,820
Take it off!

822
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,280
It’s an ownership declaration. Got it?

823
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,840
Yes.

824
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Good taste.

825
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,360
Of course.

826
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,080
Because I picked it.

827
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,820
Love Is Sweet
