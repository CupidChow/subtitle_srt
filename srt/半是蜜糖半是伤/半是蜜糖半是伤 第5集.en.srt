[Letter of Resignation]

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,039
You have no idea

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
how helpless I was

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,720
at that moment.

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,120
Luckily, my Prince Charming

10
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,880
suddenly appeared in front of me.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,920
I’m really happy.

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Just thinking about it makes me excited.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,720
Hello, mom.

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Jiang Jun.

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
How is your work?

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Is everything going well?

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,440
Everything goes well. Everyone is friendly.

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,440
I’m fine.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,680
That’s good.

20
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,720
Jiang Jun.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
Listen.

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,880
Don’t ever cry if you get wronged.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,800
You can tell me about it. Got it?

24
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,840
Maybe you can get a boyfriend.

25
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,040
He can take care of you.

26
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,320
Then I will feel relieved.

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Alright, mom.

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,320
No hurry. Just let it be.

29
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
Alright.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
I won’t urge you again. Okay?

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,520
Jiang Jun.

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,120
Look,

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,400
you are in Shanghai alone

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,560
without anybody accompanying you.

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
So be careful all the time,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
you know?

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,280
Please take care, mom.

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,400
I will return when I get a holiday.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Bye-bye.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,440
Your mom?

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,040
Jiang Jun.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,760
How about changing to another job?

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I’ll support you if you can’t get a proper job.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,720
I’ll support you even if I
have to sell instant noodles.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,720
Well.

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,079
You don’t like the big devil, right?

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Leaving him

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,240
is a good thing from another angle.

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,000
Don’t you think so?

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Stop thinking of the resignation letter.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,000
You need to eat first

52
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,600
and then fight with the others.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,960
Hold on, I’ll cook the instant noodles for you.

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
Taking MH as an online game,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,480
which level are you at?

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,840
I’m being kicked out of the newbie area.

57
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,840
It seems you need a teacher.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,079
I’m not

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,760
the top one but kind of experienced

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,520
in the investment industry.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,680
Am I that lucky

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
to be your teacher?

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,720
I have no idea about it right now.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Maybe I can have a try

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
even if there is a slim chance.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,560
Teacher, please accept me as your student.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,390
Seriously? You take me as your teacher online?

68
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,160
I didn’t have a meal today.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Would you mind treating me to a meal?

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,560
Delicious noodles for you.

71
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
Li, enjoy it yourself.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
I have to go out now.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,240
No need to wait.

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
Eat some before leaving.

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,040
Where will she go alone so late?

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
You young girl,

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
why are you going out so late alone?

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,560
It seems I’m caring about her too much.

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,080
You are out alone so late.

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
Are you trying to murder Deng Ke?

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,120
It’s really a good idea.

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,440
But seems the price is too high.

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,680
Don’t worry.

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,920
Nobody else, but you.

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,320
You are the first target

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,760
for me to assassinate.

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,040
Then take care and come back alive early.

88
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,440
I’d wait for dying together with you.

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Bah!

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,440
Excuse me.

91
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,240
Thank you.

92
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:04,770
Thank you.

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,360
Mr. Du,

94
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,480
maybe we can change another place.

95
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
I don’t think this place

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,200
fits your identity very well.

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
Both steak and fried chicken

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,120
make people feel full

99
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
while let people enjoy the delicious food.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
They both give people satiety.

101
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,200
Why do we have to care about
the lowliness or nobleness.

102
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,440
It tastes great.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Alright.

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,240
No matter if I can learn

105
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,480
the essence from you,

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
I’d appreciate you

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
helping me at the critical moment.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
I’d show my respect.

109
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
Alcohol will affect your judgment.

110
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Moreover,

111
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
it’s not about drunken boxing.

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,000
How have you been recently?

113
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,920
There is no room for change.

114
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,800
Is it about Kelang Pharmacy?

115
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
You know it?

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
They have done many things recently.

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
M&A.

118
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Joint board of directors.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,560
I heard of it.

120
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,160
My mistake. I was sure of success.

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,920
But we got a weak teammate.

122
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,280
What do you mean by that?

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Simply speaking,

124
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,640
we doubted that

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
one senior leader of Kelang was stained.

126
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,080
Unexpectedly, our witness

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
went wrong at the critical moment.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,600
We were then defeated at last.

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,480
He went wrong at the critical moment.

130
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
You think he had important evidence?

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,040
Do you mean he did that on purpose?

132
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,120
Deng Ke is a person

133
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,680
good at making psychological attacks.

134
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
A boss like him

135
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
wouldn't have foolish staff.

136
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,000
What does that mean?

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Remember,

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,280
no matter what kind of company,

139
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,080
it will cover its shortcomings

140
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
and pretend everything is going well

141
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,520
at the first moment

142
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,480
when it faces huge interests.

143
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
You need to find out the truth,

144
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,120
but not just seeing documents they offered.

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Documents can be feigned and deceive people.

146
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,360
While backstage and data

147
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,880
are always traceable.

148
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,800
You are right.

149
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,800
The thing shouldn’t be that simple.

150
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,280
Excuse me, Miss.

151
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
We are on the anniversary.

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
Every lady can have this as a gift.

153
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,120
Please accept it.

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Thank you.

155
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,440
Also please show my appreciation to your boss.

156
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,120
OK.

157
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,030
I didn’t expect this bonus.

158
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
See?

159
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
You are getting luckier.

160
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,800
She will probably be fired,

161
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,280
but she even feels like dating a man.

162
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,720
Remember your good luck.

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,400
Thank you.

164
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
She even received a flower.

165
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,920
Drive safely.

166
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
Fine, Jiang Jun.

167
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,360
You asked me to rediscover you.

168
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,320
Is that what you want me to rediscover?

169
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Well.

170
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,920
Wait and see.

171
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I will show you how.

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Comparisons are odious.

173
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,800
People are always different.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
Both work in investment industry,

175
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,840

349

Look, you are

350
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,120
interesting.

351
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,520

352

To betting to bear.

Hello.

357
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,880
Nice to meet you.

358
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Nice to meet you.

After signing the contract,

360
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,440
we may play golf sometime.

361
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,320
You have the final say.

Please sit.

363
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,880
Great.

364
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,880
Why hasn’t she taken the agreement?

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,840
I will go check it.

366
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,600
Why is it her?

367
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,840
Mr. Yuan

368
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
gave her the chance.

369

Mr. Fan.

370
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,640
MH is so tolerant.

371
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800
You gave a chance to the person

372
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,000
who made such a big mistake.

373
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
I believe Mr. Deng

374
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,320
is also an easy person.

375
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,480
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here today.

376

Yeah.

377
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,880
Arranging her to take the contract

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,720
is letting her know better about

379

He has the evidence Mr. Deng transferring

corporate assets to his private bank account.

But you made us confused on purpose

and cheated

Sorry, Mr. Deng.

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,960
I was just scolding you in the company

522
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,200
but not learning your personal information.

523
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360
Giving birth to a second child?

524
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,640
Bah. I’m single now.

525
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,880
Don’t talk nonsense.

526
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,640
Does your ex-wife live an extremely good life?

527
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,920
Her new husband

528
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,520
is much better than you, right?

529
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,800
Sorry to tell.

530
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,800

Got it.

533
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
A nobody becomes rich suddenly

534
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,520

535
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,040
You are exactly right.

536
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,320
There are too many beauties in a big city

537
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,320
like Shanghai.

538

Everyone is very charming.

539
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
I really don’t know which one to pick.

542

Sorry.

543
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,840

The most expensive one for two.

548

She will pay the bill.

549

116 yuan.

550
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,200
You are a regular customer. 110 yuan is okay.

551
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,680
Turn it over and pay by scanning it.

Let’s go.

570

How is it?

571
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,400
I learned to make it

572
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,720
because I wanted to have Chinese food abroad.

573
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,440
After a while, I could almost make it well.

574
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,640
But I still remember

575
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,920
the rice noodles your dad made.

576
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,720
I tried replicate his recipe many times,

577
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,840
but failed.

578
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,240
After I returned,

579
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,360
I accidentally found this restaurant.

580
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,280
It tastes nice.

581
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,000
Of course it’s not as good as your dad’s,

582
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,040
but it’s not easy to reach this level.

583
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,120
So I brought you here to try it.

584
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,920
My dad invited you to have meals

585
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,320
so that you would take care of me.

586
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,960
You were pleased with the meals.

587
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,360
But you spared no effort in bullying me.

588
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,960
You only intended to let me see the light

589
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
by helping me in the matter of Kelang?

590
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,480
You want to hear the truth or lie?

591
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,960
The truth of course.

592
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,480
I intended to apologize.

593
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,440
I owe you an apology

How dare you mention that?

596
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,670
I was almost killed.

597
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,920
How can you say that lightly?

598
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
I know the matter of the speech

599

caused serious consequences.

I didn’t expect you would

606
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,240
put it together with the speech.

00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,800
I have your speech.

695
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,680
It isn’t missing.

696
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,840
Look.

697
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
It’s you.

698
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,800
You…

699
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,360
Wake up. Jiang Jun.

700
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,600
Jiang Jun.

701
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,760
Jiang Jun.

702
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,880
Jiang Jun.

703
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,560
Alright.

704
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,200
Stop crying.

705
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,200
I’ve said it.

706
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,320
Jiang Jun will feel sad

707
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,720
if she sees you like this

708
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:20,960
when she wakes up.

709
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,880
You know she can’t burst into tears.

710
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,480
My poor Jiang Jun.

711
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,360
I wonder whom she has offended at school.

712
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,640
Why did the person steal her speech?

713
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,280
Maybe it’s the mischief of her classmates.

714
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,040
They can’t do that even it’s a mischief.

715
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,440
Didn’t they know Jiang Jun’s illness is special?

716
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,840
You are right.

717
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,200
But it just happened.

718
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,600
Don’t be sad anymore.

719
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,720
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

720
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,920
My pleasure.

721
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
What did the doctor say?

722
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,840
She was brought here without delay.

723
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,680
So there is no big deal.

724
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,400
But we have to pay more attention in the future.

725
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,680
It will be very hard if it recurs.

726
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,840
Thanks to the boy who brought her here.

727
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,720
Jiang Jun.

728
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,840
You are awake?

729
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,880
Dad.

730
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,280
I want to transfer to another school.

731
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,200
It’ll be okay.

732
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,800
I will contact the school

733
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,080
proper for you.

734
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,600
You won’t feel

735
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,480
that stressed in different environment.

736
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,840
Ling.

737
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,320
Where is Jiang Jun?

738
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,480
She transferred to another school.

739
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,280
Transfer?

740
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,520
I’m late. I have to go.

741
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,360
Yuan Shuai.

742
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,840
It’s too late.

743
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,160
Come on. Get on.

744
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,620
Love Is Sweet
