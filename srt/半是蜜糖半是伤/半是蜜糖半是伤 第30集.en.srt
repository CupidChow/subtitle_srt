Love Is Sweet

Episode 30

5
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,940
Sister.

6
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,500
It all came to a good end.

7
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,740
Why do you still wear such a bitter face?

8
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,020
Give me a smile.

9
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,820
I didn't think it would end like this

10
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,660
You didn't do anything wrong.

11
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,620
This is the end I deserve.

12
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,100
Thank you for telling me,

13
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,380
so that I won’t be wrong any more.

14
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
It makes me feel good

15
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,579
to say this now.

16
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,100
Du,

17
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,660
thank you for showing me that

18
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,300
to truly love someone

19
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,620
is to give him what he needs,

20
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,380
not what I think

21
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,540
he needs.

22
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,060
You know I don't apologize easily.

23
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,460
I'm sorry that

24
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,060
my selfish love to you

25
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,860
has hurt you so much

26
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,620
for so long.

27
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,180
For the rest of your life,

28
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,020
just do whatever you want to do

29
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,860
and pursue whatever you want to pursue.

30
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,100
When you feel tired,

31
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,860
just go home.

32
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,180
The Du family is always your home.

33
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,460
Sister,

34
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,980
stop.

35
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,579
I know.

36
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,740
I'll take care of dad for you.

37
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,740
We will always be one family.

38
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,540
Okay,

39
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,860
I’ve got to go now.

40
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,900
Take care.

41
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,420
Jiang Jun!

42
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,060
Jiang Jun,

43
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,580
listen to me.

44
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,580
I have a good reason for this.

45
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,340
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,420
Will you forgive me?

47
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,980
Crazy… Crazy bitch,

48
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,540
why do you beat Yuan Shuai?

49
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,500
Who is the crazy bitch?

50
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,540
You!

51
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,500
No. You’re…

52
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,020
Jiang Jun,

53
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,180
ignore him.

54
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
He's just a kid.

55
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,100
brother,

56
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,180
does she have something on you?

57
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,260
Jia Yuanji.

58
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,780
Yuan Shuai.

59
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,980
Shut up!

60
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,580
What's the matter?

61
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,740
What are you doing?

62
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,420
Hello, my name is Jia Yuanji.

63
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,300
Whose kid is this?

64
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,500
Bye.

65
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,220
Jiang Jun!

66
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,100
Jiang Jun.

67
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,260
Jiang Jun, I’m home.

68
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,660
Jun.

69
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,580
Jun, open the door.

70
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Honey,

71
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,100
I bought some chestnuts you like.

72
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,420
Her birthday.

73
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,220
My birthday.

74
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,940
Her mother's birthday?

75
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,340
It's over. It's over.

76
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,980
I can't even get into my house.

77
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,420
Honey, open the door. Honey.

78
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,659
Honey, open the door.

79
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,420
I know you won't be so cruel.

80
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,780
I bought some chestnuts you like.

81
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,740
What do you mean?

82
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,620
Can't you see?

83
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,340
Congratulations!

84
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,660
You are kicked out of the house.

85
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,520
You've gone too far, Jiang Jun.

86
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,040
It can’t be worse than certain people
working with others

87
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,760
to hide the truth from me.

88
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,920
I had a good reason for doing that.

89
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,440
I can explain it to you.

90
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,240
I know.

91
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,400
If you know, why are you still doing this to me?

92
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,480
I do this

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,760
for a good reason, too.

94
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
What reason do you have?

95
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,640
You don't need to know.

96
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
You just need to know

97
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm also doing this for your own good.

98
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,720
Jiang Jun, good for you.

99
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
You changed the password.

100
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,440
I'm not allowed to enter the house.

101
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,440
I bought you chestnuts and you didn't want them.

102
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,760
What do you want?

103
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,280
I apologized to you so sincerely,

104
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,840
and yet you still don't forgive me.

105
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,160
You could meet a better man than me?

106
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,200
I don't believe it.

107
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
You're drinking here all by yourself

108
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,200
without me.

109
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
You are not enough of a friend!

110
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,120
Thank you.

111
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
Buy it yourself. It's mine.

112
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,360
Why are you so mean?

113
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,520
After all, we've been through a lot together.

114
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't turn your back on me.

115
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,360
The whole Lin Taimo thing is over.

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,480
When do you intend to leave MH?

117
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
When am I leaving?

118
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,600
I haven't thought about leaving.

119
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,160
Why?

120
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
Aren't you going to leave MH?

121
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
Look.

122
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,760
I had been out of work for a long time

123
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
since I left GE.

124
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,600
I've wanted to do something.

125
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Besides, I think MH is good.

126
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,600
I like it very much.

127
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,760
You like MH,

128
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,080
or you like the people in MH?

129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,480
To be exact,

130
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,560
both.

131
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,800
What?

132
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,440
You’re so nervous.

133
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,960
Are you afraid I'm too close to Jiang Jun?

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,040
Are you kidding?

135
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,440
Would I be nervous because of you, Du Lei?

136
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,840
I don't think you're seeing
the situation clearly.

137
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,440
Jiang Jun had already made her choice.

138
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,280
Situation is something that can change.

139
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,840
You two aren't back together yet?

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,800
It's none of your business.

141
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,040
Thank you for telling me the good news.

142
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,720
Drink?

143
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,600
This is my drink! Buy it yourself.

144
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,480
I guess I'll have to think about

145
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,040
what I shall do to ask her out for dinner
this weekend.

146
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,920
Waiter,

147
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,920
I want a bottle more expensive than his.
I want to celebrate.

148
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,520
You have money, right? Okay.

149
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,280
Waiter,

150
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
this bottle is on him, too.

151
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,560
-Jun.
-Li.

152
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,800
By the way,

153
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
why do you want to go shopping today?

154
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
It's now clear about what happened to my dad.

155
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,960
I just want to go home in a few days,

156
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,360
talk to my mother about it,

157
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,760
and buy her some clothes.

158
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,640
It's a little too long.

159
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,680
This is not bad.

160
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,000
This must be warm.

161
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,520
Du Lei, you bastard!

162
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,960
It’s you!

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,920
Yuan Shuai.

164
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,040
I’m hungry.

165
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,560
Hungry?

166
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,600
Will you treat me to dinner?

167
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,000
Sure. What would you like to eat?

168
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,040
Pizza.

169
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,160
Pizza? Alright.

170
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,720
Ok.

171
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,160
-Where is it?
-Let’s go.

172
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,160
Which floor?

173
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,440
It's on the ground floor or the first floor?

174
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:05,920
I forgot.

Li,

195
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,120
three-legged toads are hard to find

196
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
but two-legged men are everywhere.

but she gave me the cold shoulder.

and hide the truth from me.

215

it was for my own good.

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,960
and believe that

519
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,480
you would be willing to

520
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,120
bear all the risks with me.

521
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,800
What's worse,

522
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,680
I kept everything from you

523
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,840
in the name of protecting you.

524
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,000
If…

525
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,240
If anything were to happen to me,

526
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,760
you would…

527
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,080
You would have no one to complain to.

528
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,760
I’m sorry, Jiang Jun.

529
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,360
So narcissistic.

530
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm serious.

531
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,720
If you can forgive me,

532
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,000
I’ll do whatever you want me to do.

533
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,480
Ok.

534
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,680
Didn’t you say

535
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,720
I can bully you the way you bullied me?

536
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,520
I already figured out how to punish you.

537
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,200
Come here.

538
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,520
Jiang Jun,

539
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,760
Are… are you serious?

540
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,520
Come here!

541
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,280
No.

542
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,520
Jiang Jun.

543
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,680
Jiang Jun. No.

544
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,280
It’s so childish.

545
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,080
You really want to hit me in the palm?

546
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,720
Who said anything about hitting you in the palm?

547
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,960
I'm going to hit you on the buttocks.

548
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,440
Buttocks?

549
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,640
Get ready.

550
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,680
-You…
-Get ready!

551
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,360
Can you feel ashamed?

552
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,640
Hit me on the buttocks?

553
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,480
Let go of me.

554
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,360
No, I won’t.

555
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,560
Let go of me!

556
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,760
No!

557
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,080
Yuan Shuai,

558
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,560
you only get one shot.

559
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,480
Will you take it?

560
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,120
If not, let’s break up nicely.

561
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,720
Jiang Jun, good for you!

562
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,760
Come on!

563
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,600
Get ready.

564
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,120
You're good at acting  it.

565
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,640
I haven’t started yet.

566
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,640
Get ready!

567
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,880
Be gentle.

568
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,680
Ok. Ok.

569
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,720
It must be gentle.

570
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,000
Gentle?

571
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,400
Will you admit your mistake or not?

572
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,500
[Class 3, Grade 1]

573
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,960
Do you remember this street?

574
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,720
When we were children,

575
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,920
we used to walk this street every day
to and from school.

576
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,600
I don’t remember.

577
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,720
How long are you gonna give me
the cold shoulder?

578
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,480
How long have you been away?

579
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,360
All right.

580
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,800
It doesn't matter.

581
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,200
Anyway, I have been waiting for you
for more than ten years,

582
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,080
and I don't care to wait a few more days.

583
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,840
I’m telling you, Jiang Jun.

584
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,000
I'll always be there for you.

585
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,760
You can only be mine.

586
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,080
Brother Yuanyuan,

587
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,800
how long are you going to bully me?

588
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,920
As long as you keep crying,

589
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,360
I’ll bully you.

590
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,560
Thank you, Brother Yuanyuan.

591
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,880
Let’s go.

592
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,240
Brother Yuanyuan.

593
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,120
How long are you going to bully me?

594
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I will never bully you again.

595
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,280
From now on,

596
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,440
I will only protect you.

597
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,120
How?

598
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,520
Hold you tight

599
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,440
and never let you go.

600
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,340
Love Is Sweet
