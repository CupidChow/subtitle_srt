1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,800
This technique needs to be a sign of

2
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
It's nutritious and healthy.

3
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
He has been in love with me for so many years,

4
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
but he didn't tell me.

5
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
If you knew earlier, you wouldn't have told me.

6
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
That's because I was confident in you before.

7
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
But now, I regret it.

8
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I really had a brain hemorrhage,

9
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
so I was willing to keep you in MH.

10
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I think you really want me to resign

11
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
and say anything.

12
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I don't want to talk to you.

13
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Jiang Jun!

14
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
What attitude is that?

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
That's my attitude!

16
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm doing this for your own good!

17
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Have you got off work yet?

18
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Do you want to eat? I'll buy it for you.

19
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Braised beef, pork, sweet and sour fish,

20
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
fried chicken, fried chicken, and barbecue.

21
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Jiang Jun, I'm off work.

22
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Qiao Qiao, you're off work.

23
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Why are you sleeping here?

24
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Didn't you say you wouldn't let me look for you?

25
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
You didn't reply to my messages.

26
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
So I had to wait here.

27
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I fell asleep while I was waiting.

28
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Are you stupid?

29
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Can't you just call and ask?

30
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
And what's wrong with your face?

31
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Did you fight?

32
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Qiao Qiao, are you caring about me?

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Let me tell you, this injury

34
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
was caused by my sword, Yong Wei.

35
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
This is called the heart attack of my man.

36
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Can you help me blow this?

37
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
You want your face to be injured and you'll have to face the enemy, right?

38
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
And don't you have to go to work every day?

39
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,800
You're the Crown Prince and you're always busy.

40
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Qiao Qiao, that's not right.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I finished my work early.

42
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
My brother gave me a week off.

43
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,800
To look up to you, I've been studying Chinese,

44
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
finance, and law for the past two years.

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm really, really looking for you.

46
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Then you...

47
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
keep going.

48
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Qiao Qiao, you mean...

49
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
I can look for you?

50
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I didn't say that.

51
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Right, you must be hungry.

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Do you want to eat something?

53
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
When I asked you, you didn't say what you wanted to eat.

54
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
So I just bought you whatever I saw.

55
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
I don't know if you like it or not.

56
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I never go out.

57
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Let's go.

58
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
I'll take you out to eat.

59
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I'll take you out to eat.

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Wow.

61
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Wow.

62
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Wow.

63
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
It smells so good.

64
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Look at this today.

65
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
The colors match the brightness.

66
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Which one should I eat first?

67
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Which one should I eat first?

68
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I'll eat the beef first.

69
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
It's so delicious.

70
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh my god.

71
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It's so delicious.

72
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I admire my own sugar.

73
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
It's so delicious.

74
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
It's so delicious.

75
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
It's so delicious.

76
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Wow.

77
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
My stomach hurts suddenly.

78
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
My stomach hurts.

79
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm so hungry.

80
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,240
Where do you

124
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,160
Wonder Challenge

125
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
On Christmas Day

126
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
What are you doing?

127
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
Chuhe Hanjie, a Chinese

128
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I will sleep like this from today

129
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
If you dare to cross the line, you will die

130
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
General

131
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
You let me come, but I still don't come

132
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
What if you come?

133
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
If I come, I will sleep like a pig

134
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Who comes is a pig

135
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Who comes is a pig

136
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
You

137
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
You are really playing, right?

138
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
General

139
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
You sleep on the quilt

140
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
You just give me a blanket

141
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
You

142
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
You are really cruel

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
I also want to sleep on the quilt

144
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
What are you doing?

145
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Give it back to me

146
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Give it back to me

147
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Give me back my quilt

148
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Give me back my quilt

149
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Let go

150
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Let go

151
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Don't cross the line

152
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
General

153
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
You are too much

154
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Ok

155
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
If you can cross the line, then don't cross the line

156
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Who is a pig?

157
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
What is so happy?

158
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
What are you doing?

159
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
You wear sunglasses in the day and think you are a star?

160
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I didn't sleep at all

161
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
What are you doing?

162
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I am suspecting that I am sick

163
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
You are sick again?

164
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Where are you sick?

165
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I am the one you think of

166
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
You are drinking low-fat tea in the morning

167
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Aren't you afraid of your skin being dehydrated?

168
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
I can't help it

169
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
I had a good night's sleep last night

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I have to save myself

171
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
You had a night's sleep?

172
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
I just ate

173
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
What are you wearing?

174
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Ghosts

175
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I just

176
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I just

177
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
I just

178
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
I just

179
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
I just

180
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
I just

181
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Boss

182
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
You are in the office

183
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Why don't you take off your glasses?

184
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
You two are fighting too much

185
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
He

186
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
He made a mess with me

187
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
He put a long stick

188
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
He left me a little space

189
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
I am not left-handed

190
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
I am not right-handed

191
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
He is lying beside me

192
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
I am used to it

193
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
But I can't

194
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
So I can't sleep

195
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
You are done

196
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
You are totally done

197
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
I think

198
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Apologize for your life

199
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Apologize?

200
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Why should I apologize?

201
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
It's his fault

202
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
I apologize to him

203
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Why should I?

204
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Listen

205
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
According to my observation

206
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Do you think he had a good night's sleep last night?

207
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
He didn't sleep last night

208
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I lost

209
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
You two

210
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
You are perfect

211
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
But

212
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
General is in good health

213
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Do you want him to stay up with you?

214
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I tell you

215
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
General is the worst

216
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
He must resign tonight

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Listen

218
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
I am in a bad mood

219
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Brother, if you have any work

220
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Just tell me

221
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
I promise to do it for you

222
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
I promise

223
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Qi Shao

224
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
You are so angry

225
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
What's the good thing?

226
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Nothing good

227
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Just a meeting

228
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Brother Qiao Na is in a good mood

229
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
We are not that good

230
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
We just had a good night's sleep

231
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
And shared our childhood

232
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
The childhood

233
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
The childhood

234
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
You are right

235
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Brother, you don't understand

236
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
I am in pain

237
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
I am happy

238
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Ok, ok, go to work

239
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Ok, ok, go to work

240
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
You don't congratulate me?

241
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I am happy

242
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
You don't congratulate me?

243
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Su Sheng

244
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Qi Shao

245
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Your brother is so happy today

246
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Let's change the store

247
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Hello

248
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
The ring you ordered has arrived

249
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
When can you pick it up?

250
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Ok, I will be right back

251
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
She just left for a few days

252
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
So fast

253
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Tomorrow, new colleagues will come

254
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
So today you have to clean up

255
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
All of them

256
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Give it to me

257
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
I printed the photo

258
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
I printed one

259
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I think I forgot

260
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
You can keep this photo

261
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
You two keep it

262
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Hello, Shen Xing

263
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Shen Xing

264
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
I have something to ask you

265
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
When I was on vacation at home

266
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Did you hear anything strange?

267
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
It's normal every day

268
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
The strangest thing

269
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Is that the newspaper was leaked

270
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
What about Mr. Du?

271
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
I remember I just took a vacation

272
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
You were always with him

273
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
Then you transferred to Mr. Qiao

274
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Speaking of Mr. Du

275
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
There is something strange

276
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
One day I was in a hurry

277
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
To ask him to sign

278
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
I knocked on his door and entered his office

279
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Don't worry, we have told you

280
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Still follow the last year's notice

281
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Chen Jianhui and I will handle it

282
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Ok, since you are sincere

283
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I will not go

284
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,840
He said on the phone

285
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
That the return of the newspaper

286
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Will be done according to last year's

287
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
He has already done

288
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
What happened?

289
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Nothing, just me

290
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
My conclusion is

291
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,840
Du Lei, he knew

292
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,840
There is a better solution

293
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Still insisted on firing Xiangding and Shen Xing

294
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
He has a reason

295
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I suspect it's Xiangding and Shen Xing

296
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
They know what makes Du Lei afraid

297
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Have to leave

298
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,840
How's the interview?

299
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
I have several

300
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Can't

301
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840
What about Shangding?

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Same

303
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What's your plan?

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Want to join the investment bank?

305
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I love this job

306
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So many years

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I finally borrowed these experience and connections

308
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I really don't want to give up

309
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Plus

310
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Chen Yicheng knows this

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He is also very uncomfortable

312
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So I decided

313
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
To try it

314
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Remember?

315
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Right, remember is also recruiting

316
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
But

317
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
It's not easy

318
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Actually I know

319
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
The investment bank

320
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
If there is no recommendation

321
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
It's almost impossible to be used

322
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Plus the news of SKL

323
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
It's all over the place

324
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Even if I write on the resignation certificate

325
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Personal reasons

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
There is no hope

327
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Jiang Jun

328
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Actually I asked you today

329
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
I have an unexpected request

330
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
You say

331
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
I will try my best to help you

332
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Isn't Mr. Yuan remembering?

333
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I want you

334
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Write a letter of recommendation for him

335
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
By the way, clarify

336
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
The news of SKL

337
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
It really has nothing to do with us

338
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Forget it, Jiang Jun

339
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Don't make it difficult

340
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
I didn't say this

341
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
No, don't misunderstand

342
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I think it's good, I'll go back

343
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Really?

344
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Of course

345
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Thank you, Jiang Jun

346
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Every time I am most difficult to help me

347
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
It's okay

348
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Mr. Yuan

349
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Welcome to Zokai diamond ring custom

350
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
I'll get the ring

351
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Ok, wait a minute, I'll get it for you

352
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Sir, your diamond ring

353
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Please confirm

354
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Please sign the letter of recommendation

355
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Ok

356
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Mr. Du

357
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
This flower is called

358
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
This is a flower shop called Air Flower

359
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
And this card

360
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
For me?

361
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Ok, go to play

362
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Mr. Du

363
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
What can I do for you?

364
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
I want to make tea

365
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Thank you

366
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Wait for me after work

367
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I have something to tell you

368
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Jiang Jun

369
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Jiang Jun

370
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Wang Si Cai

371
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Look what a good thing dad brought back

372
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Look

373
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Is it beautiful?

374
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Look

375
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Look

376
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Your dad

377
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Is going to propose to your mom

378
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
But now

379
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
You should suffer first

380
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
I'm sorry

381
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Mr. Du

382
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
You said you have something to eat

383
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Eating is not eating

384
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Sit

385
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Why do you have a cake?

386
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
What day is it today?

387
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Think about it again

388
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Sorry

389
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
I forgot it's your birthday today

390
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
It's a pity that you are off work

391
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Otherwise, I can let everyone spend time with you

392
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
No need

393
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
You can help me with the old rules

394
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Then make a wish

395
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
I know you don't like birthday songs

396
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
I want to hear today

397
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Sing

398
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Ok

399
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Happy birthday to you

400
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Happy birthday to you

401
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Make a wish

402
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Ok

403
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Here.

404
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,800
What did you make?

405
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
A secret.

406
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,040
There's a bottle of wine. I'll get it.

407
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I'll be right back.

408
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
What?

409
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
I forgot to take my dog's delivery.

410
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Help me get it when you come back.

411
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,800
I brought this wine from France.

412
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,280
It's from France today.

413
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,800
Jiang Jun, you're with Du Lei now.

414
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I have something to do at the office.

415
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,720
You can go get it yourself.

416
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,640
Jiang Jun, I'm warning you.

417
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,840
If you dare drink, you're dead.

418
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I...

419
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Young Master Yuan is worried about you.

420
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
You're with Du Lei?

421
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Where?

422
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You're still at the office?

423
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Well...

424
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
I know you can't drink.

425
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
You can drink juice.

426
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Okay.

427
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I'll drink with you.

428
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Here.

429
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Happy birthday.

430
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Thank you.

431
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I remember when I first met you,

432
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,480
you were a young girl who just got married.

433
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Now, you're a VP.

434
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I should thank you for taking care of me

435
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
for so many years.

436
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't be where I am today.

437
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You haven't called me Mr. Du in a long time.

438
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Really?

439
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well,

440
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
you've been feeling unwell.

441
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I've thought about it.

442
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
From tomorrow,

443
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
you can skip the company's work.

444
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I'll find you a professional nutritionist.

445
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Oh, and...

446
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
you can't sleep for seven hours.

447
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
You can't come to work.

448
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Mr. Du,

449
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
I've been thinking about something.

450
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Before I officially apply,

451
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
I think I need to tell you something.

452
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
You're serious?

453
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Tell me.

454
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I want to resign.

455
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
You're so bold.

456
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
You're not going to resign?

457
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Is it because of SKO?

458
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
You're feeling unwell?

459
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
No.

460
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
It's my personal reason.

461
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
And I've been thinking about it for a long time.

462
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
If it's because of your health,

463
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I can give you a vacation.

464
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
One month is not enough for two months.

465
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Two months is not enough for half a year.

466
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
If it's not enough for half a year, one year is fine.

467
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Until you recover.

468
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Then, in two months,

469
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
I won't be where I am today.

470
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Don't worry.

471
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
As long as I'm here,

472
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
no one will touch you.

473
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
You think he's going to help you?

474
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
Because he likes you.

475
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
You think he really treats you as a student,

476
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
as a friend?

477
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
He's always liked you.

478
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Mr. Du.

480
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Thank you for your kindness.

481
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
I know I'm sorry to the company

482
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
and to you.

483
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,560
But this time, I really want to be good.

484
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
I won't force you.

485
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Is it because of Yuan Shuai?

487
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
What he can give you,

488
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
I can give you too.

489
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
No.

490
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
You misunderstood.

491
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
I've been really tired these two years.

492
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
I don't have time to spend with my family.

493
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Really?

494
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,560
I just remembered that I have something to do.

495
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
I'll go back first.

496
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
I'll drink.

497
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
I'll drink.

498
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Mr. Du, do I have something on my face?

499
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Can you tell me what's on my face?

500
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Okay.

501
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
I didn't bring the bag you gave me last time.

503
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
I was actually quite angry at first.

504
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
But I thought about it later.

505
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Maybe it's because you really don't like it.

506
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
So

507
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
I've picked another necklace for you.

508
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
I hope this time,

509
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
I can wear it for you.

510
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Thank you.

511
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Mr. Du, I'm driving.

512
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,080
It's dangerous. You sit down.

513
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Mr. Du, Mr. Du, I...

514
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Sit down!

515
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
It's dangerous! Sit down!

516
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
You're so afraid of me?

517
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Why did you quit?

518
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Did Yuan Shuai force you?

519
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
No.

520
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
I wanted to quit.

521
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
You wanted to quit?

522
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
What are you going to do after you quit?

523
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Go and give him a job?

524
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
What about your dream?

525
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
You entered the first-class company

526
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
with a dream.

527
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Just because of him?

528
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
No.

529
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
I quit

530
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
because I really needed a personal reason.

531
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I should have this freedom.

532
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Mr. Du,

533
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
I think you should find a price.

534
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Who are you?

535
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,120
What is my voice?

536
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
I'm telling you now.

537
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
My voice is always with you.

538
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Stop it!

539
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
Do you know the tie?

540
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,640
You've been giving it to me for two years.

541
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
I've been wearing it since I entered the first-class company.

542
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
I'm not as stupid as you.

543
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
You can't feel my heart.

544
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Du Lei, calm down.

545
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Calm down!

546
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
If you don't mean anything to me,

547
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
why did you give me such a sensitive gift?

548
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,640
I didn't mean anything.

549
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
It's just my failure.

550
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
I'm sorry.

551
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
I was too careless and made you misunderstand.

552
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
You guessed it right. I just want to get married.

553
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
So you should understand that

554
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
I can't go back to your heart.

555
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
I know you didn't do it.

556
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
I want to take back this tie.

558
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Please give it back to me.

559
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
General!

560
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
I love you. I can't leave you.

561
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,680
I want you to be by my side.

562
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,680
I can protect you.

563
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Let go of me!

564
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Let go of me!

565
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Let go of me!

566
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Let go of me!

567
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Zixuan, are you okay?

568
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Did you get hurt?

569
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Yuanfei!

570
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Stop hitting me!

571
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Stop hitting me!

572
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Stop hitting me!

573
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Zixuan!

574
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Get lost!

575
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Zixuan, are you okay?

576
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I'll think about it.

577
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Zixuan!

578
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Zixuan!

579
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Zixuan!

580
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Zixuan!

581
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Zixuan!

582
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Zixuan!

583
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Zixuan!

584
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Zixuan!

585
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Zixuan!

586
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Zixuan!

587
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Zixuan!

588
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Zixuan!

589
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Zixuan!

590
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Zixuan!

591
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Zixuan!

592
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Zixuan!

593
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Zixuan!

594
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Zixuan!

595
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Zixuan!

596
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Zixuan!

597
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Zixuan!

598
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Zixuan!

599
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Zixuan!

600
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Zixuan!

601
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Zixuan!

602
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Zixuan!

603
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Zixuan!

604
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Zixuan!

605
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
OhcohETH~!

606
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:21,240
The

607
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,640
In our

608
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,540
What you

609
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,980
What's your real thought on Du Lei?

610
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,980
I think it's a pity.

611
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,980
Pity?

612
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,540
I shouldn't go.

613
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,580
Am I disturbing you?

614
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,940
You asked me my real thought.

615
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,340
I really think

616
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,380
it's a pity to be with someone who's been a true friend.

617
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,820
If I could be more sensitive and found out earlier,

618
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,980
I wouldn't be like this now.

619
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,540
You know you're not a person with no sense of sense.

620
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,780
But that's right.

621
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,980
After all, I've liked you for so long.

622
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,460
You don't even know.

623
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,020
Miss Jiang is really talented in this area.

624
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,260
I really didn't expect it.

625
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
You know that.

626
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,700
You're the only one who knows my love experience.

627
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,100
Otherwise, I wouldn't be in this awkward situation.

628
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,260
Do you think I'm angry at you?

629
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,820
What are you angry at?

630
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,900
You're alone at night.

631
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,660
You drink with her.

632
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,900
You drive her home after drinking.

633
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,300
You're a good service.

634
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,580
I swear I didn't drink.

635
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,700
Stop.

636
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,580
Sit down.

637
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,820
What did you do to Du Lei?

638
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,020
Why did he suddenly act like you?

639
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,620
I did say something to him.

640
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,300
I can't tell you yet.

641
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,740
I'm sorry. I won't accept your apology.

642
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,620
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

643
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,700
You're breaking the rules.

644
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,980
I have more things to do.

645
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,580
Don't be angry, okay?

646
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
It still hurts.

647
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,380
It hurts. Let me see.

648
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,020
Does it still hurt?

649
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,140
A little.

650
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,620
Now?

651
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,420
It doesn't hurt.

652
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,540
It doesn't hurt.

653
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,380
You should be more careful.

654
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,340
Did you hear that?

655
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,380
Oh, right.

656
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,300
I forgot to tell you something.

657
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,260
What is it? Let's talk about it tomorrow.

658
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,340
No. It's too late tomorrow.

659
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,100
Go ahead.

660
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,940
Shen Xing is going to the interview in Ji Yi tomorrow afternoon.

661
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,700
You know what's going on with him.

662
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,900
So I wrote a letter of recommendation for you.

663
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
Can you put it on the floor for me?

664
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,540
Let's go.

665
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,860
Jiang Jun.

666
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,940
You came to me for help.

667
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,020
That's why you're so...

668
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,220
That's why you're so obedient.

669
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,420
No.

670
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,300
I just remembered it.

671
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,740
You remembered it?

672
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,180
What a coincidence.

673
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,900
I'm just asking if you want to help me.

674
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,380
Write a letter of recommendation?

675
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,700
Listen to my analysis.

676
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,780
It's good for him to write a letter of recommendation for Shen Xing.

677
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,940
But it's not good for you.

678
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,740
Shen Xing is your confidant.

679
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,060
You're my girlfriend.

680
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,260
This is no longer a secret in the industry.

681
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,940
Write a letter of recommendation and send Shen Xing to my company.

682
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,860
If someone knows about this,

683
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,500
they will definitely be in trouble.

684
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,740
No.

685
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,780
He's just a recommender.

686
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,380
He didn't violate the rules of the industry.

687
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,500
And this is probably his last chance.

688
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,100
You can't temporarily let go of your miserable confidant.

689
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,060
Let him go.

690
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,660
I've analyzed the interest and the debt with you.

691
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,260
Since you've decided,

692
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,900
then write a letter of recommendation.

693
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,580
Let's make up.

694
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,380
Okay, let's make up.

695
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,980
October 12.

696
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,220
Isn't this the day Shen Xing said?

697
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,060
My conclusion is that

698
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,780
Du Lei knew that he had a better chance,

699
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,140
but he insisted on firing Xiang Ding and Shen Xing.

700
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,940
He has a reason.

701
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,820
I suspect that it's Xiang Ding and Shen Xing

702
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,260
who knew the secret that made Du Lei afraid.

703
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,900
They had to leave.

704
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,860
One day, I was too anxious to let him sign.

705
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,740
I knocked on his door and entered his office.

706
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,500
He seemed to say on the phone

707
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,300
that he was not ready to talk to me.

708
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,780
He did what he did with the Huan Yu financial report

709
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,420
last year.

710
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,660
He has already settled the case at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

711
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,740
Xiaoyu, come in.

712
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,540
Okay.

713
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,700
Come in.

714
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,100
Mr. Jiang, you wanted to see me?

715
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,300
You are responsible for the Huan Yu Group's follow-up, right?

716
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,300
Yes.

717
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,660
I am just doing some auxiliary materials.

718
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,700
Have you seen the financial reports of three Huan Yu Groups

719
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,900
this year?

720
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,700
Of course.

721
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,300
A big client like Huan Yu

722
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,140
must be responsible for the debtors.

723
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,220
For two years,

724
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,540
they have been directly submitting to Mr. Du.

725
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,020
The accounting firm's meeting

726
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,580
was also attended by Mr. Du himself.

727
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,340
Okay, I see.

728
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,100
You may leave.

729
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,940
Wait.

730
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,780
Mr. Jiang.

731
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,780
I am looking for you today. Don't tell anyone.

732
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,940
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

733
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,740
Go.

734
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,540
Then you will be staying every day of my life

735
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,420
like I don't mind.

736
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,540
I can close my eyes.

737
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,700
I can stay behind with my time.

738
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,100
Walk into your plan

739
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,580
like I never knew you were not mine.

740
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,460
Make you satisfied.

741
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,260
Wear another mask.

742
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,740
You never realize things I do for love.

743
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,540
I think I'm tired.

744
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,340
I think I'm blind.

745
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,180
Don't know how to feel.

746
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,140
Don't know how to heal.

747
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,060
You walk so fast.

748
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Can't catch your light.

749
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,140
You fly so high.

750
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,340
Leave all the things behind.

751
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,740
And our story

752
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:38,540
leave all of nowhere to find.

753
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,540
I think I'm tired.

754
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,260
I think I'm blind.

755
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,140
Don't know how to feel.

756
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,140
Don't know how to heal.

757
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,940
You walk so fast.

758
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,740
Can't catch your light.

759
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,140
You fly so high.

760
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,340
Leave all the things behind.

761
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,940
