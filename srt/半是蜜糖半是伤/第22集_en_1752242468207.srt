00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,800
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,240
An Li, Liu Cuilai, invites you to watch

3
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,400
the half-life secret and half-life business.

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,040
To invest,

5
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,400
you must invest your beauty first.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,240
Do you know the secret of being beautiful?

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,480
The answer is An Li, Liu Cuilai.

8
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,920
Natural nutrition, natural health,

9
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,400
beautiful.

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,320
Eat it.

11
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Episode 2

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,560
Have you heard?

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,920
This time, President Qiao

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
is going to do something big.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,520
What's wrong?

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
He didn't know what happened two days ago

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,760
and filled the wrong data

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,320
in the financing plan of Yuan Yang Group.

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
He even sent it directly to the client.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,520
As a result,

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,400
it caused loss to the client.

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,720
Now he is being questioned.

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,080
Let me tell you.

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,920
Yuan Yang Group

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,960
has always been

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
a big client of our company.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,560
Such a serious mistake

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
can't be delayed in the company.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm afraid that the investment bank will be in trouble.

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,280
Yes.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,120
The senior management has already ordered it.

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
He was fired this time.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,560
It must be a big deal.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,320
As a result,

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,200
President Yuan came forward

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
and kept him safe.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,360
He even promised Yuan Yang Group

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,400
to give a special gift

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,240
to a new financing plan.

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,720
Did I hear it right?

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,920
24 hours.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,880
A new plan?

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,520
Yes.

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,160
Then President Yuan will have to open a new one.

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,400
And

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,040
if the new one doesn't work out,

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,800
President Yuan

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,720
will have to leave with President Qiao.

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,560
Edelweiss and Kekke said

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,320
that you should be more cautious

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
than you are after the incident.

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,000
This is the responsibility

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
they should take for their mistakes.

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,800
Edelweiss said

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,360
President Yuan is really...

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,460
Li Li!?

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
How are you feeling?

58
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,600
Humming

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,120
껥껥

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
I think I'll

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,400
For quite a while

62
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,800
Sit up

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,680
You should go to bed

64
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,440
I am leaving

65
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Happy soup

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
Happy and happy

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,200
Happy soup

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,440
Am I cute?

69
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,680
Yes

70
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,880
diamonds

71
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,080
I passed by the cake shop this morning. Here you go.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,080
Thank you, Xiao Chen.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
This cake looks delicious.

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,880
This cake shop is great. Buy one, get one free. It's super cost-effective.

75
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,080
I'm sad that this cake isn't that delicious.

76
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
Xiao Chen.

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
Teacher Du.

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,280
Teacher Du, you're here.

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,680
What happened to the funding issue you were talking about?

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Let's go. Teacher Du, this way please.

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,880
Okay.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Teacher Du, we have some financial problems. What should we do?

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,680
There's a problem with the funds.

84
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,480
Teacher Du, drink some water.

85
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,680
Thank you.

86
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
Okay.

87
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Do you understand why there are two kinds of funding issues?

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
I understand.

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
So is there a problem with the funds?

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,080
No. The funding issue is about a company's profit

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,880
and the amount of money they spend on it.

92
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,480
Every company has this kind of value.

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,680
Xiao Chuan just had a problem with the funding issue.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
I'll explain it to him.

95
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,480
Okay.

96
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,080
No problem is good.

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,680
Oh, right. Teacher Du, are you free tonight?

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,480
How about we eat together?

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
Okay.

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,480
Huang Cai, are you waiting for me?

101
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Why are you so good?

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,280
Huang Cai.

103
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,880
Huang Cai, your father is busy today.

104
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,680
We have to understand him and not disturb him.

105
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,880
We have to wait for him to come home, right?

106
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,280
Maybe he'll come back after we clean up. Right?

107
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,280
Sit tight.

108
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,680
Huang Cai, your father is so good.

109
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,280
We can't drag him down, right?

110
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,680
I have to find the most worthy client for our collaboration.

111
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Give me five.

112
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Give me five.

113
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,680
Five.

114
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Okay?

115
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,480
Okay, I know.

116
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Don't wait for me.

117
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
Beauty is important. Love you. Good night.

118
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,080
Bye bye.

119
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Huang Cai, look at your father. He's not home for the night.

120
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,080
He's with a beautiful lady. I'm not jealous at all.

121
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,280
Would it be great to save the Galaxy?

122
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Am I great?

123
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,080
Yes.

124
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,720
Your name appeared all over the Country also.

125
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,700
It's you?

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,260
I've never seen you in the empty house before.

127
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,980
Who was it?

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,660
Your background.

129
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,980
I can take care of that.

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,900
Did you know?

131
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,820
I knew this is another important client,

132
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,120
then you would've had to bring up the files yourself.

133
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,540
Are you sure any evidences are false?

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,180
First, I was the one who made the mistake.

135
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,180
I was the one who was in charge.

136
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,780
I can't be out of the way.

137
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,540
Second, I know very well about Mr. Qiao's capabilities.

138
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,260
The reason for the failure is because of something.

139
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
So...

140
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,140
So, we've been working together for so long.

141
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,980
We've already developed a tacit understanding.

142
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,300
I've always regarded you as my comrade-in-arms.

143
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,140
You're like Su Chang.

144
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,260
You're my best friend at work.

145
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,740
Thank you, Mr. Yuan, for being so honest with me.

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,820
Look at these photos.

147
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,780
Don't be nervous, Mr. Yuan.

148
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,660
I'm just a comrade-in-arms to remind you.

149
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,860
You should pay attention to your image when you're in a relationship.

150
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,020
If these photos are taken by someone else,

151
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,300
it won't only affect your work.

152
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,460
Of course, I'll clear up all these photos.

153
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,060
Then, we'll be even.

154
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,140
You can go back to work.

155
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,780
Then, we'll be even.

156
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,220
If anything happens to me, it'll be none of my business.

157
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,220
Thank you for reminding me, Mr. Qiao.

158
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,100
But I've said it before.

159
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,660
Since it's my choice,

160
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,100
I'll be responsible for everything.

161
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,380
You're welcome.

162
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,940
Good luck.

163
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,520
Iético Sabado

164
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,020
Good morning, Tong Jun.

165
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,300
Morning.

166
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
Nothing. What's wrong?

167
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,540
I just bought one more.

168
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,220
Here you are.

169
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,100
Okay.

170
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,660
Thank you.

171
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,180
Hello.

172
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,300
Hello.

173
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,620
Are you the general of MH?

174
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,780
I'm Dong Mi, a newbie in technology.

175
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,620
My surname is Xia.

176
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,100
Our company wants to

177
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,380
do IPO.

178
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,900
Let's see if you can

179
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,860
establish a

180
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,820
initial contact.

181
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,100
Sure.

182
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,780
Is your time convenient today?

183
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,860
Can we

184
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,100
meet and talk first?

185
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,420
It should be fine today.

186
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,940
Please send the address.

187
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,060
Okay.

188
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,940
Okay.

189
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,980
Mr. Shuang.

190
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,740
The client asked me to go out.

191
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
I saw Mr. Yuan was busy.

192
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,780
So I didn't report to him.

193
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,660
If you have any questions,

194
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,540
please let me know.

195
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,420
Thank you.

196
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,660
I'm leaving.

197
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,580
Okay. Bye.

198
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,940
Miss Jiang.

199
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,620
Please come in.

200
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

201
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,700
It's okay. I just sat down.

202
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,660
This way, please.

203
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,380
Hello.

204
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,100
Hello.

205
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:38,900
Hello.

206
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,620
Hello.

207
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,420
Hello.

208
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,060
Hello.

209
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,620
This is my business card.

210
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,500
Thank you.

211
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,900
I've made coffee for you.

212
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,940
Let's have a drink and talk.

213
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,700
Thank you.

214
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,500
You're welcome.

215
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,620
This is our new proposal.

216
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,500
Thank you.

217
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,060
Mr. Fan.

218
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,020
The MLH is really professional.

219
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,220
In just one day,

220
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,860
we've come up with a new financing plan.

221
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,900
And we've completed a lot.

222
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,180
I'm even wondering

223
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,820
if you've used that plan

224
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,380
to scare the public with your lies.

225
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,860
If that's the case,

226
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
we'll have a meeting

227
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,140
at the board meeting.

228
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,220
I'll be there.

229
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,020
Okay.

230
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,820
Okay.

231
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,580
Okay.

232
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,380
Okay.

233
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,060
Okay.

234
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,780
Okay.

235
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,780
I'll be there.

236
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,820
But

237
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,580
this time, it's because of our negligence

238
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,100
that the problem has been caused.

239
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,380
So it's our duty

240
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,260
to solve the problem.

241
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,980
We'd like to thank Youyang Group

242
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,460
for giving us more trust.

243
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,300
At the same time,

244
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,740
our Director Yuan

245
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,980
is willing to be

246
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,060
a part of Youyang Group's

247
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,660
annual foundation.

248
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,060
Director Yuan,

249
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,100
a year?

250
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,780
Okay, Mr. Liu.

251
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,780
Go to my office and have some tea.

252
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,740
Okay.

253
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,020
Please.

254
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,500
Thank you.

255
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,700
You're welcome.

256
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,300
Do you have time to talk?

257
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,700
Sure.

258
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,540
Alright.

259
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,540
See you.

260
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:19,520
Chow's

261
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,220
Hello, who is that? What do you mean?

262
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,300
Don't be nervous.

263
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,780
I am just doing a test on her safety.

264
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,540
Now she is falling asleep somewhere become quiet.

265
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,980
Where is she?

266
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,060
I'll send Don to you.

267
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,220
Graduation ceremony

268
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,780
Hello, sir

269
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,380

270
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,060
Sir

271
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,660
mix

272
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,620
Sir

273
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,620
likes

274
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,900
Sir

275
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,220
Sir

276
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,060
Is the medicine not good?

277
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,700
Sorry.

278
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,660
Please show me your ID card.

279
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,340
We need to verify the information.

280
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,340
Well,

281
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,580
call Luo Dong

282
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,340
and tell him I'm the director.

283
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,660
I'll give him the proof later.

284
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,580
Jiang Ding.

285
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,580
Jiang Ding.

286
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,500
Jiang Ding.

287
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,460
Mr. Yuan.

288
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,420
Where's Jiang Jun?

289
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,500
Jiang Jun just left.

290
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,180
He said he went out to meet a client.

291
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,380
Meet a client?

292
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,700
Hello.

293
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,820
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

294
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,700
Please redial later.

295
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,860
He must have taken some sleeping pills

296
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,540
and had low blood sugar.

297
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,620
But he's fine now.

298
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,220
I think he'll wake up soon.

299
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,220
Okay.

300
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,340
Thank you, doctor.

301
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,660
Is Jiang Jun in the hospital?

302
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,940
Mr. Du, I...

303
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,580
I asked him what happened to him.

304
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,660
He must have fainted in the snow.

305
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,700
I just came from nearby.

306
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,740
I sent him here.

307
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,860
What did the doctor say?

308
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,300
The doctor said he's fine.

309
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,940
He'll wake up soon.

310
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,220
I'm relieved that you're here.

311
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,340
He'll leave you to him.

312
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,700
I have something to do. I'll leave now.

313
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,580
Okay.

314
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,900
Since you have something to do, you can leave.

315
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,580
We'll stay here.

316
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,700
Remember to drink more water when he wakes up.

317
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,260
What's going on?

318
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,220
Jiang Jun is in trouble.

319
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,460
Come to the hospital now.

320
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,980
Hey,

321
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,500
can I talk to you?

322
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,820
I'm so happy for Jun Jun.

323
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,140
He has so many内 Rifle raised in the world,

324
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,020
yet he can hardly be treated

325
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,660
for both of you.

326
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,860
I've been livingivahigh for four years.

327
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,700
I'm sorry.

328
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,060
If I could meet

329
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,580
such a person,

330
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,260
it would be great.

331
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,100
I agree.

332
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,860
Although Mr. Du is really nice,

333
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,020
I still support my brother.

334
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,940
After all, they are the only one

335
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,980
who is 100% compatible

336
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,740
in the western world.

337
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,700
May I ask you,

338
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
where is the person

339
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,220
who is 100% compatible now?

340
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,940
I have a bold prediction.

341
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,500
I will count down to five now.

342
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,260
The person who is 100% compatible

343
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,380
will appear here.

344
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,340
Do you believe it?

345
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,380
I don't believe it.

346
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,580
Then try it.

347
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,260
Five,

348
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,020
four,

349
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,340
three,

350
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,940
two,

351
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,140
one.

352
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,860
Jiang Jun.

353
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,620
Jiang Jun.

354
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,700
How is he?

355
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,980
He is fine, brother.

356
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,420
The doctor said he has low blood sugar.

357
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,020
Mr. Du was just nearby,

358
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,300
so he sent him here.

359
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,900
Du Lei?

360
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,700
Jiang Jun, you are awake.

361
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,580
Jiang Jun.

362
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,140
How are you?

363
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,660
Are you feeling okay?

364
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,260
Why am I here?

365
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,420
I am here to see you.

366
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,620
Why am I here?

367
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,620
The doctor said you have low blood sugar,

368
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,900
so you fainted.

369
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,500
Why would he have low blood sugar?

370
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,340
Who did you go to see this afternoon?

371
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,860
How dare you ask him?

372
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,300
I haven't asked you yet.

373
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,980
I can trust you to take care of Junjun.

374
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,020
What happened?

375
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,940
You let him go to the hospital the next day.

376
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,740
Is it appropriate?

377
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,540
Enough.

378
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,140
I haven't finished yet.

379
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,220
How did you become my boyfriend?

380
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,220
It's okay.

381
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,820
It's not his fault.

382
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,180
I am sorry.

383
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,660
I didn't take good care of you.

384
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,500
I am fine.

385
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,860
Don't blame yourself.

386
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,780
I am fine.

387
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,620
I am leaving.

388
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,060
You are still here.

389
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,340
You are still here.

390
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,060
I am sorry.

391
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,180
Look.

392
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,980
You are a perfect match.

393
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,220
The one who truly loves you

394
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,700
will use a hug or...

395
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
or a kiss

396
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,380
to improve each other's blood oxygen,

397
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,460
to make each other feel comforted

398
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,780
or to reduce stress.

399
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,380
Chen,

400
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,980
have you ever been in love with someone?

401
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,020
Have you ever kissed someone

402
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,100
when you were dating?

403
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,980
I...

404
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,580
I think I am still running the code.

405
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,180
I am going to run the code first.

406
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,260
You...

407
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,340
Here is the report.

408
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,940
Medication?

409
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,220
Yes.

410
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,300
The patient's blood sugar level is not high.

411
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,900
He won't faint.

412
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,380
When I was giving him his blood,

413
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,220
there was a lot of medicine

414
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,420
in his body.

415
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,020
Okay, doctor.

416
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,300
I got it. Thank you.

417
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,620
He is fine, Chen.

418
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,060
The doctor said his blood sugar level was low.

419
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,580
Mr. Du was just nearby.

420
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,860
He sent him here.

421
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,060
Why did you do that?

422
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,260
What did I do?

423
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,020
Why did you hurt him?

424
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,620
Hurt him?

425
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,340
Du,

426
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,420
are you angry?

427
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,340
No.

428
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,500
I just want to see you angry.

429
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,580
You are really not a little bit of a bottom line?

430
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,180
Are you talking about the bottom line?

431
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,660
Did you have a bottom line

432
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,740
when you used Wan Shan to draw?

433
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,980
Did you have a bottom line

434
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,260
when you used Jiang Nanfeng

435
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,700
to kill his father?

436
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,700
Anyone can talk about the bottom line with me.

437
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,980
But you can't.

438
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,220
By the way,

439
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,020
the person who gave you hope

440
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,460
is the daughter of Mr. Jiang

441
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,540
who was killed by you five years ago.

442
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,860
You are really fated to be together.

443
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,340
If he knows

444
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,620
that you killed his father indirectly,

445
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,260
will he still give you hope?

446
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,780
I think the food and security

447
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,820
of Jiang Nanfeng

448
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,020
are a little strange.

449
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,620
The bottom line

450
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,500
is the most common brand

451
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,100
with the highest market share.

452
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,100
Nothing has ever happened.

453
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,620
But

454
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,900
they agreed to not accept

455
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,940
the acquisition of the surgery

456
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,700
and caused such a financial crisis.

457
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,780
You see...

458
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,300
Food.

459
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,380
Isn't it normal

460
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,380
for the quality of the product to be problematic?

461
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,460
Remember.

462
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,900
The capital market

463
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,660
always prioritizes profit.

464
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,740
The investment bank is not a charity organization.

465
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,420
It's your responsibility

466
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,020
to help C Group complete the acquisition.

467
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,460
After you complete the task,

468
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
I can recommend you to be the VP.

469
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,940
That's the most important thing.

470
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,700
I've read the contract.

471
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,740
No problem.

472
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,180
Sign it.

473
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,900
You have to promise

474
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,820
that none of the 112 employees

475
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,340
in the company can quit.

476
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,020
I can give you the business card.

477
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,660
But I won't give you the secret letter.

478
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,460
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

479
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Your request

480
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,860
is very clear in the contract.

481
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,380
There will be no problem.

482
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,540
I'm not eating.

483
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,620
But I really didn't expect that it was you who planned it.

484
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,620
What do you want to prove by saying this?

485
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,620
Didn't you choose your own future back then?

486
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,620
We are the same.

487
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,620
We are all people who can do things without any means.

488
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,620
Even if you hate it and want to abandon this name,

489
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,620
you are still Du Lei.

490
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:33,620
I hope that girl who was hurt by you will forgive you after she knows.

491
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,620
I know how you feel now.

492
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,620
I hate it when you do it.

493
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,620
Do you still love me?

494
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,620
I don't know.

495
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Director Yuan?

496
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,620
Why are you so interested in finding me an old friend?

497
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,900
and saved him.

498
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,140
Don't you want to explain it?

499
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,420
Why should I explain it?

500
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,100
It's just a coincidence.

501
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,700
Do you think I'll believe you?

502
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,060
Du Lei.

503
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,420
What do you want to do?

504
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,220
To be honest,

505
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,860
it has nothing to do with me.

506
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,140
But I can promise you one thing.

507
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,460
I won't hurt you.

508
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,300
I'll never hurt you.

509
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,340
I'll never hurt you.

510
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,900
What do you mean?

511
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,620
Because I like her.

512
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,220
Of course, I know

513
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
you like her too.

514
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
So I don't mind being honest with you.

515
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,300
After all, I said

516
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,940
some things can be allowed,

517
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,420
and some things can't.

518
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,660
Well.

519
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,500
Do you think I need you to let me go?

520
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
I'm sorry.

521
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,900
I forgot to tell you.

522
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,100
I'm officially with Jiang Jun.

523
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,660
If anyone bullies him in the future,

524
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,700
I'll be the one to protect him.

525
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,900
Don't worry about it.

526
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,060
One HT like both.

527
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,260
My friend is a suspicious suspect.

528
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,980
We could get a best record for one HT like Feibai's.

529
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,780
Group dan.

530
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,380
He said that the medicine was given to Miss Jiang

531
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
for temporary medical reasons.

532
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,100
But in the end,

533
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,820
he did nothing

534
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,780
and ran away.

535
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,740
For temporary medical reasons?

536
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,460
How could it be temporary medical reasons?

537
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,580
Will it be possible to bring

538
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
sleeping pills with you?

539
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,940
Someone must be behind the scenes.

540
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,820
If someone is behind the scenes,

541
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,620
the person who helped people

542
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,660
must have been prepared

543
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,780
to be arrested long ago.

544
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,220
I think it's a bit difficult to do this.

545
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,540
But believe me,

546
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,660
I'm a strong man.

547
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,740
I will tell him the truth.

548
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Do it well.

549
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,940
I'll give you a chance.

550
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,180
I'm going travel just in time.

551
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,060
Look at your feet.

552
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,340
You're not Wang Jichuan.

553
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,260
What about the cold?

554
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,660
I have a heater at home.

555
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,100
I'm not that weak.

556
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,220
You're not weak.

557
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,820
You'll faint if you're not weak.

558
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,340
You don't eat on time

559
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,460
and stay up late.

560
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,540
Look at you.

561
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,260
You don't even blow your hair after you shower.

562
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,700
What if you catch a cold?

563
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,340
From now on,

564
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,660
you have to eat on time.

565
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,380
Do you hear me?

566
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,220
I'm not unfilial.

567
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,180
Who wants to make a bad name for themselves?

568
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,100
Okay.

569
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,780
We have a deal.

570
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,140
From tomorrow,

571
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,820
we'll eat together.

572
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,820
I'll cook and you'll eat.

573
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,260
Can I order?

574
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,540
Of course.

575
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,220
You can eat whatever I cook.

576
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,740
Mom.

577
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,700
Jichuan.

578
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,300
Hey.

579
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,500
Junjun.

580
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,100
Why is the screen black?

581
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,260
Mom.

582
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,540
It's a dog.

583
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,140
I recently had a dog named Yuan Wangcai.

584
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,180
He just called me.

585
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,900
Why is the dog talking about Yuan now?

586
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,940
No.

587
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,980
Mom, you're misheard.

588
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,100
Mom, what's up?

589
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,820
I'm asking you.

590
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,180
Did Yuan buy the ticket back?

591
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,900
Well,

592
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,740
I'll buy the ticket

593
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,700
when he says the price is off.

594
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,660
Then hurry up.

595
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,020
Don't buy the ticket.

596
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,460
Junjun.

597
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,420
Listen.

598
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,820
I've prepared a lot of delicious food for you.

599
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm waiting for you to cook and eat.

600
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,780
Okay.

601
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,220
Mom, you're still...

602
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,220
Where are you, Junjun?

603
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,940
Doggy.

604
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,580
Don't raise a dog if you live alone.

605
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,380
Junjun.

606
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,020
Okay, mom.

607
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,220
You're sleepy.

608
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,180
Go to bed early.

609
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,700
I'll get you a drink next time.

610
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,740
Take your time.

611
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,020
What's wrong with you?

612
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,700
What?

613
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,420
Okay.

614
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,340
You're here.

615
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,260
Wrong.

616
00:32:59,420 --> 00:32:59,900
Wrong.

617
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,700
Did I do something wrong?

618
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,340
Did I?

619
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,100
Wrong.

620
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,260
Why didn't you let me talk to my mom?

621
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,140
We were together for a long time.

622
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,580
I didn't tell my mom.

623
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,340
You know my mom.

624
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,540
If she saw me

625
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,140
with a man in the middle of the night,

626
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,420
she would be scared to death.

627
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,300
Yes.

628
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,220
She's like you.

629
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,900
She's got tears in her eyes.

630
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,180
She's crying.

631
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,620
You're the one with tears.

632
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,500
Mocai,

633
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,380
bite her.

634
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,780
Bite her.

635
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,820
So,

636
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,620
you're going home for New Year's Eve?

637
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,860
Isn't it normal?

638
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,780
You know my parents are abroad?

639
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,740
I know.

640
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
If you go home for New Year's Eve,

641
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,420
I'll be the only one in Shanghai.

642
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,620
Here.

643
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,580
What?

644
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,860
You want to go home with me

645
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,140
and see your mother?

646
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,740
Why not?

647
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,700
You wish.

648
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,260
I haven't seen my aunt for a long time.

649
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,260
Since I went abroad,

650
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,100
I haven't seen my uncle or aunt.

651
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,820
I miss the rice noodles cooked by my uncle.

652
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,780
I want to eat it as soon as I think of it.

653
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,900
What's wrong?

654
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,740
You may not see my dad.

655
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,260
He passed away five years ago.

656
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,820
What happened?

657
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,140
Heart attack.

658
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,100
After you moved abroad,

659
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,620
he and a few brothers

660
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,020
opened a rice noodle brand

661
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,060
called Yi Xianqian.

662
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,500
Yi Xianqian?

663
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,420
I remember Yi Xianqian

664
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,180
is the main product of Group C.

665
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,300
So, this rice noodle

666
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,740
was made by my uncle.

667
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,700
Yes.

668
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,060
My dad started to make it step by step.

669
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,300
From offline to online stores,

670
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,500
the better he made it,

671
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,180
the more he produced.

672
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,460
But my dad was not good at business.

673
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,420
So he found MS to make the financing.

674
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,380
My mom said it was MS that

675
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,620
made Yi Xianqian bought by Group C.

676
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,020
But later,

677
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,860
they wanted my dad's hard work

678
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,740
to become cheap self-heating rice noodles.

679
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,220
No matter the texture or ingredients,

680
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,500
they were all discounted.

681
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,980
My dad's hard work

682
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,180
was gone.

683
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,020
So you must enter MS

684
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,700
because of your uncle?

685
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,020
Yes.

686
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,100
My professor told me

687
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,700
that meat is the most real thing

688
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,180
in the capital world.

689
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,380
So I insisted

690
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,900
to enter MS.

691
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,660
Is this financial circle

692
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,860
really only

693
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,460
bigger than the fish?

694
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,380
In front of the interests,

695
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,020
can good will and conscience

696
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,100
only be in the dream?

697
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,740
What do you think

698
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,180
in the past half year?

699
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,820
I don't evaluate others.

700
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,340
But at least in your eyes,

701
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,620
I still see hope.

702
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,060
Whether it's Deng Ke,

703
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,140
Wanshan or Zhu Youyi,

704
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,100
you didn't put interests

705
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,140
in the first place.

706
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,740
Then you're wrong.

707
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,700
I'm also a person

708
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,900
who deals with capital.

709
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,500
But

710
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,660
some people have short sight,

711
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,740
and only know the interests in front of them.

712
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,900
So they earn fast and die fast.

713
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,340
I'm different.

714
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,780
I have long sight.

715
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,460
I value long-term interests more.

716
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,500
Only by respecting capital,

717
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,860
treating it kindly,

718
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,540
can you be proud of it.

719
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,540
Little girl,

720
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,340
you still have a lot to learn.

721
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,180
I'm not a good girl.

722
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,140
You're a hero.

723
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,100
You've learned a lot.

724
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,820
So,

725
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,740
can I go home

726
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,020
and celebrate the New Year with you?

727
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,740
Yes, you can.

728
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,300
But you have to

729
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,500
endure my mother's test

730
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,780
to make our relationship public.

731
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,820
No problem.

732
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,460
I liked you so much when I was a kid.

733
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,420
Now,

734
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
I'll definitely like you.

735
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,740
Okay.

736
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,340
That's not necessarily.

737
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,340
I didn't tell you this.

738
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,620
The person who stole my speech

739
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,980
has always been the number one enemy

740
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,340
in my mother's heart.

741
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,940
I'm still hiding it for you.

742
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,900
If my mother knows it,

743
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,940
you're dead.

744
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,540
Why can't I get over this?

745
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,860
Speech test.

746
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,420
You're so stubborn.

747
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,940
You stole my speech test.

748
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,060
You're still here?

749
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:44,620
What are you doing?

750
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,340
What are you doing?

751
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,700
Do you want to eat crayfish?

752
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,420
Yes.

753
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,420
Do you want to eat it with the crayfish?

754
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,140
Yes.

755
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,340
What about the snail?

756
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,540
Eat as much as you want.

757
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,340
Okay, boss.

758
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,940
I'll make the order.

759
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,020
Boss,

760
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,300
I'll have one of each.

761
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,420
And this one,

762
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,820
and this one,

763
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,460
and one more.

764
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:02,940
Okay.

765
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,740
Thank you.

766
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,140
Xu Li,

767
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,540
I'm thinking

768
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,300
about helping the western world

769
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,020
to do an activity

770
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,020
to increase the value of the skin.

771
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,060
What activity?

772
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,220
You can share

773
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,620
a job with your partner.

774
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,420
When you find that

775
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,380
you like your partner

776
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,980
more every day,

777
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,740
you can give him a water.

778
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,020
If you give more than

779
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,140
ten times to two people,

780
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,820
the plant will grow

781
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,260
and increase their skin quality.

782
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,140
What do you think?

783
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,420
Can you do that?

784
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,620
You're so smart.

785
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,220
What about me?

786
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,100
Can I use it?

787
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:37,900
Yes.

788
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,260
But I haven't figured out

789
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,620
whether the plant is

790
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,860
a good pine tree or a good dragon tree.

791
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,060
Pine tree?

792
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,820
You want to wish

793
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,420
the user a long life?

794
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,740
I think

795
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,780
since we're

796
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,060
a love ABP,

797
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,660
let's forget about me.

798
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,420
It means

799
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,620
eternal love.

800
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,740
The name sounds good.

801
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,700
What do you think?

802
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,380
Okay.

803
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,220
Let's forget about me.

804
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,620
Here.

805
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,100
Thank you.

806
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:09,740
Thank you.

807
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,460
You're welcome.

808
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,740
Thank you.

809
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,500
Sha Sha,

810
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,380
how are you going to spend

811
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:17,900
the New Year?

812
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,780
Are you going home?

813
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,340
It's just a holiday.

814
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,500
It's just a way

815
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,780
for people to maintain

816
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,700
the so-called love, friendship, and family.

817
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,540
It's nothing to worry about.

818
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,740
No.

819
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,660
I was happy during the New Year.

820
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,380
Think about it.

821
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,860
Life is so boring.

822
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,500
We hope that we can take a vacation.

823
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,100
Then we can go home

824
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,700
and reunite with our family.

825
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,540
It would be better

826
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,620
if we can be with the one we love.

827
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,420
Otherwise,

828
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,260
even if we spend the New Year alone,

829
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,660
can we take the opportunity

830
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,540
to take a vacation

831
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,220
and reward ourselves?

832
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,020
Life should be a bit ritualistic.

833
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,180
But I really don't want to

834
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,780
be with my seven sisters-in-law

835
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,740
and three uncles.

836
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,060
It's seven, eight, and one.

837
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,740
Don't change the subject.

838
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,580
I really have

839
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,940
seven sisters-in-law and three uncles.

840
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,460
And those three uncles

841
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,740
really want to introduce

842
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,340
their friends' granddaughters to me.

843
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,380
Introduce granddaughters?

844
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,820
Then you'd better not go back.

845
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,180
Really?

846
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,980
Didn't you say

847
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,020
reuniting with family is good?

848
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,540
I think...

849
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,260
Think about it.

850
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,220
You're abroad.

851
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,420
You have to take a plane back.

852
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,060
It's so far away.

853
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,020
The ticket is so expensive.

854
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,780
If you want to use this app now,

855
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,340
you'd better focus on your career.

856
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,220
Right?

857
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,140
Okay.

858
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,220
What about you?

859
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,660
Why are you here?

860
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:46,940
I...

861
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,740
I'm going home.

862
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,180
My mom misses me so much.

863
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,060
Eat.

864
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,780
Here.

865
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:55,820
Thank you.

866
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,060
Brother Guang is so lucky.

867
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,420
No, I'm not.

868
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,940
I'm not that good.

869
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,620
It's a call.

870
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,980
I'm sorry, Pig.

871
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,660
It's a little fast.

872
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,340
You didn't answer it.

873
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:17,900
Bye.

874
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,440
맛있어요

875
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,040
Hello?

876
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,760
Deputy Chief Cao.

877
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,560
I'm Du Lei.

878
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,800
Can you remember me?

879
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,700
How can you contact me?

880
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,360
Did anyone ask you to contact me?

881
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,420
I guess so.

882
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,260
How long have you been here?

883
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,260
Brother Bo,

884
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I dare not run away.

885
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,420
I'm just answering the phone.

886
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,100
I'll call you back.

887
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:46,780
I'll call you back.

888
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,660
You can continue your game.

889
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,140
Listen,

890
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,660
it has nothing to do with me.

891
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,300
Stop bothering me.

892
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,020
Don't be so excited.

893
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,900
I know

894
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,500
it has nothing to do with you.

895
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
But

896
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,060
Linda suddenly thought of

897
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,180
asking if there's

898
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,980
anything we can help her with.

899
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,540
Why don't we meet first?

900
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,780
I'm not available now.

901
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,780
I'm at the outside.

902
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,300
Call me when you get back.

903
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,380
I'm not available now.

904
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,380
I'm not available now.

905
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,380
I'm not available now.

906
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,380
I'm not available now.

907
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm not available now.

908
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,540
I'm not available now.

909
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,620
I'm not available now.

910
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
I'm not available now.

911
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,980
I'm not available now.

912
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,140
I'm not available now.

913
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,300
I'm not available now.

914
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,460
I'm not available now.

915
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,620
I'm not available now.

916
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,780
I'm not available now.

917
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
I'm not available now.

918
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,100
I'm not available now.

919
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,260
I'm not available now.

920
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
I'm not available now.

921
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,580
I'm not available now.

922
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,740
I'm not available now.

923
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
I'm not available now.

924
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,060
I'm not available now.

925
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,220
I'm not available now.

926
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,380
I'm not available now.

927
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
I'm not available now.

928
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
I'm not available now.

929
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,140
Walk into your plan

930
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,700
Like I never knew you were not mine

931
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,580
Make you satisfied

932
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,380
Wear another mask

933
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,180
You never realize things I do for love

934
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,820
I think I'm tired

935
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,620
I think I'm blind

936
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,380
Don't know how to feel

937
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,340
Don't know how to heal

938
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,220
You walk so fast

939
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,820
Can't catch your light

940
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,380
You fly so high

941
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,580
Leave all the things behind

942
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,820
End our story

943
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,820
Leave all of nowhere to find

944
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,980
I think I'm tired

945
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,740
I think I'm blind

946
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,700
Don't know how to feel

947
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,860
Don't know how to heal

948
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,740
You walk so fast

949
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,140
Can't catch your light

950
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,220
You fly so high

951
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,460
Leave all the things behind

952
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,060
End our story

953
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:52,220
Leave all of nowhere to find
