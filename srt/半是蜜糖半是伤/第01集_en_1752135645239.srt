1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,220
In gym.

2
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,220
I'm going to be a little bit of a

3
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,220
little bit of a

4
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,220
little bit of a

5
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,220
little bit of a

6
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,220
little bit of a

7
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,220
little bit of a

8
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,220
little bit of a

9
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,220
little bit of a

10
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,220
little bit of a

11
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,220
little bit of a

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,220
little bit of a

13
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,220
little bit of a

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,220
little bit of a

15
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,220
little bit of a

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
I'm gonna put a pasta

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:39,900
Chicken

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:51,900
G degrease

19
00:01:51,900 --> 00:02:01,900
I'm holding back the fears, flying to the star, to where you are

20
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:10,900
I'm holding back the tears, may this broken wish will be strong enough

21
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,900
to take me all the way to you

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Across the ocean, you'll be waiting

23
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,900
A lighthouse shining down forever

24
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Watch me fly so high, see how my colors paint the sky

25
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:50,900
I'm holding back the fears, may this broken wish will be strong enough

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:57,900
to take me all the way to you

27
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Across the ocean, you'll be waiting

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,900
A lighthouse shining down forever

29
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Hey, give me your spare button.

30
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,900
What's the use of this?

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Maya has a saying, if you want to go back to a place, bury the button here.

32
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Can you do it?

33
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Of course. Maya will bless you. Good luck.

34
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Thank you.

35
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Wait for me.

36
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Did you tell him earlier that the matter of burying the button was real?

37
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,900
I lied to him to encourage him.

38
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Hello, I'm Shen Xin, the interviewer from last year.

39
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,900
I'm Zhang Jun.

40
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,900
In the annual recruitment season, MS will receive tens of thousands of resumes.

41
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,900
If you can enter the fourth phase, that means you've already defeated 99% of the people.

42
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,900
But this is not the end.

43
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Answer me one question.

44
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,900
If you enter the MH in the future, what kind of person do you want to become?

45
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Soros once said that the financial world is a turbulent and chaotic place.

46
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,900
If you take the financial market as a step towards a certain mathematical formula,

47
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
it won't be eliminated.

48
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,900
So, mathematics cannot control the financial market.

49
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,900
The psychological factor is the key to controlling the market.

50
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
Time's up. Next.

51
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Sorry, I haven't finished yet.

52
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,900
MH is Shanghai's top investment agency.

53
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
It manages hundreds of billions of assets.

54
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,900
You can't waste our time.

55
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
15 seconds. Next.

56
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,900
The financial world is like an zoo. I want to become an investor like a breeder.

57
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
I can beat the strong and tame the weak.

58
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Success means defeating your opponent.

59
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
If you want to succeed, you have to discover the other person's flaws.

60
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
If you discover the flaws, you have to catch them.

61
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Just like the Fulhamers.

62
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,900
So, of course, I want to become an investor like the Fulhamers.

63
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,900
The workplace is like spring and autumn, not a country.

64
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
I want to become the end of the MH.

65
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Love is not a merit, but a virtue.

66
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
It's the new world.

67
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
I want to become the end of the MH.

68
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,900
I want to become a good interviewer.

69
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,900
The investment agency is the Leyuan of the ambitious family.

70
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
It's not the end of the Su Qin Zhang Yi.

71
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Be careful.

72
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,900
I don't like people who are not ambitious.

73
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,900
I think you lack the spirit of the elite.

74
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,900
But you are the first beneficiary of the MH diversification recruitment strategy.

75
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Congratulations.

76
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
You can attend the interview at 2 p.m.

77
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,900
By the way, don't be too happy.

78
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,900
The one who will interview you this afternoon is the unbeatable warrior of the MH.

79
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,900
He will only be more strict than me.

80
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,900
So you can Emcee the marriage of Kcedev by Bkey.

81
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,900
If I can, I won't have a mother.

82
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Music

83
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
the absolute control of the TV.

84
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,740
It's time to start.

85
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,940
Stop arguing.

86
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,100
Wait a bit longer.

87
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,820
Boss, you're still waiting?

88
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,060
You're so noisy.

89
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,940
Mr. Du, we're still two points away

90
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,500
from the complete acquisition of the successfully controlled

91
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,180
DVD of the Dragon King.

92
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,180
This time, the attack on MH

93
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,380
will definitely not be in our hands.

94
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,380
It's been two days since we started.

95
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
I'm very happy.

96
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,180
We will continue to work hard.

97
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Hurry up and call Mr. Yuan.

98
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,900
Mr. Yuan, we're still one point away.

99
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,980
Let's start.

100
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,380
Mr. Du, bad news.

101
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,900
VTV suddenly stopped its announcement

102
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,020
and announced a new plan.

103
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,460
Mr. Hua's shares

104
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,020
have been lost.

105
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,420
How could this happen?

106
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,700
VTV's CEO just resigned.

107
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,020
The board of directors is very confused.

108
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,860
How did they suddenly have an announcement plan?

109
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,740
Mr. Du,

110
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,660
we will definitely have other ways.

111
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,860
No need.

112
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,860
We've already been set up.

113
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,940
Leave us.

114
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,460
I don't want to see you again tomorrow.

115
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,060
Listen,

116
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,420
tell your boss that

117
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,980
the band members are buried.

118
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,660
Hurry up and ask Wu 8.

119
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,220
The band members in bathtub and shower

120
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,620
are all buried within 24 hours

121
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,140
of the official announcement,

122
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,260
so we definitely want to ask Mr. Hua

123
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,620
to distracted the Army

124
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,300
and see they can't see the authenticated name.

125
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,300
Before Mr. Hua realises they have been

126
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,380
used by those captives,

127
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,820
let's get the news from the board of directors.

128
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,100
If

129
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,340
they haven't been себя hued,

130
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,260
The first is to attack the enemy, the second is to attack the enemy.

131
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,260
The third is to attack the city.

132
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,460
I admire your plan.

133
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,260
The famous Mr. Du Lei has been defeated by your little plan.

134
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,460
The backers are furious.

135
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,860
I know him well.

136
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,860
The more you want to win, the easier it is to make a decision.

137
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,860
Boss, why are you sleeping again?

138
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,460
I have something to report to you.

139
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,060
Changchang,

140
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,260
let me go.

141
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,060
Last night, I helped the old man for a night's sleep for the board's wedding.

142
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,260
Now my head still hurts.

143
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Be good.

144
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,860
Hey, you're making a new set again.

145
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,860
What should I do?

146
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,260
Last night, I was vomited by the old man.

147
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,460
You really treat the office as a show ground,

148
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,060
and you're treating the office as a stage.

149
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,660
This is the dress for the BYU's head-on league meeting tonight.

150
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,860
Give me your opinion.

151
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,660
The dress is nice, but it's a bit too big.

152
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,860
Believe it or not, I'll kill you.

153
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,460
Again?

154
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,860
The French French-born guardian Ding Tian will go back to the hospital.

155
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Are you going to be my boyfriend?

156
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,660
What do you think?

157
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,460
Forget it. I'm used to your rejection.

158
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,260
There's only one day in Shanghai for Ding Tian's trip.

159
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,460
There will be a lot of people surrounding him at the party.

160
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,260
But I can tell you a secret.

161
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,660
You can definitely get his attention.

162
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
What secret?

163
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,260
Ding Tian's wife and Ding Tian were young,

164
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,060
and they were in the medical team.

165
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,860
What I wrote behind your back is his wife's alias.

166
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,060
He'll definitely notice you by then.

167
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,860
You're too wild.

168
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
He doesn't have this in his heart.

169
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,660
Half a year ago, I went to the medical team on behalf of M&H to make donations.

170
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,860
You can tell him when you get the chance.

171
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
You haven't even sent out your order.

172
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,060
You've already reached the end.

173
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,660
You're too good.

174
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,060
This time, it's an exception.

175
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,260
I really didn't know about this when I was making donations.

176
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,660
You can take it as a return for doing good things.

177
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,660
I'm here to give you the resume for the interview this afternoon.

178
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,260
Okay.

179
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,060
This girl is boring. What's her name?

180
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,060
She said she's Mo Zi.

181
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,660
Come here.

182
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,060
Love is not a mere achievement.

183
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,860
It's a new world.

184
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,660
Hey, are you okay?

185
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,460
I'm fine.

186
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,060
Don't act cool in front of me.

187
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,860
I only pick the best fruits on the tree.

188
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,260
But I don't care about the fruits.

189
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,260
I'm going to the interview. You can go ahead.

190
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,660
Hi, Lily.

191
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
Hi, Xingxuan.

192
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,060
How's it going?

193
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,860
You still have the fifth round of the interview.

194
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,660
You still don't know if you can get the Alpha.

195
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,860
Don't be discouraged. You have to have confidence in yourself.

196
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,260
I believe in you.

197
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,260
You can enter the M&H's final year.

198
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,060
You're already a professional.

199
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,660
You're still a top student.

200
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
You're the only student in our group.

201
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,460
And I have the luck to get the support.

202
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,660
You can definitely fulfill your dream and enter this company.

203
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,260
Okay. Thank you for your encouragement and support.

204
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,460
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

205
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,260
Do your best. I'll be here waiting for you.

206
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,860
I'm hanging up.

207
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Two days ago, Gao Gu had an important information.

208
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,260
The market technology plan has increased power supply and given a price.

209
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,860
You guys analyze

210
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,860
if M&H should buy the stock of power supply.

211
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,460
I think it should.

212
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,660
Power supply is now 35%

213
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,860
After the purchase, the stock should be

214
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,260
17% increase.

215
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,060
If you buy 3 million stocks, it can be the main fund.

216
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,660
After the purchase, the stock will be the new chairman of M&H.

217
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,260
He's the investor of the world.

218
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,060
Now the annual profit of the stock will be more than 442.

219
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,460
I don't think this meeting will be successful.

220
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,060
Power supply has been decreasing for three years.

221
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,260
The management has lost twice.

222
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,060
M&H is an old oil bar.

223
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,260
It can't be good for power supply.

224
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
If M&H doesn't like power supply,

225
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,460
why does it have to buy the stock?

226
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,060
M&H is the shareholder of the market technology.

227
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,860
His ex-wife owns 5% of the shares of power supply.

228
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:18,960
I suspect he's just pretending to be a

229
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,560
So the principle of the interview today is

230
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,960
the wolf stays, the sheep leaves.

231
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,360
Come on.

232
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,960
Little crybaby.

233
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:24,360
Take away the spirit from me

234
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,960
To somewhere love don't exist

235
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Burn my heart, steal my soul always

236
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Sometimes I dream of you

237
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Tears on my face all night long

238
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Tell me how I live without you

239
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

240
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
I'll help you take it off.

241
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
No, no, I can do it myself.

242
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Here you go.

243
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm sorry.

244
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
It's okay.

245
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
Put it on.

246
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,960
It's a memory of the MH-1 that Mr. Yuan gave you.

247
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Wait a minute.

248
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I can borrow your phone to express my gratitude to Mr. Yuan.

249
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Thank you.

250
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Yuan Shuai, wait for me. I won't lose to you.

251
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Thank you.

252
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Yuan Shuai, wait for me. I won't lose to you.

253
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Yuan Shuai, wait for me. I won't lose to you.

254
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Boss, you heard it.

255
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
He said he would never lose to you.

256
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
I won't lose to you.

257
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
You're so smart.

258
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
I don't understand.

259
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
He did well in the last interview.

260
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
What a good girl.

261
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
How could you let him out?

262
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Use your pity on other women.

263
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Don't think about him.

264
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,960
You two know each other?

265
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,960
How can a person who can't even cry be suitable for the fight?

266
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
I drove her away for her own good.

267
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Su Chang, find me a job that suits her.

268
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,960
If there's a company that would hire her according to the MH-1's treatment,

269
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
I would like to be their one-year free investment consultant.

270
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,960
One-year free investment consultant?

271
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Are you sure?

272
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Go find her.

273
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Don't worry.

274
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Don't worry.

275
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
General, where's my uniform?

276
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Here.

277
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Thanks.

278
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Jiefang, Feile, Mo Zi, Jianai.

279
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Look.

280
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
We did a full check.

281
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,960
It's confirmed that your daughter's eye allergy has increased.

282
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Increased? To what extent?

283
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,960
That is to say, if she cries again, she will be in shock.

284
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,960
If she doesn't take her medicine in time, her life will be in danger.

285
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Then, in the future, won't she...

286
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
You don't have to worry about that.

287
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,960
As long as she doesn't have an allergy, there won't be any problems.

288
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
That is to say, as long as she doesn't cry,

289
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,960
your daughter's future normal life will not be affected.

290
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

291
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
You're welcome.

292
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Lan Shan, thank you for protecting Junjun.

293
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
It's nothing.

294
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,960
You are two years older than Junjun, so you are his big brother.

295
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Uncle saw you grow up.

296
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,960
He said you were the smartest of the kids.

297
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,960
I want to ask you a favor. Can you promise me?

298
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Go ahead.

299
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,960
In the future, no matter what happens in school,

300
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
you must help me protect Junjun.

301
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,960
You must not let him cry.

302
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Okay?

303
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
No problem.

304
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Thank you, Uncle.

305
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,960
But will you give me ten salaries every month?

306
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Of course.

307
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Uncle, don't worry. I'm the most responsible.

308
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Every penny you pay me will not be wasted.

309
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
It's a deal.

310
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
It's a deal.

311
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
What did you say?

312
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,960
You said that today's interview was about a kid living across your house

313
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
and your dad bought him to protect that boy?

314
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,960
I know Hua Chen Hui.

315
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Really?

316
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,960
He's a guardian angel. How could he let you down?

317
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,960
He's not a guardian angel. He's a bad guy.

318
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,960
My dad spent every penny.

319
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
When I was little, he used to tell people to bully me

320
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,960
behind my back.

321
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I was too timid and didn't dare to resist.

322
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,960
From elementary school to high school, he was my nightmare.

323
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
What happened after that?

324
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,960
He did something that I could never forgive.

325
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
My dad took me to school.

326
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,960
He should have told me that he was going to kick you out of school.

327
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Why would he kick you out of M&H?

328
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Baby, do you think a bad guy would feel ashamed of being kicked out of school?

329
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,960
If I can't get kicked out, then forget it.

330
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,960
I swear that my interview will be fine. I can definitely get in.

331
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
I did it on purpose.

332
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,960
I will never let it go.

333
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Here.

334
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
Thank you.

335
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Who is it?

336
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I don't know.

337
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
You are...

338
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Yuan Shuai.

339
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
I am Yuan Shuai.

340
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,960
What's wrong with you? You even called me on WeChat.

341
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
I eliminated you today for your own good.

342
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
A smart person should do the right thing in the right place.

343
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,960
I happen to have a director assistant who is also a director.

344
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,960
A director assistant's salary is less than 300,000 a year.

345
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,960
There is a lot of room for improvement. I can introduce you to him.

346
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,960
It's not too late for a gentleman to take revenge.

347
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,960
I must get into M&H.

348
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I want him to know that he is not the only one in this world who can say that.

349
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
That's right.

350
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,960
I will not resist. I will support you.

351
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Cheers.

352
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,960
But how can I resist being a good actress?

353
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,960
My character is not a pushover.

354
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,960
I asked the older neighbor of my sister's, the younger one's, the classmate's, the older brother's,

355
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,960
to help me get into M&H.

356
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,960
And I have to say that I have been taking care of my illness.

357
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
I am the vice president of M&H and also the head of the investment department.

358
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Lin Tai Mo will also go.

359
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
He will also go.

360
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,960
You have always admired him.

361
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Think about it. If you can see him,

362
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,960
tell him about the internal injustice.

363
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
And then...

364
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
And then what?

365
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,960
You are crying, crying, and complaining about how I was bullied by Yuan Shuai.

366
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
What?

367
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
There are so many people who are bullied every year.

368
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Even if I get into Lin Tai Mo, people won't remember me.

369
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
What can I say?

370
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
If you believe me,

371
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
you will dress up and go to M&H.

372
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Leave the rest to me.

373
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
I will go.

374
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,960
President Du, President Du.

375
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
President Du, President Du.

376
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
This time you lost to Yuan Shuai again.

377
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Do you have any internal information to share?

378
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
I am sorry, everyone.

379
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
We are here to attend the meeting.

380
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Please follow the official media and press conference.

381
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,960
President Lin, you are the one who joined M&H after you came out.

382
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Does this loss represent the two companies' strength?

383
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
There is still a gap.

384
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,960
It is normal to make a mistake.

385
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,960
We have always maintained a friendly cooperation relationship with M&H.

386
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,960
We are rivals and friends.

387
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,960
I never thought that I would work with you because of a case.

388
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,960
President Du, because of you, M&H lost nearly 1 billion dollars.

389
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,960
Do you not need to be responsible for such a failure?

390
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
1 billion?

391
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Does your statement have any basis?

392
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
Even though you did not get control,

393
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,960
the VTV channel of M&H still exists.

394
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
I am sorry.

395
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,960
President Lin, please say a few words.

396
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I am sorry.

397
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
It is okay.

398
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,960
President Fan, M&H won again.

399
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Do you have anything to say?

400
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
M&H never wants to defeat anyone.

401
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Our responsibility is to fight for the biggest profit for the client.

402
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
We are not going to let the money

403
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
bring harm to the market and the companies.

404
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,960
President Yuan, this morning, VTV suddenly stopped to increase the stock.

405
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
It successfully defeated the company's bad acquisition.

406
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
I heard that this is a very good opportunity.

407
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
I think it is a good opportunity.

408
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
I heard that this is a good opportunity.

409
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
I heard that these are all your plans.

410
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Do you have anything to say?

411
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
We will move forward with a low profile.

412
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I heard that the person who helped Hualun acquire the company

413
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
was Du Lei from GE.

414
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
He is your old rival.

415
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
This time, you defeated him again.

416
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Do you have anything to say to him?

417
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Let him continue to work hard.

418
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Okay. President Fan,

419
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
is there any new plan for M&H this year?

420
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Can you tell us about it?

421
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
We have a big joint plan that is still in the middle of the year.

422
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
If there is any news, I will immediately

423
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
report it to you, okay?

424
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Don't mind him.

425
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
You will win.

426
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Understood.

427
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
The situation this year is not bad.

428
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
The company's performance is very good.

429
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
So I hope that you will continue to work hard.

430
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
And then,

431
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
do better.

432
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Brother, is that Yuan Shuai?

433
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
He is older than today.

434
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Go away.

435
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Yes. What are you doing?

436
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Thank you.

437
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Yuan Shuai, why don't you answer my messages?

438
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
Who are you?

439
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Do you not love me anymore?

440
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
I am not your friend.

441
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
I am your friend.

442
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,960
I am your friend.

443
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I am your friend.

444
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
I am your friend.

445
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
I am your friend.

446
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Do I know you?

447
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

448
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
You pretend not to know me.

449
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Did you all hear that?

450
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
This person pretends not to know me.

451
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Now you pretend not to know me.

452
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Then you called me a little heartless, little baby,

453
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
and little cute. Why didn't you say you didn't know me?

454
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
You don't know me.

455
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
You are a monster.

456
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
You are a bastard.

457
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Miss,

458
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
you said I am your boyfriend, right?

459
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Okay.

460
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
Then I will ask you.

461
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Where do I live?

462
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
What day is my birthday?

463
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
What is my phone number?

464
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Do you know?

465
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Okay. Since you are talking about your girlfriend,

466
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
coincidentally, my girlfriend

467
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
is also here today.

468
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Really?

469
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Who is it?

470
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Who is it?

471
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Who is it?

472
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Who is it?

473
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
My girlfriend is here.

474
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Hello.

475
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Hello.

476
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Hello.

477
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Is it a water bath today?

478
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,960
You didn't give me a chance to tease me.

479
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I didn't see Lin Tai Mo.

480
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
I left in such a mess.

481
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Is this man a monster?

482
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Are you talking about me, little crybaby?

483
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
I am sorry.

484
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
How did you know I was here?

485
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
I have been wronged since I was a child.

486
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
I like to look up.

487
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
It's been so many years.

488
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
You are still so good at guessing.

489
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Yes, you are always transparent.

490
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Then guess what I want to do now.

491
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
You found an actor

492
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
who is so good at acting.

493
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
He is your friend.

494
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
And I humiliated him in public.

495
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
You must be trying to say something bad.

496
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
But you don't know how to say it.

497
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
It's okay. Just say it.

498
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Congratulations.

499
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
You guessed wrong.

500
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
You are not worth making me angry.

501
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Tell me.

502
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Why did you kick me out of MH?

503
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Mind your words.

504
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
You never entered MH.

505
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
I have the interview results

506
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
to enter the company.

507
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
And I know that in the past five years,

508
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
MH has never eliminated people in the middle.

509
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Congratulations, Miss Jiang.

510
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
You are the first one.

511
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Is it a honor?

512
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
You look like a jerk.

513
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Look at me again.

514
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Am I that cool?

515
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
I will definitely enter MH.

516
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
You will not.

517
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Yuan Shuai, Yang Ji Lian will bite you.

518
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
You bite me.

519
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
Come on. Bite me.

520
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
Bite here.

521
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
I don't let you enter MH.

522
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
That's for your own good.

523
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
You should learn from me.

524
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
You deserve it.

525
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
What do you mean by that?

526
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
What lesson?

527
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
The most painful lesson in my life

528
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
is to believe in you.

529
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
When my dad asked you to protect me,

530
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
you were so angry.

531
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,960
If it wasn't for you,

532
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
why would I have transferred to MH?

533
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Do you know that I am still

534
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
dreaming about it?

535
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Dear teachers and students,

536
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
the topic of my lecture today

537
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,960
is my Chinese heart.

538
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Changchen.

539
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Can you do it?

540
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
Yes, you can't. Go down.

541
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Don't waste your time.

542
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
Go down.

543
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
Go down.

544
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Go down.

545
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Go down.

546
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Go down.

547
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
Go down.

548
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
Go down.

549
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Go down.

550
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Go down.

551
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Go down.

552
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Go down.

553
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Go down.

554
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Go down.

555
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Go down.

556
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Go down.

557
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Go down.

558
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Go down.

559
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Go down.

560
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Go down.

561
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Go down.

562
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Go down.

563
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Changchen.

564
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Changchen.

565
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Changchen.

566
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Don't cry.

567
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
Your eye patch isn't missing.

568
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,960
Look.

569
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
Your eye patch is with me.

570
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
It's missing, look.

571
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
It's you.

572
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Wake up, General!

573
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,960
From then on, I don't have the face to stay in high school anymore.

574
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I can only transfer to another school.

575
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Who would have thought that after so many years, I would meet you again?

576
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,960
You should know that in the industry,

577
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,960
the proportion of female employees is less than 20%.

578
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,960
The ability, endurance, and resistance that this job requires

579
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
is something that many men can't achieve.

580
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Not to mention you.

581
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,960
You are a person who can even cry.

582
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,960
How can you use your own judgment to exclude me from that 20%?

583
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
How can someone else do it but I can't?

584
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
No matter what you say this time, I won't hide anymore.

585
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I'm telling you, Yuan Shuai, I must enter MH.

586
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
You can't.

587
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
What are you doing?

588
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
I don't want that.

589
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Don't move.

590
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
Come back with me.

591
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,960
If you cry, I won't have time to send you to the hospital.

592
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
Don't make a fuss.

593
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Let go of me, Yuan Shuai!

594
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Let go of me!

595
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Don't make a fuss.

596
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Yuan Shuai, let go of me!

597
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
Let go!

598
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Zhang Xin!

599
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Zhang Xin!

600
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Here!

601
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Hurry, hurry!

602
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Yuan Shuai, are you okay?

603
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Yuan Shuai, are you okay?

604
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Stop filming!

605
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
Who are you filming?

606
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
You're filming a scene from the movie, Gao Taiqing?

607
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
Let's go!

608
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Zhang Xin!

609
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Zhang Xin!

610
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Zhang Xin!

611
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Zhang Xin!

612
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Jiang Jun.

613
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
What is it?

614
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
I've been targeting you for the past year.

615
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,960
I've been doing a detailed analysis of the various emergencies.

616
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,960
I've divided the quarrels into nine levels.

617
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,960
I've divided the school bullying into six, 18 levels.

618
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,960
After a year of experiments, I found that you can only endure a level of dispute.

619
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,960
You can't be angry with all kinds of school bullies.

620
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
I'm sorry.

621
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,960
You can't be angry with all kinds of school bullies.

622
00:43:43,960 --> 00:44:00,920
You can't be angry with all kinds of insects and

623
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I don't know how to change those little white rabbits, little sheep, little dogs,

624
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
these weak, cute animals.

625
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I suggest you start with your own hobbies.

626
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Learn to draw some more fierce animals to improve yourself.

627
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
Jiang Jun, did you hear that?

628
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,920
Drawed a wolf?

629
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
A wolf?

630
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,920
A wolf?

631
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,920
A wolf?

632
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,920
A wolf?

633
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,920
A wolf?

634
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
A wolf?

635
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
A wolf?

636
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,920
A wolf?

637
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,920
A wolf?

638
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,920
A wolf?

639
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,920
A wolf?

640
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,920
A wolf?

641
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,920
A wolf?

642
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
A wolf?

643
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,920
A wolf?

644
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
A wolf?

645
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,920
A wolf?

646
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,920
A wolf?

647
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,920
A wolf?

648
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,920
A wolf?

649
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
A wolf?

650
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,920
A wolf?

651
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,920
A wolf?

652
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,920
A wolf?

653
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
A wolf?

654
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
A wolf?

655
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,920
A wolf?

656
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,920
A wolf?

657
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:34,920
I think I'm tired, I think I'm blind.

658
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Don't know how to feel, don't know how to heal.

659
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:49,920
You walk so fast, can't catch your light.

660
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,920
You fly so high, leave all the things behind.

661
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:05,920
End of story, leave all love nowhere to find.

662
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,920
I think I'm tired, I think I'm blind.

663
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Don't know how to feel, don't know how to heal.

664
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,920
You walk so fast, can't catch your light.

665
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:35,920
You fly so high, leave all the things behind.

666
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:45,920
End of story, leave all love nowhere to find.
