1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Perfect.

2
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,560
Are you okay?

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,520
I'm fine.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,880
What do you mean by buying?

5
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,800
Jiang Jun, let me tell you.

6
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
The body is the most honest.

7
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,360
Come on.

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,200
Come on.

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,960
Come on.

10
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Come on.

11
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Come on.

12
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Come on.

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Come on.

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Come on.

15
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Come on.

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Come on.

17
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Come on.

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Come on.

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Come on.

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Come on.

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,440
Come on.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
Come on.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,960
Come on.

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,480
Miss Xing Xin,

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
I just come back from abroad,

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
forgot time travel and travel.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:24,120
No.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,000
You usually stay here,

29
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,740
right?

30
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
How can there be a sound of water?

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Dog!

32
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,740
I have a dog that can flush the toilet.

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Dog can flush the toilet?

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,740
Yes, it's so smart.

35
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
You are here in the morning.

36
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
Assistant Yuan.

37
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,740
You...

38
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,740
Why are you here?

39
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
You two...

40
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
You...

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
We two...

42
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,740
It's the kind of relationship you think of.

43
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,740
Baby, let me tell you.

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,740
I found something very unexpected this morning.

45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
What is it?

46
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
It's the one who lives next to you, Mr. Jiang.

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
And your assistant Yuan.

48
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,740
You two are a couple.

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,740
How did you know?

50
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,740
I saw it with my own eyes this morning.

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,740
With your own eyes?

52
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,740
What did you see?

53
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
I saw them living together.

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,740
My little Zulong,

55
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
you have to stay away from her.

56
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
What's wrong with her?

57
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
She...

58
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,740
She is the daughter of our boss.

59
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
She came here by herself.

60
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,740
Why did she sit in this position when she was so young?

61
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,740
So you mean,

62
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,740
that little assistant Yuan is the little white face she raised?

63
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,740
It's understandable.

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,740
You should go to her less often.

65
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
You know her secret.

66
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
She should wear slippers in the company.

67
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
No way.

68
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
I think she is a good person.

69
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,740
You don't know.

70
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,740
She is very bad.

71
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
What's wrong with her?

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,740
You should go to her less often.

73
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
Okay?

74
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,740
Okay.

75
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
I will listen to you.

76
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Mr. Su, you pay the bill.

77
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,740
Pay the bill.

78
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Mr. Jiang, little assistant Yuan?

79
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,740
It can't be Junjun and Yuan Shuai, right?

80
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
But the position is not right.

81
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
It should be a coincidence.

82
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,740
Please.

83
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Junjun,

84
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,740
the office of West World has been renovated.

85
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,740
Tonight, Li Xiaochuan and Mr. Du and I

86
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,740
will celebrate the formal opening of West World.

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,740
You should spare the time for tonight.

88
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
Okay, no problem.

89
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,740
I want you to be with me

90
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,740
and open the silence

91
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,740
to heal my wound

92
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,740
You're my miracle

93
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,740
You're my means everything

94
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,740
My promise

95
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,740
will be said after a moment

96
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Hello.

97
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Hello, Mr. Du.

98
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Are you free tonight?

99
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
What?

100
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
West World has been renovated.

101
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
You're the investor.

102
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,740
We want you to witness

103
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
the opening of the world.

104
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Okay, see you tonight.

105
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
Junjun, I'm off work.

106
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
I'll go to your house now.

107
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Okay.

108
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
Let's go to Xiaochuan's place together.

109
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,740
No, you can't go.

110
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
No, if I stop them,

111
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Li Li will be suspicious.

112
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Wang Yuan Shuai, hide yourself.

113
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Li Li wants to change clothes here.

114
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
If she sees you at my house,

115
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
she will be dead.

116
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
Why would Jiang Junjun

117
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
take off his shoes?

118
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,740
You just came back.

119
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
I want to ask you

120
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
why you don't have men's slippers.

121
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Well,

122
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
women live alone.

123
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
And those delivery men

124
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
will come here

125
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
if they see

126
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
men's shoes.

127
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
It will be safer.

128
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
You don't want to do that, right?

129
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
Yes.

130
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Stop it.

131
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Why is Wang Chai not here?

132
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
I can't see him.

133
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
He even added water.

134
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Why didn't he add water?

135
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
Why do you have men's clothes in your house?

136
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,740
No, it's mine.

137
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
I just bought it.

138
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,740
I really like this color

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
recently.

140
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
You,

141
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,740
you are stuck.

142
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
You want to wear it yourself.

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
How can you be stuck?

144
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Go and apply it.

145
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
I'll go.

146
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740
You,

147
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
you.

148
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Jiang Junjun.

149
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,740
I think

150
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
you should explain

151
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
why this kind of thing

152
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
appears in your house.

153
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
I bought it recently.

154
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
I think it's

155
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
pretty good.

156
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
It's elastic.

157
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
It's so good.

158
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
And

159
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
I like it.

160
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
I've always liked it.

161
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
It's all cotton.

162
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Look.

163
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,740
It's very convenient.

164
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
It's very comfortable.

165
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Do you want to try it?

166
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
It's comfortable?

167
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,740
Yes.

168
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
You like to

169
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
wear it here.

170
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,740
It's a special thing.

171
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,740
You're being stingy, right?

172
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
Do you think I'll believe you?

173
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
I don't believe you either.

174
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
I'll be honest

175
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,740
and say the same thing.

176
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
I don't want to.

177
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,740
We have a colleague

178
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
who bragged to her girlfriend

179
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
that she is the first brother

180
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
and bought several houses.

181
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Her girlfriend

182
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
has come back to visit her recently.

183
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Yuan Shuai was helping her

184
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
and helped her move

185
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
to the next room.

186
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
So you let her live in

187
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
because you want to help Yuan Shuai?

188
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,740
I don't want her to live here either.

189
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
But she has to live here.

190
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,740
What?

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
I can't.

192
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
I can't.

193
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Why do you do this?

194
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
I can't.

195
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
I can't.

196
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
I can't.

197
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,220
But he insisted on staying here.

198
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,460
I couldn't leave.

199
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,300
Besides,

200
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,100
this is his room.

201
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,180
He insisted on staying here?

202
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,300
Then,

203
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,340
did anything

204
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,780
happen

205
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,100
to you?

206
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,140
Of course not.

207
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
How could it be?

208
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,460
We...

209
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,700
What's that look?

210
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,980
What look?

211
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,740
I told you.

212
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,580
What look?

213
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,300
What time is it?

214
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,500
Do you want to go with Li Xiaochun?

215
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,180
That one?

216
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,540
I'm going on a date.

217
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,260
It's all your fault.

218
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,300
Wait.

219
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,100
I'll come back and settle it with you.

220
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,020
Luckily, Tang Seng went there.

221
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,660
What's wrong with me recently?

222
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,580
I'm like that bastard.

223
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,780
I'm not a bad person.

224
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,860
I'm just a bad person.

225
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
I'm just a bad person.

226
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,540
I'm just a bad person.

227
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,620
Tang SengŞan

228
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,100
Mr. Tu.

229
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,340
I'm just here for a few reasons.

230
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,660
Wait.

231
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,100
Don't exaggerate.

232
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,760
Is it a ceremony?

233
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,940
Take it with you.

234
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,980
What?

235
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,420
Okay, let's go.

236
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,580
On the stairs. Wait.

237
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,420
Okay.

238
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,260
And then I'll do another one.

239
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,580
Another one.

240
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,180
Okay.

241
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,140
Mr. Du, please show us your trick.

242
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,780
Surprise!

243
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,020
Why are you here today?

244
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,420
Today is to celebrate the opening of the Western World.

245
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,340
We've prepared a surprise party for you.

246
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,260
Mr. Du, look.

247
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,860
This is the office area.

248
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,620
I wonder if you like this style.

249
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,940
And this is the sofa area.

250
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,780
I've seen it.

251
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,500
The sun will shine there

252
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,100
around 2 or 3 o'clock.

253
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,540
When you're not busy,

254
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
you can sit down

255
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,500
and have a coffee.

256
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,460
Isn't it easy?

257
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,660
Mr. Du, we all know you're busy.

258
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,100
But we hope you can come

259
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,740
when you have time.

260
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,460
Please come.

261
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,700
Yeah, don't worry.

262
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,220
With your excellent staff,

263
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,500
Mr. Du will come often.

264
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,620
What are you talking about?

265
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,860
You're also a part of the Western World.

266
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,020
Mr. Du, right?

267
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,300
Yes.

268
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,340
Right.

269
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,380
Xiaochuan and I are preparing

270
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,900
a offline party for the same city.

271
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,700
If you're not busy,

272
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,620
remember to come.

273
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,260
Speaking of this,

274
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,420
I think

275
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,740
it's not only

276
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,940
to strengthen the tacit understanding

277
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,460
between the users,

278
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,860
but also to make it more romantic.

279
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,900
Jun, tell me.

280
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,020
No one wants to go out

281
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,020
on a date.

282
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,260
It's not as dangerous

283
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,340
as dressing up.

284
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,340
The most important thing

285
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,820
in this kind of event is the occasion.

286
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,100
It must stimulate

287
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,980
the love interest of people.

288
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,060
Jun, what do you think?

289
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,180
I think Xu Li is right.

290
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,700
Thank you, Mr. Du.

291
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,500
Let's celebrate.

292
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,860
Today is the opening

293
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,820
of the Western World.

294
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,780
Today is the opening

295
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,020
of the Western World.

296
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,100
Let's welcome

297
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,420
Mr. Du, the investor.

298
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,180
Say it.

299
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,340
Okay.

300
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,340
Let me say something.

301
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,500
I've been in the investment industry

302
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,540
for many years.

303
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,820
I've met many

304
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,820
big and small cases.

305
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,140
A case like the Western World

306
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,660
is the smallest case

307
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,620
I've ever met.

308
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,740
But I think

309
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,980
as long as you work hard

310
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
and use your abilities,

311
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,620
you will definitely create

312
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,860
the product of the business market.

313
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,020
Thank you, Mr. Du.

314
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,980
Next, let's welcome

315
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,060
the founder of the Western World,

316
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,060
Li Xiaochuan.

317
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,580
Please make a speech.

318
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,300
Hello, Xiaochuan.

319
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,180
Please come up.

320
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,100
Come on.

321
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,860
Cheers.

322
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Cheers.

323
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,100
Cheers.

324
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,700
Cheers.

325
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,060
It's such a special day.

326
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,220
Let's take a picture.

327
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,620
Okay.

328
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:52,980
Junjun.

329
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,420
I promise not to post it.

330
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,540
I really hid it.

331
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,460
Don't move.

332
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,620
Three, two, one.

333
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,700
Mr. Du.

334
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,100
We're going to

335
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,460
leave some sourness today.

336
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
Don't mind it.

337
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,060
You can't say that.

338
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,700
It's Mr. Du's investment money.

339
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,300
You have to use every penny

340
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,980
on the knife.

341
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,820
I think

342
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,540
since it's the first day of the business,

343
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,900
we don't have to buy so much.

344
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,700
Let it go.

345
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
You can eat whatever you want.

346
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm sorry.

347
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,260
Okay.

348
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,300
I'll go buy it now.

349
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,660
There's a fried chicken and spring rolls

350
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,180
at the door. It's very delicious.

351
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,780
Since it's Mr. Du's treat,

352
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,180
we'll leave it at that.

353
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,820
Let's go.

354
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,660
Let's go.

355
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,140
Come with me.

356
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,060
Why should I come with you?

357
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,620
Come with me to buy something.

358
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,020
Come on.

359
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Hurry up.

360
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,220
You can talk for a while.

361
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,780
We may be very busy.

362
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,340
Let's go.

363
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,620
You're not come back yet?

364
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,540
He won't come back.

365
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,660
he's working overtime again.

366
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,620
Who's working overtime?

367
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,660
The Western world只有 isn't open today.

368
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,460
Sounds good.

369
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,140
You're the bestounds.

370
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,220
It's so slippery.

371
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,420
Tony.

372
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,580
Here.

373
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,980
I haven't eaten friends.

374
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,420
Hold on.

375
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,780
Yes.

376
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,460
So...

377
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,420
Open up.

378
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,560
Where is your office?

379
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,260
Okay.

380
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,060
I'll do it.

381
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,700
Sorry.

382
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,820
Hurry up.

383
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,580
Do you think he's mocking me?

384
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,980
No, I don't think so.

385
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,220
Listen,

386
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm your

387
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm not a good smileer.

388
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,540
Unless

389
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,300
I can't recognize you.

390
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,940
Hello, who's this?

391
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,300
Hello, Mr. Du.

392
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,660
Linda has ordered

393
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,100
birthday gifts and birthday cakes for you.

394
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,180
But you don't have anyone at home.

395
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,780
Can you tell me your current address?

396
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,060
I'll ask someone to send it to you.

397
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,740
How do you know it's today?

398
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
I don't need it now.

399
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,580
You help me deal with it.

400
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,900
Mr. Du, it's your birthday today.

401
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
It's kind of a birthday.

402
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,620
Linda is the last time I was in the neighborhood.

403
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,740
You are my sister who is in the same name as my family.

404
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,700
Anyway, I don't know

405
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,740
any Du family.

406
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,220
I just know it's your birthday today.

407
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,420
So,

408
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,020
I allow my apprentice to sincerely say

409
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,860
Happy birthday to you.

410
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,740
Thank you.

411
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,300
Oh, right.

412
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,620
There's a cake here today.

413
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,460
Let's celebrate it together when they come back.

414
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,900
Let's celebrate it together.

415
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,100
Or let's just forget it.

416
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,220
I don't want others to know.

417
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,960
I know

418
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,380
your birthday.

419
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,660
But about your last birthday,

420
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,340
since I'm also there.

421
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,380
That's what I do for my aunt.

422
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,860
I'll show her.

423
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,460
OK, then.

424
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,140
Bell university?!

425
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,860
Cassaita?

426
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,380
Huh?

427
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,580
A lotдержika!

428
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,540
What year was it?

429
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,360
Year.

430
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,520
Why are you enjoying yourself?

431
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
Happy Birthday!

432
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,880
Happy Birthday!

433
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,120
Happy Birthday!

434
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm bit nervous now.

435
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,440
Okay.

436
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,920
I follow your wish.

437
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,280
A wish?

438
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
I don't have any wish.

439
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,360
How about

440
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,840
keeping it?

441
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,520
Okay.

442
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
Keep it.

443
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,320
Of course.

444
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,880
Okay.

445
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,040
Why can't I eat noodles?

446
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,720
Let me help you.

447
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,560
I want to set a moment

448
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,760
for you to say yes.

449
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,200
Stop it.

450
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,360
Mr. Lu,

451
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,760
I can't eat this cake.

452
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,280
It's all about the taste.

453
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,000
Well...

454
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,280
Tianzhe,

455
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,000
I want to tell you something.

456
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,320
Go ahead.

457
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,440
Actually...

458
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
Actually...

459
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,880
Right.

460
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,920
Okay.

461
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,160
What can I do for you?

462
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,720
It's nothing.

463
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,560
My friend asked me to

464
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
help him eat and official the food.

465
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Mr. Lu, go ahead.

466
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,520
OK, go on.

467
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
Li LOL אם

468
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,240
When will you come back?

469
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,440
I have a sore wound.

470
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,080
Nothing serious.

471
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Du,

472
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,960
something is really urgent.

473
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,280
I gotta go.

474
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
I'll make it up to you

475
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,640
about your birthday another day.

476
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,160
I'm leaving.

477
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,840
Happy birthday!

478
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm leaving.

479
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,840
You're working late.

480
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,040
Why didn't you work overtime?

481
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,480
I remember I asked you to come over

482
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,680
to talk to me a few times.

483
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
You said you were busy.

484
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,400
What's wrong?

485
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,480
You suddenly

486
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,640
came to me today.

487
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,760
I've been by your side for days.

488
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,880
I didn't want to be too anxious,

489
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,800
so I came.

490
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
Talk to me.

491
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,520
What's wrong?

492
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,280
Is it because of work

493
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,840
or him?

494
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,160
I understand.

495
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,920
You came to me

496
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,120
because of him, right?

497
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,320
He said something

498
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,560
very hurtful to me.

499
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,400
And recently,

500
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
I can't contact him.

501
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,080
I envied you

502
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,320
when I was a kid.

503
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,160
Really.

504
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,240
You can do whatever you want

505
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
freely.

506
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,640
So,

507
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,600
I tried my best to prove it

508
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,080
until I realized

509
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,000
it's not what I want.

510
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,080
Our nature is different.

511
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,720
You're Du.

512
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
I'm not.

513
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,120
I never thought

514
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,320
he would look at me like that.

515
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,680
I always thought

516
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,880
I was his support.

517
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,480
But in his eyes,

518
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,880
I'm just like those

519
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,600
who want to control

520
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,120
his life.

521
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,960
No difference.

522
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,440
I decided to

523
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,600
leave Antique Two

524
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,480
with you

525
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,240
so that even

526
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,560
when we losing

527
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,080
an imposed

528
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,120
relationship,

529
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,960
I would only

530
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,000
think of myself personally.

531
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,560
Here's a drink.

532
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
and a strong person.

533
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,120
I admit that I am.

534
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,560
But I've never treated him.

535
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,600
Your character

536
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,760
will affect your behavior.

537
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,400
For example, this cup of warm water,

538
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
even if it's a doctor's suggestion,

539
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,280
you won't accept it easily.

540
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,480
Maybe you think

541
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
you've controlled yourself enough

542
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,280
in front of him.

543
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,520
But in fact,

544
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,920
your subconscious power

545
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,400
will still be able to

546
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,680
control his life.

547
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,200
In fact, many things

548
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,480
may have better results

549
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,120
if you change a method.

550
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,880
Have a good rest first.

551
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,320
Relax.

552
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,440
趴出于orewhite

553
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,200
Change a method.

554
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,720
He doesn't answer my calls.

555
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,240
So what?

556
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,440
He doesn't even call you.

557
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
You have a scar?

558
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,760
Yes.

559
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,200
But I can take it.

560
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,640
You still play games with scars?

561
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,320
Give them back to me.

562
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
I can only play games.

563
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Who made this?

564
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
It looks so delicious.

565
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
No, it's cold.

566
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
Just heat it up.

567
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
I didn't eat anything at the children's house.

568
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
I'm starving.

569
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I saw the photo you sent me.

570
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
I'm drooling.

571
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Let's eat together.

572
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
No, you eat it yourself.

573
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
What are you two doing?

574
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Xiao Yuan, why are you so fierce?

575
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Did anyone make you angry?

576
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
I'm sorry, Miss Xing Xing.

577
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

578
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
It's my fault.

579
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Please continue.

580
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Don't be angry.

581
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
It's me.

582
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
You two, please continue.

583
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
It's me.

584
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Let's take a break.

585
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
I don't want to play games anymore.

586
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,120
Mr. Yuan, what are you doing? It's so cold outside.

587
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,880
Mr. Yuan?

588
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,880
Why did Mr. Jiang call Xiao Yuan Mr. Yuan?

589
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,080
Mr. Jiang likes to be emotional.

590
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,960
Yes, Mr. Jiang likes this kind of

591
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,600
overbearing and mischievous

592
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,480
cosplay.

593
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,080
Mr. Jiang.

594
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,280
Yes.

595
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,800
I like to play this kind of role with Mr. Yuan.

596
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,240
I like to play this kind of role.

597
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,560
I'm sorry.

598
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,880
Does it hurt?

599
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,160
You don't know I have...

600
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,560
Can't you be gentle?

601
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,640
Why is your hand so cold?

602
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,880
Where is your coat? I'll get it for you.

603
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
In the closet.

604
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,960
Wait a minute.

605
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,960
They look so good together.

606
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,080
It doesn't matter. You guys continue.

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,120
I cautious

608
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,400
Give me one on each side.

609
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,880
You want to be alone?

610
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,680
You have to blame it on Xiao Yuan!

611
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,040
Let's blame your dad.

612
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,280
Mr. Jiang.

613
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,840
I can do it myself.

614
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,920
You better go check the bedroom.

615
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,880
Hurry up and go!

616
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,120
Let's eat.

617
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,480
The doctor said my wound is fine.

618
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,800
I'll start working tomorrow.

619
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,880
Let's eat.

620
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,920
This is better.

621
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,680
Try it.

622
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
I'll go first.

623
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,760
Go ahead.

624
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm sorry.

625
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,720
Well,

626
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,000
I didn't mean to

627
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
do that.

628
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,360
Don't forget to go to bed.

629
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I'm full.

630
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,120
Since you're fine,

631
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,360
I'll stay in the bedroom.

632
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,800
I'll go to bed.

633
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,400
Be careful.

634
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,200
Okay.

635
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,840
Yes.

636
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,200
It's hot!

637
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
You're here again, right?

638
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,520
I've read your report

639
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,680
about Shengshi Group.

640
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,320
It's much better than the one

641
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,520
in Wanxing.

642
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,080
Good.

643
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,520
I hope you can keep it.

644
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,160
Let's talk about Xiangding first.

645
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,440
He's the biggest one this time.

646
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,480
He has the basic situation of the company,

647
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,280
land, real estate, brand, patent...

648
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,560
Xiang.

649
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,120
Please.

650
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,680
Xiang.

651
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,160
Xiang Jun.

652
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,400
Jiang Jun.

653
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,240
Jiang Jun.

654
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,840
I'm doing the popular dance of

655
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,760
putting on a mask.

656
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,360
Putting on a mask?

657
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,160
You don't know it?

658
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,920
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

659
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,200
It's popular in the office.

660
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
It's good for your mouth.

661
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

662
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,200
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

663
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm leaving!

664
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,000
Schön-국

665
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,080
Why are you making such a big joke?

666
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,600
Nononononononono

667
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,120
What are you doing?

668
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,200
Yes, I was about to do something.

669
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,840
will you never think of leaving my place impulsively?

670
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,040
No way.

671
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,080
Only when I say so.

672
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,160
You've seen her all the time?

673
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,480
The PS4でも curve.

674
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,440
Since you have time to slap me,

675
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,040
you better finish your task properly.

676
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,040
Wouldn't this be the last chance to hear about it?

677
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,800
You guys,

678
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm interested too.

679
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,080
Okay.

680
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,600
I'll be causing you guys an earthquake.

681
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Don't worry.

682
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,680
Mr. Xiao,

683
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,720
this needs to be checked.

684
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:42,920
Okay.

685
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh my god.

686
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,600
A 뭔ess inflation.

687
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,760
We've never seen those before.

688
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,920
I must check first.

689
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,640
Okay.

690
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,560
I really don't want to do this.

691
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,160
I think the

692
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,360
Baroness is very specific.

693
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,080
Thanks.

694
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:15,640
Would you like to use Guo Guo's

695
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,200
so they can have a date face to face.

696
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,920
As for the location,

697
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,200
I personally

698
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,120
still insist on

699
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,520
going out for a date.

700
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,080
But I was denied it.

701
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,240
So we decided to leave it to Xu Li

702
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,000
to plan it.

703
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,640
The place I booked this time

704
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,920
is quite beautiful,

705
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,960
quite fresh,

706
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,360
and quite dreamy.

707
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,760
And a lot of idol dramas

708
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,960
are all in there.

709
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
This magical place

710
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,600
is the Ocean Hall.

711
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,600
When the time comes,

712
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,640
I will arrange

713
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,680
70%,

714
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,720
80%,

715
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,680
and 90% of the men and women

716
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,680
in different meeting places.

717
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,680
The premise is

718
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,760
they don't know

719
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,720
who is who.

720
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,800
We can only use this software

721
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,080
to decide whether to meet or not.

722
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,320
And the most important thing is

723
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,080
I will arrange the only

724
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,760
100% match

725
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,680
between the two of us

726
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,800
in a super

727
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
beautiful meeting place.

728
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,160
They will be our only

729
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,840
focus-on-observation partner.

730
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,000
If they go on a date,

731
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,360
they will be the first

732
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,240
to fly in the western world.

733
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,520
Sounds good.

734
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,880
Will you go there, Mr. Du?

735
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,600
Actually, that day...

736
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,520
If there's any problem,

737
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,480
you and Junjun

738
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,840
can help us

739
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,600
to figure it out, okay?

740
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,440
Okay, I will.

741
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,240
What else can I do?

742
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,360
Can you also...

743
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Excuse me.

744
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,600
Come here.

745
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'll make you a magic trick.

746
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Watch it.

747
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Wait.

748
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So ugly.

749
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
A big one.

750
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's quite similar.

751
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You think it's the same as me?

752
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I can make you a different one.

753
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I don't want it.

754
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I think it's the same as you.

755
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I don't want it.

756
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't want it.

757
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I don't want it.

758
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I don't want it.

759
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't want it.

760
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Come back.

761
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
No.

762
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Stop it.

763
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Stop it.

764
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So ugly.

765
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
What about the last one?

766
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'll make a ring.

767
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Do you know?

768
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Super magic trick.

769
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Super magic trick.

770
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Do you know?

771
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Do you know?

772
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay.

773
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Listen carefully.

774
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'll make you a different one.

775
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'll make you a different one.

776
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'll make you a different one.

777
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So ugly.

778
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Another one.

779
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I got it.

780
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Listen carefully.

781
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Three, two, one.

782
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Small one is called a rabbit.

783
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
A tout is called a Pig.

784
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Two pig's ears were born and went strong.

785
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
They're waiting to eat carrots

786
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and t Grande Prés Scott engineers.

787
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Pedicurri Minch Nan

788
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Two pig's ears were born and gone strong.

789
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
They're waiting to eat carrots

790
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and t Grande Prés Scott engineers.

791
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
They're waiting to eat carrots

792
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and t Grande Prés Scott engineers.

793
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,800
What it is

794
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,640
Gang

795
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:28,720
Li

796
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,400
Is everything okay?

797
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,440
you just say vegetables go in,

798
00:41:40,440 --> 00:42:04,680
and

799
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,240
I

800
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,040
as a part of the western world.

801
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
You must come.

802
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,760
You can make me cry, you know why.

803
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,760
Never been so brave.

804
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,560
I will run away.

805
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,040
If it's what you want,

806
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,240
what you like,

807
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
I don't mind.

808
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,480
I can close my eyes.

809
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,600
I can stay behind, waste my time.

810
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
Walk into your plan.

811
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,200
Like I never knew you were not mine.

812
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,200
Make you satisfied.

813
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,800
Wear another mask.

814
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,600
You never realize things I do for love.

815
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,200
I think I'm tired.

816
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,800
I think I'm blind.

817
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,600
I think I'm blind.

818
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,400
Don't know how to feel.

819
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,400
Don't know how to heal.

820
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,200
You walk so fast.

821
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
Can't catch your light.

822
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,400
You fly so high.

823
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,600
Leave all the things behind.

824
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:07,600
And our story leave all of nowhere to find.

825
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,600
I think I'm tired.

826
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,400
I think I'm blind.

827
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,400
Don't know how to feel.

828
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,400
Don't know how to heal.

829
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,200
You walk so fast.

830
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,000
Can't catch your light.

831
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,600
You fly so high.

832
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,600
Leave all the things behind.

833
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:47,800
And our story leave all of nowhere to find.
