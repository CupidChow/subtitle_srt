1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,840
Oh

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,360
oh

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
oh

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
oh

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
oh

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
oh

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
oh

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
oh

18
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,140
To love To heal

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,680
No no no, doctor

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,080
Let's get some medicine

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,820
But now I suddenly found

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Your wings are hard

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,700
The medicine is about to fly

24
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,660
for 30,000 left.

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,300
Thank you.

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Are you okay?

27
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,620
Boss, you're awake?

28
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,340
How could you

29
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,860
not give

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,180
enough attention to yourself?

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,300
Still call him action

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,660
since your injury has réalmed.

33
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,380
I'm okay now.

34
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,540
Su topics.

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,860
Let me take to Mr. Qiao first.

36
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,340
I have a nurse and a doctor here.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,900
You can go back first.

38
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,060
Mr. Qiao,

39
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,940
it's not convenient for you to have a daughter.

40
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,020
Let me send you back.

41
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,700
I'll take care of Boss.

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,820
Okay.

43
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,340
I'll come and see you tomorrow.

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,060
Okay.

45
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,500
Boss.

46
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,980
Where's General?

47
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,020
He wasn't here when we came.

48
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,420
Then why did Qiao Na know I had a surgery?

49
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,900
Boss.

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,220
I'll turn myself in.

51
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,740
I'm in danger.

52
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,660
Forgive me.

53
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,660
I'll give you a chance to atone for your crimes.

54
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,060
Hello?

55
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,500
General, where are you?

56
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,180
Boss had a problem at the hospital.

57
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,180
What happened?

58
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,340
I can't explain it in a few words.

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Come here now.

60
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,860
Okay, I'll be right back.

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,620
Hurry up!

62
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,820
My width is wide enough!

63
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,180
Get away from me!

64
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,980
Excuse me.

65
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,540
My width is wide enough!

66
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,300
Excuse me.

67
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,060
I'll do it for you.

68
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,900
Sir?

69
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,780
I bought yourself some medicine

70
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,660
She's very nice

71
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:11,460
You can even process her

72
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,740
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,860
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,140
You're here.

75
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,060
You're awake.

76
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,540
How do you feel now?

77
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,020
I haven't eaten anything for a day.

78
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,180
I'm hungry.

79
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,300
Go and get me an apple.

80
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,060
Cut my hesitation.

81
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,680
房間

82
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,080
房間

83
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,340
What?

84
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,540
Where?

85
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
It hurts.

86
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,060
It hurts.

87
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,940
It hurts.

88
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,020
Where?

89
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,140
Here.

90
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,660
Undercut

91
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,780
Why are you taking pictures of me?

92
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,060
That's because you lied to me.

93
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,580
You said that

94
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,700
the time I woke up,

95
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,300
you would be beside me.

96
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,540
Why aren't you there?

97
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,180
All right.

98
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,220
That's settled then.

99
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,900
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,900
I just knew

101
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,260
you could run so fast.

102
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,260
Are you worried about me?

103
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,980
I'm not like you, a cold-blooded monster.

104
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,820
I'll be worried about anyone else, okay?

105
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,820
I'll ask the nurse what you eat.

106
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,740
You're hungry.

107
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,820
Code of Meal

108
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,900
What's on the meaning of you buiding a stop for me?

109
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,820
Do you want to stay his for a few more days?

110
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,060
No, thank you.

111
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,220
If more of this site,

112
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,020
Wangcai will be so ashamed.

113
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,320
Fine.

114
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,420
Give me the car keys.

115
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,740
What are you doing?

116
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,020
I'm driving.

117
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,940
Drive.

118
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,460
What? You look down on the female driver?

119
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,740
No, I don't.

120
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,540
You...

121
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,460
Alright, Mr. Yuan.

122
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,500
Just leave it to me.

123
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,860
I promise I'll drive you home

124
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,260
safely and quickly in 20 minutes.

125
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,700
Let's go.

126
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,220
20 minutes?

127
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,380
Slow down.

128
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,940
Slow down.

129
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,020
20 minutes later

130
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,620
Jiang Jun, drive carefully.

131
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,700
Don't look at me.

132
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,940
We're driving carefully.

133
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,140
You scared me.

134
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,860
Jiang Jun, are you driving a rocket?

135
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,060
I'll bear with you.

136
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,460
20 minutes later

137
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,500
19 minutes. Perfect.

138
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,340
Are you okay?

139
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,420
I'm fine.

140
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,660
I'm fine.

141
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,420
A road killer.

142
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,140
You're indeed a well-known killer.

143
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,020
I admire you.

144
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,020
Why do you keep scolding me?

145
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,660
No.

146
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm praising you.

147
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,780
I'm praising your driving skills.

148
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,980
You're a good driver.

149
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,340
I mean it, Miss Jiang.

150
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,820
Where did you learn to drive?

151
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,420
I'll learn one tomorrow.

152
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,940
Maybe it'll improve my driving skills.

153
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,860
Alright, let's go home.

154
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,020
20 minutes later

155
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,500
I'll take it.

156
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,540
You just ran away.

157
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,620
I'm fine.

158
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,020
20 minutes later

159
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,700
Go to work.

160
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,140
I'll cook breakfast myself.

161
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,620
It's okay.

162
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
I'll send it to you.

163
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

164
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,620
Look at you.

165
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,140
What are you cutting?

166
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,580
Carrots.

167
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,100
Are these carrots?

168
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,460
Carrots look like this.

169
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,300
I'll do it.

170
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,300
I'll do it.

171
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,220
Don't move.

172
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,460
I just finished the operation.

173
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,820
Just sit still.

174
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,580
Wait for me.

175
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,460
I'll be right back.

176
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,660
I'll sit here.

177
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,620
I'll wait for your nutritious breakfast.

178
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,540
Okay.

179
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,660
I've checked the recipe.

180
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,260
They said after the operation,

181
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,300
you can only eat raw food if you drink more soup.

182
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,260
Try it.

183
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,740
Okay.

184
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,660
Which one should I eat first?

185
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,620
Try the chicken soup.

186
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,060
Okay.

187
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,900
How is it?

188
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,340
It tastes wonderful.

189
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,980
It's very imaginative.

190
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,180
Really?

191
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,780
I've been cooking for two hours.

192
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,820
Then you eat more.

193
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,380
Eat more.

194
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,420
I'll go to work now.

195
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,540
Okay.

196
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,540
Be careful on the road.

197
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
Be careful.

198
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,100
You don't know how to do these?

199
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,900
Right.

200
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,300
Well,

201
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,020
how could this soup be sweet?

202
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,420
What about fish soup?

203
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,400
Is he

204
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,980
putting all the sugar in salt?

205
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,180
Drink it all.

206
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,340
Drink it.

207
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,060
I...

208
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,260

209
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,820
How's my boss?

210
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,940
He's fine.

211
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,860
He just got discharged today.

212
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,620
He's been out of work these days.

213
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,340
I feel so relieved.

214
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,500
I'm so happy.

215
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,580
I'm so happy to hear that.

216
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,900
Hello?

217
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,460
Baby, guess where I am now.

218
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,060
In my heart.

219
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,060
I'm on my way back.

220
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,820
What?

221
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,140
Why are you back?

222
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,820
It's a holiday.

223
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,020
I just want to give you a surprise.

224
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,260
Baby,

225
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,300

Well, keep going.

244
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,700
The last time i went there,

245
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,380
my girlfriend was studying abroad.

246
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,340
I took her there before.

247
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,940
But all of a sudden she's back,

248
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,340

I'm your assistant.

251
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,260
You brat.

252
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,340
You know how to copy wrongly.

253
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,180
But you

254
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,620
just moved in without moving.

255
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,020
You didn't change at all.

256
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,660
I was wrong.

257
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,180
You brat.

258
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,620

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,060

I'll be your slave in the future.

264
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,740
I'll be your senior.

265
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,260
Please, boss.

266
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,060
OK.

267
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,460
Then you would live on the couch with me

268
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,620
until the position after we move out.

269
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,260
Why are we so important

270
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,500

271
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,460

If you don't want to live with me,

275
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,620
I'll open a hotel for you.

276
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,540
No need for me to live with you.

277
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,540
No.

278
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,980
You can

279
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,820
bring your girlfriend

280
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,980
to my place.

281
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,860
I'll help you.

282
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,540
Boss,

00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,700
where do you live?

284
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,660
I have a house in Shanghai.

285
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,060
You want to move to the next room?

286
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,460
Boss,

287
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,780
it's a rare opportunity.

288
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,500
You have to seize this opportunity.

289
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,820
You can't live in a place

290
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,900
where women can't.

291
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,260
I haven't changed my mind yet.

292
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,620
I'll do whatever I want.

293
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,620
Okay, boss.

296
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,740

Don't touch it.

299
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,100
Don't touch it.

300
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,540
You're a gentleman.

301
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,740

the view here

311
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,140
is scrumptious.

312
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,100
I enjoy it.

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,960

Is it 701?

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,540
Yes, it is.

325
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,620
But how can the door be opened?

326
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,140
The door...

327
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,260

Hello, Mr. Su.

333
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,020
I've packed your things.

334
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,540
How are you going to deal with these?

335
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,860
Throw it away.

336
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,700
Throw it away.

337
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,420
Throw it away.

00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,180
the latest one of their autumn winter?

343
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,740
And it's still in good condition.

344
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,380
Why did you throw it away?

345
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,260
It's okay.

346
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,620

Don't be so thick.

349
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,820
You used to be so thin.

350
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,980
Baby.

351
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,460
Since I was with you,

352
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,940
my life has been more secretive.

353
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,340
People are different.

354
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620

355
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500

You're so fat.

00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,140
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

362
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,300
I'm helping Mr. Su

363
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,580
to pack his things.

364
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,740
Mr. Su.

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,700
Mr. Jiang.

370
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,420
Mr. Jiang.

371
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,420
Hello, I'm Xin Xin.

372
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,020
Yuan.

373
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,340
Since you've finished packing Mr. Su's things,

374
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,900
please clean my room later.

375
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,780
Okay, Mr. Jiang. No problem.

Yuan.

382
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,220
It seems that you've recovered well.

383
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,900
You have the strength to move.

384
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,660
It's a coincidence.

385
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,980
It's a coincidence.

386
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,420
Baby.

387
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,220
You've decorated the house so well.

388
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,660
It's a taste.

389
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,700
Baby, you're so tasteful.

390
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,580
Baby.

391
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,940
Because I want to give you the best.

392
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,580
You're so nice to me.

393
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,860
Well, I want to go to the bathroom.

394
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,980
Okay, wait a minute.

395
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,900
What are you talking about?

396
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,540
You...

397
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,860
You're going to live in my house?

398
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,900
We...

399
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,940
We're alone and single.

400
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,580
Living together...

401
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,100
What does it mean?

402
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,060
Stop.

403
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,300
What do you mean by that?

404
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,500
I don't understand.

405
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,500
Why are we

406
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,980
alone and single?

407
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,500
Why are we not called alone and single?

408
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,700
Why are we single?

409
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,020
Why are we single?

410
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,140
Why are we single?

411
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,140
Why are we single?

412
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,340
Why are we single?

413
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Why are we single?

414
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,740
Why are we not called single?

415
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,660
She...

416
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,460
is also a woman.

417
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,660
Okay, she stays.

418
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,620
You go away.

419
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,860
General.

420
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,660
Well...

421
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,900
You're really a man of moral integrity.

422
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,020
I mean,

423
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,540
Su Chang

424
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,220
has worked for me for so many years.

425
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,740
When he asked me to do something,

426
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,020
I didn't even blink

427
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,260
and just lent him the house.

428
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,420
What is this?

429
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,300
This is called a revenge.

430
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,580
Unlike someone,

431
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,180
when it's about Ke Lang's case,

432
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,940
if I didn't bring Lin He to the scene in time,

433
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
if Wan Shan's case

434
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,740
wasn't me

435
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,980
who got the data in the phone repaired in time,

436
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,620
who was it?

437
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,700
If it wasn't me

438
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,820
who rushed Ma Xiu Ran's wine,

439
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,900
Enough.

440
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,100
You're so annoying.

441
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,140
This house is for you.

442
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,260
I'll live in Li Li's house.

443
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,100
Okay?

444
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,460
My wound hurts.

445
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,860
My wound hurts.

446
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,340
It's so cold.

447
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,820
I'm a sick person.

448
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,820
If I want to go to the toilet at night,

449
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,100
or the toilet,

450
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,100
my wound will surely

451
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,420
bleed to death.

452
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,260
Blood will flow into the river.

453
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,220
Blood will be blurred.

454
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,500
Blood...

455
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,740
Blood...

456
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,580
Blood will be dried.

457
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,500
Stop pretending.

458
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,820
You're so good at acting.

459
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,940
Are you going to stay here

460
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,420
and not leave today?

461
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,100
Isn't it obvious?

462
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,300
What did you say?

463
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,900
I said,

464
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,780
how can this be called LINE?

465
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,780
This is my house.

466
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,740
I call it

467
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,020
reasonable accommodation.

468
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,300
Do you understand?

469
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,780
Reasonable accommodation.

470
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,140
Where are you going?

471
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,780
I want to be quiet.

472
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,740
Who is quiet?

473
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,820
Your sister.

474
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,420
I'm not quiet.

475
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,580
I only have a sister called Jun Jun.

476
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,380
Don't buy bananas anymore.

477
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,300
I don't like bananas.

478
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,020
I like apples.

479
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,780
Buy more apples.

480
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,740
Be gentle.

481
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,180
This is my house.

482
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,780
It doesn't matter.

483
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,980
Kick it.

484
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,460
I'll live here if you kick it.

485
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,940
It's delicious.

486
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,140
I'll eat it.

487
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,100
Sleeping in the office downstairs

488
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,620
is perfect.

489
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,260
What are you opening?

490
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,620
I'm opening a business gift.

491
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,700
We've all turned to the office.

492
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,460
Of course we need to feel a sense of ceremony.

493
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,780
This is for Mr. Du.

494
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,540
It can show his high-end spirit.

495
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,820
This is for you.

496
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,260
That one is better.

497
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,020
Can I take this one?

498
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,580
No need.

499
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,460
I'm doing this for your own good.

500
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,260
Think about it.

501
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
This is an app about love.

502
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,620
If the client comes to work with you,

503
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,060
and finds out that you are

504
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,100
in love with someone,

505
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
they'll think you are

506
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,180
a person with a lot of love.

507
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,700
They'll believe in your app more.

508
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,540
Right?

509
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,020
Okay.

510
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,140
Here you are.

511
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,940
This is for one-on-one.

512
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,260
It's a waste if you don't buy it.

513
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,180
Right?

514
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,860
Thank you.

515
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,700
You're welcome.

516
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,820
Thank you.

517
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,860
What's that?

518
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,380
This is the first business list

519
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,620
I've prepared for the company.

520
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,380
I've already checked it.

521
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,300
We'll move to another house tomorrow.

522
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,260
We'll invite Mr. Jun and Mr. Du

523
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,100
and celebrate with him.

524
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,820
Celebrate our Western-style world.

525
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,700
Western-style world.

526
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,180
What's wrong?

527
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,380
I need a mirror.

528
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,940
I want to read your Confucian-style text.

529
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,060
Master Li now has one more computer.

530
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,460
I'd like to suffer for one more day.

531
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,880
You can just

532
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,020
buy it from winning a lottery.

533
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,220
Okay.

534
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,620
Welcome.

535
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,780
20 mutton skewers.

536
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,460
20 beef,

537
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,540
10 pork belly,

538
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,860
10 crispy stable,

539
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,180
Order whatever you want

540
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,620
Thank you

541
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:23,900
Enjoy your meal

542
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,420
Thank you

543
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Do we really eat so much?

544
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,300
I don't know

545
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,660
But I want to order

546
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,140
Actually, I want to order more

547
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,180
Don't don't don't

548
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,980
I found that

549
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,180
the way to express happiness

550
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,300
is quite strange

551
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,260
Your beer is here

552
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,580
Thank you

553
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,780
Xu Li

554
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,300
I have something to tell you

555
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,380
Actually, I have been thinking for a long time

556
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,860
If you hadn't been by my side

557
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,380
and helped me

558
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,500
and comforted me

559
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,260
I wouldn't have been

560
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,620
invested by Mr. Du

561
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,780
in the first place

562
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,740
So

563
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,780
I decided

564
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,940
Oh my god

565
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,620
This stupid head

566
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,100
is finally going to start

567
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,020
Is he going to confess to me?

568
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,740
What did you decide?

569
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,100
Tell me

570
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,620
I decided

571
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,740
to give you

572
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,700
5% of the Western world's equity

573
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,940
Just take it as a technical investment

574
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,420
From today on

575
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,940
you are my best brother

576
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,500
Li Xiaochun

577
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,180
Don't go

578
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,700
Never mind

579
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,540
I'm not the only one

580
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,340
Own your utilize

581
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,480
But unapp

582
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,900
Come on, bro

583
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,620
Forget it.

584
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,300
I don't care about the shares.

585
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
You can keep them.

586
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,500
Okay.

587
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,660
But

588
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,580
the growth rate of the Western world

589
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,140
is 5% of the shares.

590
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,460
It will soon become 500,000 yuan.

591
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
But if it develops well,

592
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,620
it may become 5 million yuan.

593
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,220
Forget it. It's okay.

594
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,380
How much?

595
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,740
5 million yuan.

596
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,620
I...

597
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
I can accept your offer

598
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,060
if you take back what I just said.

599
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,620
Okay.

600
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,420
Cheers.

601
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,420
To the Western world.

602
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,660
To the Western world.

603
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,260
Let's eat. I'm starving.

604
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,140
Let's eat.

605
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,300
Hurry up. Come on.

606
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,420
Come on.

607
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,180
Let's eat.

608
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,300
Did you eat?

609
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,220
Um...

610
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,100
One.

611
00:30:50,580 --> 00:31:12,580
The finals

612
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
the most honest.

613
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,140
Try it.

614
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,500
How is it?

615
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,980
It's so delicious.

616
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,780
How did you make it?

617
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,980
How?

618
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,100
This is my secret recipe.

619
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,780
You've lived with me for a long time.

620
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,060
You'll know it.

621
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,660
Have some soup.

622
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,740
I want to discuss something with you.

623
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,100
It's your

624
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,700
bedroom's

625
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,620
future use.

626
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,620
What do you mean, Yuan Shuai?

627
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
Don't you want to

628
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,340
play the

629
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,300
middle line

630
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,820
and I sleep on the left

631
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,420
and you sleep on the right

632
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,340
to make up a story?

633
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,580
Will I be so boring?

634
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,220
I mean

635
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,340
I sleep in the bedroom

636
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,820
and you sleep on the sofa.

637
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,700
Yuan Shuai.

638
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,900
Don't be so stubborn.

639
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,100
I asked you to live in my house

640
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,180
and you want to live in my bedroom?

641
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,660
We're living in the same bedroom!

642
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,980
What does it mean saying that?

643
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,420
So

644
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
you agree that I live in your house.

645
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,620
I've heard about it.

646
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
You're lying to me.

647
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,180
I'm asking you ah!

648
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,660
You are so stupid!

649
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,740
It's dinner!

650
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,460
Let's eat a steak.

651
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,380
Do you want a bone..?

652
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,380
Ginger.

653
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,740
Mine.

654
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,980
Mine.

655
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:46,980
Mine.

656
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,820
Mine.

657
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,220
Mine.

658
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,260
Mine.

659
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,540
Mine.

660
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,100
All of them are mine.

661
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,660
Mine.

662
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,140
You can't eat them.

663
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,540
All of them.

664
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,060
You can't eat them.

665
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,780
All of them are mine.

666
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,900
Mine.

667
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,340
What's wrong?

668
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,460
What's wrong with your wound?

669
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,260
Sit down.

670
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:03,940
How are you?

671
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,180
Are you okay?

672
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,260
Are you caring about me?

673
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,100
If anything happens to you

674
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,700
in my house,

675
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,940
I'll be responsible for it.

676
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,220
You know what?

677
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,340
I'll wash these later.

678
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,180
You can have a rest.

679
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,060
I'll treat this place

680
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,140
as my home.

681
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,940
You're welcome.

682
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,260
Have a piece of pork chop.

683
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,740
It's delicious.

684
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,820
If it's delicious, you can have more.

685
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,020
You can't eat it.

686
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,460
It's delicious.

687
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,420
Delicious.

688
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,940
I'm full.

689
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,300
No.

690
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,220
You haven't had the soup

691
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,980
I made for you.

692
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,620
No.

693
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,860
Drink it.

694
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,020
Please.

695
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,260
It's so delicious.

696
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,580
What's wrong?

697
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,580
I like it.

698
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,940
It's delicious.

699
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,540
It's a match made in heaven.

700
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,980
I can drink it like this.

701
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,580
How can I help you?

702
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,580
What?

703
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,780
Forget it.

704
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,740
Yan An.

705
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,540
I've thought about it.

706
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,820
We shouldn't let a patient

707
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,540
sleep on the sofa

708
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,580
and sleep in the room.

709
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,900
You don't have a fever.

710
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,420
Why are you suddenly so good?

711
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,780
You even let me sleep on the bed.

712
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,900
I haven't regretted it yet.

713
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,860
You'd better...

714
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,900
Damn it.

715
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,260
Could it be that

716
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,060
you've put something on the bed?

717
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,900
Go away.

718
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,980
I'll go. I'll go.

719
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,700
The door to the left.

720
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm a woman.

721
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,460
I'm obviously...

722
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,380
Fine.

723
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,380
I won't be mad at you.

724
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
You're a patient.

725
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,460
You'll get ugly if you get mad.

726
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,260
You'll get old if you get mad.

727
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,140
I won't be mad.

728
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,660
I won't be mad.

729
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,700
Go away.

730
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,060
You're too mad.

731
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,780
Madam.

732
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,020
Madam.

733
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,860
Hello Madam.

734
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,100
I'm helping Madam,

735
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,100

736
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,220
I've tried to call you

737
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,620
It's for UK

738
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,500
Oh my god

00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,820

Let me help you

743
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,700

745
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,420
Sister is together again

746
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,380
Littleião

747
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
Blame my mistake.

748
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,380
Plessure

749
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,500
Choyu

750
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,380
You are so stupid

751
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,340
No one can help you

752
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,500
Yes, yes.

753
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,460
as they were together.

754
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:18,700
nemver

755
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,660
I'm just Aber killers.

756
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,900
I swear to senior.

757
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,580
I'll kill him.

758
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
a taste of happiness is enough

759
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,580
Go to sleep.

760
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Good night.

761
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,380
How many passers-by

762
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,380
Prove your uniqueness

763
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,380
Love can be made into a flower

764
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,380
Wait a minute, what am I happy about?

765
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,380
I want you to be with me

766
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,380
So crazy

767
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,380
Crazy

768
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,380
Only my heart

769
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,380
You're my miracle

770
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,380
You're my miss everything

771
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,380
My promise

772
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,380
Wait a moment to say good

773
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,380
Never knew you were not mine

774
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,380
Make you satisfied

775
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,380
Wear another mask

776
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,380
You never realize things I do for love

777
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,380
I think I'm tired

778
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,380
I think I'm blind

779
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,380
Don't know how to feel

780
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,380
Don't know how to heal

781
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,380
You walk so fast

782
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,380
Can't catch your light

783
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,380
You fly so high

784
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,380
Leave all the things behind

785
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,380
And our story

786
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:07,380
Leave all of nowhere to find

787
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,380
I think I'm tired

788
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I think I'm blind

789
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Don't know how to feel

790
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:22,380
Don't know how to heal

791
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,380
You walk so fast

792
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,380
Can't catch your light

793
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,380
You fly so high

794
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,380
Leave all the things behind

795
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,380
And our story

796
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Leave all of nowhere to find
