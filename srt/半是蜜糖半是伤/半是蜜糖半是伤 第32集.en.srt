Episode 32

5
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,500
Come in.

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,039
Mr. Du,

7
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,400
Baxi's M&A loan was approved.

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,479
Director Liu agreed?

9
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,640
Yuan Shuai and Director Liu were acquaintances,

10
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,759
so I asked him for a favor.

11
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,320
Later, they got very cooperative.

12
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,479
After we resubmitted the materials

13
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,520
in accordance with their requirements,

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
it was soon approved.

15
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,970
Don't you like the watch I gave you?

16
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,720
This is...

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,560
Jiang Jun,

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,280
please be professional in the future.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
Yuan Shuai works for GE now, after all.

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,480
I think you know better than anyone

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,760
about the relationship between the two of you.

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
You need to avert suspicion.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,920
This is MH’s project.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
How can you just let someone

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,770
from a rival company get in the way?

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,900
It’s not like that.

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,560
We just had a meal

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,600
with Director Liu together.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,260
But this is not the first time.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,000
Last time in the Fengchao case,
they robbed us of our achievements.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
You think nobody in this company gossiped?

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
People who don't know

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,920
will think that we are inferior.

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,440
Do you still want to stay in the company

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,970
if someone with an ulterior motive finds out?

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,490
It’s not that I haven’t taught you that

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,300
gossiping is a fearful thing.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,880
This time I was thoughtless.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,080
I'll be careful in the future.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Make sure it won't happen again.

41
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
When you get back,

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,800
go over the merger data yourself

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
and give me a detailed report on Wednesday.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,520
Ok.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,380
One more thing.

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,410
Please come to me

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,570
if you have any problems in the future.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,460
After all, your current boss,

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,600
is me, not him.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,200
I see.

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,940
Have you heard that

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
Ms. Jiang was scolded?

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Yes.

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,250
It's rare to see Mr. Du get so angry.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
I heard that the Secretary Department

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720
did not dare to send documents in the afternoon,

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,650
for fearing of being scolded, too.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
I heard that

59
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Ms. Jiang had a meal with the client

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
and Mr. Yuan.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,520
I don’t think it's a big deal.

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,280
Why did he…

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,120
I’m telling you, out of kindness,

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,880
that Mr. Du is in a bad mood today.

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,040
You'd better stop gossiping here.

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Be careful about getting fired.

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
That makes sense.

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Honey,

69
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,829
I’ll wait for you to get off work tonight.

70
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,440
Ok.

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,200
Single guy!

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,580
Come in.

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,380
Everybody's left. Why didn't you go?

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,010
I have a few things to do. Go back first.

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
All right. Then I'm gonna go. Go home early.

76
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,960
Bye.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,440
Bye.

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,280
Tired?

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,730
Why are you so late from work today?

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Don't mention it.

81
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
Mr. Du was furious

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,920
when he found out you were helping me out
with Director Liu.

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,450
He gave me a piece of his mind

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,480
and ordered me to go over

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
all the materials for the merger

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
and write a report to him.

87
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,210
I'm not leaving early for the rest of the week.

88
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,640
What did he say?

89
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,100
He said I didn't know how to avert suspicion.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
But he's right.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,520
I was too eager for quick success,
and did not separate business from private life.

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,360
It's my fault.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,090
What's the matter with you?

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm fine. I just have a stomachache.

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Jiang Jun, you haven’t eaten again?

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,520
I had coffee.

97
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,640
Let's go. I'll take you to dinner first.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,760
You are too busy to eat.

99
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,120
Why don't you quit?

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,440
Stop working.

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,370
I'll provide for you in the future.

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,280
I have such a big appetite,

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,920
and you are not afraid that
I will empty all your property?

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,960
You're kidding.

105
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,760
When you are free, check my balance.

106
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
You will find that

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
it is only a ridiculous fantasy

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,330
to try to empty my property.

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Yuan Shuai.

110
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
I know

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,370
you are devoted to your job.

112
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,800
In fact, I will always support you.

113
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
I just don't want to see you work so hard.

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,090
With you by my side, I don't feel it’s hard.

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,760
I'll take a nap. Wake me up when we are there.

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,700
Shengxin's case goes according to the plan.

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,080
Shen Xin, send a copy of the schedule
to my mailbox.

118
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,480
Ok.

119
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,840
Chen Yicheng,

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,960
send me the evaluation report of Rongda
before getting off work.

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,720
Thanks.

122
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,360
Ok.

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,890
If there is nothing else, the meeting is over.

124
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,400
Why do you look so pale?

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Are you all right?

126
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,280
Have you offended Mr. Du recently?

127
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,920
How can he assign you so many projects?

128
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't think you can finish your work
even if you live in the company.

129
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,320
No, it's all normal work arrangements.

130
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,520
It’s so late.

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,640
How about getting something to eat together?

132
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Go ahead. I'm not hungry.

133
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,570
I have work to do.

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,970
All right. Then I'll get going.

135
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,630
Jiang Jun!

136
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,909

[Emergency Room, Inpatient Building]

139
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,280
Doctor,

140
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,560
how is she?

141
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,680
Don't worry.

142
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
According to the preliminary diagnosis,

143
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,480
it was syncope due to the acute gastroenteritis.

144
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,320
It should be caused by long-term overwork

145
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,450
and irregular diet.

146
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
Stay in the hospital
for a few days and she’ll be fine.

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,280
Thank you, doctor.

148
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,210
You're welcome.

149
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,100
Are you satisfied now?

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
Unreasonable projects,

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,570
crazy overtime,

152
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,980
and ineffective and frequent meetings.

153
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,880
Du Lei,

154
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,920
are you doing this because you're jealous?

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,290
Why are you so childish?

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,280
I know

157
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,490
she's sick and you're worried.

158
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
However, your groundless speculation

159
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,690
will only make people think that you are the one
who is naive.

160
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,520
Sorry, Mr. Du,

161
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,170
but now is the time off work.

162
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,320
There is no reason for you to stay here.

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm her boyfriend.

164
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
I'll just stay and take care of her.

165
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm her boss.

166
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,720
It's my job

167
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,810
to worry about a sick subordinate.

Jiang Jun,

169
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,840
how are you?

170
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm thirsty.

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,560
Here.

172
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040
Drink slowly.

173
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,280
How do you feel? Are you feeling better?

174
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
Mr. Du, I'm sorry.

175
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
I couldn't finish today's work.

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,400
You mustn't say that.

177
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,120
You're enslaved to syncope by the capitalists.

178
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,480
They have to send you
to the hospital immediately.

179
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,400
Or whom will they enslave in the future?

180
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,330
It's not your fault.

181
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,840
I've been putting too much pressure
on you lately.

182
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,840
Have a good rest.

183
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,520
I'll take care of the business of the company
right now.

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,560
Come back

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,250
when you are well again.

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Look.

187
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
You didn't have a good rest

188
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,940
and worked until you fainted.

189
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,040
Your health is the most important of all things.

190
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,000
Do you know?

191
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,400
I was too busy to notice the time

192
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,440
and forgot to eat.

193
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
Here, have some more.

194
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,480
Rest more

195
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,440
and eat regularly in the future.

196
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,410
Watch your step.

197
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,920
I am fine.

198
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,880
It's the same as the hypoglycemia.

199
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
It’s not like I lost my arms or legs.

200
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Don't treat me like I'm the old or the disabled.

201
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,810
What did you say?

202
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,240
Hypoglycemia?

203
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
Ma’am,

204
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,960
you know,

205
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,920
the severe gastroenteritis can result

206
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,450
in shock from dehydration,

207
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,680
and environmental disorders,

208
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,120
or death.

209
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,080
I always tell you to eat on time
and take breaks on time,

210
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,410
but you ignore them all.

211
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,320
You have at least three cups of coffee a day.

212
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Do you think you're made of iron?

213
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,960
If I hadn't been with you,

214
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,010
you would have fallen ill long ago.

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,080
This

216
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,380
[One-week recuperation diet]

217
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,920
is your menu for the next week.

218
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,330
Take a good look.

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,120
You can ask me if you have any questions.

220
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,080
Yuan Shuai,

221
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,120
did you

222
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,000
copy the diet for pigs?

223
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
If I eat like this for a week, I'll get so fat!

224
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,450
Your protest is denied.

225
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,120
And then,

226
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,840
I'm going to prepare your
fifth meal of the day,

227
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,360
kiwi with bean and longan sauce porridge.

228
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,780
Wait for me.

229
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,960
Bean and longan sauce...

230
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
What are you going to do with the computer?

231
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,760
Work?

232
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,370
No. I'm going to watch a TV play.

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,860
Watch a TV show?

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
Then why do you put the iPad aside

235
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,620
and use the computer instead?

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
I have a case to deal with.

237
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
I'll just have a look.

238
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,160
No.

239
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,880
Jiang Jun,

240
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,520
you are a patient now.

241
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Any work will interfere with your rest.

242
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,980
Do you understand?

243
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,000
Besides,

244
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,800
since you made a mistake,

245
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,160
you should be punished.

246
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
What punishment?

247
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,920
A pain in the ass.

248
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Sleep tight. I'm here for you.

249
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,080
Here.

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,740
Good night.

251
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,080
Good night.

252
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,340
Where do you want to go?

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,660
Look at you.

254
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,440
I know

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
you haven't taken your annual leave yet.

256
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,520
So,

257
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,680
I asked Mr. Du

258
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,320
for a seven-day holiday.

259
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,480
In the next few days,

260
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
behave yourself,

261
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,720
stay at home,

262
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,280
and get a good rest.

263
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,680
I know you care about me,

264
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,440
but it's not so good to ask for leave for me.

265
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,560
Yuan Shuai.

266
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,080
What's the matter with you?

267
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
Why didn't you tell us you were sick?

268
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,480
Mr. Yuan, you can go to work.

269
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,140
We're here to take care of her.

270
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,480
Xiaochuan and I went to buy the things
to be stewed early in the morning.

271
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,240
There are chicken and things like that.

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
I'll stew them for you later.

273
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,520
It's reassuring to have someone
taking care of you.

274
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,200
Honey, I'm going to work.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,640
Bye-bye.

276
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,720
Bye-bye.

277
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Watch her closely.

278
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,960
Watch her closely.

279
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,320
Don’t you want something to eat?

280
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,120
No.

281
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
How are you feeling now?

282
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,760
Is there anything else wrong?

283
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm fine. I was already fine!

284
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Yuan Shuai insisted that I rest for a week.

285
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,940
He did the right thing.

286
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,000
Look!

287
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,760
See what I got you.

288
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,360
Your skin is so dry.

289
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,920
You haven't put on a face mask for days,
have you?

290
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,720
Take this small reservoir
and apply the mask well.

291
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,600
You are the best to me.

292
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,580
I have something else.

293
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,520
What is it?

294
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,210
Put it away! Put it away!

295
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,280
Why?

296
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
I’m bringing in good luck.

297
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Let's have one for each of us.

298
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,240
Maybe we all get pregnant.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
Put it away!

300
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,890
Jiang Jun, have some watermelons.

301
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,000
Thanks.

302
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,570
What are you talking about?

303
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
Woman's secrets. You don't need to know.

304
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,100
What's the secret? I want to hear.

305
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,829
The watermelon is too cold

306
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,880
for you to eat.

307
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,950
I'll get you something else.

308
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,440
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

309
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,770
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

310
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,060
-Good morning, Ms. Qiao.
-Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

311
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,040
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

312
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,829
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

313
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,109
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

314
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,440
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

315
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,160
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

316
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,900
[My love for you will never stop.
Jia Yuanji]

317
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,600
Little kid!

318
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,480
Hello.

319
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,320
Please ask the staff

320
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
to clean up my office.

321
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,840
Clean…

322
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Qiao,

323
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,520
if you accept my love,

324
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,560
I can promise

325
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
to surprise you every day.

326
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,240
Kid,

327
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,120
your behavior

328
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,880
are too naive.

329
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,690
You want to chase me?

330
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,920
Save it!

331
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,720
Three minutes! Clean it up.

332
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Qiao!

333
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,130
Qiao! I've been preparing this all night.

334
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,960
I'm telling you,

335
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
I have a friend

336
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,420
who got pregnant during the safe period.

337
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,320
You’re awake?

338
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,570
Why did you wake up so early?

339
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,740
Didn't sleep well?

340
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,020
What's the matter?

341
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,560
Yuan Shuai.

342

it would be impolite for me to reject it.

She’s fine.

380

It’s just that she should pay more attention
to her diet in the future.

How's it going over there?

I'm sad.

She said she did not have any interest in me.

Do you have any tips?

She needs to be surprised.

You have to figure it out by yourself.

you are the one I want to spend

you can still work in the Investment Banking Department.

But all things being considered,

443
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,580
I think GE's Fixed Income Department

444
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
suits you better.

445
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,560

continue to do the work you love

I have something to do here.

513
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,160
Put it down.

514
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,020
Put it down.

515
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,080
Why?

516
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,880
You'll only reduce your efficiency
if you don't eat.

517
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,320
Come on.

518
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,280
Leave me alone.

519
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,760
It's very important.

520
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,320
Honey,

521
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,160
let’s

522
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,320
eat it properly.

523
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,840
If you do two things at once,

524
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,880
it will only interfere with your digestion.
Right?

525
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Honey, have a bite.

526
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Just a bite, ok?

527
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,360
If the source of the quotation leak isn’t found,

528
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,620
and there is no result,

529
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,720
I am afraid that the company
will hold me accountable.

530
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,400
That doesn't mean you should work so hard.

531
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
I think Mr. Du has done a...

532
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,000
Just leave me alone.

533
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,200
Let me focus on my work.

534
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,080
You eat first.

535
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,680
What do you think that is?

536
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
Let's take a look.

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,200
Be quick.

538
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,560
Be quick!

539
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,240
Hello,

540
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,760
what is this, please?

541
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,760
This is a wet paper towel heater.

542
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,800
Newborns

543
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,040
often need wet paper towels to
wipe their bottoms.

544
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,370
It's cold in the winter.

545
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,440
If you use this to heat the wet paper towel

546
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,800
and then wipe your baby's bottom,

547
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,280
he won't feel so cold.

548
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,160
Honey, this is interesting.

549
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
What do you think?

550
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,850
Did you know that wet paper towels are toxic
when heated?

551
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,760
Don't say that in front of the shop assistant
next time.

552
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,480
That's not good.

553
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,400
Really, it is toxic.

554
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,640
Then keep your voice down.

555
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,400
I've seen data on the Internet before

556
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,520
that a lot of kids are…

557
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,180
Honey! Honey, check this out!

558
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,000
See? Building blocks.

559
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,200
We can buy them for the baby to play with.

560
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,000
What do you think?

561
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,240
No! How ugly it is.

562
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,960
Children wouldn’t put away these things either.

563
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,560
If

564
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,000
he drops the block

565
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
and steps on it like this,

566
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,929
that would be fun then.

567
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,150
Li Xiaochuan, maybe you shouldn't
start your own business.

is to talk back.

I didn't expect that

580
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,230
Mr. Li would like

581
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,480
this kind of girl.

582
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,820
Is there a problem?

583
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,230
Not really.

584
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,280
I just didn't expect

585
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,360
Mrs. Li to be so pure and lovely.

586
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,670
I’d think she is a high school student
if you did not tell me this.

587
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,040
I'm sorry.
