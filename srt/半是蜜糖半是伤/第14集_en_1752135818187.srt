1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
Is this your home?

2
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,120
Time flows

3
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,800
Time flows

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,120
They are all the same

5
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,500
What's going on?

6
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,300
You

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,060
Damn you

8
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,240
Let me burn last year

9
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
right on version 2

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,500
But I didn't get famous

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,560
You was in my team

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,340
I am notJimmy

13
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,260
And I am also a celebrity

14
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,100
Right

15
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,920
So

16
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,120
I know. I just didn't expect you to have an affair with that big guy again.

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,520
Who's the bad guy? Who made me fall for him?

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,720
He's a big bad guy.

19
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
That's not going to take long.

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Be quiet. I don't know how to talk bad about people.

21
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,320
He's my previous landlord.

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,760
I told you.

23
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,960
There's no room for him in this world.

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
Do you have to live in his house?

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,120
It's you.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm not your friend.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
You're not my friend.

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,320
You're not my friend.

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,520
You're my friend.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
You're my friend.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
I'm not your friend.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm not your friend.

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,520
I'm not your friend.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,720
You're not my friend.

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
It's you.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
They're pointing at you.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,920
It's you.

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
Why are you pointing at me?

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
How do I know?

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Why should I point at you?

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
You're pointing at me because I'm Junjie.

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Besides, I don't live with anyone.

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,920
You should know that we're all friends.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
You should have a sense of sense.

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
Sense of sense.

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
I know. I know.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,320
I'm wrong. Okay?

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,720
So why did you ask me to come here today?

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
Yeah.

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
It's all your fault.

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I forgot to give you a chance to sing rap with you.

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,920
I'll try my best.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,920
This is a woman.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,920
This is the dating app I created.

55
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,720
Western World.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,720
Dating app?

57
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Are you sure?

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
Take a good look.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,920
This is a new product of the painting era.

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
No.

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Now dating apps are all over the street.

62
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,120
What's so special about you?

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,720
That's different.

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Our Western World doesn't need basic information.

65
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,920
It doesn't need photos.

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,120
But registered users need to pass a series of tests.

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,920
Personality test, intelligence test, and EQ test.

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
My big data system will analyze the data

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,520
in detail according to the answers provided by the users.

70
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,120
It will provide a total score.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,120
In the end, only the 100% accurate and suitable object

72
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,920
will be a match.

73
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,320
You mean,

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,920
all aspects are done in a match?

75
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
You're definitely a genius.

76
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Definitely a genius.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
My app, in addition to accurate match,

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,720
gives Xiangqing a sense of will and challenge.

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,520
There's one more important thing.

80
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
What?

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,520
It has an EQ test match system.

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
EQ test?

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,520
The 8 characters are superstitions.

84
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,120
The eyes are vulgar.

85
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,720
The EQ is the real match.

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
How do you do the EQ test?

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
We gather online.

88
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
We build a large data simulation database.

89
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,920
I collected a large amount of married couple's marriage data.

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,720
From a biological science perspective,

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
I summarized these rules.

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,520
I put these rules in my app

93
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,320
so that every user can find the most accurate match.

94
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
I think this project sounds interesting.

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,320
It's not just interesting.

96
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm telling you,

97
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
there are three stages of human blind dating.

98
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,720
We build a society by looking at the 8 characters.

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
And nowadays,

100
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,720
we live in a free love era.

101
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,920
What does that mean?

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,120
We work hard to look at the face and feel.

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,920
But in the future,

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,520
we will enter a more competitive,

105
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
more scientific,

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
marriage-related blind dating.

107
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
The product of this human blind dating fashion era

108
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,720
will be led by Mr. Li Xiaochuan.

109
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
What is the ultimate goal of your project?

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,720
The ultimate goal is

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
a perfect match for marriage.

112
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
I heard you're starting the internal test.

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes.

114
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
But the next development

115
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,720
may require a lot of funds.

116
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
So,

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,720
I want to find an investor.

118
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Zhenzhen,

119
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,720
aren't you the head of M&H?

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Can you invest?

121
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,320
It's not an investment company.

122
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Can you understand what your sister is doing?

123
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Zhenzhen,

124
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
I really think this project is good.

125
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,920
What do you think?

126
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
What do you think?

127
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,920
How about this?

128
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Follow me to a place.

129
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Beauty,

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,920
can I have a glass of wine?

131
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Sorry, my boyfriend is here.

132
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Sorry, my boyfriend is here.

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
We've been waiting for three hours.

134
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
What are we waiting for?

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,920
What do we need to do?

136
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Xu Li,

137
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I brought you here on purpose.

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
The purpose is to give you a chance to be matched.

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
You're boring.

140
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Xiaochuan,

141
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
how long have we been here?

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
About half an hour.

143
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
In these half hours,

144
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,920
how many times have you been matched?

145
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,920
I didn't notice that.

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
In this bar,

147
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,920
there are 12 girls without a boyfriend.

148
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
There are 20 boys without a girlfriend.

149
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,920
The number of times a girl is matched

150
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,920
can be seen as her social expectation in the opposite sex.

151
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
As the founder of a dating website,

152
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,920
you don't care about these details.

153
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
No,

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
social expectation can't be calculated.

155
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Do you want to turn beauty,

156
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
body,

157
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,920
and makeup into parameters to make a guess?

158
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Let's put it this way.

159
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Among the girls without a boyfriend,

160
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Miss Jiang,

161
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,920
your social expectation is the seventh.

162
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
How can I be so low?

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
You don't believe me?

164
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Okay,

165
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
but let me ask you.

166
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,920
How many times have you been matched in these half hours?

167
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Once.

168
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
You saw it.

169
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
And the guy who matched you is a jerk.

170
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
How do you know?

171
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
You're just guessing.

172
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Can you see it?

173
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,920
The guy who matched you is the guy with the highest position in your three o'clock.

174
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Look at his jacket and watch.

175
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Although they are all famous brands,

176
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
they are not suitable for the world.

177
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Look at his hands.

178
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
He took off the wedding ring.

179
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
But the ring is still there.

180
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
No doubt,

181
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
he is a jerk.

182
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Oh my god.

183
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,920
What's on your mind?

184
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Xiaochun,

185
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
to be a good dating website,

186
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
you need to be good at social studies,

187
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
social studies, and psychology.

188
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
You also need to have a certain amount of time

189
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,920
to have love experience and social experience.

190
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
What about you?

191
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
You are a closed-door man.

192
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
You have never even had a serious relationship.

193
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
How can you be a good dating website?

194
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Brother,

195
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
this is a bar.

196
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,920
These are not the popular groups in the western world.

197
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
People who come here

198
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
will not want to have a fixed partner.

199
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
You are a friend online.

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
People who come to the bar

201
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
may also be looking for true love.

202
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Isn't it?

203
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Xiaochun,

204
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I understand your desire to start a business.

205
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
But you chose a dating website

206
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
as your starting point.

207
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
This is not for you.

208
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Do you understand?

209
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I am doing this for your own good.

210
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Li Xiaochun!

211
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,920
You don't understand me at all.

212
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,920
You don't understand my website.

213
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Xiaochun, don't be angry.

214
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,920
What kind of material is your mouth?

215
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Stop it.

216
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
As a founder,

217
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
this is the blow he should be taking.

218
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
But you are really going too far.

219
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Enough.

220
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Can you stop talking about this today?

221
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Okay.

222
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Can you tell me

223
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
the social value of your social status in this bar?

224
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Okay.

225
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Pay attention to your 12 o'clock direction.

226
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
There is a girl in black.

227
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Her body is the best in the bar

228
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
and she is the most beautiful.

229
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
So,

230
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
the person she is interested in

231
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
must be the one in this bar

232
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,920
who is at the peak of social hope.

233
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
You are so stupid.

234
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Okay, I don't believe you.

235
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
But I will let you see

236
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
how I reject her slowly

237
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,920
and make her think I am very attractive.

238
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Excuse me, beautiful.

239
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
I only drink today.

240
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
I will pay you.

241
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Can you give way?

242
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Are you talking to me?

243
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Of course.

244
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Can I buy you a drink?

245
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Of course.

246
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
I love drinking with you, beautiful.

247
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
I am sorry.

248
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
I am sorry.

249
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
I love drinking with you, beautiful.

250
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
You are so handsome.

251
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,920
You are really...

252
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Let me show you magic.

253
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Watch carefully.

254
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I am so handsome.

255
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Nothing is here, right?

256
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
No.

257
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Watch carefully.

258
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,920
The magic moment is coming.

259
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Congratulations to Mr. Li Xiaoxuan.

260
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Xu Li is the first investor to buy the goods.

261
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
I will take care of you if others don't.

262
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
You are the best Li Xiaoxuan in the universe.

263
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,920
We can take our time to find the investor.

264
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,920
These are all my belongings.

265
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
I have kept them for a long time.

266
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Although I may not help you much,

267
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
you can take them for the time being.

268
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Take them.

269
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Why are your hands so dirty?

270
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I think your judgment of Xiaoxuan

271
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,920
has affected your judgment of the project.

272
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,920
I have too much judgment on him.

273
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
So I know that he is not suitable for this project.

274
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
So what is your judgment of him?

275
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
As long as he doesn't do anything about human love,

276
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,920
I will support him no matter what he does.

277
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,920
This bastard chose something that he is not suitable for.

278
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Of course I have to stop him.

279
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,920
You think you know him, so you refuse this project.

280
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,920
But have you ever thought that everyone has shortcomings?

281
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Not only Xiaoxuan, but you too.

282
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
You think you are doing this for his own good,

283
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
but you are using the way he can't accept.

284
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
You don't care about his feelings.

285
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,920
And I think the western world has its own future.

286
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
You are saying that I am right.

287
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
What about you?

288
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
What about me?

289
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Do you know this software?

290
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Have you tried it?

291
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Do you know what its advantages are,

292
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,920
what is the core competitiveness?

293
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
You said you would support Xiaoxuan

294
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,920
to make an app about love.

295
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
But do you know about love?

296
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
You talk as if you know about love.

297
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
What a coincidence.

298
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
I know about love.

299
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It seems that our president Yuan has a lot of relationships.

300
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,920
No, I have never had a relationship.

301
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
You have never had a relationship?

302
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
It sounds like you have.

303
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Of course not.

304
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
You know my system.

305
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,920
If we break up, I have to live in this hospital.

306
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
So,

307
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,920
I said you should study medicine

308
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,920
and study your own physiological structure.

309
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,920
But why haven't you talked about it?

310
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
If you think about it,

311
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
it should be easy.

312
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
But you have to think about it.

313
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,920
If you think about it, it should be easy.

314
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,920
There is a beautiful girl in the company.

315
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
What beautiful girl?

316
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Nothing, you heard it wrong.

317
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Actually,

318
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
I have someone I like.

319
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,920
But I saw someone

320
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,920
who failed to confess his love when he was a kid.

321
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,920
It caused a lot of damage to his childhood.

322
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,920
So I dare not to tell you.

323
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
When did you have someone you like?

324
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,920
If you dare not to tell me, you can tell me.

325
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
I will give you a trick.

326
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,920
My name is secret love, do you understand?

327
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
It's good to have a secret love.

328
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
It's just a coward.

329
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
I'm afraid that after I tell you,

330
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
I can't even make friends.

331
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
It's going to rain. Let's go home.

332
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
I'm sorry.

341
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm sorry.

346
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
I'm sorry.

348
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,920
What the hell? How did he fail?

351
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Li Xiao Chuan, Li Xiao Chuan.

352
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Is that software reliable?

353
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Let's go.

354
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
The man you chose

355
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
is going to keep kneeling.

356
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Why is he so bad with Xiao Chuan?

357
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
Who can help him?

358
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
It's him.

359
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Oh, right.

360
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Jingjing still has a mastermind.

361
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
So funny.

362
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Jingjing,

363
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I have something important to tell you.

364
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I'm going to see you now.

365
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
What happened? Why are you in such a hurry?

366
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Go and help me.

367
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I want you to tell Mr. Du

368
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
to help me check

369
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
our Xiao Chuan's project.

370
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Yuan Shuai is going to be

371
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
very rude to people tomorrow.

372
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
I know. Drink some water first.

373
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Hold on.

374
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I think Yuan Shuai is

375
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
making a mistake.

376
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Then...

377
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Jingjing...

378
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Okay, I'll ask Mr. Du.

379
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Let him give me some advice.

380
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
If I'm not wrong,

381
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
this is the first time you've called me.

382
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Really?

383
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I might have something to ask you.

385
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
What's wrong?

386
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
My friend is starting a business.

387
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
She's researching a dating app.

388
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,920
She's doing a research.

389
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I want to ask a professional to give me some advice.

390
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Do you have time?

391
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Okay, no problem.

392
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Really? That's great.

393
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Thank you.

394
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
You're welcome.

395
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Send me the link of the app

396
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Okay, I'll send it to you.

397
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I love you.

398
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I don't know what to do without you.

399
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You're not Li Xiao Chuan.

400
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
No one can do it.

401
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
No.

402
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
In my life,

403
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
it's just you and

404
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Wu Li Xiao Chuan.

405
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Jingjing!

406
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Li Xiao Chuan?

407
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
What the hell?

408
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
What the hell?

409
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
This project is called Westworld.

410
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
It's a dating app.

411
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
If you need it, you can try it.

412
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Okay.

413
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
I'll try it.

414
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
You think you know her

415
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
and you rejected this project.

416
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
But have you ever thought that

417
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
everyone has shortcomings?

418
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Not only Xiao Chuan, but you too.

419
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
You think you're doing it for her

420
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
and you think you're doing it for her.

421
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
But you're using the way she can't accept.

422
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
You don't care about her feelings.

423
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
And I think

424
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
there's a future in the Westworld.

425
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Westworld.

426
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
The name needs to be changed.

427
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
The registration interface

428
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
can be simpler.

429
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
The template is too monotonous.

430
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Overall,

431
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
it's not practical.

432
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
It's not practical.

433
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
It's not practical.

434
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
It's not practical.

435
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
It's not practical.

436
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
It's not practical.

437
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
It's not practical.

438
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,920
It's not practical.

439
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
It's not practical.

440
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Do you know this software?

441
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Have you tried it?

442
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Do you know what its advantages are,

443
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
its core competitiveness, and its attention to detail are?

444
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Hello, Juno.

445
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
You're the first one in the Westworld

446
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
to answer the question.

447
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Congratulations.

448
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
You've answered the question.

449
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
The page has successfully entered the match mode.

450
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Please put your finger

451
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
in the center of the screen to match.

452
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Although I don't want to go on a blind date,

453
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
if I don't use it,

454
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
I won't be convinced.

455
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
If I don't use it, I won't be convinced.

456
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
The match failed.

457
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
A 100% match.

458
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
What a joke.

459
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Juno.

460
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Hello, Juno.

461
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Hello,

462
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Zou Si.

463
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Your name is quite big.

464
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
You're so generous.

465
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Your name is not modest at all.

466
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
I'm not modest, either.

467
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,920
So we're a 100% match.

468
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Do you believe in 100% match?

469
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
I don't believe in it.

470
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Because I have someone I like.

471
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
So I don't believe it.

472
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
You use a dating software

473
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
when you have someone you like.

474
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Could it be

475
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
a single love?

476
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
A secret love.

477
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
For many years.

478
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Tell me.

479
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
That's a good one.

480
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
It's beautiful unless you exchange it.

481
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Do you have someone you like?

482
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
I don't know.

483
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I'm sorry.

485
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Are you sure that the matching book

486
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
and the data algorithm

487
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
are not a joke?

488
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Absolutely not.

489
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
The data now is just conservative data.

490
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,920
I believe that after the data optimization

491
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
of the real user,

492
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
it will be more accurate.

493
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
I've used your app.

494
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
The data algorithm is very attractive

495
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
and fast.

496
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
It's a good project.

497
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Yes, I'm confident in my work.

498
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Why do you want to make a dating app?

499
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Because I hope that

500
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
people can use this app

501
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
to find the 100% matching partner

502
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
in the simplest way.

503
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
So

504
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
your partner

505
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
is also found by this algorithm?

506
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
No, I don't have a partner yet.

507
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
But

508
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
what does this have to do

509
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
with this?

510
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
What's wrong?

511
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
What's wrong, mom?

512
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
How about this?

513
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Let's have a match.

514
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
If you win,

515
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I will not only guide you, but also think about investing in you.

516
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Come on, let's have a match.

517
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
What about the core competitiveness of the two universes?

518
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Perfect algorithm,

519
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
without any doubt, the database.

520
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
How do you think?

521
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Because

522
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I can put their past experiences,

523
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,920
their genes and their EQ

524
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,920
and their intelligence into data.

525
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,480
Can love be said in a few words?

526
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Of course.

527
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,760
I appreciate your brain-boggling tactics.

528
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,680
You lost this game.

529
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,640
You used what you're good at

530
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,880
to deny what I'm good at.

531
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,400
This...

532
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,680
This is not fair.

533
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,560
If today you're doing an athletic app,

534
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,920
how can I trust someone who's lying on the bench?

535
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,960
Similarly, you've never been in a relationship.

536
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,320
A person who's never been in a relationship

537
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
is doing a wedding app.

538
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,920
How can I convince the investors and the users?

539
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,320
I know what you're trying to say.

540
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,960
You think I've thought too much about love, right?

541
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,160
But what I'm trying to say is

542
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,560
it's because I don't understand it

543
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,120
that I can make a wedding app

544
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,280
that's so rational and calm

545
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,400
to let people know what the right choice is

546
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,240
and what the wrong impulse is, right?

547
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,520
I admit

548
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,320
that everyone can find a good partner

549
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,120
who can be 100% compatible with them.

550
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,440
It's a pity that your western world

551
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,000
lacks a very important parameter.

552
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,600
When you find the real answer,

553
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,200
come and find me.

554
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,000
Find what?

555
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,040
Find what?

556
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,680
Imagine that you live in the 두 TH a week later

557
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
as if you can't imagine it.

558
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,480
Su Xing is working in a app

559
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,160
that has prince coaster design.

560
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,000
I'll have you sea sitä.

561
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,000
You still feel sleepy

562
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,400
felt so dizzy

563
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,800
been so busy

564
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,720

565
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,120
been soリ Έ

566
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,960

568
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,400
äh

569
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,480
I

570
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,520
I come

571
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,160
to

572
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,320
do

573
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
i want to know

574
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,560
your name

575
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,800
How is the southern world or the eastern world?

576
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,440
The western world.

577
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,960
The western world?

578
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,240
How is it?

579
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,240
You don't care about the western world, do you?

580
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,520
I'll care if I ask.

581
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,080
I care about many things.

582
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,400
Drink it yourself.

583
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,040
You...

584
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,120
You grabbed my coffee.

585
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,280
Who likes it?

586
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,360
Xiao Xi reminds you that you can get 100% more love with your girlfriend.

587
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,200
I don't need to get more love.

588
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,880
You can start a conversation.

589
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,800
Okay, An Lian.

590
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,960
So, did you confess your love today?

591
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,080
Did you meet the one you like today?

592
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,040
Yes.

593
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,960
Not yet.

594
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,160
I'm too busy to have time to fall in love.

595
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,360
Busy?

596
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,840
It seems that you don't have time to find your partner.

597
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
It seems that a quick blind date is still very popular.

598
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
You're a guard, right?

599
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,080
You can chat online when you don't have time.

600
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,280
Can't I just be busy?

601
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,720
The key to this app is that all the girls who don't have time to fall in love are men and women.

602
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Let's make it clear first.

603
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,760
Don't expect anything from me.

604
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,160
I'm very dedicated to the one I like.

605
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,400
Brother, An Lian is beautiful, but he's always in love.

606
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,720
Aren't you afraid that the one you like will be chased away?

607
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:38,760
Sh adjusting

608
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,280
I believe the western world will match you with the most suitable one.

609
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,280
We don't need to be so polite.

610
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Oh, right. Is there something you want to talk to me about?

611
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Oh, I have a question to ask you.

612
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Sit, sit, sit.

613
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,280
You said you wrote a love novel before, right?

614
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Yes.

615
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Humans like to fall in love so much

616
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
that even if it's a failure,

617
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
he still has to keep doing it. Why?

618
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Such a philosophical question.

619
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Let me think.

620
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Falling in love is when two different souls

621
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
come together because of fate.

622
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,280
In this process, there may be difficulties

623
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
and many ups and downs.

624
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
But there will also be mutual understanding and tolerance.

625
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,280
And they are willing to change for each other.

626
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,280
So even if you really meet the wrong person,

627
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,280
you have experienced many ups and downs.

628
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,280
But when you think of the person who is right for you,

629
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,280
you still look forward to love.

630
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
No.

631
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I think that's because science was not so developed before.

632
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,280
Don't you think that humans are so blind to fall in love

633
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,280
that the wrong way of thinking has brought many tragedies?

634
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
But love is always blind.

635
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,280
When you meet someone you like, you fall in love with them.

636
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Why do you have to make so many mistakes?

637
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Because the speed of human growth is different from the limit.

638
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,280
When there are two individuals who are too different,

639
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
they can't grow together.

640
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
When two people can't grow together,

641
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
they will definitely be separated.

642
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Love is gone.

643
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Since the variation is so big,

644
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,280
why don't we use technology to match

645
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,280
and let the person with the most similar growth rate be together?

646
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Do you think my technology and your growth rate match?

647
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,280
I mean, why are you so weird today?

648
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,280
Well, Mr. Du said that all aspects of the western world are pretty good.

649
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,280
But I'm still looking for the only missing core parameter.

650
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
I knew it.

651
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Xu Li's express.

652
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Wait a minute. Wait for me.

653
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Hello.

654
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Hello, please sign.

655
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Okay.

656
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Thank you.

657
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
You're welcome.

658
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
What's this?

659
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
Where are you?

660
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Take a look.

661
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
This is...

662
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
This is the missing core I got.

663
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I don't know what role it is.

664
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Simply put, I bought a bunch of bracelets in a hurry.

665
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
I don't know if it looks good.

666
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
I don't know if it's useful.

667
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,280
I don't know if it's worth it.

668
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Someone would buy something like this?

669
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Of course. It's very popular.

670
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
It's fun. Try it.

671
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
Open it.

672
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
It's so ugly.

673
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,280
Don't mind it.

674
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
It's a kind of fate.

675
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
It's a kind of fate.

676
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Try it again. You'll like it.

677
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Thank you.

678
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
Thank you.

679
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
I think I've found my answer.

680
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Wait for me.

681
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Again?

682
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
You're using me.

683
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,280
I'll take advantage of you to get a little cheaper.

684
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
That was your boyfriend?

685
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
He's so handsome and he's so nice to you.

686
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
I'm so jealous.

687
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
My boyfriend is always like this.

688
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Don't be embarrassed.

689
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
By the way, look at this.

690
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,280
This is an app that can match the other half.

691
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,280
That's how my boyfriend found me.

692
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I'll try it.

693
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Just scan the app.

694
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Okay.

695
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
You figured it out so quickly?

696
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,280
I know where the problem is.

697
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Tell me.

698
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,280
All the data in the West is there.

699
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,280
But the only thing missing is the fate.

700
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,280
What's the specific change?

701
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm thinking,

702
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,280
other than the mode of 100% match,

703
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,280
we'll add an X fate matching mode.

704
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,280
It's like a super-message box.

705
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,280
It allows users who don't get 100% match to match randomly.

706
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,280
This mode will not match randomly under any conditions.

707
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,280
The system can reduce the weight of EQ, IQ, and genes

708
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,280
according to the frequency of their chat or the key words of the heart.

709
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,280
That is to say, even if it matches randomly,

710
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,280
it can also be 100% matched.

711
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
What do you think?

712
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
It sounds like a good breakthrough.

713
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
How about this?

714
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
We've designed a version of X fate matching 2.0

715
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
according to the current plans and ideas.

716
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Don't worry about the capital.

717
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
What do you mean?

718
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I mean, I've decided to invest in you.

719
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
So you can continue your next step.

720
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Really?

721
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Of course.

722
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,280
Thank you.

723
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,280
I'll try my best.

724
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Thank you.

725
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
Mr. Du has decided to invest in the western world.

726
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Really?

727
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Really?

728
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Well, do you have any other plans?

729
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Yes.

730
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Mr. Du's investment funds are coming in soon.

731
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I'll make my framework first

732
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
and then run the data.

733
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,280
And then I'll give the most important data to...

734
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Xia Chuan, that's not what I meant.

735
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I mean, do you have any...

736
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I mean, do you have any...

737
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
any words?

738
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Of course.

739
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
How could I let Mr. Du spend money for nothing?

740
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I'll make this software very good.

741
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Xia Chuan, I mean...

742
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Mr. Du, Jun Jun gave you Mr. Du, right?

743
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,280
And then Mr. Du decided to invest.

744
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,280
So, do you have any words?

745
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,280
I mean, do you have any food or a team?

746
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,280
You're right.

747
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I should thank them and thank you.

748
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
Okay.

749
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,280
It's okay. I've done this before.

750
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,280
I'll take care of it.

751
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
I'll go now.

752
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,280
You really don't need my help?

753
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Okay.

754
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,280
Jun Jun, Xia Chuan is treating you to a big meal tomorrow.

755
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Please be there on time.

756
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,280
I'll send you the location.

757
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
A big meal? Why?

758
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,280
You'll know when you get there.

759
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,280
It's so mysterious.

760
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,280
You and Xia Chuan are a couple, right?

761
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,280
If that's the case, I won't just treat you to a big meal.

762
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
I'll treat you to a hot-pot.

763
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

764
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
I'm going to work. Go to bed early.

765
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Good night.

766
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
You're not working well.

767
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,280
You're back to work.

768
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Wen Shuai, do you think Shanghai is big?

769
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
I don't think it's big.

770
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Why?

771
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,280
We can all meet again. Do you think it's big?

772
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,280
What's wrong? Why are you suddenly emotional?

773
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Yeah, people tend to think they're small when they face huge problems.

774
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,280
I'll go back to work.

775
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Wait.

776
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,280
I might be working late tonight.

777
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Please leave me some food after you go back.

778
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,280
You're the owner of the restaurant. You're so unlucky.

779
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,280
What's your password?

780
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
0905.

781
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
0905?

782
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Isn't this the day you got me eliminated from the interview?

783
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Think about it again.

784
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
It's not your birthday.

785
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,280
It's Wang Cai's birthday.

786
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Think again.

787
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
0905.

788
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
0905.

789
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
0905.

790
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
0905.

791
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,280
It's the day we meet again.

792
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Try to understand

793
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,280
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

794
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,280
You can tell me lies

795
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,280
You can make me cry, you know why

796
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,280
Never been so brave

797
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,280
I will run away

798
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,280
If it's what you want

799
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,280
What you like, I don't mind

800
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
I can close my eyes

801
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,280
I can stay behind with my time

802
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,280
Walk into your plan

803
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Like I never knew you were not mine

804
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,280
Make you satisfied

805
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,280
Wear another mask

806
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,280
You never realize things I do for love

807
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I think I'm tired

808
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,280
I think I'm blind

809
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Don't know how to feel

810
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Don't know how to heal

811
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,280
You walk so fast

812
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Can't catch your light

813
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,280
You fly so high

814
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,280
Leave all the things behind

815
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,280
And our story

816
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,280
Leave all love nowhere to find

817
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,280
I think I'm tired

818
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,280
I think I'm blind

819
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Don't know how to feel

820
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,280
Don't know how to heal

821
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,280
You walk so fast

822
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,280
Can't catch your light

823
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,280
You fly so high

824
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,280
Leave all the things behind

825
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,280
And our story

826
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:39,280
Leave all love nowhere to find

827
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,280
Thanks for watching!
