00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,680
An Li, Niu Cui Lai

3
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,320
invites you to watch

4
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
the half-life secret and half-life business.

5
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,160
To invest,

6
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,520
you should invest your beauty first.

7
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
Do you know the secret of natural beauty?

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,600
The answer is An Li, Niu Cui Lai.

9
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
Natural nutrition, natural health,

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,520
beautiful.

11
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,120
Eat it.

12
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,160
It smells good.

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,160
Really?

14
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,080
Don't move.

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,640
It's not washed yet.

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,640
Wash it for me. I want to eat it.

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
You're even making noise.

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,280
You don't like it?

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
I like it so much.

21
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,000
Drink it.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,120
Yuan Yuan.

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
Why are you cooking?

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,760
You're the guest.

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
Go inside and rest.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
I'm fine, aunt.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,000
You two go inside and rest.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Leave the rest to me.

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Yuan Yuan.

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,120
You're working in the good old house.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,040
How can you work?

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,080
Go inside and rest.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,560
Hurry up.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
I'm fine, aunt.

35
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm with Jun Jun.

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
So I'm...

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
You're together?

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,800
I mean we're working together.

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,720
No.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,120
Yes.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
You often come to disturb you.

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,960
You're serving me.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't dislike me.

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,520
Where are you going?

45
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,840
You make me happy every day.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
Mom, let him cook.

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
He cooks very well.

48
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
You should rest.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,000
Go inside and rest.

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,120
Aunt.

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,600
You're so annoying.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,440
Go inside and rest.

53
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm fine.

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,680
Wait for me.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Aunt.

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,840
Take the dishes here.

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,600
Don't bother.

58
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,560
Leave this to me.

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,200
Okay.

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,440
He's so good at cooking.

61
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,200
He's so good at cooking.

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Really.

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,600
Mom.

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,600
How do you know I love this dish?

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Let's eat.

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,280
Go inside and help him.

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,080
Eat later.

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,480
I...

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,120
Come here.

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Help me.

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,240
Is it good?

73
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,800
Is it good?

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Don't just eat.

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Eat.

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,960
It's so good.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Is it good?

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,520
Is it?

79
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,560
Here.

80
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,040
Here.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,040
Here comes the soup.

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,640
Here.

83
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
It's so good.

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,200
It smells good.

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,960
Does it smell good?

86
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,680
It smells good.

87
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,240
Yuan Yuan, come here.

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,520
Coming.

89
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,840
Let me help you.

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,320
It's so abundant.

91
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,040
Here.

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,320
Aunt.

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,440
Happy New Year!

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,320
Happy New Year!

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Happy New Year!

96
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,280
Happy New Year to Junjun and Yuanyuan!

97
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,960
Happy New Year!

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,720
Happy New Year!

99
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,400
Good luck!

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,480
Here.

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,240
Auntie, try my cooking.

102
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,440
See how it is.

103
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,200
Yuanyuan,

104
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,720
how did you make this dish?

105
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,440
I think Junjun likes it, too.

106
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,200
This dish?

107
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,680
It's very simple.

108
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,120
I often make it at home.

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,320
This dish was made by Mr. Yuan

110
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,760
when he was in the army.

111
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,240
He made a lot of dishes

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,600
for all the departments.

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,680
Various dishes.

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,640
Pork ribs,

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,520
sweet and sour pork ribs.

116
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,160
Right?

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,000
Right?

118
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Yes.

119
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,720
Auntie,

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
if you like it,

121
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,000
I often come to your house

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,440
and make it for you.

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
I can write down the recipe

124
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,920
and you can write it down.

125
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,760
Okay, Yuanyuan.

126
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Thank you.

127
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,560
You're welcome.

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,760
Here, Auntie.

129
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,520
Try it.

130
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,600
Okay, thank you, Yuanyuan.

131
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,480
You're welcome.

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,680
Here.

133
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,080
It's delicious.

134
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,600
It's delicious.

135
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,280
Eat more.

136
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,640
Eat.

137
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,880
Yuanyuan,

138
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,760
I hope you'll come to my house

139
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
often.

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,760
I like you.

141
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,800
Thank you, Auntie.

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,520
I remember

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,640
you often came to my house

144
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,360
when you were a kid.

145
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,000
I know how good you and Junjun are.

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,560
Look.

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,560
If Junjun's speech was stolen,

148
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,120
Junjun wouldn't go to the hospital.

149
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,720
If Junjun didn't go to the hospital,

150
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,000
he wouldn't transfer to another school.

151
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,920
If Junjun didn't transfer to another school,

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,600
he wouldn't miss

153
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,240
your meeting before leaving the country.

154
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,040
It's a pity.

155
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
The one who stole the speech

156
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,200
is the one who is the most guilty

157
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,080
and the most hateful.

158
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,360
Auntie,

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,920
I don't think he

160
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,200
deliberately stole the speech.

161
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,800
Can you stop hating him?

162
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
I'm just complaining to you.

163
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,440
I remember it today.

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
But every time I remember it,

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,320
I feel very hateful.

166
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,840
I...

167
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,760
Yuanyuan,

168
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
what are you doing?

169
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,440
Get up.

170
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,920
Auntie,

171
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to confess something to you.

172
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Back then,

173
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
the one who stole the speech

174
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
was me.

175
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,720
I...

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,400
Mom, mom, mom.

177
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,360
He didn't mean it.

178
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,600
He wanted to take my stuff

179
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,360
and made a mistake.

180
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,080
He really...

181
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,440
He regretted doing it.

182
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,040
Right?

183
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,640
Right?

184
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,320
I really regret it, auntie.

185
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,120
I...

186
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,000
I didn't mean it.

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,520
You...

188
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,280
I...

189
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,520
I really regret it.

190
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,120
If you don't forgive me today,

191
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,320
I won't get up.

192
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,800
Please forgive me.

193
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,320
I...

194
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
I'm begging you.

195
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm begging you.

196
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,000
Yuanyuan,

197
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,440
come on.

198
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,280
Get up.

199
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
I forgive you.

200
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,120
Come on, get up.

201
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,240
Sit down.

202
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
Thank you, auntie.

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,800
Auntie,

204
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,320
you really forgive me?

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
I toast to you.

206
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
I promise you

207
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
from now on,

208
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,320
I'll protect you.

209
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,600
I'll drink it up.

210
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,280
Put it down.

211
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,000
How could you

212
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,720
be so petty?

213
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,040
Besides,

214
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,560
it's been so long.

215
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,840
I won't hold it in.

216
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Mom, mom.

217
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,800
Drink it.

218
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,000
Come on, Yuanyuan.

219
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,600
I toast to you.

220
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,360
I'll drink it up.

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,800
Don't you want to drink it?

222
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,680
I'll drink it.

223
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll drink it, auntie.

224
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,960
Come on.

225
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,600
I'm done.

226
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
The second glass of wine

227
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,360
I toast to you

228
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,720
is because you're Jun Jun's leader.

229
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,960
You've grown up now.

230
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,840
I believe

231
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,240
you won't do anything

232
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,200
that hurts Jun Jun again.

233
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,000
Come on.

234
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
I'll drink it up.

235
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,840
Mom.

236
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,840
You don't want to drink it, Yuanyuan?

237
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,480
I'll drink it.

238
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,560
I'll drink it.

239
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm done, auntie.

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,560
The third glass of wine

241
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,560
I toast to you.

242
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,360
Today is the New Year.

243
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,960
New year, new weather.

244
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,280
After today,

245
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
the past will be forgotten.

246
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
I'll drink it up.

247
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,760
I'll drink it up.

248
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,720
The past

249
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,240
will be forgotten.

250
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,680
We'll turn the tables.

251
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Yuanyuan,

252
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
happy new year.

253
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,520
You don't want to drink it?

254
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,640
I'll drink it.

255
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll drink it.

256
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm done.

257
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,880
Jun Jun,

258
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,440
eat.

259
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Are you okay?

260
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
I'll go to the bathroom.

261
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,560
I'm sorry, auntie.

262
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,520
I'm sorry, auntie.

263
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,520
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,480
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,440
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,640
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,560
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,440
I'll go with you.

272
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,280
Sit down.

273
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,640
No, mom.

274
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,720
Sit down.

275
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,640
No, mom.

276
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,320
He's going to throw up.

277
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,120
Sit down.

278
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,240
Li Li,

279
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,640
why are you here?

280
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Didn't you go home on holiday?

281
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,160
I'm fine.

282
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,480
I just want to come and see

283
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,240
if there's anything I can help you with.

284
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Help?

285
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
How about

286
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
visiting my store?

287
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,760
Sure.

288
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,440
You can go.

289
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,600
I'm just kidding.

290
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,560
I'm serious.

291
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,760
Let's go on holiday.

292
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,880
It's hard to say.

293
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,640
I have to go home and take a nap.

294
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,720
You know what?

295
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,560
A young man

296
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,240
came to our store

297
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
in the middle of the night

298
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,720
and got drunk after drinking half a bottle.

299
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,640
We tried to persuade him

300
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,080
to go home safely.

301
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,920
I guess he's hurt by love.

302
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,160
He made us suffer until midnight.

303
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,560
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,480
Li Li,

305
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,920
what are you talking about?

306
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,920
Nothing.

307
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,600
I'm just saying

308
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,840
I'm still a poor girl.

309
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,200
Yeah.

310
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,200
You're so lucky this year.

311
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
Please

312
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,760
keep an eye on this place.

313
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,560
I'll go and make up for it.

314
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,400
I'll be back soon.

315
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,360
Go ahead.

316
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Thank you.

317
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,560
Happy New Year.

318
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,440
Happy New Year.

319
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,200
Happy New Year.

320
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,400
The sunlight

321
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,760
made you to be here.

322
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,160
Why you had to leave me?

323
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,240
You can't cry, Xu Tian.

324
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,040
Don't cry, Xiao Man.

325
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Don't cry.

326
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,800
Don't cry.

327
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,960
You'll feel better after you get up.

328
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,800
Don't cry, Si Tong.

329
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,000
It's a good time.

330
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,880
I've been working hard these days.

331
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,720
I'm so tired.

332
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,960
And so will I.

333
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,920
Sit down

334
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Mother

335
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,160
Mingyue

336
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,360
Thank you

337
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you

338
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,840
You're just a guest

339
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,000
and you're helping me brush the dish

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,080
I should

341
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,360
Take the responsibility

342
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,040
Come on, crispy apple

343
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Thank you

344
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
Have you ever thought of

345
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,480
having a sweet love?

346
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,760
Aunt.

347
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,120
Actually,

348
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,640
my girlfriend and I are sweet.

349
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,720
What?

350
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,520
You have a girlfriend?

351
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,280
Aunt.

352
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,240
Actually, I've been with...

353
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,120
Stop eating.

354
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,760
Brush these.

356
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,080
I didn't mean to offend anyone.

357
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,920
I'm just making friends with your daughter.

358
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,920
I'm buying groceries.

359
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,000
I cook.

360
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,600
I wash dishes.

361
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,840
I drink.

362
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm a good son-in-law.

363
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,040
My mother-in-law is right.

364
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,000
She's the best.

365
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,760
She's always right.

366
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
I should wash this bowl.

367
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,160
Junjun.

368
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,560
Have an apple.

369
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,560
Thanks, mom.

370
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,040
Junjun.

371
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,560
Aunt Li's son is coming back.

372
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,200
Do you want to meet him?

373
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,280
Mom, don't think about the blind date.

374
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,400
You're a good girl.

375
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
You're a grown-up.

376
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
I hope you can find a boyfriend

377
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,000
and have someone to take care of you.

378
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,400
I took care of myself

379
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,240
when I was in college.

380
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm quite well-kept.

381
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Don't worry.

382
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,040
Stop playing with your phone.

383
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,640
I'm talking about something serious.

384
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,880
Junjun.

385
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,280
Xiao Gan has a girlfriend.

386
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
Do you know that?

387
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,400
What?

388
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,480
Why do you kiss me?

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
Send her away now.

390
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,760
Honey.

391
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,920
What should we do?

392
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,560
Junjun...

393
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,200
Junjun seems to have fallen in love

394
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,640
with a boy with a girlfriend.

395
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,240
He's the son of Yuan's family.

396
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,640
They seem to be close.

397
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,280
But his son told me

398
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,920
he has a girlfriend.

399
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm so pissed.

400
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,680
He's a jerk.

401
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,640
Honey.

402
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,720
Why don't you come over tonight

403
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,960
and take him away?

404
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,800
Have some hot water.

405
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,560
What did my mom say to you?

406
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,440
She's so angry.

407
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,640
She asked me to drive you away.

408
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,840
She brought me an apple.

409
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,680
She asked me if it was sweet.

410
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,720
I said yes.

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It was like my girlfriend.

412
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,880
Yes.

413
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,200
But she was angry.

414
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,040
I didn't tell her.

415
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,840
Auntie.

416
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,360
Yuan.

417
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,680
You might need to sleep in the living room tonight.

418
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,000
You won't mind, will you?

419
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,960
No, mom.

420
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,320
I can sleep in my room.

421
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,240
I'll sleep with you.

422
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,000
How can you let others sleep in a girl's room?

423
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,320
Yes.

424
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,680
How can you let others sleep in a girl's room?

425
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Auntie.

426
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,040
I think the living room is good.

427
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
The sofa is good too.

428
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,960
I'll sleep in the living room.

429
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,120
Mom.

430
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,200
It's summer.

431
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,920
It's winter now.

432
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,880
You'll catch a cold.

433
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,760
No.

434
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,040
I'm fine, auntie.

435
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm fine.

436
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,520
The quilt is thick.

437
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,240
I can do it.

438
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,880
What are you afraid of?

439
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,720
General.

440
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,600
Yuan is fine.

441
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,920
What are you afraid of?

442
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:28,840
Get up.

443
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,560
Go back to your room.

444
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,480
Mom, you're so good.

445
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,320
Get up.

446
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,960
Auntie, please go to bed early.

447
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,000
Yuan.

448
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,280
Good night.

449
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,120
Good night, auntie.

450
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,600
Mrs. Chang is right.

451
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,280
You scared me.

452
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,440
Why are you here?

453
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

454
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
So I sent you a quilt.

455
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm leaving.

456
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,560
No.

457
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,040
Warm the quilt for me.

458
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm cold.

459
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,960
My mom will come out.

460
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
I miss you.

461
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
You're annoying.

462
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,880
Come on.

463
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,720
I'll help you.

464
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,440
I'm fine.

465
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,200
I'm fine.

466
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,960
I'm fine.

467
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,800
I'm fine.

468
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,560
I'm fine.

469
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,320
I'm fine.

470
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,080
I'm fine.

471
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,760
Come on.

472
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,000
Is it warm?

473
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,840
Good night.

474
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,760
Good night.

475
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,400
Shengnan Is Too veins

476
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,840
It's more than four o'clock.

477
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,520
You should think about it

478
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,440
before four o'clock.

479
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,840
Mom, I'll get up later.

480
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,080
It's obtained rewind.

481
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,840
Okay.

482
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,760
Kiss me.

483
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,760
Go.

484
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,360
Mingyuan!

485
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,080
Mingyuan!

486
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,800
Come here.

487
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,440
Aunt.

488
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,440
I... I...

489
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,760
I can explain it to you.

490
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,440
You're a liar!

491
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,040
I can't hear you.

492
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,520
Junjun.

493
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,480
Why don't you listen to me?

494
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,320
Why are you so stubborn?

495
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,960
What's wrong with me?

496
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,760
Why am I so stubborn?

497
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,120
You're so angry at me, aren't you?

498
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,120
He has a girlfriend.

499
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,960
Do you know that?

500
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,680
I can tell that you like him.

501
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,520
He didn't plan to break up with his girlfriend.

502
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,400
Do you know that?

503
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,080
Junjun.

504
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,160
Turn around.

505
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,280
Don't let him turn you back.

506
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Have you rice?

507
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,560
Mom.

508
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
I want rice.

509
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
Junjun?

510
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,640
I can't hear you.

511
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,920
Hello, mom.

512
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,480
Did Junjun roll over?

513
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,800
Brother Xiaochun has joined Boxu's group

514
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,160
under the가심성또쿨 bem audience

515
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,160
It's been three days.

516
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
Your mom is still in a dream.

517
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,880
It's my first time.

518
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,440
You won't have a dream, right?

519
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,960
Maybe.

520
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,800
Honey,

521
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,320
you misunderstood.

522
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,000
Yuanyuan is not a scumbag.

523
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,400
She is my girlfriend.

524
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,440
Honey,

525
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,360
you can't take her away tonight.

526
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,760
Good morning, aunt.

527
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
Yuanyuan, come here.

528
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,960
Come here.

529
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,680
Come here for breakfast.

530
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Aunt, you are so generous.

531
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,280
Mom, you are exaggerating.

532
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,040
No, I'm not.

533
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,480
I just made it casually.

534
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,800
Casually?

535
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
It's your first time here.

536
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,560
I don't know what you like.

537
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,200
I made some more for you.

538
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,000
Look.

539
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
This is Japanese.

540
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,920
This is Chinese.

541
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,320
This is Western.

542
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
You can eat whatever you want.

543
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,320
Listen.

544
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,480
The most important thing is

545
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
boys must eat eggs.

546
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,440
Eggs are a big portion, you know?

547
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,280
So,

548
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,800
I made some more for you.

549
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,480
Look.

550
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,400
Anchon eggs,

551
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,200
braised eggs,

552
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,000
boiled eggs,

553
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,880
pine nuts eggs,

554
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,800
fried eggs,

555
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,280
and poached eggs.

556
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,880
The most important thing is

557
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,560
the dresses,

558
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,720
while back home,

559
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,520
wearing extra birth kid pumps.

560
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,200
Actually,

561
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,120
It's a secret.

562
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,720
However,

563
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
here is a secret.

564
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,020
Why?

565
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,600
According to parents' safety regulations,

566
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
the whole house

567
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,920
不錯

568
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,240
Yes!

569
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,000
No...

570
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,040
you have the answer.

571
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Hurry up.

572
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Here.

573
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Auntie.

574
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Thank you so much.

575
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
But to be honest,

576
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,040
if I can eat the rice you made,

577
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
I'll be very satisfied.

578
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Yuanyuan.

579
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,040
How could you forget that you like this?

580
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Wait.

581
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
You really have it.

582
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
My mom is crazy.

583
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Maybe you're her new body.

584
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm crazy?

585
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
What is that?

586
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Rice with ten-fingered rice.

587
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Mom.

588
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
What did you put in?

589
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
What's the smell?

590
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Nothing.

591
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Just a few.

592
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
There are

593
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
dango,

594
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
deer's milk,

595
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
sea cucumber,

596
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
and lychee.

597
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
The most important is

598
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
this beer and lamb kidney.

599
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Here.

600
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Try it.

601
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
My mom has taken all the precious ingredients

602
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
in her box.

603
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
You have to eat it.

604
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Come on, Yuanyuan.

605
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Eat it all.

606
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
You eat it alone.

607
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Here.

608
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Where should I start?

609
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Here.

610
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Eat the body first.

611
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
It's very nutritious.

612
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
I'd better eat the rice first.

613
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I tell you,

614
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
the soup is nutritious.

615
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Eat it all.

616
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
It's delicious, auntie.

617
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Is it delicious?

618
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Here.

619
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Eat the egg.

620
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Here.

621
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Eat more, Yuanyuan.

622
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
You must eat more.

623
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
I tell you.

624
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
What are you eating?

625
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
So many eggs.

626
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Where did she eat them?

627
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Am I your daughter?

628
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Why does a girl eat so much?

629
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Just eat vegetables.

630
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Eat vegetables and salad.

631
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Yuanyuan, eat more.

632
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Thank you, auntie.

633
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Aunt, come on.

634
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
You eat too.

635
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Eat a bun.

636
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Aunt.

637
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
This rice is very delicious.

638
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
It still has the taste of your old days.

639
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Yuanyuan.

640
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
In the future,

641
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
I will make you

642
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
all kinds of delicious food.

643
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Thank you, auntie.

644
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
I'll cook for you next time.

645
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
My cooking is good.

646
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Sorry.

647
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Aunt, answer the phone.

648
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Hello.

649
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Is the food delicious?

650
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Are you free?

651
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
Come to play mahjong.

652
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
I can't play mahjong today.

653
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I have guests at home.

654
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Yuanyuan, right?

655
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Ask her to come together.

656
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Three to one.

657
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
By the way, she is familiar with it.

658
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Okay, Cui Ping.

659
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Okay.

660
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
See you in the afternoon.

661
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Okay.

662
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Yuanyuan.

663
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
After eating later,

664
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I will give you

665
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
a task of honor.

666
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Me?

667
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
What task?

668
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
You'll know after eating.

669
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Eat, eat, eat.

670
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
Come on.

671
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Okay.

672
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Is it delicious?

673
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Is it delicious?

674
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
I forgot the most important thing.

675
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
The Buddha jump the wall.

676
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
I'll get it for you.

677
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Wait.

678
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Buddha jump the wall.

679
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
What are you doing?

680
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Aunt made an appointment

681
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
with a friend to play mahjong in the afternoon.

682
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
I have to show my hands.

683
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Just playing mahjong.

684
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Do you have to do that?

685
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
My mom has already

686
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
liked you enough.

687
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
You don't understand that.

688
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
So,

689
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
a son-in-law

690
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
knows his mother-in-law better.

691
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Who let you be a son-in-law?

692
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
You shameless.

693
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
I say,

694
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
don't show up in the afternoon.

695
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Otherwise,

696
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
you will disrupt

697
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
my aunt's plan.

698
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Do you have any sense?

699
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Am I still a Jiang family?

700
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
I'm going to cry to my dad.

701
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Listen to me.

702
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
This is about right.

703
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Yuan Yuan,

704
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
your watch

705
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
looks expensive.

706
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
It's okay.

707
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
It's a good deal.

708
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
This watch is just

709
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
a medium-priced watch.

710
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Yuan Yuan,

711
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I don't know if you

712
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
have bought a house

713
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
in Shanghai now.

714
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
What I mean is

715
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
young people

716
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
always need a stable home

717
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
when they work outside.

718
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Right?

719
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Yes.

720
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
You're right.

721
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I have bought

722
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
two houses in Shanghai.

723
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
But

724
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
they are all

725
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
some common

726
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
shopping houses in the community.

727
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Yes.

728
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Yuan Yuan's two houses

729
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
are not big.

730
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Yuan Yuan,

731
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
you are so young.

732
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
You bought

733
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
two houses in Shanghai.

734
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Two.

735
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Did your family

736
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
invest in it?

737
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
No, auntie.

738
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
I don't think so.

739
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
I just bought

740
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
two houses in Shanghai.

741
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
No, auntie.

742
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
My parents

743
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
have been abroad for a long time.

744
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
They don't plan

745
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
to go back to China for a short time.

746
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
I bought these two houses

747
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
for my own convenience

748
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
and work.

749
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
But your company's treatment

750
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
is really good.

751
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
It depends on the project.

752
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
If it's a small project,

753
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
it's actually more common.

754
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Yes.

755
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
If Yuan Yuan's company

756
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
is a big project,

757
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
he can make more money.

758
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
I'll take it.

759
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Thank you.

760
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
The ninth.

761
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
I did it.

762
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Yuan Yuan,

763
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
you can't sit in the row like this.

764
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
The second.

765
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Guan Jun,

766
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
I'll change your seat later.

767
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
You can't

768
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
sit in Yuan Yuan's house.

769
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Yes, auntie.

770
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
I'm good at it.

771
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Three bowls.

772
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
The first.

773
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
The first.

774
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
The second.

775
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
The second.

776
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I made it.

777
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Great.

778
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Such a big plate.

779
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
You made it.

780
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I'm so lucky.

781
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
You're so good at it.

782
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Give me the money.

783
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Shujuan,

784
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,040
you're so mean.

785
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Yuan Yuan is so busy with work.

786
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
He doesn't have time

787
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
to practice mahjong.

788
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
How can he sit in the row?

789
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
You're right, auntie.

790
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
He's too busy with work.

791
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
So,

792
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
he doesn't have time to play mahjong.

793
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Today,

794
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
I'm here to learn from some mahjong masters.

795
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Don't mind the talent.

796
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Don't mind the talent.

797
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
No, I won't.

798
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
No, I won't.

799
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
That's good.

800
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Let's start.

801
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Come on.

802
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Eight.

803
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
I made it.

804
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
You're so good at it.

805
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Again.

806
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
I'm so lucky.

807
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Auntie,

808
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
you're so good at it.

809
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Seven.

810
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
I made it.

811
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
I made it again.

812
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Great.

813
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
You're so good at it.

814
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Give me the money.

815
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Nine.

816
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
I made it again.

817
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Give me the money.

818
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Give me the money.

819
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
I think I made it.

820
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Auntie,

821
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
look at this.

822
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Is it a win?

823
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Really?

824
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
I made it.

825
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
I made it.

826
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
I made it.

827
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
I made it.

828
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I made it.

829
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
I made it again.

830
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
I'll give you all the money.

831
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
No need to look for it.

832
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Today,

833
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm so embarrassed

834
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
to win.

835
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Look at me.

836
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Auntie,

837
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
what are you talking about?

838
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm usually busy at work.

839
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
I don't have time to play mahjong.

840
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm not good at it.

841
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
It's really an honor

842
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,040
to play with some god of cards today.

843
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
I told you.

844
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
God of cards is a human being.

845
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Yuan Yuan lost so much.

846
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
He doesn't have to be embarrassed

847
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
and make a fuss.

848
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,040
He must be a good husband in the future.

849
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Yuan Yuan,

850
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
I'm a straightforward person.

851
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
I won't make a mess with you.

852
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
Listen to me.

853
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm your wife.

854
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Go away.

855
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Go away.

856
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
I made the appointment

857
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
for this game, right?

858
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Of course, I'll go first.

859
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Grandpa,

860
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
I'm your daughter.

861
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Hui Ping. Hui Ping.

862
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
I'm sorry.

863
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
I'll interrupt you.

864
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
I understand

865
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
what you two want to ask.

866
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Our Yuan Yuan

867
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
is indeed

868
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
a little better

869
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
than some ordinary boys.

870
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
But Yuan Yuan

871
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
is already with Jun Jun.

872
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
They're already

873
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
boyfriends.

874
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
No.

875
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Didn't you just say yesterday

876
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
that Yuan Yuan is not Jun Jun's boyfriend?

877
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
Shu Jun,

878
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm sorry to say that yesterday.

879
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I already have a girlfriend.

880
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Then,

881
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
good relationship.

882
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
I'm going back to cook.

883
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Auntie, you're not playing?

884
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Let's play another round.

885
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Okay.

886
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Have fun.

887
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
Take care, auntie.

888
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Come again next time.

889
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Come again next time, auntie.

890
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
See you again.

891
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
How is it, auntie?

892
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Did you do well today?

893
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Quite successful.

894
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Yeah.

895
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Be honest.

896
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
When I hit four,

897
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I knew he wanted me.

898
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Auntie, wait a minute.

899
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
How much is this?

900
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Help me get two bags.

901
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Actually,

902
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
two bags and forty.

903
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Okay.

904
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Just right.

905
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Thank you.

906
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Yuan Yuan,

907
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
can you eat this much?

908
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Jun Jun likes to eat this.

909
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
I think he likes it.

910
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
You must like it too.

911
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Buy more.

912
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
When Jun Jun was young,

913
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
his father especially liked to buy him

914
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
candied chestnuts.

915
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Yeah.

916
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Yuan Yuan,

917
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
you're so good at this.

918
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
How is it?

919
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Do you want to learn?

920
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
But if you want to learn,

921
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
you have to call me

922
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Brother Yuan Yuan.

923
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Jun Jun.

924
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Dad.

925
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Guess what I brought you.

926
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
It's chestnuts.

927
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
This is a chestnut.

928
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
It's a chestnut.

929
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
It's a chestnut.

930
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
It's a chestnut.

931
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
It's a chestnut.

932
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
It's a chestnut.

933
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
It's a chestnut.

934
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
It's a chestnut.

935
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Thank you, Dad.

936
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
You eat with Brother Yuan Yuan first.

937
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
I'll make you some rice noodles.

938
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Brother Yuan Yuan,

939
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,040
let's eat chestnuts.

940
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
No.

941
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
How is it?

942
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Is it sweet?

943
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
It's okay.

944
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
It seems that

945
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
you don't like chestnuts.

946
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
I prefer to eat.

947
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
How about you peel it for me?

948
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
I'll eat them.

949
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Why?

950
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Because I'm weak.

951
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
Dad used to peel it for me.

952
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Now he cooks for me.

953
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
How did you peel the chestnut

954
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
you gave me?

955
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
I bit it with my teeth.

956
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Okay.

957
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
How about this?

958
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
You call me Brother Yuan Yuan three times.

959
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
I'll peel it for you.

960
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
Brother Yuan Yuan.

961
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Brother Yuan Yuan.

962
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Brother Yuan Yuan.

963
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Come on.

964
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Come on.

965
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
Is it sweet?

966
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
Yuan Yuan,

967
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
thank you.

968
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Thank you for caring about

969
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Jun Jun's feelings.

970
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
Since his father passed away,

971
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
he seems to have grown up overnight.

972
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Since then,

973
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
he has never cried again.

974
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
I don't know

975
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
whether he has become strong

976
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
or pretending to be strong.

977
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
But I know

978
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
he is afraid that I worry about him.

979
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
But the more he is like this,

980
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
the more I worry about him.

981
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
But now I have you,

982
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
I can rest assured.

983
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Aunt,

984
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
this is what I should do.

985
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Yuan Yuan,

986
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
can you promise me

987
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
one thing?

988
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
Aunt,

989
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
please.

990
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
I hope

991
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
no matter what changes

992
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
happen between you and Jun Jun,

993
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
or what happens between you,

994
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
I hope you can be kind to Jun Jun

995
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
and don't be the one who makes him cry.

996
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Aunt,

997
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
don't worry.

998
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
I will treat him well

999
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
and won't let anyone bully him.

1000
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
In this life,

1001
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
I will only let him laugh

1002
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
and won't let him cry.

1003
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Thank you, Yuan Yuan.

1004
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Is it that one?

1005
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
I haven't eaten it for a long time.

1006
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Stop.

1007
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
I am the one who made the chestnut.

1008
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
That's good.

1009
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Here.

1010
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
Here, have a taste.

1011
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
How is it?

1012
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Tasty.

1013
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Is it good?

1014
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Yes.

1015
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Yuan Yuan,

1016
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
look at how you made it.

1017
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Yang Pan Pan,

1018
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
this is our young man's hobby.

1019
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
You don't need to wait.

1020
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Aunt,

1021
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
a girlfriend should be spoiled

1022
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
and spoiled.

1023
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
I will give you a hug.

1024
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Yuan Yuan,

1025
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
no need.

1026
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
I will eat it later.

1027
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
It's okay.

1028
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Here, have a taste.

1029
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
See if it's good.

1030
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Thank you, Yuan Yuan.

1031
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
You're welcome.

1032
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Here, have some orange.

1033
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Okay.

1034
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I drank water and it's still on my tongue.

1035
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Eat slowly.

1036
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
Here.

1037
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
Jun Jun, what are you doing?

1038
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
It's okay, Aunt.

1039
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
I didn't mean to.

1040
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
You are really...

1041
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Here, take it off.

1042
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
I will dry it for you.

1043
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Thank you, Aunt.

1044
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
You have been so clumsy all day.

1045
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
It's okay.

1046
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
What's wrong with you?

1047
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
Are you okay?

1048
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
Did you take out anything in the room?

1049
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
No, I'm fine.

1050
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
Wipe yourself.

1051
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
It's okay.

1052
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
Are you okay?

1053
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
You are really clumsy.

1054
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
You are still not understanding.

1055
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Yuan Shuai.

1056
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
What's going on?

1057
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
Well...

1058
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
General.

1059
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
Come in with me.

1060
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
What's going on?

1061
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Jun Jun.

1062
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

1063
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Mom, I was afraid you would be worried.

1064
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
You wanted to go to Shanghai.

1065
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
I disagreed.

1066
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Because the city is under great pressure.

1067
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
And people are being manipulated.

1068
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,040
But you told me that you wanted to go out and see.

1069
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
I didn't stop you.

1070
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,040
I don't want you to do work that is under too much pressure.

1071
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
But you are studying related majors.

1072
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
I also accepted it, right?

1073
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,040
But why did you take my words as a warning?

1074
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,040
Especially when you buried that place where people are evil.

1075
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
I don't want to hear his name in my life.

1076
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Why can't you listen to me?

1077
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Especially your father.

1078
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
Mom.

1079
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I used to think that投行 only recognized money, not people.

1080
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
But after half a year, I found that it's not the industry's problem.

1081
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
But the problem of people's hearts.

1082
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
And I really love this job.

1083
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Stop talking.

1084
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
I will resign when I go back.

1085
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
I can't compromise on this matter anymore.

1086
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I'm going to be someone you always want to know.

1087
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,040
Then you'll be staying every day of my life.

1088
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
Try to understand.

1089
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Try to say goodbye a thousand times.

1090
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
You can tell me lies.

1091
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
You can make me cry.

1092
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
You know why.

1093
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,040
Never been so brave.

1094
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,040
I will run away.

1095
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,040
If it's what you want, what you like, I don't mind.

1096
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
I can close my eyes.

1097
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,040
I can stay behind with my time.

1098
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
Walk into your plan.

1099
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,040
Like I never knew you were not mine.

1100
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,040
I'm sorry.

1101
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
I'm sorry.

1102
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
I'm sorry.

1103
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm sorry.

1104
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,040
I'm sorry.

1105
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,040
I'm sorry.

1106
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
I'm sorry.

1107
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,040
I'm sorry.

1108
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
I'm sorry.

1109
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
I'm sorry.

1110
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,040
I'm sorry.

1111
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
I'm sorry.

1112
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
I'm sorry.

1113
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
I'm sorry.

1114
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm sorry.

1115
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,040
I'm sorry.

1116
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
I'm sorry.

1117
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,040
I'm sorry.

1118
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,040
I'm sorry.

1119
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
I'm sorry.

1120
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
I'm sorry.

1121
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
I'm sorry.

1122
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
I'm sorry.

1123
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
I'm sorry.

1124
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
I'm sorry.

1125
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
I'm sorry.

1126
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
I'm sorry.

1127
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
I'm sorry.

1128
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm sorry.

1129
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
I'm sorry.

1130
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
I'm sorry.

1131
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
I'm sorry.

1132
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
I'm sorry.

1133
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
I'm sorry.

1134
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
I'm sorry.

1135
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,040
I'm sorry.

1136
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
I'm sorry.

1137
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
I'm sorry.

1138
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
I'm sorry.

1139
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
I'm sorry.

1140
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
I'm sorry.

1141
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
I'm sorry.

1142
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I'm sorry.

1143
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,040
I'm sorry.

1144
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,040
I'm sorry.

1145
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
I'm sorry.

1146
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,040
I'm sorry.

1147
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
I'm sorry.

1148
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
I'm sorry.

1149
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
I'm sorry.

1150
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
I'm sorry.

1151
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
I'm sorry.

1152
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,040
I'm sorry.

1153
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,040
I'm sorry.

1154
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
I'm sorry.

1155
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,040
I'm sorry.

1156
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
I'm sorry.

1157
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,040
I'm sorry.

1158
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,040
I'm sorry.

1159
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
