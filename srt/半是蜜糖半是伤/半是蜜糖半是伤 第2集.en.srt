00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,240
Now.

178
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,960
Handsome. You can move in right now.

179
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,740
The apartment No. 702 in Longting No.79.

180
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,130
Post it on the Internet.

181
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
As for the price,

182
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,560
three thousand lower than nearby ones.

183
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
Three thousand?

184
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,600
People are gonna grab it.

185
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,560
Mr. Yuan.

186
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,760
If you’re so kind,

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,280
why don’t you rent it to me?

188
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,240
Prepare the furniture

189
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,280
as I told you.

190
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
Get some decorators on standby.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,400
OK.

192
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,640
You can count on me. I’ll see to it.

193
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,160
You’ve received the files I sent you, right?

194
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,090
It can only be rented to one person.

195
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
Yuan Shuai.

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,060
Your clothes. Washed.

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
They're clean.

198
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,800
To be prudent is a basic requirement

199
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
in our industry.

200
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,240
What’s wrong with your face?

201
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,600
You know it.

202
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,840
Wait.

203
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,680
We need to talk.

204
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,820
[Shimao Technology terminated the acquisition
of Yangsheng Power]

205
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,560
You see this?

206
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
The acquisition was terminated.

207
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,080
I was the only one who got the answer that day.

208
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,280
Why did you reject me?

209
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,880
I knew you’d talk with me about it.

210
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,530
What do you mean?

211
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
You did answer it correctly,

212
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,890
but that’s only temporary.

213
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
The termination of the acquisition

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,060
made people think Ma Yuke did that

215
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
to buy on margin and boost share price.

216
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,840
But,

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
actually not.

218
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,760
He did that

219
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
just to get one more seat on the board,

220
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,320
plus the right to express
leadership’s decisions.

221
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,960
Got it?

222
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,090
You must keep this in your mind.

223
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
You don’t have to trust yourself,

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
but you must trust me.

225
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,280
You

226
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,360
don’t fit MH.

227
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,250
Impossible.

228
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
You’re so confident?

229
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,280
Alright.

230
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
I’ll give you another test.

231
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,280
If you can pass it,

232
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,880
you’ll get into MH.

233
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,280
OK.

234
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
Try but never buy. Are you a demon?

235
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,440
What kind of damned assessment is this!

236
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Excuse me.

237
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,000
Can I try this on?

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Thanks.

239
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Indeed, you failed the test.

240
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,440
Why did you quit halfway?

241
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,200
You tried on seven dresses in a row

242
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
yet didn’t mean to buy them at all.

243
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,240
The seller got angry with you

244
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
for sure.

245
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,760
But you,

246
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,570
you were embarrassed as if you’d been shot

247
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,520
and ran away.

248
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
What kind of test is that?

249
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,080
You’re fooling me.

250
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,240
From this test, we can see

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
you’re

252
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
extremely sensitive

253
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,920
and psychologically weak.

254
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
I’ve told you that

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the investment banking is like a battlefield.

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,680
You.

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,200
You can’t.

258
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Jiang Jun.

259
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
You’re not smart,

260
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
but you’re kind of meticulous.

261
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
I think

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,930
consulting will be better for you.

263
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Actually,

264
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,280
I’ve got it done.

265
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,320
Wise Consulting,

266
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,840
one of the top three consulting firms
nationwide.

267
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
The position is director assistant,

268
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,160
with annual salary at least 300 grand,

269
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,220
and high possibility for promotion.

270
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,540
You don't have to thank me.

271
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,320
I won’t give up.

272
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
I will definitely get into MH.

273
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,360
I’ve said

274
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
you couldn’t.

275
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
When girls are sad,

276
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,480
they may cry and be fine afterwards.

277
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
But you,

278
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,640
you can’t even shed tears.

279
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
I hope you’ll show respect to others.

280
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,000
I hope you’ll not be so weak.

281
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,680
There’s no way can I forgive you.

282
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,360
From now on, we won’t have any contact with one another

283
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
and never meet again.

284
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,240
Jiang Jun.

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,360
In your heart,

286
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,200
am I always a bully?

287
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

288
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,330
I finally see your true colors.

289
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,960
Alright.

290
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,220
Don’t be so kind in the future.

291
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
If someone bullies you,

292
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,490
just fight back.

293
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,940
If someone sets you up,

294
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,930
you’ll pay back double.

295
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,800
Learn to protect yourself.

296
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
Understand?

297
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,349
Save it.

298
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,920
I’m not as mean as you.

299
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,520
You’re not like other girls.

300
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,589
They can cry to get things done,

301
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,520
but you,

302
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,960
you’re even allergic to tears.

303
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,760
You're the one who makes me cry.

304
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
I don’t want to see you again.

305
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Jiang Jun. Finally, you're back.

306
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,840
I’ve got a special situation to tell you.

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
My son just called me

308
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,420
and said

309
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,720
he’d get married soon.

310
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,340
Really?

311
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,760
Yes.

312
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,120
He asked me to get him an apartment.

313
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,400
You know.

314
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
I’ve expected this day

315
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,560
for so many years.

316
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
So, Jiang Jun,

317
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
I’m so sorry.

318
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,880
I’ll return you all the rent and deposit

319
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,280
of this apartment.

320
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,080
You won’t have to pay the utility bill this month.

321
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,940
What do you say?

322
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,760
But...

323
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,400
Is it so urgent?

324
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,760
Isn’t your son abroad?

325
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,760
He is abroad,

326
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,320
but

327
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,200
he’ll be back tomorrow.

328
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,360
You know,

329
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,520
he’ll be back with his fiancee.

330
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
It’s not convenient for them to live with me,

331
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,200
is it?

332
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,040
Well, Ms. Zhang,

333
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
do you want to raise the rent?

334
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,320
If that's the case, we can talk.

335
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
What are you talking about?

336
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,880
Do I look like

337
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,440
a snobby woman?

338
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,480
You don’t.

339
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,400
Alright.

340
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,800
Jiang Jun.

341
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,360
Take an extra month’s rent

342
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,060
as the penalty.

343
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,720
Alright?

344
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
And you’ll just

345
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,840
pack up and move out

346
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,880
very soon.

347
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
We’ll still be good friends.

348
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Alright?

349
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,400
But, Ms. Zhang,

350
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,480
I have so much stuff here.

351
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,400
I don’t have enough time...

352
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,480
You can try to pack up as soon as possible.

353
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,080
That’s it.

354
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,960
-Hurry and pack up.
-But...

355
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,360
Just move out. Alright?

356
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,160
That’s it.

357
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,200
You’re beautiful.

358
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,640
I like you. Bye.

359
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,420
Eat it quickly.

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,200
My roommate is on a diet.

361
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,660
If she hears it, she’ll...

362
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,330
You know what I mean.

363
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,400
How is it?

364
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,760
You're eating instant noodles so late.

365
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,080
I’m on a diet!

366
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Is it good?

367
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,320
It’s good.

368
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I just tried to go against the tide,

369
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,300
yet got damned right away.

370
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,400
Even my base was taken.

371
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,560
How can I fight against the enemy?

372
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,440
Just keep fighting. Why not?

373
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Jiang Jun.

374
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,840
I’m sorry that

375
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,920
you didn't see Lin Taimo.

376
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,520
So,

377
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,800
to make up for it,

378
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,240
I’ll ask my entire sisterhood

379
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,560
of 800 models for help

380
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,840
to get Lin Taimo

381
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,400
in front of you.

382
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,840
Thank your sisterhood then.

383
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
You'll be well rewarded.

384
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,370
Yes, my lady.

385
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,580
What are you doing?

386
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,100
Looking for an apartment.

387
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,240
Isn’t it for me?

388
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,800
Friends should share everything.

389
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Leave some for me.

390
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Mr. Yuan. It’s rare that you don’t work
on weekends.

391
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
It’s almost done.

392
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,740
Are you satisfied?

393
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,600
All these are bought as you required,

394
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
sofa, plants

395
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,540
and the wrought-iron bed in the bedroom.

396
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
Is this apartment posted on Internet?

397
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Yes, it is.

398
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,320
Since it’s posted on the Internet,

399
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,400
My cellphone hasn’t stopped ringing.

400
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,320
Certainly.

401
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,400
Take your time.

402
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,440
I gotta go to my company.

403
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,240
Mr. Yuan. Bye.

404
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,800
OK.

405
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,880
Thanks.

406
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
Let’s see if you’ll rent it.

407
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,720
Jiang Jun.

408
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,180
Tell me the requirements.

409
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,460
Five thousand.

410
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,040
Simple furniture style,

411
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,290
nothing grandiose.

412
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
Wrought-iron bed is preferred.

413
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,680
It will be better if there is

414
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,410
a big balcony to see the view of Shanghai at night.

415
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,600
Jiang Jun.

416
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
That’s not much at all.

417
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
What about the location?

418
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,810
If there’s a subway,

419
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,960
it doesn’t matter if it’s a little far.

420
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,020
[Refined decoration,
Room No.702, Longting No.79]

421
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,000
Wrought-iron bed.

422
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,880
Big balcony.

423
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
Shanghai night view.

424
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
It all fits!

425
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,250
Really? Where is it?

426
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,080
Longting Community.

427
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,320
Forget it. I can’t afford it.

428
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,920
That community is nicknamed

429
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,560
Shanghai Investment Banking Backyard.

430
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,040
Most investment banking elites live there.

431
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,960
It‘ll be at least double the price .

432
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,690
Did you forget to sort by price?

433
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,280
So cheap?

434
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
Is it false advertising?

435
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,200
True or not,

436
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,400
let’s ask them.

437
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,360
Hello. Can I help you?

438
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,280
Hello. I’d like to ask you,

439
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,010
do you have an apartment to rent

440
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,610
in Longting Community?

441
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes.

442
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
I’d like to ask,

443
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,440
is it really 7,000 yuan a month?

444
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,480
Exactly.

445
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,360
Well, can we see the apartment tomorrow morning?

446
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,240
May I have your name?

447
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,410
My surname is Xu.

448
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Miss Xu. I’m sorry but

449
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,600
the apartment is already rented out.

450
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,240
My surname is Xu,

451
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
but I’m inquiring about it for my friend.

452
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,080
Her surname is Jiang.

453
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,480
Jiang?

454
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,370
Did you say someone has rented the apartment?

455
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,760
No, not yet.

456
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,800
That apartment is still available.

457
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,440
Does your friend’s phone number end with 3097?

458
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Yes, yes.

459
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,320
It’s exactly this number.

460
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,680
Shall we go to see the apartment

461
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,600
at 1 pm?

462
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,920
OK. Let's go this afternoon.

463
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,240
Thank you so much.

464
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Be quiet!

465
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,760
Boss. A little bird said

466
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Jiang Jun adopted a stray dog

467
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,880
at the playground.

468
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,480
She goes to feed it every day.

469
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
Once she has affections

470
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,960
with these kitties and doggies

471
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,200
and they’re gone someday,

472
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,680
she’ll cry her eyes out.

473
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,680
No.

474
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,300
I have to do something.

475
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,920
Wealth.

476
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,480
Wealth.

477
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,600
I... I’m getting you out.

478
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,520
Wealth. Don't be afraid.

479
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,840
Wealth.

480
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,640
Wealth.

481
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,880
Jiang Jun.

482
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,420
What are you doing?

483
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,000
What’s wrong?

484
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
It seems stuck in there.

485
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,100
Don’t move. Let me.

486
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,260
Come on.

487
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,480
Wealth.

488
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,320
Here.

489
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,060
Slowly.

490
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,040
Fine.

491
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,120
Come out.

492
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,440
Go.

493
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,120
Here.

494
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,360
It’s fine.

495
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,780
-Wealth.
-Wealth.

496
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,920
It's fine now.

497
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,060
Poor little thing.

498
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,920
Wealth.

499
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,410
Your hand...

500
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
You’re so clumsy.

501
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,640
How come you are here?

502
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
I heard you adopted a dog,

503
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
so I brought you a kennel.

504
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,410
You’re ridiculous.

505
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
People are everywhere here.

506
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,100
And there’s always a pool.

507
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,240
Why didn’t you

508
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,090
get a good place to keep the dog?

509
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,200
Here.

510
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,900
Be careful in the future. You hear me?

511
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
I know.

512
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Come, baby.

513
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,920
Wealth. Come.

514
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
You're naughty.

515
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,120
Are you happy?

516
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Are you?

517
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,520
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

518
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,040
The tenant you designated

519
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,120
has contacted me.

520
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,560
We’re gonna

521
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,960
see the apartment at 1 pm.

522
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Look, Wealth.

523
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,560
It’s odd.

524
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,120
It’s already 1 pm. Why hasn’t she come?

525
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,480
This apartment is particularly well-lit.

526
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,080
The geomantic layout is excellent as well.

527
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,600
If you rent this apartment,

528
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
your business will surely be great.

529
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,320
Who is that?

530
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,720
Are you satisfied with this apartment?

531
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,240
Jiang Jun. Obviously,

532
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
the layout is exactly what you want.

533
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,760
And the sofa,

534
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,560
it’s exactly the style you love.

535
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,040
It’s the first time that this apartment
is rented,

536
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,560
so all the furniture is brand new.

537
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,290
The lighting is superb as well.

538
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,120
Honestly,

539
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,200
this apartment is beyond my expectation.

540
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,000
And its rent is two or three thousand cheaper

541
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,240
than the surrounding ones.

542
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
Is there any special reason?

543
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,200
Is it haunted or something?

544
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,120
Haunted?

545
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,840
No way.

546
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,880
Let me tell you.

547
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,000
Since this apartment is posted on Internet,

548
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,720
clients have been inquiring about it.

549
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,520
The landlord doesn’t care about money.

550
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,160
The hygiene is his concern.

551
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,000
You perfectly match

552
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,320
his requirements.

553
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,880
So I brought you here to see the apartment.

What do you say?

555

Rent it.

556
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,160
Didn’t you say it’s Investment Banking Backyard?

557
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,020
Think about it.

In case that you could join MH

559
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,320

560
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,400
Ms. Jiang. If you sincerely want to rent it,

561
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,880
you can sign the contract today

562
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,200

And it is exactly today.

Seriously?

571
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,040
I’m going there now.

572
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,960
Excuse me. I’ll rent this apartment.

573
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,560
Talk with her about the contract.

574
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:21,840
OK.

575
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,520

Didn’t she rent it?

The copy of your friend's ID will do.

I’ll take you to do the formalities.

Mr. Lin. I’m here for you.

My name is Jiang Jun.

623
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,600
I attended the interview of
MH Investment Banking last week,

624
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,199
and got into the final round.

625

But due to

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,230
a personal feud,

627

I passed the interview

628
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,040
but still got rejected.

629
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,400
For me, MH is a company

630
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,960
that I have dreamed to join.

631
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't want any regrets.

632

I got no way to go,

633
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,280
so came to you rashly.

I’m in charge of Investment Banking.

Since the company's leadership decided it,

it’s not my place to interfere in it.

Ok . I'll give you an another chance

Tell me then.

651
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,880
Take this bookstore for example.

Should we invest in it?

653
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,520

659
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,000

is doing a public service,

661
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,760

He’s such a headache.

Look.

00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,360
He is groping again.

Look at him.

Philosophy?

850
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,080
A thing or two.

851
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,760
What?

852
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
The fundamental cause of a thing
is not external but internal.

853
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,000
Right?

854
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,120
Yes.

855
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,720
To prevent her from crying,

856
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,280
the fundamental way

857
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,570
is to strengthen her mental capacity.

858
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,960
When she gets tough,

859
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,920
she won’t cry anymore.

860
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,120
I did ask others to bully her.

861
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,400
The purpose is not

862
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,120
to make her cry,

863
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,200
but to strengthen her mental capacity.

864
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,800
I’m making things hard for her

so as to make her stronger.

866
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,680
I’m doing so

867
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,640
to make

868
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,400
every penny you paid me

869
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,960
worth it.

870
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,730
What you’re doing is right.

871
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,040
I misunderstood you.

872
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,920
Uncle

873
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,040
You haven’t paid me

874
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,400
last month’s salary.

875
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,160
You rascal.

876
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
Thank you, uncle.

877
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,020
Love is Sweet
