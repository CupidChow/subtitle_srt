1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,540
well

11
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,540
come

12
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,540
well

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,540
person

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,680
the

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,280
sister

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
no

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,080
no

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
if

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:46,680
Turns

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,940
Around

21
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,380
Episode crunchy

22
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,540
Being able to give you advice

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,020
to do things you don't think can end it,

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,880
all of this can help you build up results.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,080
And those other habits

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,860
are also just gli 이미 became a scam.

27
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,920
The thing is...

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,480
I still want you to be the sister,

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,620
because if you want to be

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,100
that kind of daughter from my heart,

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
I'm not your sister.

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,980
Can't you feel it?

33
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,780
All these years,

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,820
I've been by your side,

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,140
keeping you company and protecting you.

36
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,500
Everything I've done is for you.

37
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,820
In this world,

38
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,660
there's no one who loves you more than I do.

39
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,940
Don't reject me anymore, okay?

40
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,460
Don't be so cruel to me.

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
I'll do whatever you want.

42
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,260
I can change everything

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,620
if you don't like me.

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,180
I know I'm stubborn and domineering.

45
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,540
I can change everything for you.

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,020
As long as you don't leave me.

47
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
Don't leave me.

48
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,740
Sister.

49
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,340
I have someone I love.

50
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
She gave me hope to start over.

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,340
What hope?

52
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,260
Can't I give you the hope she gave you?

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
You can't.

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,700
's

55
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,460
Miss Du!

56
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,620
I want a piece of information.

57
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,820
Jin Yan!

58
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,860
What are you doing?

59
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,380
Look!

60
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,420
See?

61
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,220
Xiaochuan!

62
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,700
Xiaochuan!

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,660
Xiaochuan!

64
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,620
What's go wrong?

65
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,340
Xiaochuan!

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,820
Okay!

67
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,660
I'm afraid you won't be the top five among the characters today.

68
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,660
You're all black!

69
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,460
Stop!

70
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,140
Where's the phone?

71
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,580
What's wrong?

72
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,740
Come on!

73
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm not giving you the phone!

74
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,220
Give it to me!

75
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,540
Tell me,

76
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,300
what did you come for on the overnight business?

77
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,620
I just want to

78
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,060
do a review

79
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,420
to the only

80
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,300
100% match

81
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,260
in the western world.

82
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,180
But when I was about to knock,

83
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,820
I saw...

84
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,900
Stop talking.

85
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,220
Delete what you just filmed.

86
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,860
Delete it.

87
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,780
No.

88
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,460
Delete it.

89
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,140
You...

90
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,340
You want to do a review, right?

91
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,740
What do we need to do?

92
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
It's simple.

93
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,300
You just need to answer

94
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,420
some simple questions.

95
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,500
But

96
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,660
there's a condition.

97
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,020
You must try it.

98
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,780
You can't lie.

99
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,220
Can you, brother?

100
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,300
Delete it.

101
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:02,940
Okay.

102
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
Let's get started.

103
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,060
The first question.

104
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,620
Why did you two stop using

105
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,340
the software in the western world?

106
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,820
Wait.

107
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,900
You don't need to answer this.

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,180
Because you two

109
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,420
have successfully

110
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,260
made a relationship.

111
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,540
It proves that

112
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,660
my data is accurate.

113
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,100
Delete it.

114
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,340
The second question.

115
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,780
Okay.

116
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,340
The second question.

117
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,700
When did you two

118
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,740
start to like each other?

119
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,100
I don't know.

120
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,860
We just...

121
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,500
Just recently.

122
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,420
He's lying.

123
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,220
He's been liking me for more than ten years.

124
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,980
I...

125
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,100
How do you know?

126
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,420
I want to tell you a secret

127
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,420
before I leave.

128
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,780
A secret that only a stupid person

129
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,620
like you

130
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,420
doesn't know.

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,260
I've been loving you.

132
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,580
Sorry.

133
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,500
I accidentally opened your box.

134
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,140
What about you?

135
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,580
When did you

136
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,940
start to like me?

137
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,100
I...

138
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,780
Well...

139
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,300
Recently.

140
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,060
I don't know.

141
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,460
Okay.

142
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,340
The next question.

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,180
Did you two plan

144
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,980
to have a deeper

145
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,060
relationship

146
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,660
recently?

147
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,700
What do you mean?

148
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
You know,

149
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,660
they are going to

150
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,860
have a deep relationship.

151
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,740
They are going to...

152
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,460
Stop!

153
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,340
Don't ask anymore.

154
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,580
We're going to sleep.

155
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:55,620
You...

156
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,300
Get out.

157
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Shut up.

158
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,180
It's over.

159
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,260
Stop asking.

160
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,260
Get out.

161
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,220
Get out.

162
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,300
Give me some more time.

163
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,980
No more time.

164
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,660
Get out.

165
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,140
Get out now.

166
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Delete the video you took.

167
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,380
Did you hear me?

168
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,780
Delete it.

169
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,540
Get away.

170
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,260
I wooded it.

171
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,300
Bro.

172
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,020
Don't know what to do.

173
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,620
Just Steal it.

174
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,900
And I stay here

175
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,980
to take nahi.

176
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Do you want to know?

177
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,620
It's a bit small.

178
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Can you?

179
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't ever leave me again.

180
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,140
Why did you get out?

181
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
Nobody is allowed to run in the afternoon.

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,300
no matter what happens,

183
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,380
please bring Shframe back.

184
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,420
Morning.

185
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,540
I'm fine.

186
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm fine.

187
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,660
What about you?

188
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,660
I'm fine.

189
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,260
That's good.

190
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,500
Go and pack up.

191
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,900
I'll make breakfast.

192
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,780
Okay.

193
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,140
I'll go out later.

194
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,220
Okay.

195
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,780
Isn't it just a breakfast?

196
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,780
Why are you dressed...

197
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,340
dressed so formally?

198
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,860
This is the desire of women

199
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,380
for fashion quality.

200
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,380
You don't know.

201
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,940
Leave this to me.

202
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,940
You're making breakfast?

203
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,380
Okay.

204
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,420
Then I'll wait for you

205
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
to make my first breakfast.

206
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,380
Go ahead.

207
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,820
Across the ocean

208
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,020
You'll be waiting

209
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,780
A lighthouse

210
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,540
Shining out forever

211
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,860
Watch me fly so high

212
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,260
See how my colors paint the sky

213
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,340
었어요

214
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,500
I was gonna

215
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,580
make a pair of breakfasts for you.

216
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
I didn't expect to have to

217
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,300
be rustic with you.

218
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,660
Thank you, Xiaoyuan.

219
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,180
with me

220
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:04,820
How is it?

221
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,260
honest

222
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,300
This taste

223
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:09,540
still knows

224
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,620
a lot about you.

225
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,980
Obviously.

226
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,020
It'd be nice if you like it.

227
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,340
Have some.

228
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,020
Let's eat.

229
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,100
Then you should try

230
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,700
the milk I made for you.

231
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,100
How is it?

232
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
Does it taste good?

233
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,580
It's very soft.

234
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,740
Cheers.

235
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,540
Cheers.

236
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,180
I'll make you some every morning.

237
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,180
The most beautiful red...

238
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,620
The most beautiful red...

239
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,420
Good morning, Mr. Yuan.

240
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,980
Morning.

241
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,100
Morning.

242
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,300
Chen Yicheng.

243
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,940
Your suit is nice today.

244
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,020
It's pretty.

245
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,900
Especially the tie.

246
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,500
Look, it's classic.

247
00:15:59,460 --> 00:15:59,940
It's nice.

248
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,460
It's good for your diet.

249
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,540
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

250
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,100
Good morning, Mr. Yuan.

251
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
Shen Xing, look at you.

252
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,260
Why is the lip color so nice?

253
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:08,940
Is it new?

254
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,900
I just bought it.

255
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,140
It's so pretty.

256
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,740
It suits you.

257
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,340
Really?

258
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,460
Keep on showing off.

259
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,740
Okay.

260
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,180
Jiang Jun.

261
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,860
Good morning, Mr. Yuan.

262
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,820
You look good.

263
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,500
You must have a good sleep last night.

264
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,580
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

265
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,860
You slept very well.

266
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,580
I'll sleep well tonight.

267
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,580
So sweet.

268
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,260
The air is so fresh today.

269
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,540
It's a perfect day.

270
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,180
Boss.

271
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,980
The new materials for the class

272
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,020
need you to sign.

273
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,420
Okay.

274
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,380
And one more thing.

275
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,900
You know that Xinxin is back.

276
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
I want to ask for a leave

277
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,180
to spend more time with her.

278
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,380
That's a good thing.

279
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Spend more time with her.

280
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,460
Okay.

281
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,220
Okay.

282
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,060
Okay.

283
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,740
Okay.

284
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,500
Okay.

285
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,660
Spend more time with her.

286
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,700
Boss.

287
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,500
I want a year off.

288
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,380
How about you?

289
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,300
I'll ask for a leave later.

290
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,940
Go ahead.

291
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,500
You'll have fun.

292
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,180
Oh my god.

293
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,460
Is he still Yuan Shuai?

294
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,100
I'm not

295
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,380
a flower that blooms every year.

296
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,140
I told you.

297
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,100
We've been together for so many days.

298
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,260
Nothing

299
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,020
could happen to him.

300
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,700
You brat.

301
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,980
I didn't say anything.

302
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,740
You guessed it.

303
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,860
Boss.

304
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,620
Am I a god this time?

305
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,540
You have to pay me back.

306
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,740
Su Chang.

307
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,540
Do you want to get a year off?

308
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,660
Is the room in 701 comfortable?

309
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,540
I have Xinxin's phone number.

310
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,140
Boss.

311
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,020
Boss.

312
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,300
I forget you're at your bending.

313
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,980
There'll be a meeting later.

314
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,700
I know.

315
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,220
I'm leaving.

316
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,380
F Miranda

317
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,700
You look happy today.

318
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,660
Can you share a cheers with me?

319
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,260
Not that.

320
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,460
I'm just in a good mood.

321
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,060
Just forget it.

322
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,180
You're so petty.

323
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,300
Mr. Yuan.

324
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,100
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

325
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,100
Hello.

326
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,220
Mr. Yuan.

327
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,020
Jiang Jun.

328
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,980
You can soak it for me.

329
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,140
This one.

330
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,420
Thank you.

331
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Jiang Jun's is the best.

332
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,940
Brother.

333
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,060
Drink more.

334
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,140
Jiang Jun's is the best.

335
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,980
You can drink more.

336
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,020
Jiang Jun.

337
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,060
When the meeting is over,

338
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,780
you can make tea for all the colleagues

339
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,020
in the company.

340
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,540
The weather is easy to get hot these days.

341
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,300
You can drink it.

342
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,420
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

343
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,180
Make tea.

344
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,780
Tea.

345
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,820
Okay.

346
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,380
Okay.

347
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,180
You can make tea.

348
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,900
Okay.

349
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,380
Mr. Qiao.

350
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,220
Mr. Yuan.

351
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,540
Okay.

352
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,540
Now that everyone is here,

353
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,540
let's start the report.

354
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,460
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

355
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,460
Now I'll tell you

356
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,740
the starting point of the company's

357
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
IPO.

358
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
It's going to conduct

359
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,620
a very intensive market survey.

360
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,260
In 2003,

361
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,260
it has made

362
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,100
3 billion dollars.

363
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,980
Its first-generation IPO

364
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,420
has grown by more than 10%.

365
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,820
In the second and third-generation,

366
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,220
it will increase to 2,152 billion dollars.

367
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,300
Then,

368
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,460
Wanxing Group

369
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,700
is the largest online music development platform

370
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,020
in the entertainment group.

371
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,420
Its current users

372
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,700
have reached 5.79 billion.

373
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,460
This is one of them.

374
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,500
In short,

375
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,900
the company has put a lot of effort

376
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,980
into Wanxing Entertainment.

377
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,020
I believe we can

378
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,340
complete the task well.

379
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,300
Okay.

380
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,820
Everyone has done a good job.

381
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,900
The other day,

382
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,220
we didn't just let everyone dig up

383
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,940
the new customers of the IPO and the financing business.

384
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,180
Remember to hand over

385
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,260
the information and list you found.

386
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,260
Okay.

387
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,700
Dismiss.

388
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,580
I don't know why

389
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,740
I feel so depressed

390
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,660
sitting next to Mr. Qiao.

391
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Why did you mention him?

392
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,140
You don't understand

393
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,380
the first instinct of a woman.

394
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,100
To be honest,

395
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,540
Mr. Yuan looked at me

396
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,140
and I felt a little bit scary.

397
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,780
I think they are

398
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,980
a little bit different.

399
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,980
They are different.

400
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,900
They are different.

401
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,900
They are different.

402
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,900
They are different.

403
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,780
They are different.

404
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,700
They are different.

405
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,700
They are different.

406
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,660
They are different.

407
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,700
They are different.

408
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
I think they are a little bit strange.

409
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,540
Luckily, I got along with Mr. Yuan

410
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,460
in time.

411
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,860
Otherwise, I guess

412
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,060
my report will be approved next year.

413
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,380
Is it because the senior management is going to shake?

414
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,700
Not really.

415
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,020
I think it's just

416
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,540
a simple emotional impact.

417
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,900
Absolutely not.

418
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,220
It's not that simple.

419
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,420
Dr. Chen.

420
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,780
Call your report

421
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,740
to my office later.

422
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,860
I'll sort it out

423
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
and send it to you later.

424
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,900
It's hard to choose from

425
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,460
any superior performance in life.

426
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,500
won't die

427
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,780
are the two biggest

428
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
expensive ones in life.

429
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,100
This might be the day

430
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,340
I still chooseping something different.

431
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,700
Not necessary, not necessary.

432
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,420
It's time to

433
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,140
have youれて in our uniform.

434
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,540
Come in.

435
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,660
Mr. Yuan, this document needs you to sign.

436
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,860
Why are you looking at me?

437
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,300
What do you want?

438
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,980
Signed.

439
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,540
Stop looking. You can see it.

440
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,340
I think in the future,

441
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,900
don't be afraid.

442
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,380
In the future,

443
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:38,200
I may

444
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,660
get you married soon.

445
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,780
We all will be great.

446
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,780
I can do it.

447
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,780
I can do it.

448
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,820
When?

449
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,660
When?

450
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,340
Agricultural Hot Chaps

451
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,620
disintegrating

452
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:03,080
So many huge

453
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,260
Listen

454
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,500
planetary

455
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,060
스타일

456
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,140
era

457
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,540
Damit

458
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,060
control

459
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,360
Thus 그것 dig Golden Lily

460
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,180
Yi Yi

461
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,060
Let's go home tonight

462
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,300
I wanted to leave, you still need to pretend

463
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,520
My apologies, Please

464
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,580
You look very good today

465
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,060
You look radiant

466
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,060
you changed clothes

467
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,060
and changed to a new perfume.

468
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,060
What?

469
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Are you in love?

470
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,060
Since your boyfriend chose the girl we're going to invest in,

471
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,060
we need to let him understand our working status.

472
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,060
I've read the new materials you submitted.

473
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,060
I think it's pretty good.

474
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,060
But there are a few companies that need to do a thorough investigation.

475
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
How about this?

476
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,060
You work overtime tonight

477
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
and sort out all the information for me.

478
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,060
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

479
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,060
Is that okay?

480
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
What?

481
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
Is there anything else to do tonight?

482
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
No.

483
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Okay, Mr. Qiao. I'll do my best.

484
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
Hi, Mr. 100%.

485
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
You can leave first tonight.

486
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,060
I'm going to stay and work overtime.

487
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
Do you want me to stay and accompany you?

488
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,060
No need.

489
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,060
I can still do this little thing.

490
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
Okay.

491
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
Then go home early.

492
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,060
Miss 100%.

493
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
I'll do my best.

494
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Mr. 100%.

495
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,060
I'll go.

496
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,060
You're not reading the road? You're so reckless.

497
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,060
You haven't finished sorting out?

498
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
You scared me.

499
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
According to your sorting speed,

500
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,060
I think after you're done sorting out,

501
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,060
these companies will be listed.

502
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Didn't I tell you to go home first?

503
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,060
I'm worried that someone can't complete the job and drag me down.

504
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Will I have to stay home alone when I go back?

505
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
No one.

506
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Hey, hey, hey!

507
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
Someone's here!

508
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,060
No one.

509
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
Okay.

510
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,060
Then wait for me for a while.

511
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
I'll be done soon.

512
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Go home first.

513
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
I'll help you when you get home.

514
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
I promise you'll complete the job.

515
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,060
No, I have to do this myself.

516
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
What a rare experience.

517
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
Get up.

518
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
You're disturbing my work.

519
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
I'm not doing this.

520
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,060
I'm just doing it for fun.

521
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,060
I'm done with work.

522
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
I'm not getting up.

523
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
Get up.

524
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
No.

525
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,060
Okay, I'll let you go.

526
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Let's go home.

527
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
Qiao,

528
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
why are you back?

529
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
I went to the meeting room to get the materials.

530
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
Just yourself?

531
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
Yes.

532
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,060
I did some stretching yesterday.

533
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
My arms are stiff.

534
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
What happened to your mouth?

535
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,060
Your lipstick is all ruined.

536
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
Well,

537
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,060
I just had a delivery.

538
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,060
It was very spicy.

539
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,060
It was too spicy.

540
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,060
I'm sorry.

541
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,060
I'm sorry.

542
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
It was too spicy.

543
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,060
It was too spicy.

544
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,060
I said,

545
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
once you get into the company,

546
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,060
don't eat

547
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
such a heavy food in the company.

548
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
I know, Qiao.

549
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
Before you leave,

550
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
remember to supplement the lunch.

551
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
Don't force the company's image.

552
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Okay.

553
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
Qiao, take care.

554
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,060
Come out.

555
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
I'm leaving.

556
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
I'm leaving.

557
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,060
Good for you, Jiang Jun.

558
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,060
I'm a man of my word.

559
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,060
But you pushed me down.

560
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
You want to kick me?

561
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,060
Don't take it for me.

563
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Okay?

564
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,060
Are you teasing me?

565
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
I'm teasing you.

566
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm teasing you.

567
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
There's tea for two.

568
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,060
Honey and ice cream now.

569
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Don't go far.

570
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,060
You're so sweet.

571
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Love so beautiful.

572
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
I don't want to hurt you.

573
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,060
But I'm sorry.

574
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
Tian Jingzhi.

575
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,060
I'm sorry.

577
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
I'm sorry.

578
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,060
I'm sorry.

579
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
I'm sorry.

580
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
I'm sorry.

581
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,060
I'm sorry.

582
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
I'm so sorry.

583
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,460
But I'm really sorry.

585
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,700
I already have someone I like.

586
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,220
What isn't the light?

587
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,500
Isn't the Brendan now?

588
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
What's up?

589
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,300
What's up?

590
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,940
Good evening.

591
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,740
Go to sleep already.

592
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,660
Okay.

593
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,740
Besides,

594
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,300
his manner of 9thid is very bad.

595
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,300
I have discovered

596
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
his features.

597
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,060
But I don't keep it top secret.

598
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
Sir,

599
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,420
do Gao Bin have a one-ball?

600
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,060
headache now.

601
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,420
I'm calling you for help.

602
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,500
Before I expertly

603
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,860
arrange all 9 blocks,

604
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,660
I ordered people to

605
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,700
take one block

606
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,020
to square it equally.

607
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,740
What if they were to

608
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,320
put me in a soreness case?

609
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,780
I'm so unlucky.

610
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,940
But

611
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,900
I'm sorry.

612
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,500
Well,

613
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,340
he's not feeling well today.

614
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:48,940
So I want to

615
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,220
help him sit on the sofa.

616
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,300
He's not feeling well.

617
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,740
If he's not feeling well,

618
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,140
just use your mouth to help him.

619
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,500
Actually, I'm...

620
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm...

621
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,340
Shut up!

622
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,780
Did I ask you to talk?

623
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,740
No.

624
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,540
How do they know each other?

625
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,780
Wu Water is already put in the water purifier.

626
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,060
Try another round.

627
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,900
Stay still, stay still.

628
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,740
Ou regist time for my electronic report.

629
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,340
Okay.

630
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,980
You won't need to wait.

631
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,820
Stay still.

632
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,460
I have an idea.

633
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:36,980
I'll go prepare the meal.

634
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,620
Meals for me.

635
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,560
But this one is quite reais.

636
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,820
Then we will have to cancel it.

637
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,900
We can't cancel it again.

638
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,320
Come on.

639
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,540
Let's go.

640
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,320
Let me.

641
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,640
These are the Prize Awards.

642
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,700
If we have more than 100 cases.

643
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,620
Oh, I know that.

644
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,580
Really?

645
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,200
Wait.

646
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:20,240
You just said graduating handsome and Junjun together?

647
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,340
What...

648
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,260
Yuan Yuan.

649
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,020
What happened?

650
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,340
Don't move?

651
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,100
Tell me.

652
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,900
When did you start to like this big blind man?

653
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,540
Who is the big blind man?

654
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,820
The client is still here.

655
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,700
Can't you

656
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,140
pay attention to your own words?

657
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,500
Did I ask you to open your mouth?

658
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,300
Bye.

659
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,020
We actually

660
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,700
only communicate recently.

661
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,220
Communicate?

662
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,660
You've been thinking about him?

663
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,260
No.

664
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,940
I, a womanizer, don't agree.

665
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,180
It's so delicious.

666
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,180
Uncle Yuan,

667
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Uncle Yuan,

668
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,300
tell me.

669
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,420
He's good at everything,

670
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,180
in his career,

671
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:40,940
in his study,

672
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,020
in his family,

673
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,020
and he's a good boss.

674
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,140
He has such a good cooking skill.

675
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,860
Junjun,

676
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:50,860
it's so delicious.

677
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,780
I remember someone said

678
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,700
I'm a big blind man.

679
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,460
Really?

680
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,380
Who has such a bad taste?

681
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,420
It's really...

682
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,700
How could our Uncle Yuan

683
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,180
be a big blind man?

684
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,140
We're all brothers in college.

685
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,340
I love you.

686
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,180
Come on.

687
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,420
Have some soup.

688
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,540
It's very salty.

689
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,700
Thank you.

690
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,540
Have some.

691
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,980
Right.

692
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,260
You're still

693
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,500
my cousin.

694
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,140
You're indeed a good brother.

695
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,300
It's such a perfect match.

696
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,380
But if Junjun

697
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,900
says you're a little weird,

698
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,900
and you're hard to deal with,

699
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,620
then...

700
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,020
I'll definitely

701
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,380
be your couple for a long time.

702
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,940
Weird, hard to deal with, hard to listen to.

703
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,180
Let's eat.

704
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,140
Let's eat.

705
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,540
But...

706
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,140
But you're also...

707
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,500
You two are together.

708
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,700
Why are you hiding it from me?

709
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,540
Right?

710
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,580
I'm just trying to help you.

711
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,220
You should say something.

712
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,820
Let's eat.

713
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,740
Let's eat.

714
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,940
Eat more.

715
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,180
Eat more if it's delicious.

716
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,700
This soup is so delicious.

717
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,340
Next time, I'll definitely

718
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,220
make a big bowl of rice

719
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,420
for our Xiaochun.

720
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,420
Whatever.

721
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,740
Tell me what you want to eat.

722
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:11,980
I'll cook for you.

723
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,140
Don't worry.

724
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,060
Junjun's is my home.

725
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,020
I won't be so polite.

726
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,740
Okay.

727
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,620
I'm full.

728
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,260
I won't

729
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,820
be your single partner.

730
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,340
You two should enjoy

731
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,020
your time together.

732
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,460
No.

733
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,460
You're full?

734
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,260
You're leaving?

735
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,220
Thank you.

736
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,140
You're leaving?

737
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,180
See you.

738
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,900
Bye.

739
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,140
Wipe your mouth.

740
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,300
Okay.

741
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,180
Bye, Xiaochun.

742
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,860
Bye.

743
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,820
Be safe.

744
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,780
Okay.

745
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,060
I'm full.

746
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,620
It's delicious.

747
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,220
It's my turn now.

748
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
What did you say?

749
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,900
What did you say?

750
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,180
Hmm?

751
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,020
Okay.

752
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,180
Is it really 100%

753
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,100
that we can be together?

754
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:29,980
Well,

755
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,860
yeah,

756
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
be patient.

757
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,380
Be patient, be patient.

758
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,220
Xiaochun,

759
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,740
Entry no.2,

760
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,060
That's set.

761
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,540
That's set.

762
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:52,980
Here,

763
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,620
see.

764
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,900
I'm leaving.

765
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
I'm so good.

766
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
How could I not deserve Di Xiaochuan?

767
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,260
It's just some software values.

768
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,340
I can definitely make it through my efforts

769
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,540
to make me, a one-percent girl,

770
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,820
reach a hundred percent.

771
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,580
Come on!

772
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,860
A one-percent girl

773
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,380
can also be a man.

774
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
I'm so happy!

775
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
I'm so happy!

776
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,220
Mr. Qiao.

777
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,780
Mr. Fan wants you to go to his office.

778
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,940
Mr. Fan.

779
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
Look at this first.

780
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,780
Is there anything

781
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,420
that Mr. Qiao is not satisfied with?

782
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:07,940
Mr. Yuan,

783
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,060
is this how you manage your subordinates?

784
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,540
You've been controlling

785
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,060
the financing plan of Yuan Yang Group.

786
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,660
How could you

787
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,980
have such a situation now?

788
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,540
We're in the same boat

789
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,860
dealing with numbers.

790
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,380
We're far from being a good person.

791
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,820
Why did Mr. Qiao

792
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,780
call his client

793
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,780
without a trial?

794
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,060
Now, the client

795
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,500
has already worked

796
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,460
according to this plan.

797
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,260
And there's been a serious mistake.

798
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,260
Tell me,

799
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,980
how should I

800
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
bear this loss?

801
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,900
I have an unfeasible responsibility

802
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,820
for this matter.

803
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,460
I'll go to the client

804
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,740
with Mr. Qiao later

805
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,140
to apologize.

806
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,540
And I'll give them

807
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,140
a new financing plan.

808
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,420
A new plan?

809
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,540
You're so easy to say.

810
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,860
First,

811
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,580
the time of the financing plan

812
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,500
has been announced.

813
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,060
Second,

814
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,340
the financing plan

815
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
has been announced

816
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,220
and it's impossible

817
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,180
to use this plan again.

818
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,860
Third,

819
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,340
a new plan

820
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,220
will take at least a week.

821
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,540
Then tell me,

822
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,420
how should I explain to the client?

823
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,380
I'll explain it to him.

824
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,780
I'm sorry, Mr. Qiao.

825
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,060
This matter

826
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,740
is indeed

827
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,140
related to Mr. Yuan

828
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,260
due to my personal failure.

829
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,380
I'm willing to resign.

830
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,780
I'm willing to bear

831
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,300
the loss of the company and the client.

832
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,340
How can you bear it?

833
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
Stop it, Qiao Na.

834
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,460
Mr. Qiao,

835
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,860
as Mr. Qiao's boss,

836
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,820
this is also

837
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,900
a mistake in my management.

838
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,060
I promise you

839
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,540
I'll give them

840
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,460
a new financing plan

841
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,460
within 24 hours.

842
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,300
Please rest assured.

843
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,620
If there are

844
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,260
any more mistakes,

845
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,180
Mr. Qiao and I

846
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,900
will leave MH together.

847
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
24 hours.

848
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,620
24 hours.

849
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,020
Okay.

850
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,180
You're giving me

851
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,380
a military medal, right?

852
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,420
Okay.

853
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,700
Tomorrow,

854
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,340
I'll wait for your new plan.

855
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,980
If the client is not satisfied,

856
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,620
you two

857
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,380
will clear the office.

858
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,700
I think I'm blind

859
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,700
Don't know how to feel

860
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,700
Don't know how to heal

861
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,700
You walk so fast

862
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Can't catch your light

863
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,700
You fly so high

864
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,700
Leave all the things behind

865
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,700
And our story

866
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,700
Leave all love nowhere to find

867
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,700
I think I'm tied

868
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,700
I think I'm blind

869
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,700
Don't know how to feel

870
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,700
Don't know how to heal

871
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,700
You walk so fast

872
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,700
Can't catch your light

873
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,700
You fly so high

874
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,700
Leave all the things behind

875
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,700
And our story

876
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Leave all love nowhere to find

877
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,700
I think I'm blind

878
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,700
Don't know how to feel

879
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Don't know how to feel

880
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,700
Don't know how to feel

881
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Don't know how to feel

882
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,700
Don't know how to feel
