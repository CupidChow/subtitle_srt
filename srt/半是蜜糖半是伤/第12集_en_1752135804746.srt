1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,640
little bit in the

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,640
sink

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,140
in the

13
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,640
sink

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,020
in the

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,640
sink

16
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,140
sink

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,140
To love To heal

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,140
Episode 05

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,140
You're a newbie.

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,140
You don't have to come over to thank me.

21
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
But,

22
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,140
after you got the job,

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,140
you're also responsible for Wanxin Entertainment.

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,140
As your leader,

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,140
I still want to give you a friendly reminder.

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
I'll do it.

27
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,140
Look carefully.

28
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,140
I have already told you to stay away from that Mr. Du.

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,140
Du Lei,

30
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,140
his goal has always been me behind you.

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,140
He and Wan Shan, that old fox,

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,140
are a team.

33
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,140
Tang Xin retreated because of him.

34
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,140
Jiang Jun,

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,140
you have to understand one thing.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,140
There has never been an idiot lunch in the world.

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,140
There has never been a teacher who is a fool.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,140
Really?

39
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,140
Then, is there a house that is free of charge in this world?

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,140
What house?

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,140
Mr. Landlord,

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
you are really considerate.

43
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
No, Jiang Jun,

44
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,140
don't misunderstand.

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,140
I actually think

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,140
it was too much to let you enter the M&H.

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
So,

48
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,140
we have been friends for so many years, right?

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,140
I hope you can have a good living environment

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,140
to make up for your

51
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,140
unemployment.

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,140
I have no other thoughts.

53
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Make up for?

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,140
You raised my house price and made me go nowhere.

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,140
You let me live in the house you arranged.

56
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
You told me to make up for it.

57
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,140
You might as well say that you are used to

58
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,140
being a playboy in other people's lives.

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,140
You think it's funny to see me moving in and out by myself, right?

60
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,140
Yes.

61
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,140
Is that what you think?

62
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
Isn't my house

63
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,140
a hundred times better than the one you lived in before?

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
You are a liar!

65
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,140
I don't want to live in a liar's house.

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,140
I will move out tonight.

67
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,140
You moved so much stuff over here.

68
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,140
Do you want to live here forever?

69
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,140
What? You are not going to let me live here?

70
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
Don't worry.

71
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,140
I have already asked Zhou Jie to find a house.

72
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
Find a house?

73
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,140
Do you think it's easy to find a house now?

74
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,140
Last time, Yuan Shuai and Xiaochuan

75
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
talked happily.

76
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,140
I thought he had changed his school rules.

77
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,140
I didn't expect him to bully you again.

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,140
You are a family.

79
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
Why is there such a big difference?

80
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
He won't bully our Xiaochuan, right?

81
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
Junjuan,

82
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,140
I think you can ask Yuan Shuai to help me.

83
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Are you going to listen to me?

84
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
No.

85
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
I started to read novels recently.

86
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,140
In their comments, they all said

87
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,140
that my anti-corruption is too much.

88
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,140
I think I can ask Yuan Shuai

89
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,140
to interview him.

90
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Let him tell me about

91
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,140
the story of bullying you.

92
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Oh my god.

93
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,140
For more than ten years,

94
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,140
he has been bullying you alone.

95
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,140
Such a persistent anti-corruption

96
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,140
was actually encountered by me.

97
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,140
I think I can write it well

98
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
into my novel

99
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,140
and make it popular.

100
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,140
General.

101
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
Brother Yuan Yuan.

102
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,140
General, jump down.

103
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,140
I'm scared.

104
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,140
It's okay.

105
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,140
Jump down.

106
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm scared.

107
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,140
Don't be afraid.

108
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Believe me.

109
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,140
I will help you.

110
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
I will help you.

111
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,140
Come on.

112
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Come down.

113
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
Brother Yuan Yuan.

114
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,140
I'm going to jump.

115
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
You have to help me.

116
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Come on.

117
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
Ready.

118
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
One.

119
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Two.

120
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Three.

121
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Jump.

122
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
You fell down, right?

123
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,140
You deserve it.

124
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
You said you would help me.

125
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,140
You lied.

126
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
I just want to teach you

127
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,140
not to believe what men say easily.

128
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,140
So cruel.

129
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,140
But I still think it's unreasonable.

130
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,140
What's unreasonable?

131
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,140
You lied to me to rent a house.

132
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Or you lied to me to get a house.

133
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
I don't think it's reasonable.

134
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,140
I think it's unreasonable.

135
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,140
I think

136
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
Yuan Shuai may think

137
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,140
you are a little bit short.

138
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,140
Anyway, you have already entered the company.

139
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
At least

140
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
you can live better.

141
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Listen to your sister.

142
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,140
You are a little bit short.

143
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,140
Stop your

144
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,140
shameless pity.

145
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
This kind of black and white man

146
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,140
will not have a contrast.

147
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,140
And there is no stupid

148
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
talent in the world.

149
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
It's really sweet

150
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
and hurtful.

151
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
Oh, my god.

152
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140
What's wrong?

153
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
This question is so boring.

154
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
Tell me.

155
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,140
Why does she

156
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,140
think I'm playing with her?

157
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,140
No.

158
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
What on earth did you do to her?

159
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
She

160
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
knows I'm her landlord.

161
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
This is the reason

162
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
why you come here

163
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,140
to drink at night.

164
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
I mean, are you serious?

165
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
Do you think

166
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
you can get her

167
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,140
around you

168
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
and she will react?

169
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
You like her.

170
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Shouldn't it be like this?

171
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
Naive.

172
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
I mean...

173
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
For other girls,

174
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
they might think so.

175
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,140
But for you,

176
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
no.

177
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
You

178
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
used to bully her.

179
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
I heard you were

180
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
so sad.

181
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
Unless she has

182
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Sdg.

183
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,140
Otherwise,

184
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
she will not think

185
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
a super villain

186
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,140
in her life

187
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
will like her.

188
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
Then you tell me.

189
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
Will she like me?

190
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Do you think

191
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Lan Jin Ling will like

192
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
Ge Ge Wu?

193
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
I'm going home

194
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
to pack my luggage.

195
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,140
You should thank me

196
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
for the earliest

197
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,140
delivery tomorrow.

198
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,140
I'm leaving now.

199
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,140
I'm going out.

200
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Boss.

201
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,140
Boss.

202
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Xiao Ni.

203
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,140
I have a document

204
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
to sign with Mr. Yuan.

205
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Is he coming?

206
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Mr. Yuan is on a business trip

207
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
to Beijing.

208
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Your document is very important.

209
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
It's okay.

210
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,140
No hurry.

211
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
Hello.

212
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
Are you free?

213
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
I'm near your company.

214
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
Can I meet you?

215
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Well...

216
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,140
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,140
I have a document to sort out.

218
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,140
I quit my job at Ji Yi.

219
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,140
Okay.

220
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
Why did you resign?

221
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
I met Yuan Shuai.

222
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,140
He suspected that

223
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
I was using you

224
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,140
for Wan Xin's business.

225
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
And you know

226
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
I knew Wan Shan

227
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,140
and I was afraid you would misunderstand.

228
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
So I resigned.

229
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
You resigned because of this?

230
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Actually,

231
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,140
I didn't...

232
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Ji Yi

233
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,140
has been very concerned

234
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
about this project.

235
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,140
And Wan Shan and my father

236
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,140
are old acquaintances.

237
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,140
They have been looking for me many times.

238
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
But I went to find them.

239
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Then why didn't you just say it?

240
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
After all,

241
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
our company has a competitive relationship.

242
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Besides,

243
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,140
we have promised each other

244
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
that we will not interfere with each other's work.

245
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Yuan.

246
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,140
It's okay.

247
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,140
It doesn't matter.

248
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,140
To be honest,

249
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
I'm quite relaxed now.

250
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
I have helped others

251
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
for so long.

252
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Finally, I have a chance

253
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
to do what I want to do.

254
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
What are you going to do in the future?

255
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
I haven't thought about it completely.

256
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,140
I will be a speech therapist

257
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
in some financial training classes.

258
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I may develop in this field in the future.

259
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,140
Maybe.

260
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
Then you won't be

261
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
my teacher anymore.

262
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,140
Four seven

263
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
four eight

264
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,140
four nine

265
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
four nine

266
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Why don't you get off work?

267
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
What are you counting?

268
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,140
If I pass fifty people,

269
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,140
my love hasn't come yet.

270
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,140
I will get off work.

271
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
Then your love

272
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
is too magical.

273
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,140
I'm going to go now.

274
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
I'm going to go now.

275
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
Did I use too much strength

276
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,140
to get off work?

277
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,140
It's been less than a week.

278
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
The network signal is also very good.

279
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Is it

280
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,140
faster than our network speed?

281
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Xu Li.

282
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
There is a delivery order.

283
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Can you please

284
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
send it to me when you go back?

285
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
Okay.

286
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
Thank you.

287
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
You're welcome.

288
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Ren Shuai.

289
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,140
You're a bad guy.

290
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,140
You ordered so many things.

291
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,140
I will kill you.

292
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I will kill you.

293
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
I will kill you.

294
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,140
You're a bad guy.

295
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,140
I...

296
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
I...

297
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
No.

298
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Why are you

299
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
here?

300
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,140
My cousin is on a business trip.

301
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,140
He asked me to help him raise a dog.

302
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
So...

303
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
On a business trip?

304
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
You want to raise a dog for him?

305
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
Then

306
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
you're home alone.

307
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,140
He's so cute.

308
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
What does he mean?

309
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Fang Cai.

310
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
Fang Cai.

311
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
Fang Cai.

312
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
Well...

313
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
I...

314
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Well...

315
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
You bought a lot of vegetarian food.

316
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,140
Are you not going out?

317
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
These are very important

318
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,140
to me.

319
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
Because I'm running

320
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,140
the last test.

321
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
So I'm very busy recently.

322
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
But a dog

323
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,140
needs exercise.

324
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Yes.

325
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
It's a good idea to let him exercise.

326
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Fang Cai.

327
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
Let's go.

328
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,140
So this is what you said

329
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,140
to let him exercise?

330
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,140
Does he eat dog food?

331
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
He eats it every day.

332
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,140
This is what

333
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,140
my cousin told me.

334
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
You're so sweet.

335
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
But actually,

336
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
a dog needs...

337
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
What?

338
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
It's a dog.

339
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
It's going to the bathroom?

340
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,140
Xi Ya, you're so busy.

341
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
How about

342
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
I help you raise a dog?

343
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Okay.

344
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Thank you.

345
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
It's the first time

346
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
it's thanked me.

347
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
I'm so happy.

348
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Then...

349
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,140
I'll...

350
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
I'll help you raise a dog.

351
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Fang Cai, let's go.

352
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Where's the rope?

353
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
Over there.

354
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
Fang Cai, come here.

355
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,140
We're leaving.

356
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,140
Fang Cai.

357
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
Come on.

358
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Fang Cai.

359
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,140
I lost a hair!

360
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,140
You lost a hair?

361
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
I'll leave now.

362
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Back to work, okay?

363
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,780
Bye

364
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,420
I'm leaving

365
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,340
Bye

366
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
You're going to drive a night car again, right?

367
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,100
Here

368
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,380
I bought it for you

369
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,340
Take care of your health

370
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,420
Thank you

371
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,140
You're welcome

372
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,460
Help me turn off the light when you leave

373
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,340
Okay, bye

374
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,140
Bye

375
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,860
I'm leaving

376
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,460
This is the financial report and the account of Hu Di Group

377
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,500
Within two days

378
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,580
a complete asset evaluation report will be issued

379
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,420
Am I doing it alone?

380
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,580
Or I'll do it with you

381
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,100
Okay, Mr. Ma

382
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,780
Bye

383
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,620
Are you still fighting?

384
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,780
You're really good at it

385
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,700
Don't sit down all the time

386
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,140
It's useful to stand up and do a jump

387
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,420
Hello

388
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,300
Can you order?

389
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,900
I didn't order

390
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,540
General, right?

391
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,140
This is yours

392
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,340
Five thousand good comments

393
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,980
Thank you

394
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,580
Did you receive the business dog food?

395
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,180
I received the business dog food

396
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,020
Thank you for your vote

397
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,100
I can't finish my work

398
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,340
I'll go home after eating

399
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,940
I'll just pass by

400
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,140
I'll go to the restaurant

401
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,380
I'll just pass by

402
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,220
I'll go home

403
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,660
Go home

404
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,180
I don't have a home to go back to

405
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,020
Don't bother

406
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,260
I have a lot of things to do

407
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,860
I'll stay in the company today

408
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,180
Don't worry, it's safe

409
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,700
Brother, how did you shoot this car?

410
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm really sorry

411
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,260
I was in a hurry

412
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,060
I didn't notice

413
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,540
Look at you

414
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,740
You've knocked down the pole

415
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,540
Brother, you

416
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,300
Let's talk privately

417
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,020
Brother, can you?

418
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,940
Or you can drive

419
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,660
Okay?

420
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,540
Brother, this

421
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,380
I've already taken it

422
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,300
Can't I pay the full price?

423
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,260
You don't have to worry about me

424
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,180
I'm shooting Liu Gening

425
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,980
You two continue

426
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,780
I'm leaving

427
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,900
I'll go home

428
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,860
I'll get back to work

429
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm leaving

430
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,380
I'll go home

431
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,500
I'm leaving

432
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,300
I'll go home

433
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,180
I'll go home

434
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,220
You two continue

435
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,340
Okay, boss

436
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,700
What do you say?

437
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm being chased

438
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,660
Like

439
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,420
Why is it a like?

440
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,580
I'm in a car accident

441
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,420
Liar

442
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,620
What does it have to do with me?

443
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,540
I'm not a liar

444
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm not a liar

445
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,700
I'm not a liar

446
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,660
I'm not a liar

447
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,700
I'm not a liar

448
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,820
I'm not a liar

449
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,860
What's the matter with me?

450
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,260
No

451
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,500
You don't even give me a like

452
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,260
So petty

453
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,500
What do you mean, General?

454
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,500
I'll answer the phone

455
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,340
You see how much you are

456
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,100
Hello

457
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,860
Baby, are you asleep?

458
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,940
I'm working overtime

459
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,260
I have good news for you

460
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,580
I can go back to China in the last semester

461
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,260
We don't have to live separately

462
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,780
Really?

463
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,420
That's great

464
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,620
I'll pick you up later

465
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,340
Are you done?

466
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,020
You're in a hurry to go to work

467
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,100
Baby, I'm sorry

468
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,820
Boss is urging me

469
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,620
I'm hanging up

470
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,340
If you keep doing this

471
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,500
Don't take the year-end award

472
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,940
during your working hours

473
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,300
Boss, I didn't take the year-end award

474
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,500
I have a call

475
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,540
He's going abroad to study

476
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,500
and will be back soon

477
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,900
Are you trying to irritate me?

478
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,700
No

479
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,300
I want to tell you

480
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,900
We are childhood friends

481
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,180
We have been together for many years

482
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,300
We never broke up

483
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,540
There is a trick in it

484
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,620
Trick

485
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,740
No

486
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,340
I had a car accident

487
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,300
I sent a friend a car

488
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,020
She gave me a like

489
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,980
What does she mean?

490
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,860
Boss

491
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,540
I think

492
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,660
you need a sincere apology

493
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,540
Apologize

494
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,020
I didn't order food

495
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,060
I'll help you walk the dog

496
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,900
This is the compensation for her

497
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,260
I brought you some strawberries

498
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,460
blueberries

499
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,060
bread and milk

500
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,340
I washed them all for you

501
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,180
And coffee

502
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,460
It's for you

503
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,300
Seriously

504
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,500
You are so handsome

505
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,940
Oliver

506
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
I did it!

507
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,460
You are the first person to witness my western world.

508
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Let me tell you. I used a method.

509
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
It's a simple method.

510
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,460
I used all my data simulation machines to do a division experiment.

511
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
The result...

512
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Do you know?

513
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,460
My matching method is very accurate.

514
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
It's a huge breakthrough!

515
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Congratulations.

516
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,460
What method did you say you used?

517
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,460
I... I can't tell you right now.

518
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,460
But when I'm done with everything, I'll tell you, okay?

519
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Oh my god!

520
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Why is he so bad at it?

521
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
What should I do?

522
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
He's so fast.

523
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Well, I'll help you walk.

524
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm tired.

525
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,460
Then... I'll go to work.

526
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,460
I'll leave you to it.

527
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
I...

528
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
Jiang Junya.

529
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
Morning, Mr. Ma.

530
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,460
You did a division experiment on the work report according to the asset list.

531
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,460
It's very detailed and convenient to speed up.

532
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
I should do it.

533
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
I'm sorry.

534
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
I should do it.

535
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
I've been in MH for so many years.

536
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,460
I've never seen you so detailed.

537
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,460
Mr. Ma, you're flattering me.

538
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,460
My English name is Bo.

539
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,460
It means Bole in Chinese.

540
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,460
In my eyes, trust is divided into two types.

541
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
One is a wild boar.

542
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
The other is a family boar.

543
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,460
Do you understand what I mean?

544
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,460
Wild boars are good.

545
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,460
Wild boars are good at it.

546
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,460
Wild boars dare to break through and fight.

547
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
They have a future.

548
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
You're so interesting.

549
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,460
After work today,

550
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,460
you should prepare for it.

551
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,460
Mr. Qin from Wanbo invited us to dinner.

552
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,460
You're excellent.

553
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,460
I specially asked you to attend on behalf of the company.

554
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
Me?

555
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
Good luck.

556
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
I'm looking out for you.

557
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Mr. Ma.

558
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Let's go.

559
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Let's go.

560
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,460
Mr. Yuan, the price you gave is too low.

561
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
You have a big appetite.

562
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
You're so arrogant.

563
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,460
You're a big business.

564
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,460
20% increase is too much.

565
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Impossible.

566
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,460
Do you know the price of Jinding's investment bank?

567
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,460
I don't know.

568
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,460
Can Jinding compete with MH?

569
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
Their signature is not good.

570
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,460
But they gave a high price.

571
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Ma sent Jiang Jun to Wanbo to accompany Mr. Qin.

572
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
I heard he's hard to deal with.

573
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
Jiang Jun may have trouble.

574
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,460
I'll give you one minute to think about it.

575
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,460
I'll stop working with you.

576
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
But I want to remind you.

577
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,460
If I announce that I'll stop working with your company,

578
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,460
I believe no other company will be interested in your company.

579
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Start timing.

580
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,460
Order the fastest flight back to Shanghai.

581
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Okay.

582
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Mr. Yuan, we haven't finished talking.

583
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
30 seconds.

584
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,460
Hurry up.

585
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,460
I'll answer.

586
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Listen to me.

587
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,460
Wait.

588
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,460
Every drink should be in place.

589
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,460
Okay?

590
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,460
Come on.

591
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
You guys.

592
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,460
Hurry up.

593
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,460
Hurry up.

594
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,460
You're good at everything.

595
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
One more.

596
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
I can't drink.

597
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
I'll drink.

598
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Are you sure?

599
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
Good drink.

600
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Where is Miss Jiang going?

601
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Qin.

602
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,460
I want to go to the bathroom.

603
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,460
Go to the bathroom and get a bag.

604
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,460
Come on.

605
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,460
I'll go make up.

606
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,460
Come on.

607
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,460
Drink one more.

608
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,460
How about this?

609
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,460
I'll propose a toast.

610
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,460
But the first one

611
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,460
is to Miss Jiang.

612
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Miss Jiang, Mr. Ma is always there for me.

613
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,460
He said you're a newbie,

614
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,460
but you're smart and smart.

615
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,460
He's very good at judging.

616
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,460
But I have a habit

617
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
of not looking at the person's face.

618
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,460
I've known him for a long time.

619
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,460
So the rule here is

620
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
to judge the person by the drink.

621
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,460
Wait.

622
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,460
This is the first time I've met you.

623
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,460
This drink

624
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
is not good enough.

625
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,460
This drink

626
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
is not good enough.

627
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
I'll use this.

628
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Come on.

629
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,460
This is right.

630
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
The last step.

631
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,460
This drink is called

632
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,460
the best.

633
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
Miss Jiang, you're so sincere.

634
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Come on.

635
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,460
Mr. Qin,

636
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,460
I really don't want to drink with you.

637
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,460
I'm really allergic to alcohol.

638
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,460
Look at my face.

639
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Mr. Qin,

640
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460
Xiao Jiang's face is red.

641
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,460
She really can't drink.

642
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
Look, it's a face.

643
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,460
It's a face.

644
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,460
Look, it's a face.

645
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,460
Don't force her.

646
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
I'll take Miss Jiang out for a walk.

647
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,460
It seems that Miss Jiang

648
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,460
doesn't want to give me a face.

649
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
It's okay.

650
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Jiang Jun, if you really

651
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
don't want to drink with Mr. Qin,

652
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,460
I'll drink for you.

653
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Come on, Mr. Qin, I'll drink for her.

654
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,460
Okay, come on.

655
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,460
Come on.

656
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,460
Mr. Qin is our M&H's

657
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,460
big client.

658
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,460
Anyway, Mr. Qin

659
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,460
will definitely drink.

660
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Good.

661
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
Good.

662
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
You're really a person recommended by Mr. Ma.

663
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
You have a good strength. Hurry up.

664
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,460
Sorry, I have to answer the phone.

665
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,460
Hello.

666
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,460
Are you available now?

667
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,460
I'm eating with my client.

668
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,460
Why are you so ugly?

669
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,460
You go back to the building.

670
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,460
Send me the phone. Wait for her.

671
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,460
I'll ask her to come here.

672
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,460
Let me go.

673
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,460
Let go.

674
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
How are you?

675
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,460
Come home with me.

676
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,460
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Yuan.

677
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Shut up.

678
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Be careful.

679
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
What have we received after our oatmeal?

680
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,460
You were so burning,

681
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,460
so we need to wait for it.

682
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,460
I'll open the door.

683
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,460
Now it's on time.

684
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
It is so funny.

685
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,460
I'm thirsty.

686
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
Yeah, the water is...

687
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,740
Your face has changed.

688
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,260
What team did I become?

689
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,220
That color.

690
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,060
She shouldn't have...

691
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,040
The same color.

692
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,100
Are you sure she's fine?

693
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,540
That's none of your concern.

694
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,460
All my means, everything

695
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,460
My promise

696
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Wait for a moment to say it out

697
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,460
Say it

698
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,460
I shouldn't drink in my working hours

699
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
I'm sick

700
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
I mean

701
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,460
How can you let someone like Ma Xiu Ran

702
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,460
ride on your head and be so powerful?

703
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,460
I've said it many times

704
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,460
This is a battlefield, not a test field

705
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,460
There are no rules

706
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,460
There are no test teachers

707
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,460
How can you be so easy to deal with

708
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,460
someone like Ma Xiu Ran?

709
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
How can I be so easy to deal with?

710
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,460
Are you sick?

711
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,460
Are you not making sense?

712
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,460
I'm going to be punished today

713
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
Do I have any way?

714
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,460
Can I defy Ma Xiu Ran's order?

715
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,460
How dare you defy me?

716
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Don't touch me

717
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,460
What are you doing?

718
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,460
Get down, General

719
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,460
It's dangerous up there

720
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,460
Get down

721
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,460
You are a big liar

722
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,460
Stop it, get down

723
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
It's dangerous up there

724
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
Don't touch me

725
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Don't touch me

726
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
Get down, I'll take you

727
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
Are you kidding me?

728
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
Will I be fooled by you again?

729
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Get out

730
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,460
Don't do anything, General

731
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,460
Get down

732
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,460
What are you doing?

733
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
It's dangerous

734
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,460
I'll take you

735
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,460
Get down

736
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
You fell down, right?

737
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,460
I deserve it

738
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,460
You said you would hold me

739
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
You are lying

740
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,460
I just want to teach you

741
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Don't believe what men say

742
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
I won't believe you again

743
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Little crybaby, I'll hold you

744
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,460
I've been saying this for three times

745
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,460
I'll be the second one to be punished

746
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,460
I promise I won't do it again

747
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,460
Silly girl, you've been transferred

748
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
I won't let you leave again

749
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,460
She is crazy

750
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Shut up

751
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,460
Be quiet

752
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,460
Don't give Yuan Shuang the big wolf

753
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,460
Let's go home.

754
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,460
Try to understand

755
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,460
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

756
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,460
You can tell me lies

757
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,460
You can make me cry, you know why

758
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,460
Never been so brave

759
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,460
I will run away

760
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
If it's what you want

761
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,460
What you like, I don't mind

762
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,460
I can close my eyes

763
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,460
I can stay behind with my time

764
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
Walk into your plan

765
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,460
Like I never knew you were not mine

766
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Make you satisfied

767
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,460
Wear another mask

768
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:07,460
You never realize things I do for love

769
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,460
I think I'm tired

770
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,460
I think I'm blind

771
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,460
Don't know how to feel

772
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,460
Don't know how to heal

773
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,460
You walk so fast

774
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,460
Can't catch your light

775
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,460
You fly so high

776
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Leave all the things behind

777
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
And our story

778
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:47,460
Leave all love nowhere to find

779
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,460
I think I'm tired

780
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,460
I think I'm blind

781
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Don't know how to feel

782
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,460
Don't know how to heal

783
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,460
You walk so fast

784
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,460
Can't catch your light

785
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,460
You fly so high

786
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,460
Leave all the things behind

787
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,460
And our story

788
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:28,460
Leave all love nowhere to find

789
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,460
