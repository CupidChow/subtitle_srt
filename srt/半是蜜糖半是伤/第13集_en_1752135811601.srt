1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
I

3
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,380
Know stars falls from

4
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,320
Du

5
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,760
wi

6
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
Ùˆ

7
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,560
My only sunlight

8
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Need you to be here

9
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Why you had to leave?

10
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Oh please come back my love

11
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Standing in a red

12
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
I need your arms to hold

13
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,560
I pray every night to hurry back to me

14
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
When winter turns to spring

15
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm standing next to you

16
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,560
To see the flowers grow

17
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm standing next to you

18
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm going back to 702

19
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm going back to 702

20
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Yuli

21
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
You just woke up?

22
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
I made some porridge for you

23
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Come and drink

24
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Are you still dizzy?

25
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm fine

26
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
And look at the fridge

27
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
What else do you want to eat?

28
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
I saw you bought a lot of things

29
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,560
This is not from me

30
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Is this Yuan Shuai renting a house?

31
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
And he's giving me a house?

32
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,560
I bought you so much food in the fridge

33
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
And I even ordered you clothes

34
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Even the bed is your favorite color

35
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
This operation is so touching

36
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,560
No wonder I feel weird when I come in

37
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
The decoration is your favorite

38
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Even the furniture is your favorite

39
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Is Yuan Shuai expecting you to come back?

40
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Oh right

41
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Did you know he called me yesterday

42
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
He was so worried about you

43
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Didn't you have any opinions about him before?

44
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
In our novel world

45
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
The main character is always changing

46
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,560
For example, the last second can be a vicious villain

47
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,560
The next second can be a heart-wrenching beauty

48
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
I think he wants to keep you

49
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
There should be two reasons

50
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Either he wants to secretly kill you

51
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Or he wants to secretly love you

52
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
I'm going to Chengdu

53
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Chengdu

54
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I want you to go back with me tomorrow

55
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
To meet the person in charge of the project

56
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,560
I won't argue with you if you're not in the company

57
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,560
But the person in charge of the project is dad's friend

58
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
He said you have to be there tomorrow

59
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,560
If you don't come, dad will know

60
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Are you done?

61
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I'll go back to the factory in a few days

62
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
I'll take care of the factory

63
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
But I only want to see you once

64
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
I'll go back to the factory in a few days

65
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Du

66
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Don't do this, okay?

67
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,560
I can promise you whatever you want

68
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
As long as you don't leave Chiying

69
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
Don't leave me

70
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I'll go back to the factory in a few days

71
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I'll go back to the factory in a few days

72
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I'll go back to the factory in a few days

73
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
This is not a factory

74
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,560
There are no rules and no supervision

75
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Don't be so easy on Ma Xiu Ran

76
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
I know

77
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
The rules are the same here

78
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I can only let the one who bullies me become a fool

79
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I can only let the one who bullies me become a fool

80
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
It's good that you know

81
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Wait

82
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Take a deep breath

83
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Go

84
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Come in

85
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Come in

86
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm not looking for you

87
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
But you came to me

88
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Yesterday I arranged you to entertain President Qin

89
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
But you

90
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
You brought Yuan Shuai here

91
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
You have to go and apologize to President Qin in person

92
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
President Ma

93
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Given yesterday's situation

94
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I am requesting you

95
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Please stop

96
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Please stop

97
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
For unfair and unreasonable work arrangements

98
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Otherwise I will complain to President Fan

99
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
You are threatening me

100
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
I am talking to you

101
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
According to company regulations

102
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Drinking with customers is not my job

103
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Let me tell you

104
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Don't think that someone will vote for you

105
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
You can argue with me

106
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
The work I arranged for you last time

107
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Is your business

108
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Did you hear me?

109
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Get out

110
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Yes

111
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Don't be so easy on someone like Ma Xiu Ran

112
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
As a boss

113
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
You have the right to arrange work for me

114
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
And as a member of the investment bank

115
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
I have the right to reject unreasonable work arrangements

116
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
If you are dissatisfied with me doing this

117
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
You can complain to the company

118
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
I will go

119
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
How dare you argue with me

120
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
How dare you

121
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
President Ma is so arrogant

122
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Where do you want to go?

123
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
What does it have to do with you?

124
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
I am sorry

125
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,560
You only sent a female employee to drink with that Qin

126
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
You took the advantage, right?

127
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
You mean that general, right?

128
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
President Yuan is so stupid

129
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
You don't know how to do it

130
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Did you buy this perfume from the tap?

131
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
It smells like a mountain

132
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand

133
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,560
This is the new product of Milan fashion master Amal

134
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Amal

135
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Amal is a master

136
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
So the perfume will be fine

137
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
What do you think the problem will be?

138
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
You are going too far

139
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Last Friday

140
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
The dry medicine in Hong Kong was also disposed of

141
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
The process was very long

142
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
After two years of supervision

143
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
The number of resumption and administrative repairs

144
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Still failed to save this old Qian Gu

145
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
You know what I mean, right?

146
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
You want to threaten me, right?

147
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
I tell you

148
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
This is the meaning of the dry medicine president

149
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
I have nothing to do with it

150
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Then you are at least a tiger

151
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
So what?

152
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
You can't do anything to me

153
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
What do you want?

154
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
So beautiful

155
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
How can you have this picture?

156
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
How can I have this picture?

157
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
You say I am so fond of revenge

158
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
I have some means

159
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
How can I sit in the MH

160
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Now this position

161
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I just use the way of the man

162
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
To return to the body of the man

163
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Ma Xiu Ran

164
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I warn you

165
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
If you use this kind of unruly means again

166
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
To destroy the atmosphere of the MH

167
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
I can't guarantee

168
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,560
This picture will be leaked one day

169
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,560
I am the most beautiful

170
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
I am the most beautiful

171
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Why are you here?

172
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
I am waiting for you

173
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Wait for me?

174
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
You say

175
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
If you say the truth outside the office

176
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Will it be more sincere?

177
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
How do I know?

178
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
You say first, I will evaluate

179
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Actually it's nothing

180
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
It's about the house

181
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
I think you are right

182
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I lied to you

183
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
It's my fault

184
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
So

185
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
You should be smarter

186
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
The most important thing is

187
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Don't believe people like me

188
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
I am done

189
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
You

190
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Thank you

191
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Although you lied to me

192
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
But for the sake of your saving me

193
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
I forgive you

194
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
But you don't lie to me anymore

195
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
I am done too

196
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
I am done

197
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I am done

198
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Hello, Mr. Du

199
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Do you have time?

200
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
I want to give you something

201
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
What?

202
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
You will be late if you come

203
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
You are waiting in the box room

204
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Ok

205
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Mr. Du

206
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
You are here

207
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Why do you come to me?

208
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Smell it

209
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
It smells good

210
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Did you make it?

211
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
You made it yourself last time

212
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
You need to eat the perfume you made last time

213
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
It's just right now

214
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
I made it?

215
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
I am so good

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Sit

217
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Sit

218
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Xun

219
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
This is my English name

220
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Really?

221
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
What a coincidence

222
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
By the way

223
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Last time

224
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
You sent me the address

225
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
But I went there

226
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Then I think

227
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
You are late

228
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
It's ok

229
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Last time

230
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
It's ok

231
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
It's good that you are fine

232
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
If there is another accident next time

233
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
You need to tell me immediately

234
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Understand?

235
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
I won't

236
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I was too obedient before

237
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
So this happened

238
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
It will never happen again

239
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
It seems that my apprentice

240
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Will be a chef soon

241
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Can I help you to reduce the burden?

242
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
By the way, Mr. Du

243
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
How are you recently?

244
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,560
I am good recently

245
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
I am a teacher

246
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
I have a small plan now

247
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
I am going to invest

248
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
If you have any good projects to recommend

249
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
You need to tell me immediately

250
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Ok

251
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Thank you for your perfume

252
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
You are welcome

253
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Teacher, turn right here

254
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Sorry, I almost forgot

255
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
I am going to here today

256
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
You are not going back?

257
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
No, I live here now

258
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
You moved?

259
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
That's good

260
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
What is good?

261
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
By the way

262
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
How did you go yesterday?

263
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
A group like this

264
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Should not be too early

265
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Yesterday

266
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
My leader came to pick me up yesterday

267
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Yuan Shuai

268
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Why did he send you to go alone?

269
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
No, he came to help me

270
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Forget it

271
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
You can't explain it clearly

272
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Anyway

273
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Newbies don't know how to wear shoes

274
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
I feel that your relationship

275
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Seems quite strange

276
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
No

277
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
He is my neighbor

278
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
We met in kindergarten

279
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Sorry

280
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
You two are in a good relationship?

281
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
What good?

282
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
He has liked to bully me since childhood

283
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
I haven't seen him for so many years

284
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
He kicked me out of MH as soon as we met

285
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
And said that I am not suitable for Tou Ha

286
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
After entering the company

287
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
He has been humiliating me in various ways

288
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Who is related to him?

289
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I am back

290
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Brother

291
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
You are back

292
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Brother

293
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Where is Wang Cai?

294
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Why didn't you see Wang Cai?

295
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Over there

296
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Li Xiaochuan

297
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Dad

298
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
It's okay

299
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
It's okay, Wang Cai

300
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Dad is back

301
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
It's okay

302
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Li Xiaochuan

303
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
Did you take care of Wang Cai like this these two days?

304
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
I have set this up

305
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
After he reaches a certain amount of exercise

306
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
He will stop himself

307
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Are you also lacking exercise?

308
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Are you going to run up there?

309
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
When you reach a certain amount of exercise

310
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
I will also stop you

311
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Go up

312
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Are you kidding me?

313
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Go up

314
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Why should I run?

315
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
You are not going up, right?

316
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
You forgot that there is something in my phone

317
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
You forgot, right?

318
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
When you were in college

319
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
High school

320
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
I will run

321
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Hurry up

322
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Enough, enough

323
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
You are really

324
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Let me tell you

325
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,560
If you let me see Wang Cai's size change in this room

326
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
I will let you know what pain is

327
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Don't worry about this

328
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Last time Xu Li told me

329
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Dogs need to go out to make a big change

330
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,560
So I have a spare time to let him go out every day

331
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
And you are not here these days

332
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
I tell you

333
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
It's too heavy

334
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
About three pounds

335
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Run

336
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Run

337
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
This is the new project you have recently studied

338
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
This is confidential

339
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
I will give you a big surprise when the time comes

340
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Is it so mysterious?

341
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
I suddenly remembered that I have something to do

342
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I will leave Wang Cai to you

343
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Bye bye

344
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
It's weird

345
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Junjun, you are back

346
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
What are you doing?

347
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Don't move

348
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Where are you going?

349
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I want to think about it

350
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
I am going to Mr. Du's perfume room

351
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Mr. Du has a perfume room?

352
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Yes

353
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Great

354
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Mr. Du

355
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
You said you were helping me

356
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Mo Mo is the man behind you

357
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
What nonsense

358
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
He is my respected teacher

359
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
The predecessor of the first class

360
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Don't think about your stupid little head

361
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
I am not stupid

362
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
You said I was stupid

363
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
How can I be stupid today?

364
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Hurry up

365
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
I am hurt by the sheep

366
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Be quiet

367
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Come

368
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Come

369
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Your roommate's eyes are so scary

370
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
I have practiced iron and copper wall

371
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,560
I am used to it

372
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Maybe my B-pillar is not developed enough

373
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Or I should move back

374
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
It's not good to bother you here

375
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
No

376
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
You moved out

377
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
How can you bow your head in the dark?

378
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
And you are so embarrassed

379
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Quiet

380
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
Turn off the light

381
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,560
I can't stand this kind of

382
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
From the perspective of the eyes

383
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Ok

384
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Since you decide to resign

385
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
I won't lose you

386
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,560
But you should stay in the hospital

387
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
I will think about it

388
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
But I am so confused

389
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,560
I should go to the hospital

390
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
It's so tiring to go to the hospital

391
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Put down your foot

392
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Put down your foot

393
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Put down your foot

394
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
One more time

395
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Put down your foot

396
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
You didn't sleep in the dark?

397
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
No

398
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
You don't have to do this

399
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,560
At least you can give us a chance

400
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
What a shame

401
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
When did I start to admit my bed?

402
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Since I moved to Lily's house

403
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
I haven't slept well

404
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
In a big Shanghai

405
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
There is no place to sleep in peace

406
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
I am afraid I will be sick of work

407
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
and die

408
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
One neighbor is like a dead god

409
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
One neighbor is a devil

410
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
But the devil's environment is beautiful

411
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
It's quiet and comfortable

412
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
The price is fair

413
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
A man can't be born young

414
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
General

415
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
You can't give up on the conditions

416
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
for such a good investment

417
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
President Yuan

418
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
What's wrong?

419
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
I just want to ask

420
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Is 702 now?

421
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
What's wrong with 702?

422
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
702

423
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
The latest report from Chen Xing

424
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
The live broadcast is on the screen

425
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
OK

426
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Are you here for work

427
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
or for the show?

428
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
You look pale

429
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
and your dark circles are bigger than your eyes

430
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
You are scaring our customers

431
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
What should we do?

432
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
And your clothes

433
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
are bought by Taobao

434
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
They are so dirty

435
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
They are not even of any quality

436
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
General

437
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Don't you have

438
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
a copy of the manual?

439
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Why are you still standing there?

440
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Go back and wash

441
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
I'll take it back to the office

442
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
I have something to tell you

443
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Go to my office

444
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
These newcomers

445
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
were so excited when they first came

446
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Now they are all in the right place

447
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
They are getting more and more casual

448
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
You are so into

449
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
following the newcomers

450
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
Why don't you spend more time

451
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
to look at yourself?

452
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Me?

453
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
What about me?

454
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
You are so into it

455
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
It's not good to scare the customers

456
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
No

457
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
You are talking nonsense

458
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Let's get to the point

459
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Good news

460
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
The new technology system

461
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
has been targeted by several big companies

462
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
This kind of technology

463
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
and innovation

464
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
is really a trap

465
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
What are you going to do next?

466
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
We MH

467
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
don't have to

468
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
offend too many people

469
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Who are you going to block?

470
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
I'm going to block

471
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Since it's a company

472
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
I'm looking forward to

473
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I will definitely

474
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
let it evolve

475
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
What are you going to do

476
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
for dinner?

477
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
What are you going to eat?

478
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
I'm sorry

479
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
I have something

480
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
to do tonight

481
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Something personal?

482
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Do you need help?

483
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Okay

484
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm leaving

485
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm leaving

486
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
How is it?

487
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm not eating

488
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
I'm on a diet

489
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
You are so difficult

490
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
You are not tired

491
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
after a day of work

492
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
I'm not tired

493
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
I think

494
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
if you have anything

495
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
to report

496
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
you should go in

497
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
It's okay

498
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
I don't have anything to report

499
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
You should go eat

500
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Okay

501
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I'm leaving

502
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
I'm leaving

503
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
I'm off work

504
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Are you looking for me?

505
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
What's wrong?

506
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Don't touch me

507
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Don't touch me

508
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Where are you feeling unwell?

509
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Don't touch me

510
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,560
My foot

511
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
My foot

512
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Your foot is numb

513
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
You should have told me earlier

514
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
It's so numb

515
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Okay

516
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Okay

517
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
You changed perfume

518
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Yes

519
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Jiang Jun

520
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
You are acting strange today

521
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
You are acting strange from head to toe

522
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
What's wrong with you?

523
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
No

524
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
You can talk

525
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Don't look at me like that

526
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
If you really have something to tell me

527
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
just tell me

528
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Maybe I will agree

529
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm fine

530
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
I'm working in my own office

531
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm fine

532
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Are you sure?

533
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Yes

534
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
It doesn't matter

535
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
I'm hungry now

536
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I'll go eat by myself

537
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Mr. Lin

538
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
What a coincidence

539
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I'm hungry too

540
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
I've finished my work

541
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Let's eat together

542
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
I'll treat you

543
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Treat me?

544
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Dad

545
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
I'm going to work

546
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Your foot is numb

547
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Mr. Yuan

548
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Your rich rice noodles are here

549
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Let me help you

550
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
They have been renovating

551
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
for a while

552
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
I wonder if it tastes

553
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
the same as before

554
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Mr. Lin, do you like vinegar?

555
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Do you want some chili?

556
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Tell me

557
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
What's the matter this morning?

558
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Nothing

559
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
You were waiting for me

560
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
after work

561
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
No

562
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
It seems that I misunderstood

563
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Let's eat

564
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Delicious

565
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Let me tell you something

566
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Longting's house

567
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
has been empty for so long

568
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
If you are sure that you don't rent it

569
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
I'll rent it out

570
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
It's not empty

571
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
It's full of bricks in the refrigerator

572
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
What?

573
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
I mean

574
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
it's a short term

575
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,560
and it's not easy to make

576
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Since you helped me

577
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
I'm not a petty person

578
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I just thought about

579
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
solving this problem for you

580
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
How can you be so shy

581
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
to ask Miss Jiang for help?

582
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
I can handle it myself

583
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Think about it

584
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Longting's house

585
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
is so cheap

586
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
in that place

587
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
It's still very affordable

588
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Hello, Miss Liu

589
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
You want to see the house?

590
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
I have something to do tomorrow

591
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
in the day

592
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
How about coming tomorrow night?

593
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
What?

594
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
You want to transfer money directly to me?

595
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Okay

596
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
I'll give you the account

597
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
I've rented the house

598
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Someone is going to rent it

599
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
What?

600
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
You are affecting my business

601
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Sit down

602
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
No

603
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I thought about it

604
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
The price of your house

605
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
is still the same

606
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
It's still very expensive

607
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
So

608
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
I want to rent it again

609
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
What?

610
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Rent it again

611
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Rent it again?

612
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
No

613
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
How can you be so shy?

614
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
I'm afraid that renting it to Miss Jiang

615
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
will affect your

616
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
happy life

617
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
No, no

618
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
I don't have

619
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
a happy life

620
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Okay

621
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
You are so sincere

622
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
to rent my house

623
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
I can let you get it right

624
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
But

625
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
What are you doing?

626
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
You don't want to

627
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
start a business, do you?

628
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
It's not embarrassing to start a business

629
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
Embarrassing

630
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Very

631
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
extremely

632
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
extremely embarrassing

633
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
You are a high-ranking manager

634
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
You think you can take advantage of me?

635
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Okay, okay, okay

636
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
You are right

637
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
How about this?

638
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
I'll rent it to you

639
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
at the previous price

640
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
No

641
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Jiang Jun

642
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
You don't want me to start a business

643
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Do you want to

644
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
steal it?

645
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
No

646
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
I think

647
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
I should give it to you

648
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
at the market price

649
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
You don't take advantage of me

650
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
I can't take advantage of you

651
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Okay, it's okay

652
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Anyway

653
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
I just need to rent it again

654
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,560
I said, as soon as I thought

655
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
you moved back

656
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I felt troublesome

657
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
You are so stubborn

658
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Eat

659
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Be careful

660
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
You will lose your salary

661
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
next month

662
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Have you decided?

663
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
When will you move back?

664
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
In a few days

665
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
It seems that I have to call

666
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Miss Liu

667
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
Where are you going?

668
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
To move my stuff

669
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Yes

670
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
I made it

671
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Again

672
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Oh my god

673
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Chuan

674
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
How many stages

675
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
can you complete

676
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
in this human form?

677
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Can you tell me

678
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
in advance

679
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
when you reach the next stage?

680
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
In this case

681
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
I can also make a move

682
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
What stage?

683
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,560
It's

684
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
It's

685
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
It's the stage

686
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
you are in

687
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Sorry

688
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Because

689
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
now my software

690
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
is basically completed

691
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
I just

692
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
uploaded my

693
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
internal strategy

694
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
so I was so excited

695
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Internal strategy?

696
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
So you mean

697
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
I can download it now?

698
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Then I will be the first user

699
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
It's too late

700
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
The first user

701
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
is me

702
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
Then

703
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
I will share it with my

704
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
model team

705
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
so that they can

706
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
add more users to you

707
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
and recommend it

708
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
to their fans

709
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
on social platforms

710
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
so that they can

711
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,560
recommend it to their friends

712
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Then will you be popular?

713
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
No

714
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
My server is too small

715
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
to store so much data

716
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
so I can't support

717
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
so many users

718
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
I have to tell my brother

719
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
I said I would give him

720
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
a big surprise

721
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Then I will call

722
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Jingjing now

723
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
My baby

724
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
I have 20 bags of

725
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
food for you

726
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
I will go to the bathroom

727
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
and get some water

728
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I will go to the bathroom

729
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
and get some water

730
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Do you want water?

731
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Come on

732
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
It's ok

733
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
It's so comfortable

734
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
in my own home

735
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Hecai

736
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Hecai

737
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Why are you here?

738
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
Why are you here?

739
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Oh my god

740
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
You seem to have gained weight

741
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Hello

742
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Hello, sister

743
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
What's up?

744
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
I am back

745
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Who is next to you?

746
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
No one

747
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
What's wrong?

748
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
You can't even talk

749
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Who is it?

750
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Is Yuan Shuai in your room?

751
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
You moved back

752
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Jiang Jun, you are so ungrateful

753
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
I order you to come to my convenience store

754
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
right now

755
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
No

756
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
What are you doing?

757
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,560
I am here to welcome you back

758
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Welcome back

759
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Thank you

760
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Brother

761
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
The surprise I told you last time

762
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
is finished

763
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
I hope you can come to see it first

764
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
and help me to evaluate

765
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
how much investment

766
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
this project has

767
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Where are you going?

768
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
To the convenience store

769
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
To the convenience store

770
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
I am sorry

771
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
I am sorry

772
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
I am sorry

773
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
I am sorry

774
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
I am sorry

775
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
I am sorry

776
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I am sorry

777
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
I am sorry

778
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
I am sorry

779
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
I am sorry

780
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
