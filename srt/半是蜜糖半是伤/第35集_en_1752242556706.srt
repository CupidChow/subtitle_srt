1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,280
little bit of a

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
little bit of a

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,280
little bit of a

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,280
little bit of a

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,280
tiny little bit of a

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,280
little bit of a

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,280
The exciting new year is about to begin.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Episode 2

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,280
What's your opinion on the recent drop in the stock of Eagle Chi cars?

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Three days ago, Eagle Chi bought all the new cars that were listed this year.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,280
The stock value of Eagle Chi cars will drop to the lowest point.

21
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
But I predict that soon, the stock of Eagle Chi cars will start to explode.

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Because Beile Energy will buy the Eagle Chi cars.

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Are you sure?

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
The value of Eagle Chi cars is very high.

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
The cost is high.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Why did Beile Energy buy it?

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Although Beile Energy has hundreds of billions of dollars on its account,

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
the share is scattered and the value is not high.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
It faces the risk of being bought by the bad guys.

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
So, buying Eagle Chi cars is their only plan.

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
You are Shen Xin of MH?

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Hello, Shen Xin.

33
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
How's the interview?

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Jiang Jun.

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
I passed the memory interview.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
I can start working next week.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Really? Congratulations.

38
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Thank you and Mr. Yuan for helping me prove it.

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
By the way, do you have time today?

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I want to invite you and Mr. Qiao to have a crab meal together.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
We can also have a gathering.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
No problem. I will be there on time.

44
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Bye.

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Come in.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Jiang Jun.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Mr. Jiang.

48
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Do you know Shen Xin passed the interview?

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I know.

50
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Congratulations.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
You don't have to be a crybaby anymore.

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
By the way, I have a favor to ask you.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Go ahead.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
After work today,

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
send me all the information after you go to the information department

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
and take over the Huanyuan Group.

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Remember,

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
you must go after everyone leaves.

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Mr. Du?

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Is there any problem?

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm not sure.

62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,280
I just suspect that it has something to do with Shen Xin and Xiang Jing's resignation.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
So remember to keep it a secret.

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
I understand.

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Jiang Jun.

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
I was drunk yesterday. I'm sorry.

67
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Mr. Du.

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
I think it's okay if I say it's okay.

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
It's a bit hypocritical.

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
But don't worry.

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I will try my best to adjust my state.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Before I resign,

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,280
I will maintain an ordinary relationship with you.

74
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Are you still determined to leave the company?

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Yes.

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
I have decided.

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Am I really so despicable in your heart?

78
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Okay.

79
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
I understand.

80
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm leaving then.

81
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
Honey.

82
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Where are you going?

83
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Honey.

84
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
What?

85
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
You want me to leave the company?

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm going on a business trip.

87
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
A business trip?

88
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
How long?

89
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Tomorrow.

90
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Tomorrow

91
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
is a very important day.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
But

93
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
It's very important.

94
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
To meet the investor.

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
That's it?

96
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Think about it.

97
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Is there anything else important?

98
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
No.

99
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Li Yao Chuan.

100
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Li Yao Chuan.

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Aren't you curious about what happened yesterday?

103
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
What else do I have to ask?

104
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I've already seen it.

105
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Congratulations.

106
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
You have one more willful new skill.

107
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Then

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
I said I would leave the company.

109
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Of course I can do whatever I want.

110
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
But I don't like to see you with that man.

111
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
You don't know his background.

112
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
You don't know his personality.

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
And

114
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
He obviously knows you have a husband.

115
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
He's still pursuing you.

116
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
His character is definitely not good.

117
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
No.

118
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
I think he's a good person.

119
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
He can play the piano, humor, and style.

120
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
He can drink with me.

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
I don't want to.

122
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
So you mean

123
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
you enjoy seeing him, right?

124
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
It's okay.

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Anyway, our love

126
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Has passed 72 hours of warranty period.

127
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Anyway, someone has already felt that I have no charm.

128
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I happen to think

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
You don't seem to have such a strong personality for me.

130
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Okay.

131
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Whatever.

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Then you go see him.

133
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Lin Xiaochuan.

134
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm just kidding.

135
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Why are you so serious?

136
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
I

137
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Actually, I just want you to care more about me.

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Are you done?

139
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
I'm done.

140
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Go.

141
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Xiaochuan.

142
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
I understand

143
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Maybe in your world

144
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
There are a lot of things

145
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,280
You are the only one in my world.

146
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,280
If you don't love me anymore,

147
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,280
or if you don't love me that much,

148
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,280
it will make me lose my direction.

149
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I know I might say that

150
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
with a little bit of self-esteem.

151
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
But this is what I really want to say.

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,280
I really want to feel it once.

153
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,280
You are just like me, caring about you.

154
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Right?

155
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm here, right?

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm here.

157
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
I'm here.

158
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm here.

159
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm here.

160
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm here.

161
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
I'm here.

162
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
I'm here.

163
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm here.

164
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
I'm here.

165
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
I'm here.

166
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm here.

167
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
I'm here.

168
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
I'm here.

169
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm here.

170
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
I'm here.

171
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Sometimes,

172
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
you have to love someone

173
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
for the sake of that person,

174
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
like you do for Zhou Xin.

175
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Li Qing is a good person.

176
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I hope you like it.

177
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,280
It seems that I have to help her wear a suit again.

178
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,480
For so many years, they have been seeing flowers in the dark.

179
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,480
They may have been used to it.

180
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,080
But I think if they have the intention to see the sun,

181
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,080
they may not want to stay in the dark.

182
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,880
Instead, they will try to live like this.

183
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,680
If it were me, I think I would do it too.

184
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
Sorry.

185
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,680
I was not considerate and made you misunderstand.

186
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,080
You guessed it right. I just want to marry you.

187
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,480
So you should understand that I can't go back to your heart.

188
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,080
Do you want to leave so badly?

189
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,080
I don't want to leave.

190
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
I want to go back to my hometown.

191
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,880
I want to go back to my hometown.

192
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,680
I want to go back to my hometown.

193
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Okay.

194
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
I love you.

195
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,080
Good night.

196
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,480
I just sent you a file.

197
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,480
You can send it to me.

198
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,080
The bigger the better.

199
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,280
Xie Xing!

200
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,680
Xie Xing, good luck on theacion.

201
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,480
You can make it.

202
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,880
Don't worry, Mr. Qiao.

203
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,280
From now on, I will chill with King,

204
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
be as good as you and be as good as you and very good as the king.

205
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,080
Alright.

206
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,320
I'll work harder and more carefully in the future.

207
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
By the way, has Xiao Li come back to her hometown?

208
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,480
Yes, she has.

209
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,920
She told her parents.

210
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,320
If she changes her mind,

211
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,160
she'll be very sad.

212
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,800
I think everyone has different choices.

213
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,760
She may think

214
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,640
it's not the only choice to have a decent job in a big city.

215
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,240
Hello, Ms. Chen.

216
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,160
Long time no see.

217
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,960
Hi.

218
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,920
I brought a friend today.

219
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,720
Do you mind?

220
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,920
Of course not.

221
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Mr. Ji is here.

222
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,040
Why are you here?

223
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,880
Qiao Qiao, don't get me wrong.

224
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,560
My brother invited me here.

225
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,160
Sit down.

226
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,760
Sit down.

227
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,640
I'll sit here.

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,680
Yuan Shuai,

229
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,360
is your brother in charge?

230
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,640
No.

231
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,600
He's the boss.

232
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,520
Only Qiao Qiao can take care of me.

233
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
Why hasn't Chen Chen come yet?

234
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,320
He's busy with something.

235
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,040
He'll be late.

236
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,640
Okay, I won't wait for him.

237
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,840
I invited you here today

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,960
to thank you all.

239
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you for your encouragement and encouragement.

240
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,640
Thank you for your trust.

241
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,720
And you've been helping me and Xiao Li

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,960
to get through this.

243
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,120
Most importantly,

244
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,200
I want to thank you for your kindness

245
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,880
so that I can get into the business.

246
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,120
Come on, cheers.

247
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,000
Come on.

248
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,480
Shen Xing,

249
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,160
I'm just doing my job.

250
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,040
The most important thing

251
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,760
is your ability and experience

252
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,120
to get into the business, right?

253
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,680
Congratulations.

254
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,680
Cheers.

255
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Thank you.

256
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,440
Qiao Qiao, come here.

257
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Sorry.

258
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,000
Sorry for being late.

259
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,800
Sorry.

260
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
You're here.

261
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,880
Jiang Jun,

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,080
here's what you asked me to do.

263
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,920
Thank you.

264
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,160
What is it?

265
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,280
I'll tell you

266
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
about what you told me.

267
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,760
Since everyone's here,

268
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,160
I have something to announce.

269
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm going to resign.

270
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,000
What?

271
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,920
Why did you resign?

272
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,440
Is it because we've got you in trouble?

273
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,920
He's fired.

274
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,680
He's fired?

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,560
And

276
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,360
I resigned

277
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,560
because I think there are

278
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
other more important things to do in this world.

279
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
It has nothing to do with you.

280
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,840
Don't be self-righteous.

281
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,280
Maybe Mr. Jiang wants to show off

282
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,160
that you're a hero and a heroine.

283
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,360
You must have your own

284
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,160
budget for this.

285
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,680
Right?

286
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,920
You're good, Mr. Chen.

287
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,240
You're so good at sarcasm.

288
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,240
I dare not.

289
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,160
You've made up your mind?

290
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,560
Yes.

291
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,200
Let's toast.

292
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,440
Let's drink to the fire.

293
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,680
Let's drink to the sky.

294
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,880
Cheers.

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,080
Mr. Jiang

296
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,920
is in a good health.

297
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,240
I'll drink

298
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,920
all of his wine tonight.

299
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,560
I suddenly feel

300
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,400
that my health is in a good health.

301
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,040
What should I do?

302
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,160
I'll drink for you.

303
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,200
Stop it.

304
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:32,720
Come on.

305
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,480
Drink it.

306
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,720
Great, Mr. Yuan.

307
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,960
Great.

308
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,120
I've been missing you for a long time.

309
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,200
I really miss

310
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,920
the day we just entered the MH.

311
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,720
We didn't know anything at that time.

312
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,800
Every day,

313
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
there's Mr. Qiao's motivation

314
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,480
and Mr. Yuan's blood.

315
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,440
The most important thing is

316
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,480
that our General is an excellent little fish

317
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,120
who takes everyone up and down.

318
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,400
Now that I think about it,

319
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
time really flies.

320
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,880
Yes.

321
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,800
From now on,

322
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,880
we may have to separate.

323
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,080
So, like now,

324
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:11,760
we're all together.

325
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,640
I think

326
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,440
it's hard.

327
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,880
So,

328
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,160
I think tonight,

329
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,920
we must

330
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,400
drink to the fire, okay?

331
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,160
Okay.

332
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,720
Drink to the fire.

333
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,320
Come on.

334
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,000
Cheers.

335
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,640
Let's drink.

336
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Come on.

337
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I'll drink.

338
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,560
Drink.

339
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,920
Come on.

340
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,880
Cheers.

341
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,840
To the proud time

342
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
we're in MH.

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,880
Cheers.

344
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I love you.

345
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,960
It's true.

346
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,720
Because of you,

347
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
I understand.

348
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,480
I love you.

349
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
It's true.

350
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,720
Because of you,

351
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
I understand.

352
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,720
I love you.

353
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
It's true.

354
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,720
Because of you,

355
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
I understand.

356
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
I love you.

357
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,720
It's true.

358
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,720
Because of you,

359
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
I understand.

360
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,560
I love you.

361
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,560
It's true.

362
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,560
Because of you.

363
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,600
Because of you,

364
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,560
I understand.

365
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,560
I love you.

366
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,360
I love you.

367
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,560
I love you.

368
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,560
I love you.

369
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,560
I love you.

370
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
I'm so tired.

371
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,560
Mr. Jiang.

372
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,080
Something happened.

373
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,600
What?

374
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,160
Mr. Du.

375
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Come to my office.

376
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,680
Mr. Jun,

377
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,520
I want to contact Wu Yin.

378
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,560
Ok.

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,680
Boss, look.

380
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,320
You look good.

381
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,440
I think it'll feel like a lot.

382
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,480
milkshake

383
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,720
Fall in love on 진.

384
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,800
ć

385
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,420
We applied it,

386
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,480
it won't be effective.

387
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,600
I didn't leave it yine.

388
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,460
Can't breastfeed it.

389
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,520
I didn't see it spread outside.

390
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,320
Listen.

391
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,640
Listen.

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,680
Solve this matter quickly.

393
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,760
Don't worry.

394
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,120
I'll do it as soon as possible.

395
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,600
This matter

396
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,920
is obviously planned.

397
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,640
How dare they

398
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,120
just accept the recommendation letter from the HR department?

399
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,320
Besides,

400
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
that person is so familiar with you and Ji Yi.

401
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,360
The probability is definitely

402
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,080
a problem within us.

403
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,680
That's not necessarily.

404
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,400
You may be

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,880
someone who left Ji Yi.

406
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,000
Do you need my help?

407
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,520
No.

408
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,200
As long as you say so,

409
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,920
I'll help you with everything.

410
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,600
Thank you.

411
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,240
I can solve it myself.

412
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,440
How can you solve it yourself?

413
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,000
Listen.

414
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,240
If you can't handle this matter,

415
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,520
everything you have now

416
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,320
will be gone in a single night.

417
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,680
What's wrong with you

418
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,360
begging me at this time?

419
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,000
I admit that I wrote the recommendation letter

420
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,680
to Yuan Shuai because I was in a hurry.

421
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,960
But we never did

422
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,680
anything

423
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,240
that was messed up.

424
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Do you think you can trust

425
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,400
someone else

426
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
by doing something like that?

427
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
I'll go to the board of directors to submit the letter myself.

428
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,120
Even if I have to leave,

429
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,240
I won't carry the blame

430
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,800
and I won't involve anyone else.

431
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Mr. Du.

432
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
How are you going to explain to the board

433
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,320
about the fraud of the financial package of Huan Yu Group?

434
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,240
Did you check it?

435
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,320
There's something wrong.

436
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,200
Since the profit and debt表

437
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,040
of the four seasons two years ago,

438
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,440
the profit and average profit

439
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,760
are more than 30% of the total profit.

440
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
Du Lei can't find it.

441
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,840
And the accountant

442
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,080
couldn't have been a fraud

443
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,200
when he was inspecting and issuing the letter.

444
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
It's a three-way, five-way,

445
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,080
one-way.

446
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,600
I guess

447
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,360
Shen Xing heard

448
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,920
this.

449
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,600
If Du Lei

450
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,200
really participated in it,

451
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
what are you going to do?

452
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
I'll just do it.

453
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
You thought Shen Xing heard

454
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,760
you were bought by Huan Yu Group

455
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,720
and put on the spot

456
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,320
for the financial fraud,

457
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,880
so you deliberately made a mistake

458
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,360
and let him be the one who ordered the fraud, right?

459
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,960
I don't know what he said.

460
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,440
In order to profit, you can break the rules

461
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,080
and build a new wind.

462
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,880
This is what you've been teaching me all this time.

463
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,160
Do you have to fight for yourself?

464
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,880
Mr. Du.

465
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,280
Aren't you afraid that I'll report you to the Procuratorate?

466
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
Sometimes, for the sake of the profit of the long-term,

467
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,440
you sacrifice a little bit and then leave.

468
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,920
Not everyone

469
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,240
will sacrifice in other people's way

470
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,080
to protect themselves.

471
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,160
At least, Yuan Shuai won't do it

472
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,240
when he's around.

473
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,400
I warn you,

474
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,040
now, the MH is my last resort.

475
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,320
Don't blame him.

476
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,720
Don't compare me to him.

477
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,360
Even if I don't report you,

478
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,000
you will die one day.

479
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,800
I hope you can tell the Ministry of the Ministry of the Central Plains

480
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,720
about all your illegal activities.

481
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,800
I have my own way of handling it.

482
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,240
You don't have to teach me.

483
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,880
Moreover,

484
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,160
there is no cure for your mom's death now.

485
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,960
You get the parfois recommended medicine.

486
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,720
Mr. Du!

487
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,000
Nothing happened...

488
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm sorry.

489
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,600
When did you

490
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,600
become like this?

491
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
When did I start?

492
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,600
I never changed.

493
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,560
Let me tell you.

494
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,120
I approached you

495
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,440
to make use of you.

496
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,920
I lied to you about Wan Shan.

497
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,520
I planned to leave with no worries.

498
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,320
Including your father.

499
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,760
I had my reasons.

500
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,440
But the only thing I changed

501
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,840
was that I cared about you more and more.

502
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,720
Do you know that?

503
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,840
But in the end,

504
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,160
I found that

505
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
I became less and less

506
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,520
in your heart.

507
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,440
So...

508
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,840
So you want to destroy me?

509
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,880
Right?

510
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,640
Jiang Yuan.

511
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
Why don't you understand?

512
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,240
I just don't want you to leave me.

513
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Do you know that?

514
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,120
Do you remember your first

515
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,160
birthday?

516
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,440
That was the first time I felt

517
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,360
that there was a warmth

518
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,640
in a birthday.

519
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,200
You gave me

520
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
a new hope.

521
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,600
It's been three years.

522
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,160
I've been loving you

523
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,640
and waiting for you.

524
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,120
I've been protecting you.

525
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,360
I just hope that one day

526
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,520
you can look back at me

527
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,680
even if it's just once.

528
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,960
You don't understand me.

529
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,320
For the past three years,

530
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,640
I've only treated you

531
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
as my teacher.

532
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,280
We're friends.

533
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,880
We're bosses.

534
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,120
We've never had any other thoughts.

535
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,560
Our feelings for each other

536
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,000
are always different.

537
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,880
How can I make you feel fair?

538
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,960
Du Lei.

539
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
I hope that you won't

540
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,400
waste yourself on me.

541
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,880
You don't want

542
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,880
good or bad anymore.

543
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,720
This is the most fair answer

544
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,520
I can give you now.

545
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm sorry.

546
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,560
Do you've a lot to say?

547
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm sorry.

548
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
For the past three years,

549
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,360
you've only made me

550
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
feel sorry for three years.

551
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,820
How much of it are you actually using?

552
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,360
I didn't spend much there.

553
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,980
I just came to pick you up.

554
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,460
I'm helping the МУЗЫКА thinking of what to do.

555
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,860
Curl up the backup.

556
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,860
One day,

557
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,840
I'll clean up all your products.

558
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,200
Okay.

559
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,800
I think we don't need to meet again in the future.

560
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Go.

561
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,920
General,

562
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,720
due to your outstanding performance,

563
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,000
the company decided to terminate your use period in advance

564
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,200
and officially transfer you.

565
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,000
Mr. Chang asked me to finish

566
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,080
these documents by tomorrow.

567
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,840
General,

568
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,200
I'll do this part.

569
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,240
You helped me once on the interview day.

570
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,920
This time, even if I return you to the company,

571
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,520
we can talk it over.

572
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,440
I'll do it.

573
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,440
I'll do it.

574
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,280
I'll do it.

575
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,080
I'll do it.

576
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,920
I'll do it.

577
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,720
I'll do it.

578
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,440
I'll do it.

579
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,160
I'll do it.

580
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,960
I'll do it.

581
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,760
I'll do it.

582
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,480
I'll do it.

583
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
The report is done.

584
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,200
Really?

585
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,880
So fast?

586
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,200
I guess you can't

587
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
finish these two new ones.

588
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,520
Thank you, General.

589
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,400
It's a miracle

590
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,600
that I can finish this job.

591
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,880
Hello?

592
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,600
Are you here

593
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,880
to call for your victory

594
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,960
or to defame me?

595
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,200
oy victory is victory.

596
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Or to insult me?

597
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,560
A righteous and glorious victory is a victory.

598
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
You're a real man.

599
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
What's there to be proud of?

600
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
If it weren't for you,

601
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
how would General find me?

602
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
What he did was wrong.

603
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
It has nothing to do with who he was investigating.

604
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
You still think that

605
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
your habits are not wrong?

606
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
This world is not a natural one.

607
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
A reasonable desire can be exchanged for a higher one.

608
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Because I

609
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
have thousands of shares and employees' profits or close profits.

610
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Do you think in their eyes,

611
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
you're a bad person or I'm a bad person?

612
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Forget it.

613
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm not here to discuss with you about desires and rules.

614
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I just want to tell you

615
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
General is a soft-hearted person.

616
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Even if he's honest with you,

617
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
he won't be cruel to report you.

618
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
But I'm different.

619
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
I treat people and things

620
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
that I don't recognize as clean.

621
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
So I hope you

622
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
stop all illegal cooperation

623
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
and leave MH immediately.

624
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Otherwise, I will continue to target you.

625
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Target you to nothing.

626
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
That's it?

627
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
You're pitying me?

628
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
You don't have anything to pity me for.

629
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
First,

630
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
to me,

631
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
MH has a different meaning.

632
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
I don't want the company

633
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
to suffer because of you.

634
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Second,

635
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
I don't want you to

636
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
suffer because of me.

637
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Second,

638
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
you helped me

639
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
and General.

640
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
I owe you once.

641
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
So,

642
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
as long as you stop,

643
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
everything

644
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
will be fine.

645
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
So I have to thank you?

646
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
You're welcome.

647
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Thank you.

648
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Thank you.

649
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Chuan.

650
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Chuan.

651
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Sorry.

652
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
The subscriber you dialed is not available.

653
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Please redial later.

654
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Sorry.

655
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
I let Ashin forget.

656
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
I let Ashin forget.

657
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
It's a night.

658
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,200
What are you looking forward to?

659
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
I love you.

660
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
It's true.

661
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I can't stop thinking of you.

662
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Every minute, every second.

663
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Baby, I love you.

664
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
It's true.

665
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Because you exist,

666
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I can't stop thinking of you.

667
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I love you.

668
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
I love you.

669
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
I love you.

670
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
I love you.

671
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
I love you.

672
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I love you.

673
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Because you exist,

674
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I can understand

675
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,200
that everything is falling for you.

676
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,200
That everything is falling for you.

677
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
I love you.

678
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
I love you.

679
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
I love you.

680
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
I love you.

681
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
I love you.

682
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
I love you.

683
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
I love you.

684
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I love you.

685
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
I love you.

686
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I love you.

687
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I love you.

688
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
I love you.

689
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
I love you.

690
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
I love you.

691
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I love you.

692
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I love you.

693
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I love you.

694
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
I love you.

695
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,500
Can I say it?

696
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,180
I love you.

697
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
Can I say it?

698
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Can I say it?

699
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,180
I love you.

700
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,180
I love you.

701
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,180
I love you.

702
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,180
I love you, baby.

703
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
I love you.

704
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
Kiss.

705
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Kiss.

706
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Are you still willing to celebrate with me?

707
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,140
I thought...

708
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,380
You must love me.

709
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,740
I will cross with no doubt

710
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,780
Lily

711
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm a silly moth

712
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,780
I need to apologize to you

713
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,940
sincerely

714
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,900
I know that

715
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,260
I've been

716
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,260
enjoying your kindness

717
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,700
in the right way

718
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,500
You also know that

719
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,340
I'm not good at expressing my feelings

720
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,180
in a good way

721
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,700
If you don't like it

722
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,660
I will change

723
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,460
And

724
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,180
about the 72-hour argument

725
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,020
Actually, I want to say

726
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,900
in a relationship

727
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,540
I think the most important thing

728
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,780
is that when the impulse is withdrawn

729
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,500
there is still a heart

730
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
that wants to be with each other forever

731
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,180
This person

732
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,380
is not humorous

733
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,340
But I can play the guitar

734
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,940
and drink with you

735
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,700
Lily

736
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,860
I want to be with you

737
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,660
for the rest of my life

738
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,740
This is the most sincere revenge

739
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,060
I can give you

740
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,220
Can you accept it?

741
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,540
I think I'm blind

742
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,740
Don't know how to feel

743
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,540
Don't know how to hear

744
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,540
You walk so fast

745
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,900
Can't catch your light

746
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,500
You flash away

747
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,780
Leave all the things behind

748
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,700
End of story

749
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,260
Leave all love nowhere

750
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,300
to find

751
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,940
You don't have to answer anything

752
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,780
Just say you love me

753
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,580
By the way

754
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,100
When will you play the guitar?

755
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Isn't that simple?

756
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,540
Just six strings

757
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,900
Then

758
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,980
Did you sleep on purpose?

759
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,420
Are you afraid that my wife

760
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,980
will be cheated by others?

761
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,780
I really don't understand

762
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,420
How to play the guitar

763
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,700
How charming it is

764
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,580
Of course it's charming

765
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,540
When that light

766
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,900
hit your head

767
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,900
It really caught my attention

768
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,220
It's our 72 hours

769
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,020
You have to come back

770
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,540
Do you have a gift for me?

771
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,620
Yes

772
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,020
It's for you

773
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,100
What is it?

774
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,380
This?

775
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,020
I learned it loudly

776
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,300
It's a priceless treasure

777
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,100
Otherwise people will not accept it

778
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,180
Since it's a priceless treasure

779
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,620
I have to find it carefully

780
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,540
What's wrong?

781
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,380
Are you okay?

782
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,260
What's wrong?

783
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,620
I'm fine

784
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,460
A little dizzy

785
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,180
Are you...

786
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,620
You...

787
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:08,980
Hello, Mr. Jiang

788
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,740
The recommendation letter event this time

789
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,980
The headquarters has transferred

790
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,940
all your work information

791
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,620
for investigation

792
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,580
You need to wait for

793
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,620
the proposal of the headquarters hearing

794
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,580
Okay

795
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,420
I will do my best to cooperate with the company's investigation

796
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,060
Wait

797
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,220
I want to ask

798
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,500
I submitted the resignation application

799
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,860
for personal reasons

800
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,220
Is it in the process?

801
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,820
We don't have your

802
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,540
resignation application

803
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,100
in the system, right?

804
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,300
No?

805
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:36,940
No

806
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,300
Maybe I remembered it wrong

807
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,580
Okay

808
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:40,860
Okay

809
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,300
Bye

810
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,020
Bye

811
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,700
How is your condition?

812
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,580
How is it?

813
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,980
I was punished for half a year

814
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,340
and canceled the end of the year bonus

815
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,660
I think you will support me

816
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,660
in the second half of the year

817
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,700
I'm sorry

818
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,540
Don't worry

819
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,740
I will support you

820
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,740
in the second half of the year

821
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,780
I have another thing

822
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,620
I went to see Du Lei today

823
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,060
He decided to resign

824
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,300
and he will not

825
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,420
enter the same circle anymore

826
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,020
Really?

827
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,740
That's good

828
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,260
It's good for him and the company

829
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,300
Jiang Jun

830
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,940
Actually

831
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,340
If you still have something you like

832
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,900
or don't want to change

833
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,500
and want to continue

834
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,260
Then you should follow your heart

835
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,780
and be brave

836
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,300
Why do you say that?

837
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,220
Although it's your decision to resign

838
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,060
I gave you a lot of pressure

839
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,660
after all

840
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,980
It caused you to change your mind

841
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,500
Actually

842
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,100
No matter how much we love each other

843
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,860
it doesn't mean

844
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,980
we have to change ourselves for each other

845
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,580
So

846
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,140
No matter

847
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,220
whether you will resign

848
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,140
or stay in the first line

849
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,620
whether you want to stay in the first line

850
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
or come to Ji Yi

851
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,300
I will respect your idea

852
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,300
You are so nice

853
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,740
He really said it

854
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,940
So

855
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,100
Do you want to resign?

856
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,180
That was my plan

857
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,340
But it seems

858
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,620
I want to go on

859
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,660
You know it

860
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,620
You Force

861
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,460
me to be nice

862
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,780
how old he is.

863
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,860
Of course you remember.

864
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,220
That's it.

865
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,460
At most, less than two months.

866
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,660
Yeah.

867
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,540
At a glance,

868
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,260
Wang Cai is 13 years old.

869
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,500
Wang Cai,

870
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,500
thank you for being with me

871
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,020
when I was away.

872
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,980
We'll take good care of you.

873
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,940
Don't worry.

874
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,140
We haven't taken a picture together.

875
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,260
Take a picture.

876
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,140
Let's go.

877
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:25,740
Come on.

878
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,020
One, two, three.

879
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,340
One more.

880
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,300
Three, two, one.

881
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,980
Then you'll be staying every day of my life.

882
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,100
I think I'm tired.

883
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,700
I think I'm blind.

884
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,780
Don't know how to feel.

885
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,700
Don't know how to heal.

886
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,100
Your words are so sweet.

887
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,300
I can't help but feel it.

888
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,700
I can't help but feel it.

889
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,100
I can't help but feel it.

890
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,300
I can't help but feel it.

891
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,700
So fast.

892
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,500
Can't catch your light.

893
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,900
You fly so high.

894
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,100
Leave all the things behind.

895
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,500
End our story.

896
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:17,100
Leave our love nowhere to find.

897
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,700
End our story.
