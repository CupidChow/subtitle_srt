00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,540
little bit of a

3
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,380
little bit of a

4
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
little bit of a

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
little bit of a

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,340
little bit of a

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,340
little bit of a

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,340
little bit of a

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
little bit of a

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,880
little bit of a

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:12,880
little bit of a

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,880
little bit

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,880
a

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
little bit

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,880
相信

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,300
Happy magnet eaters

17
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,620
Super Jam

18
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,540
Previously on...

19
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,380
Super Jam

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,420
leads you to a Stanford Park

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,240
but when you 28

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,160
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
Let's call the police.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,160
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,760
Who are you?

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,480
We are the members of MH.

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,840
Someone has reported to us that

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,880
you have bribed us.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,800
Please cooperate with us to take the investigation.

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,720
Bribed?

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,880
Yes.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,080
Me?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
Are you kidding me?

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,680
Please cooperate with us.

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,480
If the truth doesn't exist,

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,040
we will clear your name.

38
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,600
Okay, I'll go with you.

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,640
This way, please.

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,080
What's going on?

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,040
I don't know.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,160
What happened?

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,200
What happened?

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,000
Those people look like

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,400
members of the He Gui headquarters.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
They said Mr. Yuan was bribed.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
How is that possible?

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,440
Yes, how is that possible?

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
You two are here.

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
I'm here.

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm here.

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm here.

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm here.

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
I'm here.

55
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm here.

56
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm here.

57
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,320
I'm here.

58
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,280
What you are doing is wrong.

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,840
Even if you are from the headquarters,

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,160
you can't just break other people's things.

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,040
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,520
Please don't interfere with our work.

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,560
Put it down.

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,800
Tell me.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,160
The former colleague of the headquarters

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,280
called and said

67
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,120
someone reported to us that

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
the boss was in a serious crisis.

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,960
He doesn't know the specific cause.

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,600
Serious crisis?

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
How is that possible?

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
I don't believe it either.

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,360
But he hasn't heard the specific cause yet.

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,920
He even asked me for help.

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
Does Mr. Qiao know?

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,600
Yes, he doesn't know.

77
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,680
What about Mr. Ma?

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,280
Isn't he transferred to the headquarters?

79
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,000
Mr. Ma?

80
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,160
His father's boss is in trouble.

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
What can he do?

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
The headquarters sent someone here in such a hurry.

83
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,040
He shouldn't have thought of it.

84
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,520
The boss is in trouble this time.

85
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,560
But don't worry.

86
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,160
We have to trust the boss.

87
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,080
And Mr. Fan is here.

88
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,520
The boss will be fine.

89
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,120
Let's wait patiently.

90
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,840
Okay.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,440
If there's any news,

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,360
tell me immediately.

93
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,120
Okay.

94
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,000
Such a big shock.

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,760
Mr. Yan.

96
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,720
Someone is reporting that

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,960
you're taking over the contract of Chen Xing Technology, Zhu You Yi.

98
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,200
Do you admit it?

99
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,320
No.

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,960
But in your account,

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,040
you received a large amount of money from Zhu You Yi

102
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,320
last month.

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
How do you explain it?

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,760
Zhu You Yi is both my client

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,000
and my friend.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,080
I lent him that money.

107
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,560
Do you have a contract

108
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,320
or a loan contract?

109
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
I've said it.

110
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,680
I have a good relationship

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,520
with Zhu You Yi.

112
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,840
I don't need a contract between him and me.

113
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,520
For this matter,

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
I can confront Mr. Zhu in person.

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,240
Then let's invite Dr. Zhu in.

116
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,520
Dr. Zhu.

117
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,120
I want to ask you

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
if you have ever

119
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,640
bribe our ED.

120
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,520
Yes.

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,480
Did he accept your bribe?

122
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,040
He did.

123
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
Zhu You Yi.

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,720
What are you talking about?

125
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,280
I've been thinking about

126
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,760
Chen Xing Technology's future

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,000
and I've been thinking about it.

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,640
Why are you blaming me?

129
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,480
Yuan Shuai.

130
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,760
Stop pretending.

131
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,360
Is it useful?

132
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
If there's no interest,

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,960
how could you

134
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,320
help me

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,240
in my most difficult time?

136
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,280
I'm treating you

137
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
as my true friend.

138
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,600
That's why I lent you the money.

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,720
Lend you the money?

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Who bought you?

141
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
How much did he spend?

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,760
Yuan Shuai.

143
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,120
Mind your attitude.

144
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
I think in this matter,

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
there must be some misunderstanding.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,040
I brought Yuan Shuai out.

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,360
I know his character.

148
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,920
Mr. Fan.

149
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,360
You don't know your own face.

150
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,240
I know Yuan Shuai is your favorite.

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
But don't say it so bluntly.

152
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,280
Whether it's borrowing money or bribery,

153
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,160
Dr. Zhu.

154
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,280
What's your relationship

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,720
with Yuan Shuai?

156
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
Here's the thing.

157
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,600
More than a year ago,

158
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,440
Yuan Shuai became the person in charge

159
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,840
of the remodeling of the company's financing and assets.

160
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
I wasted a lot of money

161
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
because of the mistake I made.

162
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,520
The company is going to close down.

163
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,120
When Yuan Shuai saw my project,

164
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
he thought it was promising.

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
He encouraged me to make a loan

166
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,920
and hinted that

167
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
I would give him a refund

168
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
after the financing was done.

169
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I agreed

170
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,840
and gave him a sum of money.

171
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,320
Not long ago,

172
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,160
my friend,

173
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,400
the student in charge of the debt collection,

174
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,280
helped me to invest a lot of money.

175
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I gave him five million in return.

176
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,280
Mr. Yuan.

177
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,920
Is it true what Dr. Zhu said?

178
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm not telling the truth.

179
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,000
No one will believe it.

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Then, Dr. Zhu,

181
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,160
do you have any evidence?

182
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,120
This

183
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,720
is the remodeling certificate.

184
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,400
Because it was the first time,

185
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,440
he was inexperienced

186
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,440
and afraid of being discovered by other shareholders.

187
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,800
So he gave him cash

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,920
and didn't take it.

189
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
This time,

190
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,120
I gave him

191
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
the money for the personal account.

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,600
Actually, I don't care about the money.

193
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,200
I just need to have the money to develop it.

194
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,280
But he actually

195
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
made an excessive request.

196
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
He said that after Chen Xin was listed,

197
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,520
as a health agent,

198
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
he would take Chen Xin's original stock

199
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,160
and make a big profit.

200
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
I don't want to be kidnapped by him.

201
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,760
But he is the leader

202
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
of the investment bank.

203
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
So I can only report to MH

204
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,960
about this matter.

205
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,320
Zhu You Yi, Zhu You Yi.

206
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,760
That's great.

207
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
Why didn't I see you

208
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
as such a person?

209
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,760
Yuan Shuai,

210
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,280
you are suspected of bribery and corruption.

211
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,360
You have severely violated

212
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,560
the working discipline of MH.

213
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,240
We will investigate all your projects

214
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,760
according to the company's rules.

215
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,560
Yes.

216
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,440
Go ahead.

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Do whatever you want.

218
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,600
Wait.

219
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,720
I have to say this.

220
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,880
Yuan Shuai has always been

221
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,760
a harsh person to MH.

222
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
So we can't just

223
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,400
listen to one side of the story

224
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,760
or bribe records

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,320
and charge Yuan Shuai.

226
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,080
Mr. Fan, don't worry.

227
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,080
As of now,

228
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,760
things are not that bad.

229
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,160
I will personally

230
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
plead with the headquarters and the board of directors

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,400
to let Yuan Shuai come out.

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,360
Don't make things

233
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,280
so bad.

234
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,360
At most,

235
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,440
we can just cancel

236
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,760
his qualification as a health agent

237
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,760
and enter the market.

238
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
It's not that serious.

239
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,440
It seems that

240
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,640
things are not that bad

241
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,400
now.

242
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
Whether I do it or not

243
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,600
doesn't matter anymore.

244
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,440
The truth is not important at all.

245
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,080
What's important is that

246
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,960
someone wants me to take this path.

247
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,480
No matter what,

248
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
the result is the same.

249
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Mr. Yuan,

250
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,760
I also thought about MH's reputation.

251
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,840
In that case,

252
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,200
I should thank Mr. Lin

253
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,680
for being lenient.

254
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,240
Mr. Lin is really something.

255
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
He gave me such a big surprise

256
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,720
as soon as he came back.

257
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
It's your fault

258
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,480
that you were careless.

259
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,720
You didn't know how to use people.

260
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,040
Really?

261
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,480
There are only the two of us here.

262
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,440
Tell me.

263
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,360
What exactly do you want to do?

264
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,920
I want to be a doctor.

265
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
I want to be a doctor.

266
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,080
I want to be a doctor.

267
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,120
I want to be a doctor.

268
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
I want to be a doctor.

269
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
I want to be a doctor.

270
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I want to be a doctor.

271
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
I want to be a doctor.

272
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
I want to be a doctor.

273
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
You see me,

274
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,280
even though I can't work right now,

275
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,520
I still believe in grams and months

276
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,000
to live on,

277
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
so I will make stop motion.

278
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,640
Or這個問題

279
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,160
is there anything

280
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,760
that you want to revolutionize around the environment

281
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,520
such as the origin of the new invention?

282
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,000
How do we end up

283
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,160
fifteen billion in 300 years?

284
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,840
People from the future

285
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,880
and the future

286
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
to purchase the shares of three non-sales companies in advance.

287
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,600
And then, they will collect the client's funds of 1,947 million yuan.

288
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,680
The profit is 8.68 million yuan.

289
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,560
In 2013, your wife, Wuji Technology,

290
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,520
became the fourth major shareholder of Fengshang Technology.

291
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,880
She invested 700,000 yuan or 650,000 yuan.

292
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,360
She has a 1.723% share.

293
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,840
In 2015, Fengshang Technology officially went public.

294
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,480
Until recently, Wuji Technology

295
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,440
held the shares of Fengshang Technology.

296
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,320
It's about 10 million yuan.

297
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,920
It's 14.2 times higher.

298
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,680
Enough.

299
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Stop being a loser.

300
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,480
How can you take me on

301
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,600
when you have no evidence?

302
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,920
Let me ask you again.

303
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,080
Why are you investigating the C Group?

304
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,760
Mr. Lin, why are you so nervous

305
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,800
when I mention C Group?

306
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,080
Are you trying to tell me

307
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,080
that if I have the information about C Group,

308
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,600
I can do something about you?

309
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,320
Let's change the topic.

310
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,080
I heard that you and your analyst

311
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,720
have a good relationship.

312
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,920
Are you close to Jiang Jun?

313
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,120
Jiang Jun

314
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,040
is the one who was kicked out of MH by me.

315
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
You brought him back.

316
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
So you kicked him out.

317
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
He is not capable and has poor academic ability.

318
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,240
If I don't hire him,

319
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,280
what do you think will happen?

320
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,640
But Mr. Lin,

321
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,880
why do you always mention someone irrelevant?

322
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,520
Nothing.

323
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,000
Yuan Shuai.

324
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,720
I was just being nice to you.

325
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,040
I didn't warn you.

326
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
If you keep doing this to me,

327
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,920
it won't be that easy next time.

328
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,040
Including your parents abroad,

329
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,640
they also run a company abroad.

330
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,600
If I want a company to go bankrupt,

331
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,280
it won't be hard for me.

332
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,440
Lin Taimo, I'm warning you.

333
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
Don't touch my parents.

334
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,040
Okay.

335
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,680
As long as you leave MH immediately,

336
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,360
and go abroad immediately,

337
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
never come back.

338
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,040
Also,

339
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,480
please shut up.

340
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,380
It is a vineyard,

341
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,440
in a youngFi.

342
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,560
I will see you again.

343
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,480
You may not let me close the door tonight.

344
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,960
But I think

345
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,440
you will welcome me inside,

346
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,000
and also

347
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,680
I have all the information in my hand.

348
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,360
Su Chang has it all.

349
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Su Chang.

350
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,800
You and Qiao Na

351
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,440
have to figure out

352
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,600
all the progress of the project.

353
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
Everyone

354
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,720
has to continue

355
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,560
the unfinished work.

356
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,640
The last thing.

357
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
When the company

358
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
re-divides the project,

359
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,480
you can report to the new leader

360
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
for yourself.

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
You can go back to work.

362
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,120
President Yuan.

363
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,920
President Yuan.

364
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,720
President Yuan.

365
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,360
President Yuan.

366
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,840
Boss, I'll go wherever you go.

367
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,800
I said go back to work.

368
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Didn't you hear me?

369
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,920
What are you doing?

370
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,240
Go back to work.

371
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
General department.

372
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,120
General him.

373
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,520
General him.

374
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
General him.

375
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:25,040
Do you

376
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,080
Mr. Fan,

377
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,560
don't you like Mr. Yuan the most?

378
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,320
Qiao Na,

379
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,240
don't worry about it.

380
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,240
The most important thing now

381
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,920
is to transfer the work

382
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,160
that Mr. Yuan has left behind

383
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
and stabilize the mood

384
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
of the following days.

385
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,320
Someone will make up for Mr. Yuan's

386
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,680
lack of time.

387
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,840
All right.

388
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,680
Go back to work.

389
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,560
Okay.

390
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,240
Hello, Lin Fei.

391
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,440
You know Mr. He Gui better than me.

392
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
I want you to help me ask him something.

393
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,520
What is the reason

394
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
for the meeting with our head office today?

395
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,960
Okay.

396
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,280
I'll wait for your news.

397
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,120
Thank you.

398
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
Did Mr. Yuan resign

399
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,080
or was he fired?

400
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,040
How many crimes

401
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
did he commit?

402
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,440
Who would be so rude to the company?

403
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,040
Did he really resign?

404
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,920
Jiang Jun,

405
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,560
what do you think?

406
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,680
Yuan Shuai.

407
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,680
Where are you going?

408
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,200
Yuan Shuai.

409
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,040
Yuan Shuai.

410
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,480
Why isn't he answering my call?

411
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,760
Boss, are you okay?

412
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,400
Why didn't you answer my call?

413
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,360
Yuan Shuai,

414
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,400
I've asked someone

415
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
to help you with your case.

416
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,040
Don't worry.

417
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Yuan Shuai,

418
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
why did you answer my call?

419
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm begging you.

420
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,040
Don't scare me, okay?

421
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,800
Yuan Shuai,

422
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,880
no matter what happens,

423
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,600
I'll always be on your side.

424
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

425
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,280
I'm not afraid of you.

426
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
I'm not afraid of you.

427
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

428
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,320
I'm not afraid of you.

429
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,560
I'm not afraid of you.

430
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
I'm not afraid of you.

431
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm not afraid of you.

432
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,320
I don't want to see you.

433
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,560
I'll be standing behind you

434
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,560
in every situation.

435
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,840
I'm going to resign tomorrow

436
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,800
and leave with you.

437
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,840
Don't leave me

438
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,720
and leave me alone.

439
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
I'm sorry, Jiang Jun.

440
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,680
I'll explain it to you later.

441
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,520
Go home now.

442
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,720
Don't ask me anything.

443
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,560
Don't come to me.

444
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,960
No.

445
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,640
I won't give up until I see you.

446
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,440
Where are you?

447
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,320
I'll go to you.

448
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,560
Okay.

449
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,160
Come to me then.

450
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,560
Okay.

451
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,480
Okay.

452
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,240
You're making me anxious.

453
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,160
Don't come over.

454
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,240
Do you really want to know?

455
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
Of course.

456
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I love you.

457
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
No matter how bad the situation is,

458
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm willing to go on with you.

459
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,520
Go on with me?

460
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,120
If I tell you

461
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,320
that I'm a person who is corrupt,

462
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,400
and is a person who is selfish,

463
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,640
will you still go on with me?

464
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,560
Today,

465
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
Zhu You Yi came to expose me.

466
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:39,880
Tell meization of the

467
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,560
NOx Groupname.

468
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm sorry.

469
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Don't joke around, okay?

470
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Can you tell me the truth?

471
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Jiang Jun.

472
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Since ancient times,

473
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
how many people can resist the temptation of money and power?

474
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Especially in our investment circle,

475
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,240
after so many years, everyone will change.

476
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
I don't understand.

477
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Everyone has desires.

478
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I'm sorry.

479
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
I lied to you again.

480
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm not the person who can bring you hope and light.

481
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
But it's okay.

482
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Just take it as the last lesson.

483
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
What do you mean?

484
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
I booked a flight tonight.

485
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm going abroad.

486
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Probably...

487
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
I probably won't come back again.

488
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
We two...

489
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
are separated.

490
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
I'm sorry.

491
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Do you want to break up with me?

492
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
You can think like that.

493
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
From Silver Moon

494
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,240
I am missing you

495
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,240
My only sunlight

496
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Need you to be here

497
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Why you had to leave

498
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Please come back, my love

499
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Standing in a rain

500
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Xingyi.

501
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I need your arms to hold

502
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Look at my eyes and say it again.

503
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Every night you hurry back to me

504
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
When winter turns spring

505
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,240
I'm standing next to you

506
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,240
To leave the flowers grow

507
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Winter's gone so soon

508
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Snow's stars fall from the sky

509
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Enough.

510
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm going to miss the flight.

511
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Why?

512
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Still not giving up?

513
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Do you want a kiss

514
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
This year

515
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,240
To commemorate our short and funny love

516
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Why you had to leave

517
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Oh please come back, my love

518
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Standing in a rain

519
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
I need your arms to hold

520
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,240
I pray every night you hurry back to me

521
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
When winter turns spring

522
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I'm standing next to you

523
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:53,240
To leave the flowers grow

524
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Why you had to leave

525
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,240
Oh please come back, my love

526
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Standing in a rain

527
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,240
I need your arms to hold

528
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I pray every night you hurry back to me

529
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
When winter turns spring

530
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I'm standing next to you

531
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,240
To leave the flowers grow

532
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
I'm sorry.

533
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
So the principle of the interview today

534
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
The wolf stays

535
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
The sheep leaves

536
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,240
You and I are like ants and carps

537
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
You slowly climb

538
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
I roll down

539
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Some people have short sight

540
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Only know the benefits of seeing in front of them

541
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,240
So they earn fast and die fast

542
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
I'm different

543
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
I have a long sight

544
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
More interested in long-term benefits

545
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
I am a corrupt celebrity

546
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Conspired in the wild

547
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
We two

548
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
Thank you

549
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Liar

550
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
You lie a knife

551
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,240
I didn't do anything

552
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
Don't even know

553
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
This is the truth

554
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I thought

555
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,880
I think I'm blind

556
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,080
Don't know how I feel

557
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,160
Don't know how I feel

558
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,160
You walk so fast

559
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:12,200
Can't I just let you fly so high

560
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,600
Live on the sky's blue line

561
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,480
My heart's story lives on

562
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,360
You have nowhere to find

563
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,120
I think I'm blind

564
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,480
I think I'm blind

565
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,240
Don't know how I feel

566
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,480
Don't know how to heal

567
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,320
You walk so fast

568
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,680
Can't catch your light

569
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,440
You fly so high

570
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,760
Leave all the things behind

571
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,160
And our story lives out of nowhere

572
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,760
Jiang Jun

573
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,560
I will always be by your side

574
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,640
Always

575
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Episode 16

576
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,960
Boss, Yuan Shuai has left China.

577
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,040
Are you sure?

578
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,920
Yes.

579
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,200
Okay.

580
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,040
After ten hours,

581
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,080
follow his phone and computer IP closely.

582
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,120
I got it.

583
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,540
You have no choice but to leave.

584
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,120
Stop calling me.

585
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,400
The laptop power in out of power 정도.

586
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Now only one phone wide open can disturb me.

587
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,120
Frank restaurants before birth

588
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,600
Can't rag and take my change.

589
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Are you marriages to me?

590
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
You're crying again?

591
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Could it be Yuan Shuai

592
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
who dragged you into this?

593
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
How could she not be here?

594
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Go find her.

595
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
She's gone.

596
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
She's gone abroad.

597
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Why is she abroad again?

598
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
We broke up.

599
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
She probably won't come back.

600
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
What?

601
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Did she dump you?

602
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Did she dump you?

603
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
No.

604
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Who brought you here last night?

605
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
I came here by myself.

606
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
By yourself?

607
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
No.

608
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Yeah.

609
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,640
She didn't say she was going to the airport.

610
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
What are you talking about?

611
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Where's my phone?

612
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Wang Xiaochun,

613
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
did your brother contact you?

614
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
No.

615
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
My brother didn't contact me.

616
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
Okay.

617
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Once he contacts you,

618
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
you must tell me.

619
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Xiaochun,

620
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
what's wrong with you?

621
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Li Li,

622
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
I'm going to the hospital.

623
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
I'm going to the company.

624
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Why hasn't Xiaochun come to work today?

625
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Did something happen to her?

626
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
What's wrong with you today?

627
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
You don't like her the most.

628
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Why are you suddenly concerned about her?

629
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
None of your business.

630
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Xiaoting,

631
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
I think you should get along with Jiang Jun.

632
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
Why don't you call him

633
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
and ask him what's going on?

634
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
I sent him a message.

635
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
He hasn't replied to my message yet.

636
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Jiang Jun, you're finally here.

637
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Are you sick?

638
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Are you feeling better?

639
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
I'm much better.

640
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
Jiang Jun,

641
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
you're finally here.

642
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Finally, someone came to help us share the burden.

643
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Look at this.

644
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
This is what Mr. Yuan

645
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
looks like the first day he left.

646
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
To be honest,

647
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
I used to think

648
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Mr. Yuan is a man of a hard temper.

649
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
He's a little cold-hearted.

650
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
But now that he's gone,

651
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
our Dinghai God is like a walking thunder.

652
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
All departments are here to trouble us.

653
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
The little fish and the little shrimp are looking for tea every day.

654
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
I just heard from Xiao Jing

655
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
that a new person might come to the company today.

656
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
And he's Mr. Lin's personal assistant.

657
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
There's a new person coming so soon?

658
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Everyone, please put your work aside

659
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
and announce something to everyone.

660
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
I know everyone is busy.

661
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
Then I'll just open the door and see the business.

662
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Next is the new employee I hired for the investment department.

663
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Welcome him.

664
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Mr. Du is also a person with a strong personality in the investment department.

665
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I believe everyone knows a little bit about him.

666
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Then,

667
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
all the business in the investment department

668
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
will be handed over to him.

669
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
I hope everyone can cooperate actively.

670
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Mr. Du,

671
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm sorry.

674
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm sorry.

678
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
I'm sorry.

679
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
I'm sorry.

680
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
I'm sorry.

681
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm sorry.

682
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I'm sorry.

683
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
I'm sorry.

685
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,640
Mr. Du,

686
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,640
say a few words.

687
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Okay.

688
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Hello, everyone.

689
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
I'm Du Lei.

690
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
I'm very happy

691
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
to be able to come to MH

692
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
and work with everyone.

693
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
I hope everyone will pay more attention to the future.

694
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Thank you.

695
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Mr. Fan,

696
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
take Mr. Du to his new office.

697
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Jiang Jun,

698
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
come here.

699
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Sit down first.

700
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Thank you.

701
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
These past two days,

702
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
I asked my colleagues from the headquarters

703
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
to ask about something.

704
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Do you know

705
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,640
who gave the original letter of the report?

706
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Who?

707
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,640
It's the new MH's ED.

708
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Du Lei?

709
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Don't you think it's too coincidental?

710
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Yuan Shuai just left for a day,

711
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
and he's about to leave.

712
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
And it's said

713
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
he's a typical candidate for Lin Tai Mo.

714
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Yuan Shuai's trouble this time,

715
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
I think it's very likely

716
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
that it's the two of them

717
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
working together.

718
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
What does this have to do with Mr. Lin?

719
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
You've been here for a long time,

720
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
and you still can't tell?

721
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
The head of the investment department,

722
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Mr. Lin and Mr. Fan,

723
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
have never been in harmony.

724
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Mr. Lin has already left the headquarters,

725
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
but suddenly returned to the investment department.

726
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
This means he's starting to make some moves.

727
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
The first day he came back,

728
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
he transferred Ma Xiu Ran away.

729
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
This is a threat to Mr. Fan.

730
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Yuan Shuai,

731
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Mr. Fan's capable leader,

732
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
was forced to leave.

733
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
You still think

734
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
all of this is a victory?

735
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
Yuan Shuai.

736
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
First, let's welcome

737
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
Mr. Lin's return.

738
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
You'd better know

739
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
what you can say and what you can't say.

740
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
I'll be back.

741
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Hello, everyone.

742
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
I'm Du Lei.

743
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I'm very happy

744
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
to be able to come to MH

745
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
and work with everyone.

746
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
I hope you will take care of me

747
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
in the future.

748
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Thank you.

749
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Thank you.

750
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
Thank you.

751
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
Thank you.

752
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
Thank you.

753
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
Thank you.

754
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Thank you.

755
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
Thank you.

756
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
Thank you.

757
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Thank you for your support.

758
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,640
Thank you.

759
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Come in.

760
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Come in.

761
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
What?

762
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Are you here to celebrate

763
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
my joining MH?

764
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Why are you here at MH?

765
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

766
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
I just want to

767
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
give you a surprise.

768
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
I think I've adjusted it.

769
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
I can go back to the workplace.

770
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
And MH

771
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
is the top company in China.

772
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
I think I won't refuse

773
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,640
if they give me a job.

774
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,640
Okay.

775
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Congratulations, Mr. Du.

776
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Let's have a meal together.

777
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
Come on.

778
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
What's wrong with your face?

779
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Nothing.

780
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
I'm a little allergic.

781
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Mr. Du.

782
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I already know

783
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
that you wrote the letter of report.

784
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
Since you're my friend,

785
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
I don't want you to

786
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
put the charges of MH

787
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
on Yuan Shuai

788
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
and be used as a gun.

789
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Are you sure you won't try it?

790
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
The future is good.

791
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
I know him well.

792
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
He won't do

793
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
such a thing.

794
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
And I believe

795
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
he will do it for the rest of his life.

796
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
If you keep

797
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
going against him,

798
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
I can only stand on his side.

799
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
I have both the witness and the witness.

800
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Why do you believe

801
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
he doesn't believe me?

802
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
It's a long life.

803
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
I will definitely

804
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
find out about Yuan Shuai

805
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
and help him figure it out.

806
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
And as a friend,

807
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
I'll give you the last advice.

808
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
I hope that

809
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
the gun will turn around

810
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,640
and you won't hurt yourself.

811
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
I'll go first.

812
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
I'm going to be happy.

813
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
I'm going to be someone.

814
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
I'm going to be someone.

815
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm going to be someone.

816
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
I'm going to be someone.

817
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
I'm going to be someone.

818
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
I'm going to be someone.

819
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
I'm going to be someone.

820
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
I'm going to be someone.

821
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
I'm going to be someone.

822
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
I'm going to be someone.

823
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,640
I'm going to be someone.

824
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
I'm going to be someone.

825
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
I'm going to be someone.

826
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I'm going to be someone.

827
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
I'm going to be someone.

828
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
I'm going to be someone.

829
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
I'm going to be someone.

830
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
I'm going to be someone.

831
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
I'm going to be someone.

832
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
I'm going to be someone.

833
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,640
I'm going to be someone.

834
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,640
I'm going to be someone.

835
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
I'm going to be someone.

836
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140
Try to understand

837
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,140
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

838
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
You can tell me lies

839
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,140
You can make me cry

840
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,140
You know why

841
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,140
Never been so brave

842
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,640
I will run away

843
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,140
If it's what you want

844
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,140
What you like

845
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,640
I don't mind

846
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
I can close my eyes

847
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,640
I can stay behind with my time

848
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,140
Walk into your plan

849
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,640
Like I never knew you were not mine

850
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,640
Make you satisfied

851
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Wear another mask

852
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,140
You never realize things I do for love

853
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,640
I think I'm tired

854
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,140
I think I'm blind

855
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,140
Don't know how to feel

856
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,140
Don't know how to heal

857
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,140
You walk so fast

858
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Can't catch your light

859
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,140
You fly so high

860
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,640
Leave all the things behind

861
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,640
And our story

862
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,640
Leave all of nowhere to find

863
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,640
I think I'm tired

864
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,640
I think I'm blind

865
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,640
Don't know how to feel

866
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Don't know how to heal

867
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,140
You walk so fast

868
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,640
Can't catch your light

869
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,140
You fly so high

870
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,140
Leave all the things behind

871
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,640
And our story

872
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:44,140
Leave all of nowhere to find
