00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When you were a kid, you even said the wrong subject.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You mentioned this to me again.

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sorry, I forgot to open the door.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mr. Yuan, I'm going out.

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hello, happy birthday.

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Happy birthday. Thank you.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Du, let's work together more.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Dad.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I wish you good health.

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Happy birthday.

16
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Dad, happy birthday.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I thought you wouldn't come.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It seems that your sister is kind.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How could it be, dad?

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Du is really busy these days.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Did I ask you?

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Since you are busy, don't come.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Without this sincerity, why do you have to force yourself?

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hypocrisy.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Since you are here, you have to remember that today is my birthday dinner.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you put this mask on, you can leave now.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I see.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then you take care of yourself.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sorry.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's okay.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Boss Du, that's your daughter-in-law.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are so beautiful. Come and meet her.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Linda, come here.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let me introduce you.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is Mr. Zhai and Mrs. Zhai.

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is Mr. Zhai.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is my daughter Linda.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Linda is so beautiful.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She looks young and also has the same age as my little Zhai.

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Linda.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Linda.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Linda.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mrs. Zhai is talking to you.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I thought you left.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I left today.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You won't let me come again.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Tomorrow to today, you won't just send me a gift.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You have to show your talent before you can leave.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are joking.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It doesn't mean that you are not bad.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know you don't want to come back with me.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But dad treats you like his own son.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You should be more understanding of him.

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My own son?

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What do you think of him?

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I am just a substitute.

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I never see you as a substitute.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
In my heart, you are my only substitute.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are you.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What?

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's been 25 minutes.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Did you get the result?

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I did.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Congratulations.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Congratulations.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I need your help.

70
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Thank you.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will take care of you.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Mr. Wan.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Congratulations on your dream to become the CEO of Man Xin.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am sorry.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's talk next time.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let me introduce myself.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I am the CEO of Ji Yi investment bank.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I am the CEO of Ji Yi investment bank.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I am the CEO of Ji Yi investment bank.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mr. Du.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You are welcome.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am Li Wei's secretary.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I am a company employee.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I should do my job.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I don't have any special position.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I am sorry.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wan Xin has been through a lot this time.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She has reached a peak.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Your last job was a great news for Man Xin IPO.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mr. Du is an old man.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He is very wise.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But it's a pity.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
M&H has been a very successful partner when Mr. Du was here.

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So...

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think you misunderstood.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I am not here to steal the voice.

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I just want to remind you that I know Yuan Shuai very well.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's not easy to save people.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it's not him who cooperates.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But if you want to ask the manager,

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can only say one thing.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No need.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Mr. Wan.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I believe you will be active soon.

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Thank you.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Come on.

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Come on.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Lily.

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Give me a cup of coffee.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Stop drinking coffee.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Drink this.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How is my new style?

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My white hair.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am so handsome.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So beautiful.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You can work, you can have a rest.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You can even take a shower.

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Junjun.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What's wrong with you?

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What kind of man is Yuan Shuai?

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Did I really owe him in my last life?

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Did he bully you again?

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I will help you to deal with him.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There may be some misunderstanding in the office today.

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I am working on a case with him.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And then Mr. Qiao hit me.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
When Mr. Qiao hit me,

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I felt a little awkward with Yuan Shuai.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Junjun.

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You seem to have triggered the classic style of the school of the Three-legged Dog.

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What?

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is your boss very beautiful and domineering?

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Does he like to find Yuan Shuai?

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And he never knocks on the door in Yuan Shuai's office.

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So what's the conclusion?

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I really want to save one.

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Or you seem to be his eyes.

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So bloodthirsty.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's the next plot?

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You tell me, I want to save myself.

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Next, he will find you to test your power.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And he will watch you from time to time.

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Until he catches your little whip.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then he will beat you down with a stick.

151
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Morning.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Morning, Mr. Qiao.

155
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The most obvious difference between a man and a bandit is the sense of ritual.

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This tells us that the sense of ritual is very important.

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Working in the bank also needs a sense of ritual.

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't wear these online newspapers to work anymore.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Online...

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Next, he will find you to test your power.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And...

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He will watch you from time to time.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Until he catches your little whip.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then he will beat you down with a stick.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Is he really so bloodthirsty?

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have read the report.

167
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Chen Yicheng.

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's good.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Mr. Chen.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Mr. Yuan said your report was interesting yesterday.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Can I have a look?

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You are all internship period.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This case can help you grow quickly.

175
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And you can quickly select who is the last person to stay in MH.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Everyone.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You are both comrades and opponents.

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Good luck.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Please.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The wind of freedom blows.

181
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
May the wind of freedom and freedom of learning blow.

182
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Beware of the Star Wars.

183
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Translating it into Chinese means...

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Do your own thing.

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It seems that this misunderstanding is not only bloodthirsty.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's becoming a war literature.

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The data of the operating capital is not correct.

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Re-calculate.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Find out the speed of the ratio.

190
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Go.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There is a problem.

193
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The transfer rate of the total assets and the stock is being re-calculated.

194
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There is a problem.

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Come in.

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mr. Yuan, you want the file.

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay, you can help me later.

199
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There is a problem.

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Everyone has worked hard today.

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Pack up and get off work.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Later, please go to eat a very delicious supper.

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay.

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Mr. Yuan, I have something urgent at home.

206
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll go first.

207
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No, General.

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Are you sick?

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No, General.

211
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you sick?

212
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you under too much pressure or are you suffering from an illness?

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You have to treat your illness.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Please don't chat during working hours.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You are the one who has an illness.

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Are you okay?

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm fine.

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What happened?

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you need me to call the police?

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, thank you.

222
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Last night, we saw a girl coming out of her office.

223
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It was almost 3 o'clock.

224
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Miss Zhang, aren't you going to work today?

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I have to go to work.

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll see you later.

227
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Bye.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Bye.

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Bye.

231
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Bye.

232
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Bye.

233
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Bye.

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Bye.

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Bye.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Bye.

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Bye.

238
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Bye.

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Bye.

240
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Bye.

241
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Bye.

242
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Bye.

243
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Bye.

244
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Bye.

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Bye.

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Bye.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Bye.

248
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Bye.

249
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Bye.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Bye.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Bye.

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Excuse me.

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
See you later.

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I didn't tell you that I was going to work in G.E.

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I apologize.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But I'm telling the truth.

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you would think

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that our companies have a competitive relationship and I was afraid you would feel stressed.

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Of course, I didn't confess my feelings.

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You should be angry.

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Mr. Du, you don't have to apologize to me.

262
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I didn't mean to blame you.

263
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If I don't ask you about your work,

264
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
will you still treat me as a friend?

265
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Of course.

266
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We are not enemies.

267
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm not that petty.

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's good.

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm leaving.

270
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
By the way,

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know what happened to you.

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But I think if you can't solve the problem,

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
just go with your feeling.

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I made egg fried rice.

275
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Come and get it.

276
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You made too much.

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I can't finish it.

278
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Come and get it.

279
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why are you avoiding me?

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is it because you are hard to be yourself

281
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but feel inferior to me?

282
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So you started playing the love-hate-for-save game.

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Did you grow up by self-hypnosis?

284
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If there's nothing else, I'll go back first.

285
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Hey.

286
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If you are really angry,

287
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
don't put it on paper.

288
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm not angry.

289
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm just worried about you.

290
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If you are really angry,

291
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
don't put it on paper.

292
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Put it there.

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Are you crazy?

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Mr. Wu will kill me.

295
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Don't worry.

296
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've already told Mr. Wu.

297
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll take all the responsibility.

298
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You'll take it, right?

299
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay.

300
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
After 613,

301
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I never painted again.

302
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
613?

303
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What day is it?

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The day we broke up.

305
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The day we got the nickname 613.

306
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Jiang Jun.

307
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
To be honest,

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm suspecting that

309
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you are not suitable for Tou Heng.

310
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm not.

311
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm not.

312
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm not.

313
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is there a difference between not and not?

314
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Of course there is.

315
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I even think that

316
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
my own judgment is wrong.

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's a big achievement.

318
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Others are self-reliant.

319
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You are self-reliant.

320
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can't even be arrogant.

321
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Have you ever seen such a handsome man?

322
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You've changed your mind.

323
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What are you doing?

324
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I didn't change my mind.

325
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Look at your tail.

326
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Is it a sheep's tail?

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll give you a big one.

328
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What?

329
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Do you have a wolf's tail?

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'll bite you.

331
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Get away.

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't have teeth.

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm a cute wolf.

334
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll give you another one.

335
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Give me five.

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Get out.

337
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes.

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'll go.

339
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Stop.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I've been in the room for more than half an hour.

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Why hasn't he come out yet?

342
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What if he is criticized by Director Yuan?

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Even if he is criticized,

344
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
he will still be silent.

345
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's too quiet in here.

346
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Could it be that

347
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Director Yuan is the one who is calling him?

348
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I told you about Wanxin Entertainment last time.

349
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't think it's right.

350
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Do you think they have a problem?

351
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Where is the evidence?

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you can do a good job

353
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
just by guessing,

354
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
what else do you want?

355
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What's wrong?

356
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What?

357
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Look at it yourself.

358
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You're following me?

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm following you.

360
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What about the delusion certificate?

361
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
My time is very valuable.

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't have the elegance

363
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
to follow a newcomer

364
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
who can't even write a report.

365
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What did you tell me last time?

366
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You actively admit your mistake and beat the shit out of me.

367
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We are just ordinary friends.

368
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I didn't say that

369
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
we have to be together

370
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
because of the company's support.

371
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I just don't want to talk to him about work.

372
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The reason why this photo

373
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
can appear in my hand today

374
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
is that there are only two possibilities.

375
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
First, someone is fighting against Du Lei.

376
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Second, someone wants to fight against you.

377
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Do you think I don't like Du Lei

378
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and won't let you two get in touch?

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He will appear in my hand today.

380
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Tomorrow he may appear

381
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
in Mr. Fan's hand.

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
By that time,

383
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
what?

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you want to explain it to him

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
in front of Mr. Fan?

386
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I...

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I've said everything I should.

388
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's your private business

389
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to be willing to be friends with anyone.

390
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't care about your private business.

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Get out.

392
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You're still here?

393
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I forgot something.

394
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What else do you want to get out to piss me off?

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Why can't I reach it?

396
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm on my way for you

397
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Though it's I do

398
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Ready is I'm ready too

399
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And me is just a rock to you

400
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Hey, you're smiling, Yuan Shuai.

401
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't be angry.

402
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I know you're doing this for my own good.

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You care about me.

404
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You should talk to me nicely.

405
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Don't be so serious.

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You're so silly.

407
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So you're planning to

408
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
call your boss's name

409
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
in the company now?

410
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Yuan.

411
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Get out.

412
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

413
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Go get Shen Xing for me.

414
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Get out.

415
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What are you doing?

416
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Waiting for General.

417
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He's been in there for half an hour.

418
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He doesn't know what he's doing inside.

419
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I just heard

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the laughter coming from inside.

421
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Hello, Mr. Qiao.

422
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Well, Shen Xing.

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Mr. Yuan just asked you to come in.

424
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Mr. Qiao, we're leaving.

425
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Mr. Qiao, I'm going back too.

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Why did Wan Shan

427
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
have to work in a secret lounge?

428
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Why did a girl walk out

429
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
in the middle of the night?

430
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And the girl who was bullied

431
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
was also very strange.

432
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Such a big company

433
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
bullies a person like that.

434
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's not like they're making a movie.

435
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
How could they endure it?

436
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And that girl didn't call the police.

437
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
She seemed to have also

438
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
admitted to this.

439
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
There must be something wrong with this.

440
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If there's something that

441
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
can't be solved in a book,

442
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
then you should talk to the director.

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll talk to him.

444
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Okay.

445
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm leaving.

446
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Miss Qu Shui Ren, what a coincidence.

447
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Are you waiting for someone?

448
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
How about we continue

449
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
to play another game tonight?

450
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's you.

451
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You didn't play enough last time.

452
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But I didn't have time

453
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
to play with you today.

454
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm a little busy today.

455
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
If your boyfriend

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
hadn't killed me last time,

457
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
we would have been

458
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
playing a game of chess.

459
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
My boyfriend?

460
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Then last time I...

461
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I was playing

462
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the cousin of Shan Tou.

463
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Oh, Shan Tou's cousin.

464
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Your Mandarin is actually

465
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
pretty good.

466
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Are you looking for someone?

467
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Well, I lost a bracelet

468
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
last time I was here.

469
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm here to look for it.

470
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
My grandma took it

471
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
from my cousin

472
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and brought it to me.

473
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's very important to our family.

474
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'll give you my card.

475
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Go in and find it.

476
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Can I?

477
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Thank you.

478
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Shan...

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You go on.

480
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I have class. I'm leaving.

481
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Thank you. Bye.

482
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay, down.

483
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
One, two, three, four, five,

484
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
six, seven, eight.

485
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay, up.

486
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Push.

487
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Okay, clean up.

488
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Come on.

489
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Three, two, three, four,

490
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
five, six, seven, eight.

491
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Four, two, three, four,

492
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
five, six, seven.

493
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Okay.

494
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Wait.

495
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Why did you do that?

496
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Where did this auntie come from?

497
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
She's so nosy.

498
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Go and call the police

499
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
to get her out.

500
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Wait.

501
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Auntie?

502
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm the analyst

503
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
of M&H.

504
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm helping Wanxin Entertainment

505
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to do the job of reporting the IPOs.

506
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
If I report this to them today,

507
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Wanxin Entertainment will be

508
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
in a loss.

509
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I wonder what kind of punishment

510
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
you'll get.

511
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We were just joking

512
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
with our classmates, right?

513
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yes.

514
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I was going to tell her

515
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
not to drink.

516
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But you came in,

517
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
so I was just joking.

518
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'll also joke with you,

519
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
okay?

520
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Sit.

521
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Here.

522
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Thank you.

523
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You're welcome.

524
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I haven't introduced myself yet.

525
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
My name is Jiang Jun.

526
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm the analyst of M&H.

527
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This is my business card.

528
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Our company is currently

529
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
doing the job of

530
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
listing Wanxin Entertainment.

531
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm mainly responsible for

532
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
doing the background investigation

533
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
of Wanxin.

534
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Don't be nervous.

535
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I just want to ask you a few questions.

536
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You can ask me anything.

537
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll be happy to answer.

538
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Thank you.

539
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'll be happy to answer.

540
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'll be happy to answer.

541
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Thank you.

542
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Don't worry.

543
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I won't reveal

544
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
your answer to anyone.

545
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Miss Tang,

546
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
can you give Wanxin

547
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
a little review?

548
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Miss Tang,

549
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
what's wrong?

550
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm fine.

551
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Honestly,

552
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
since I saved you

553
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
from the bathroom last time,

554
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I've felt something strange.

555
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Why does everyone

556
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
allow others to bully you?

557
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
After my investigation,

558
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I found that

559
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
there are clearly

560
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
high-ranking officials

561
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
targeting you.

562
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Combined with your current state,

563
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I think

564
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
maybe this high-ranking official

565
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
is Wan Shan.

566
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Miss Tang,

567
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
you don't have to worry about me.

568
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Stop hiding it.

569
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
If you really

570
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
don't say anything,

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I can't help you anymore.

572
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What's the point of saying it?

573
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I can't beat him.

574
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
How do you know

575
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you can't beat him before you fight?

576
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If you do this again,

577
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
maybe it will happen again

578
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
on you.

579
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It's also possible

580
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
that other people

581
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
will suffer the same fate.

582
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
At least I can promise you

583
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that if Wan Shan's

584
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
aggressive behavior is confirmed,

585
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
it will very likely affect

586
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Wanxin Entertainment's listing.

587
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Wanxin Entertainment will definitely

588
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
force Wan Shan to step down.

589
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Some time ago,

590
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I was eliminated

591
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
from the recording

592
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
of the show

593
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
of the debut of the girl group.

594
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
But before the revival competition,

595
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Wan Shan found me.

596
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I watched

597
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
your performance on that show.

598
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Not bad.

599
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But unfortunately,

600
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
you were not as popular as before.

601
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So our company decided

602
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to give you a chance.

603
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The contract.

604
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
The contract is too bad.

605
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We'll see tomorrow.

606
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Let's celebrate

607
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
our victory first.

608
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
As long as you sign this contract,

609
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I promise you

610
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I will let the show

611
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
to revive you successfully.

612
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And then,

613
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
we will successfully debut

614
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and form a group

615
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
to create a

616
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
reverse comeback for you.

617
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
A reverse comeback

618
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
with an idol character.

619
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And we will give you

620
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
the best stylist.

621
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Three years.

622
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
In three years,

623
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
you will be the most famous

624
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and famous star.

625
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
My little star.

626
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you understand?

627
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But the premise is

628
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
we have to sign

629
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
this contract first tomorrow.

630
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And

631
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
it depends on you.

632
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Do you understand?

633
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Mr. Wan.

634
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Mr. Wan.

635
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What's wrong?

636
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Tang Xin.

637
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
What's wrong?

638
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Water.

639
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Water.

640
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What's wrong with water?

641
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Are you okay?

642
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Tang Xin.

643
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
What's wrong with water?

644
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Tang Xin.

645
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Tang Xin.

646
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm thinking about Tang Xin.

647
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
When I woke up,

648
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I found myself lying

649
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
in a strange place

650
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
on the way.

651
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The beast was lying

652
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
beside me.

653
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I was still sleeping

654
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and ran out.

655
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I found that

656
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it was a secret

657
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
lounge in his office.

658
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The beast

659
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
was looking for me several times.

660
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
This is my evidence.

661
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Tang Xin.

662
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Listen to me.

663
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's so miserable now.

664
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But it's not too late.

665
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
As long as you're sensible

666
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
and make me happy,

667
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I have my own way

668
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
to get you back.

669
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Unbelievable.

670
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I thought that Wan Shan

671
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
just wanted to use the plant

672
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
to bribe you.

673
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I didn't expect that

674
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
he would do such a thing.

675
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Miss Wan.

676
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Although there are some things

677
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that have shocked me,

678
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
if you're willing to believe me,

679
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
can you give me

680
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
this evidence?

681
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'll help you.

682
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Miss Jiang.

683
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I've lost my way.

684
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You're my last hope.

685
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I understand.

686
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Miss Jiang.

688
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Mr. Du.

689
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Is someone following you?

690
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I feel that someone is following me.

691
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I should be too sensitive.

692
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's so late.

693
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Why are you here alone?

694
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I...

695
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm not alone.

696
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm here to help you.

697
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm here to help you.

698
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm here to help you.

699
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm here to help you.

700
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm here to help you.

701
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm here to help you.

702
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Why are you here alone?

703
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I happen to have a job nearby.

704
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
My car is nearby.

705
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Why don't I take you home?

706
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Okay.

707
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Thank you, Mr. Du.

708
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm always grateful.

709
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Actually,

710
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you can continue to call me Mr. Du.

711
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Although I can't

712
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
listen to you too much at work,

713
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

714
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The amount of time I have left

715
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
is still much less than you.

716
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I just realized that

717
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
you're such a good teacher.

718
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I didn't even know

719
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
how to take care of you before.

720
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm sorry.

722
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm sorry.

723
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm sorry.

724
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I didn't realize

725
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that you're older than me.

726
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm used to

727
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
hearing you call me Mr. Du.

728
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Okay.

729
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll call you Mr. Du from now on.

730
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
By the way, Mr. Du,

731
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
what are you doing here today?

732
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm here to pay respect to my father's online friend.

733
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
He's a new CEO.

734
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
A new CEO?

735
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
My surname is Yu Le?

736
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes.

737
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You know Wan Shan, too?

738
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Not really.

739
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I just admire him

740
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
for his strong styling skills.

741
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So, how long have you known each other?

742
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
We've known each other for a long time.

743
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
He comes to my house occasionally.

744
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Can I have your details?

745
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I just think he's very good.

746
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I've seen him on TV recently.

747
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
There are so many shows and teachers.

748
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He's the only one who gets the most comments.

749
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But he has the most accurate vision.

750
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Everyone he sees is popular.

751
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Does he have any secrets?

752
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
What?

753
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
My apprentice is going to change his job.

754
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
He's a dog-dog?

755
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm just curious.

756
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Which girl in the entertainment industry

757
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
doesn't want to know about the eight-pronged?

758
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Right?

759
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's okay to watch

760
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
variety shows.

761
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Don't take it seriously.

762
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The story behind it

763
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
is complicated.

764
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But...

765
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You seem to be really interested

766
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
in Wan Shan.

767
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Although she's my friend,

768
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I have to remind you of something.

769
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Don't be too close to

770
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
the pretty girl.

771
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Okay.

772
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I won't ask.

773
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Mr. Du,

774
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
thank you for today.

775
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'll go now.

776
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay.

777
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
By the way,

778
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I have something to tell you.

779
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What?

780
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
By the way,

781
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
don't walk around

782
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
at night.

783
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
If you really need me,

784
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
call me.

785
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm happy to be

786
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
your driver.

787
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Okay.

788
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Good night.

789
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Good night.

790
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What do you mean?

791
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I told you

792
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
to stay away from her.

793
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You actually came

794
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
to my house.

795
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
If you care about her so much,

796
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
then you should take good care of her.

797
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I haven't come yet.

798
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Xiaochuan,

799
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'll leave the seat for you today.

800
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
When are you going to come?

801
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You...

802
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You...

803
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You're not going to pay?

804
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm sorry.

805
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Seven yuan.

806
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Add me on WeChat.

807
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll pay you.

808
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
How about it?

809
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Mr. Wan,

810
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Ms. Jiang is here.

811
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Ms. Jiang is here.

812
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Please have a seat.

813
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I wonder why

814
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Mr. Wan asked me to come here.

815
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The reason why

816
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I asked Ms. Jiang to come here

817
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
is because a few days ago,

818
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I heard that

819
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
there was a girl

820
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
named Tang Xin

821
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
in our company

822
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
who told you some nonsense.

823
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You know that

824
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
kids are under a lot of pressure.

825
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Sometimes,

826
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
they think and talk nonsense.

827
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I believe

828
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that a smart person like Ms. Jiang

829
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
wouldn't believe

830
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
the nonsense kids say.

831
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Mr. Wan,

832
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
you're too kind to me.

833
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I can't take this money.

834
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Ms. Jiang,

835
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
this is...

836
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Don't worry.

837
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I think I know

838
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
what to do.

839
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'll go first.

840
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I got it.

841
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Go and destroy

842
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that General's phone.

843
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And teach him a lesson.

844
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Call the phone.

845
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm sorry.

846
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm sorry.

847
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

857
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm sorry.

858
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm sorry.

859
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm sorry.

860
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm sorry.

861
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm sorry.

862
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm sorry.

863
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm sorry.

864
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm sorry.

865
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm sorry.

866
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm sorry.

867
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm sorry.

868
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm sorry.
