You're so forgetful.

This is your punishment.

21
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
Wang Cai.

22
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,360
Your father was caught by the monster.

23
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,560
What did you say? Say it again.

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,520
I was wrong.

25
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,640
Queen.

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,720
That's more like it.

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,680
I love it.

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,760

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,440
P 마udan is hungry.

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,420
Food is waiting for you.

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,800
Me too.

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,660
According to the rule,

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,360

Of course.

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,880
I did not know.

38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Make it.

39
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm hungry.

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
I only remember you made the food

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
at one, three, or five.

42
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,420

I bought the thread broken.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,360
You used everything to save me.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,140

I can use them.

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,920
Brilliant.

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,540
Good.

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,060
Pour it.

53
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,500
28 days of the week is over.

54
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,180
According to the temperature measurement method,

55
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,100
your coolant should be today.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,740
If your inference is correct,

57
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,300
why haven't we been in the back for so long?

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
There must be something missing.

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,140
Honey,

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,940
do you think it's five...

61
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,980
Ye酸.

62
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,460
What Ye酸?

63
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,500
Ye酸.

64
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,300
You should eat more Ye酸 during this period.

65
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,580
It's good for your health.

66
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,300
Okay?

67
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,380
Okay.

68
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,260
Honey, I'll go get some sugar.

69
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,860
Okay.

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,060
Here.

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,620
After you finish this,

72
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
I'll go out and buy some Ye酸.

73
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,940
I'll be back after I buy some things.

74
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,460
Okay.

75
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,820
Can you drink with me?

76
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,020
Of course not.

77
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,980
I'm leaving.

78
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,020
You must drink it.

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,300
Obedient!

80
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,460
Sweetie, drink the sugar.

81
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,260
There's nothing in my mouth.

82
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,940
How dare you!

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
It's embarrassing.

84
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,620
Hurry up.

85
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,740
What are you doing at the door?

86
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,740
I'm doing exercise.

87
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,220
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

88
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,540
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

89
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,180
Slow down.

90
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,700
Okay.

91
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,460
I'll go get the dishes.

92
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,220
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

93
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,180
Is Xu Tuo Qian here?

94
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,300
Your spicy soup is here.

95
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,900
I said...

96
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,060
Add spicy and spicy.

97
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,980
Remember to give me a five-star rating.

98
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,780
Come on.

99
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
Oh my god.

100
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,940
It's so delicious.

101
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,060
It smells so good.

102
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,900
Is it good?

103
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,620
I swear I didn't eat it.

104
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,700
Look.

105
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,740
Add spicy and spicy.

106
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,900
Don't press the doorbell.

107
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,340
I swear I didn't eat it.

108
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,820
I swear I didn't eat it.

109
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,100
It's spicy.

110
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,460
It smells so delicious.

111
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,340
I want to eat it.

112
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,260
Excuse me.

113
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,660
It's so good.

114
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,180
Thank you.

115
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,900
Eat, adjustable.

116
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,020
No wonder you're the MVP who's the fastest-growing MVP in the M&H industry.

117
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,700
You've been in the same position for the past two years.

118
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,540
You're my idol.

119
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,980
Mr. Qiao.

120
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,780
Morning.

121
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,140
Morning.

122
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,620
You're in good shape.

123
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,740
It seems that the meeting yesterday was a good result.

124
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,060
I've worked so hard for so many days.

125
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,180
Mr. Qiao changed his new makeup.

126
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,100
It seems that he's ready to meet Jing Di.

127
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,820
It's a new project.

128
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,100
It's worth the effort.

129
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,780
I wish you success in your new project.

130
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,180
Morning, Mr. Jiang.

131
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,700
Morning.

132
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:23,940
I've sent the

133
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,100
office Once.

134
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,540
where is JinGsie?

135
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,060
Da Lim's office?

136
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,780
Good!

137
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,980
The one sent a lot of offices to optimal standards.

138
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,980
High line!

139
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,500
Da Lim's office?

140
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,100
Yes.

141
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,580
לס

142
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Come in!

143
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,300
buy

144
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,460
Good, Boss Du, you want me?

145
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,180
Many famous brands

146
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,020
go to them

147
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,580
If we can take over this business

148
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,260
The next year's sales will be very good

149
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,700
understand

150
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,980
I will contact them as soon as possible

151
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,580
it is good

152
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,700
Wait a minute

153
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,100
I went to Beijing for a business trip last time

154
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,220
By the way, I brought you a gift

155
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
I guess you should like this style

156
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,180
Didn't you just give birth?

157
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,620
This is your birthday gift

158
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,740
Ok

159
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,420
Since it's a birthday gift

160
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,940
I will accept it without any hesitation

161
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,100
Thank you for your consideration

162
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,660
It seems that I am going to start thinking

163
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,860
What gift should I give you next time?

164
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,700
I will go back to work first

165
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,220
it is good

166
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,140
You know

167
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,300
There is a restaurant

168
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,060
It's very delicious

169
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,780
It's called the moon building

170
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,380
Have you been there?

171
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,460
No

172
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,620
I will go there next time

173
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,340
Ok

174
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,900
Really?

175
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,020
Cheng Jun

176
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,740
Cheng Jun

177
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,060
Manager Chen

178
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,700
I heard that Manager Chen graduated from a famous school

179
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,180
No wonder young people are so good

180
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,260
Do you have a lot of pressure on your girlfriend?

181
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,420
I don't think so

182
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,580
Manager Chen is so gentle and considerate

183
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,220
As long as it's his girlfriend

184
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,300
It must be the last life

185
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,620
This is just a play

186
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,340
It's okay

187
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Not so exaggerated

188
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,420
Manager Chen, you are so sweet

189
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,500
Drink some water, right?

190
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,420
Manager Shen

191
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,140
I am here

192
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,340
I am here

193
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,540
My dear little Xinxin

194
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,660
Are you angry?

195
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,460
Why am I angry?

196
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,740
No

197
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,180
No, I was just here to pick water

198
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,540
Then I heard them talking

199
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,820
That new open a moon building

200
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,180
The food is very delicious

201
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,380
So they praised you for a few nice words

202
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,140
You just met the balloon flying into the sky

203
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,340
And the sun is in the middle of the cake

204
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,100
No no no

205
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,700
No no no

206
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,740
It's really not like that

207
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,940
Not what you think

208
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,900
I

209
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,340
I just heard that there is a place

210
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,300
Especially delicious

211
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,380
I just want to take my girlfriend

212
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,380
Go to eat delicious food

213
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:00,980
Go

214
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,500
That one

215
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,380
Let's go to the airport after work tonight, okay?

216
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,660
I'm not free

217
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,540
It's okay, it's okay

218
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Otherwise, that one after work at night

219
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,340
I'll make you a western meal when I get home

220
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,060
Come on, be careful

221
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,780
Come on

222
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,220
You said that Manager Chen would personally cook

223
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,540
Why don't you invite me?

224
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,900
You scared me

225
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,180
Don't be so simple

226
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,140
It doesn't count if you say it

227
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,460
Director Yu hasn't spoken yet

228
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,260
That director Yu

229
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,420
I really

230
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,340
I am a PhD student at the University of Stav

231
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,220
Actually

232
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,100
I really didn't do anything wrong to you

233
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,740
Xia Di

234
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,860
I have time on the weekend to eat with you

235
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,820
it is good

236
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,660
This weekend

237
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,900
Eat at six o'clock at night

238
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,980
Thank you, brother

239
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:01,980
Hello, Mr. Du

240
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,420
I will be at their company soon

241
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,860
I heard that the project

242
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,620
Remember to have a little bit of energy

243
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,780
Okay, I see

244
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,900
I'm sorry

245
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,540
I have too many people to meet with Dong recently

246
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,180
When he has time

247
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,140
I'll ask you to meet

248
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,140
No problem

249
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,660
If there is progress, please contact me at any time

250
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,900
Okay, please

251
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,020
What a coincidence, Director Yuan

252
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,020
Let's go, Director Jiang

253
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,660
Director Yuan is good at acting

254
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,020
I have a bed-treatment at night

255
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,340
Play against me in the daytime

256
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,220
So long

257
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,020
I didn't leave at all

258
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,300
The company is clear

259
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,260
This is the most basic professional culture

260
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,060
OK

261
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,100
From today on

262
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,020
Fair competition

263
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,020
No cheating

264
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,620
By the way

265
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,580
Many investment banks are watching the trend recently

266
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,140
The founder Dong Qi

267
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,100
It's more like Shen Longjian's hand is not in the way

268
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,580
How about it

269
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,220
Do you have any channels there?

270
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,500
I'm just a little VP

271
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,740
What channels can I have?

272
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,940
Isn't Dong Qi your alumni?

273
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,020
You don't have an alumni meeting

274
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,260
Dong Qi and I are alumni

275
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,540
You don't know

276
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,020
Of course I know

277
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,060
But he graduated early

278
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,980
No one in the alumni meeting

279
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,980
Don't know

280
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,220
So

281
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,340
Nothing, I'll hang up

282
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,100
Bye bye

283
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,060
I'm sorry

284
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,020
I'm sorry

285
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm sorry

286
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,140
I'm sorry

287
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
I'm sorry

288
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,380
I'm sorry

289
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
I'm sorry

290
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,820
I'm sorry

291
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,060
This is my phone

292
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,260
I know it's your phone

293
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,020
I wipe the table and get it for you

294
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,180
Miss Jiang

295
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,460
According to Article 702, Article 24

296
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,940
You should wash the dishes today

297
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,300
Please be upright and work hard

298
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,660
Got it, Yuan Baping

299
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,740
OK

300
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,460
Answer the phone

301
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,340
Wait

302
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
Is this Ms. Jiang?

303
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,540
I can't forget to buy a 98-thousand yuan set

304
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,660
Do you want to consider it?

305
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
No, thank you

306
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,540
Let's go

307
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,840
Miss Jiang

308
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
You look nervous

309
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,220
I thought Mr. Dong was here

310
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,020
I'm not good at trumpeting

311
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,060
It's my phone

312
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,060
Hello

313
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,420
I have no time this morning.

314
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,820
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.

315
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,220
Okay, tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.

316
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,700
Okay, that's it. Bye.

317
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,460
Who asked you out?

318
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,260
Mr. He of Rongxin.

319
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,300
I have a video meeting at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

320
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,260
What's wrong?

321
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,740
Nothing.

322
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,260
Hello, Miss Jiang.

323
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,380
Who is it?

324
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,820
It's the real estate agent.

325
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,380
He keeps calling me to buy a house.

326
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,260
I can afford it.

327
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
I'll change my clothes.

328
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,460
Wangcai.

329
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,020
A dog needs a dog for a day.

330
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,220
Today, it's up to you.

331
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,900
Hello, senior.

332
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Any progress?

333
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,260
You're lucky.

334
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,140
The person in charge of the club

335
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,780
is the senior's college roommate.

336
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,700
He heard that at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,

337
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,540
the senior would go to the public development plan

338
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,900
of the mobile group DT.

339
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,180
10 o'clock tomorrow morning, DT, right?

340
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,220
Great. Thank you, senior.

341
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,820
I don't know how to thank you.

342
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,300
Why are you so polite?

343
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,780
When we were in the college club,

344
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,260
you helped me write the report.

345
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,780
It's nothing.

346
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,580
By the way,

347
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,500
this activity is to be included in the ticket.

348
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,180
You have to go online to buy tickets.

349
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,260
Okay.

350
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,460
Thank you, senior.

351
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,980
Bye.

352
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
Why are you here, Wangcai?

353
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,860
Yuan Shuai.

354
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,380
There are dog and dog.

355
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,820
What else do you want to say?

356
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,660
I won't.

357
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
You think you're a good actor?

358
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,420
You're still playing this?

359
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,820
Ice is not a problem.

360
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,060
Learn from it.

361
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,660
Good boy. Don't be angry.

362
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,980
Little girl.

363
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,780
This is

364
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,660
a reward for you

365
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,900
for using the school resources.

366
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,060
You did a good job.

367
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,740
I bought all the tickets.

368
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,940
It's up to you.

369
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,420
I'm sorry, Miss Jiang.

370
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
I've bought

371
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,700
the tickets for tomorrow morning.

372
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,260
So cool.

373
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,740
Wangcai.

374
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,780
Cool.

375
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,460
Wangcai.

376
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,420
Since you're not a good actor,

377
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,740
don't blame me.

378
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,900
I love you so much.

379
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,780
Jiang Jun.

380
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,340
Open the door.

381
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,460
What are you doing? I'm about to die.

382
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,940
Open the door.

383
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,020
Come out.

384
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,260
There are three episodes.

385
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,220
Do you understand?

386
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,420
Yuan Shuai.

387
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,780
I took your car key.

388
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,580
If you don't want to be late,

389
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,100
just go out.

390
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,980
Jiang Jun.

391
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,820
Jiang Jun, you're too much.

392
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,900
You helped me.

393
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,580
I know you liked it.

394
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,940
Xiao sooner. Get in the car.

395
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,220
I'll send you to work.

396
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,020
Thank you, sir.

397
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,100
I have called an ambulance.

398
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,740
It's not new.

399
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,620
Can you which one you realize it is?

400
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,340
It's reasonable

401
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
it's participating in the working class.

402
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm not a girl.

403
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,580
Do you know how old we are?

404
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,020
What age are we in?

405
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,740
Age is not a problem.

406
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,260
I don't care.

407
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,820
Anyway, you should go after

408
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,460
a girl as old as you.

409
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,580
We have no chance.

410
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,060
I don't know if there's a chance.

411
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,620
But

412
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,420
you have to take these.

413
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,900
I like these things very much.

414
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,980
Thank you.

415
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,740
But I've had them all.

416
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,380
I have a lot of necklaces.

417
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,420
I'll try them on.

418
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,580
I've been preparing for a long time.

419
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,140
Qiao Qiao. Qiao Qiao.

420
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,580
Mr. President.

421
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,980
Hello.

422
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,580
I'm Zhang Jun from M.H.

423
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,060
Our company

424
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,580
does have a business plan this year.

425
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,020
But I'm sorry.

426
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,060
I'm not interested

427
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,620
in M.H.

428
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,780
Well,

429
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,460
you can look at our cooperation plan

430
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,420
before making a decision.

431
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,900
Do you know that

432
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,060
many companies

433
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,580
have given me a cooperation plan recently?

434
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
It's the top company in the industry.

435
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,780
So, the strength of M.H.

436
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,780
and the cooperation conditions

437
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,780
are not

438
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,300
particularly moving.

439
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,380
Mr. Dong.

440
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,700
The cooperation conditions

441
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
can be discussed.

442
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,980
I believe M.H.

443
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,940
will definitely give you

444
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
a satisfactory plan.

445
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,420
This is Du Lei,

446
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,020
M.H. investment bank.

447
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,540
Mr. Du.

448
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,180
You've done

449
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,260
a lot of things this year.

450
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,580
I've heard a lot about you.

451
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,420
I heard that you've only been in M.H.

452
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,780
for two years.

453
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,380
The pure profit of Q3

454
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,340
has increased by five percent.

455
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,340
You're very young.

456
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,700
Mr. Dong, you flatter me.

457
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,140
If M.H. can work with

458
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,460
Feng Chao in the future,

459
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,300
I believe

460
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,340
we can give you

461
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,660
more surprises.

462
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,460
The commission is one percent less

463
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,940
than other investment banks.

464
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,860
Of course.

465
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,060
This is just a small part of

466
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,700
Chen Yi's business.

467
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,820
I'll take a shower and then go to the bathroom.

468
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,540
Mr. Jiang.

469
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,020
Okay.

470
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,060
Mr. Dong.

471
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,460
I'm Yuan Sheng,

472
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,580
the MD of the M.H. investment bank.

473
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,300
It's a great honor.

474
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,780
But

475
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,820
if your purpose

476
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,860
is the same as theirs,

477
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,860
I'm afraid

478
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,300
you'll be disappointed.

479
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,700
Did they come to talk to you about work?

480
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,540
No.

481
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,780
I'm not here to talk to you about work.

482
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,380
I heard that

483
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,820
your proposal today

484
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,860
is to expand your overseas market

485
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,860
through a public service project.

486
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,020
That's right.

487
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,340
It's a win-win proposal.

488
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,260
But please forgive me.

489
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,020
For those

490
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,900
who are smart,

491
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,300
they will definitely think

492
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,140
this is a project

493
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,140
that challenges public awareness

494
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,500
and causes public opinion to be threatened.

495
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,500
Those who oppose it

496
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,060
will definitely be punished.

497
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,380
You know that?

498
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,620
That's one thing.

499
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,740
When did you become

500
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,220
the director of DT?

501
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,260
Take a guess.

502
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,900
So, Mr. Dong,

503
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,140
if you have my new vote,

504
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,420
your success rate

505
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,900
will definitely increase by more than 50 percent.

506
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,260
How about

507
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,780
we wait until your proposal

508
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,700
is approved before we talk about work?

509
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
I'm sorry to

510
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,140
come to my office.

511
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,020
Mr. Dong, please.

512
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,860
I was not considerate

513
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,780
and made him stand in the way.

514
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
I made you lose.

515
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,860
It's okay.

516
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Yuan Shuai is just good at

517
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,300
attacking and defending.

518
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,380
Don't mind him.

519
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,660
Let's go back to the office.

520
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,900
You go back first.

521
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,820
I'll wait.

522
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,980
Let's see if we can find another chance

523
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,180
to talk to Mr. Dong after the meeting.

524
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:14,980
Okay.

525
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,260
I'll go back first.

526
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,740
Wait for my news then.

527
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,820
Okay, Mr. Dong.

528
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,540
Take care.

529
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,180
Bye.

530
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,940
Why did you finish 15 minutes early?

531
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,740
Because I'm efficient.

532
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,980
Don't be too proud.

533
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,860
You just took the ticket.

534
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,540
But you're out of the game, sister.

535
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,100
That's also your favorite sister,

536
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,900
Uncle.

537
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,940
Let me go home

538
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,300
and serve you.

539
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,700
Why are you here?

540
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,780
Let me introduce you.

541
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,540
This is my

542
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,500
administrative assistant, Jia Yuan Qing.

543
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,860
Administrative assistant, Jia Yuan Qing.

544
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,380
You're the Crown Prince.

545
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,820
You're his assistant?

546
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,740
But it's my honor to serve you.

547
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,380
Mr. Yuan, at 3 p.m.,

548
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,300
there's a video meeting

549
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,260
with Rong Xin.

550
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,020
Let's go.

551
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,300
I'll go first, Mr. Jiang.

552
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,860
You're dead.

553
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,740
Are you going home?

554
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,140
Hello, Lily. What's up?

555
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,940
You're sick?

556
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,100
Don't worry. I'll be right there.

557
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,540
Slow down.

558
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,420
You're staring at my daughter.

559
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,500
Oh my gosh.

560
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,540
Slow down.

561
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,020
No. 11.

562
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,380
Don't be so surprised.

563
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,220
You're just a little bean sprout.

564
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,020
Are you going to

565
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,900
make up for your pregnancy?

566
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,980
Do you want chicken soup?

567
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,020
No.

568
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,140
Don't mention chicken.

569
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,660
Xiao Chuan cooks chicken soup for me every day.

570
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,660
Now I feel like

571
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,260
I'm eating chicken soup.

572
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,300
You're a woman.

573
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,980
Don't be so happy.

574
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,420
Do you know what I've been eating

575
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,500
with Yuan Shuai

576
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,980
the most these months?

577
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,220
Tomato chicken soup.

578
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
I forgot to mention.

579
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,660
Every woman

580
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,740
has her own way of achieving self-worth.

581
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,500
Think about it.

582
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm not the only one in the company.

583
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,860
But Xiao Chuan

584
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,340
can't live without me.

585
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,660
So my main factory is my family.

586
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,140
And you're a white-bone gold in the workplace.

587
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,940
Your main factory is the workplace.

588
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,420
So

589
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,340
we're all good, right?

590
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,580
Good for you, Li Li.

591
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,220
You're so good at it.

592
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,540
Where did you learn it from?

593
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:22,900
This is called

594
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,100
the one who is close to the owner.

595
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,060
The one who is far from the other.

596
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
But to be honest,

597
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,580
I have to tell you seriously.

598
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,620
You can't be too stubborn.

599
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,660
Think about it.

600
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,620
Yuan Shuai

601
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,460
is always on the same business

602
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,460
with you.

603
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,380
It's like a love affair.

604
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,340
Aren't you worried

605
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,660
that you might have a problem?

606
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,020
And

607
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,100
look at the little girls now.

608
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,260
They're all so active.

609
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:49,860
They're totally different from

610
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
when we were young.

611
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,980
Your Yuan Shuai

612
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,500
is handsome and smart.

613
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,780
If he's taken away,

614
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,660
he's still worried about...

615
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,620
Enough.

616
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,620
You're saying that

617
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,300
we're about to break up.

618
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,580
That's not true.

619
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,340
I'm pretty

620
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,340
at ease with Yuan Shuai.

621
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,100
I'm saying

622
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,460
can you not always

623
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:07,980
take care of your work

624
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,340
and take care of the people around you?

625
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,300
General.

626
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,460
Okay?

627
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,780
Okay.

628
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,340
Xiao Chuan.

629
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,300
Here he comes.

630
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,300
Be careful.

631
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,300
Be careful.

632
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,140
Doctor Ning.

633
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,220
What's going on?

634
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,900
Nothing. It's just a small problem.

635
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,940
Don't be nervous.

636
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,260
I'm not nervous.

637
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,660
Is there anything

638
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,500
that you need to pay attention to

639
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,660
in the future?

640
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,460
There's a new and old thing in the morning.

641
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Pay attention to diet and hygiene.

642
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,340
Now,

643
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,820
many people don't pay attention to this.

644
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,620
I'll pay attention to it.

645
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,820
I'll pay attention to it.

646
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,740
Okay.

647
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,420
Here.

648
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,020
Junjuan.

649
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,860
Should I

650
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,580
call Xiao Chuan

651
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,180
and tell him

652
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
to be your father?

653
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,820
Doctor.

654
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,580
What do you mean by this?

655
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,860
You're not pregnant.

656
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,060
What?

657
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,340
Then...

658
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,420
Why would I

659
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,980
feel sick?

660
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,300
You're not paying attention

661
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,780
to the health condition.

662
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,700
It's not serious.

663
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,940
Just take some medicine.

664
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,620
Here.

665
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,740
It's a dream,

666
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,820
a dream, a dream.

667
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,740
It's a dream.

668
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,940
What's wrong?

669
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,940
What's wrong?

670
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,500
What's wrong with me?

671
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,460
Look.

672
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,260
I bought you

673
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,340
your favorite cake.

674
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,260
I don't want it.

675
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,180
I want to lose weight.

676
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,660
What's wrong?

677
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,900
I stole your Dong Zou today.

678
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,980
Are you angry?

679
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,500
I'm not angry.

680
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,620
I'm just hurt.

681
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,700
I'm just hurt.

682
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,820
I'm just hurt.

683
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,860
I'm just hurt.

684
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,860
I'm just hurt.

685
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,060
I'm just hurt.

686
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,020
I'm just hurt.

687
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,020
I'm just hurt.

688
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,700
I said so myself.

689
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
I said so myself.

690
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,500
I'm glad you're not angry.

691
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,580
Then I'm relieved.

692
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,700
I'll go change.

693
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,580
Stop.

694
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,140
Sit down.

695
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,380
What's wrong?

696
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,540
I thought you said you weren't angry.

697
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,300
Tell me the truth.

698
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,060
Who are you going to fight with tonight?

699
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,100
Mr. He of Rong Xin.

700
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,180
When did Jia Yuan Ji

701
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,500
become your assistant?

702
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,340
Jia Yuan Ji?

703
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
Just for half a year.

704
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,100
But what about Su Chang?

705
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,820
I can't let

706
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,860
Su Chang be my assistant forever.

707
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,340
She's a VIP.

708
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,820
Besides, Mr. Jia

709
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,860
also wants to put Jia Yuan Ji

710
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,700
in my place

711
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,820
and practice.

712
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,380
Mr. Yuan is hiding something.

713
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,900
If I hadn't met him today,

714
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,380
I wouldn't know it now.

715
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,820
It's because of Jia Yuan Ji

716
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,740
that I'm in trouble.

717
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,180
I'm in a mess now.

718
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,420
I don't know how many peach blossoms

719
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,140
Jia Yuan Ji blocked for me.

720
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,900
It's because of Jia Yuan Ji

721
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,980
that I'm in a mess.

722
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,020
Why?

723
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,500
So there will be more flowers

724
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,940
around you.

725
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,500
The wild flowers outside

726
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,900
are better than the flowers

727
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
in my house.

728
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,460
They smell so good.

729
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,500
Where?

730
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,060
Here.

731
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,900
You're so stubborn.

732
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,140
I'm going to bed.

733
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,460
Wen Shuai.

734
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,300
What?

735
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,140
Do you think

736
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,180
I've been with you

737
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,380
for too long?

738
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,340
Why do you say that?

739
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,060
Nothing.

740
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,620
I was chatting with Li Li this afternoon.

741
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,540
She thinks I'm too hardworking.

742
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,860
You're now

743
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,700
at the peak of your career.

744
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,220
It's normal to be busy.

745
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,220
I

746
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,460
respect your decisions.

747
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,700
But as your boyfriend,

748
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
I hope you can

749
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,580
take it easy.

750
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,300
You want me to take it easy?

751
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,140
I want you.

752
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,060
I can't afford it.

753
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,060
I can afford it if I have more.

754
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,500
I'm jealous of you.

755
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,020
I want more.

756
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,620
I mean, a daughter.

757
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,700
A son.

758
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,980
I can have more.

759
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,300
Go to bed.

760
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,900
Goodnight.

761
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,500
Goodnight.

762
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,820
I love you.

763
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,420
I love you too.

764
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,500
I know this.

765
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,780
Is the purchase of the loan

766
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,460
still stuck in the bank?

767
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,940
I'll talk to Director Liu

768
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,620
after I make an appointment.

769
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,820
I'll wait for your news.

770
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,620
Okay, that's all.

771
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,820
I'll go back to the office.

772
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,340
Bye.

773
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,460
Where are you going?

774
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,620
I'll send you off.

775
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,660
To the Global Port.

776
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,340
Remember to book a ticket, sir.

777
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,980
Is the director

778
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,620
responsible for

779
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,140
the loan review?

780
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,500
Yes.

781
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,540
Recently, a producer

782
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,940
has been stuck in the bank.

783
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,580
I have an appointment with Director Liu today.

784
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,540
I want to ask him

785
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,740
what's going on.

786
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,380
I see.

787
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,140
What?

788
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,060
You know him?

789
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,340
I've talked to him before.

790
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,820
I'm close to him.

791
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,340
How is it?

792
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,620
Do you need help?

793
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,940
No matter what,

794
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,140
you must be on the right track.

795
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,260
What's your intention?

796
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,340
I'm trying to get your Director Dong.

797
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
I have to return your favor.

798
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,180
If you need help,

799
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,100
no problem.

800
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,900
But listen to the director.

801
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
When you arrive,

802
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,620
listen to my instructions

803
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,740
and cooperate with me.

804
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,980
Okay.

805
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,020
I'll be nice to you

806
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,660
no matter what.

807
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,540
Yes, Your Grace.

808
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,340
Do you know each other?

809
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,340
Yes.

810
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,220
She's my cousin.

811
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,900
She works in our bank.

812
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,740
Director Liu,

813
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,700
please take care of her.

814
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,620
Yes.

815
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,220
Director Yuan is my cousin.

816
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,580
Director Yuan, what's wrong?

817
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,260
What's wrong, Yuan?

818
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,180
Nothing.

819
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,540
Is the air conditioner too big?

820
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,220
It's really...

821
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Drink some water.

822
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,820
What a coincidence!

823
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,420
Yuan's cousin

824
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,620
is our family.

825
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,420
Listen to me.

826
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,620
The approval of the purchase of the loan

827
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,020
of your project

828
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,820
hasn't been approved.

829
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,860
The main problem

830
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,620
is on the insurance.

831
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,540
I'll ask them to find you

832
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,900
and discuss the details later.

833
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,100
Okay, thank you.

834
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
It's okay.

835
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,580
Yuan,

836
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,020
you've lost weight recently.

837
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,260
Okay, come on.

838
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
Sister, don't worry about me.

839
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,460
Eat more.

840
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,100
Look at you.

841
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,940
You eat.

842
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,500
Try the beef.

843
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,420
Here.

844
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,660
Yuan,

845
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,620
how's your girlfriend?

846
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,460
She's on a business trip in Hong Kong recently.

847
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,660
She'll be back in two days.

848
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,500
I heard last time

849
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,300
that your girlfriend has a bad temper.

850
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,380
Sister, you're right.

851
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,900
She's really bad-tempered.

852
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,340
She's always bad-tempered.

853
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,460
Listen to me.

854
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,540
When you're looking for a girlfriend,

855
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,340
you must find someone

856
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,260
who's mature and generous.

857
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:19,980
Right?

858
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,180
First,

859
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,940
she has her own economic background.

860
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,060
Second,

861
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,300
she won't be like some girls

862
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,180
who get angry

863
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,460
and ask for gifts.

864
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,260
Third...

865
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,940
You're right, Director Liu.

866
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,260
I guess so.

867
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,620
You're right.

868
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,660
When did your girlfriend

869
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,340
go to Hong Kong?

870
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,460
Why didn't I know?

871
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,660
We've made a deal in advance.

872
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,340
How could you cross the river to break the bridge?

873
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,980
I have a bad temper anyway.

874
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,460
I'm not only going to cross the river to break the bridge,

875
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,940
but also to remove the devil and kill the mules.

876
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,620
You...

877
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,900
We're doing business.

878
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,260
How can you take it seriously?

879
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,260
I'm afraid that some people will think I'm a fake.

880
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,020
Fake?

881
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,980
What's wrong with the watch?

882
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,740
This is a gift from my boss, Du Wei.

883
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm a big fan.

884
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,020
Take it off.

885
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,140
Why?

886
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,380
Take it off.

887
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,660
Take it off.

888
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,900
I'm a man of my word.

889
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,900
Do you understand?

890
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,700
I do.

891
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,140
You have a good taste.

892
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,420
Of course.

893
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,820
Don't you want to see who I am?

894
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,900
You're so brave.

895
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,620
I will run away.

896
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,060
If it's what you want,

897
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,340
what you like,

898
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,460
I don't mind.

899
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,420
I can close my eyes.

900
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,740
I can stay behind, waste my time.

901
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,940
Walk into your plan

902
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,540
like I never knew you were not mine.

903
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,980
Make you satisfied.

904
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,780
Wear another mask.

905
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,500
You never realize things I do for love.

906
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,220
I think I'm tired.

907
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,020
I think I'm blind.

908
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,900
Don't know how to feel.

909
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,900
Don't know how to heal.

910
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,780
You walk so fast.

911
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,380
Can't catch your light.

912
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,940
You fly so high.

913
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,140
Leave all the things behind.

914
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,660
And our story.

915
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,380
Leave all of nowhere to find.

916
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,380
I think I'm tired.

917
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,140
I think I'm blind.

918
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,020
Don't know how to feel.

919
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,020
Don't know how to heal.

920
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,900
You walk so fast.

921
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,580
Can't catch your light.

922
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,140
You fly so high.

923
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,300
Leave all the things behind.

924
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,620
And our story.

925
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:57,380
Leave all of nowhere to find.
