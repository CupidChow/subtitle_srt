00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,800
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,080
Mom, here.

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,640
Come here.

4
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,760
Zhe Ge Liang.

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,440
Mr. Du, the puppy.

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,480
Stop making a fool of yourself.

7
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,960
I'm not.

8
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,080
I'm just telling the truth.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,720
Is this a painting?

10
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,840
Why are you painting on the wall?

11
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,160
That...

12
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,360
That's a mark I made for practice.

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,920
My dog last night fellHi apologies.

14
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,400
Didn't you know?

15
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,120
Go to bed.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,960
【He is not the one he has anything to say about. What's more, he will walk through his private time just to make up for it】

17
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,180
17

18
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Who will be the first person to recognize me?

19
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,560
Yes, you

20
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,920
Exactly

21
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,540
That's what I heard

22
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,740
Just do as I say

23
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,660
Bai Yu

24
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,780
Only the original

25
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,420
Woman

26
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,980
мод

27
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,960
Do you taunt your wife?

28
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,400
You're...

29
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,620
I told you not to do that!

30
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,240
Who are you?

31
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,820
Look,

32
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,380
a bike belongs to a woman.

33
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,280
A girl should be able to

34
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
I have something to tell you.

35
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Hu Qin.

36
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,040
You know how to hit me?

37
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Put it in the bag.

38
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,700
I am all right

39
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,940
Alright

40
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,520
Xiao Xin

41
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,240
What's wrong?

42
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
I have a stomachache.

43
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Again?

44
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,680
Are you trying to trick me

45
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,040
to help you study?

46
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
I really have a stomachache.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
Go get me some water.

48
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:47,960
No.

49
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,520
I'll sit on your sofa.

50
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,320
Here.

51
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,800
Here.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,520
No.

53
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
Is your stomach

54
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,800
full of Lan Wei Yan?

55
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,800
It's not that serious.

56
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,120
You don't usually

57
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,360
take care of your diet.

58
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
How can you eat medicine?

59
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,520
Get up now

60
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
and have a checkup with me.

61
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
I don't want to.

62
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm afraid it'll hurt.

63
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,320
Stop it, bro.

64
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,920
If it's really Lan Wei Yan,

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,960
you can take it off and find out

66
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
that I'm dying.

67
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,080
No.

68
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,800
I'll ask for leave.

69
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,920
No need.

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
I have an important job

71
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,520
to finish.

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
I can't be late.

73
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,120
What job

74
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
is more important than your health?

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,880
How about this?

76
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,080
I'll finish

77
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,760
everything.

78
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,960
You take me to the hospital.

79
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,840
Okay.

80
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,160
Go change your clothes.

81
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,520
We'll go to the company together.

82
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
Am I okay now?

83
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,360
Wait for me.

84
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Baby.

85
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,520
You're off work?

86
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,480
Yes, baby.

87
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,040
I have good news for you.

88
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,760
I can go back to China

89
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,880
and spend the whole winter with you.

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,960
Great.

91
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,240
When will you come back?

92
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,160
Recently.

93
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,320
I haven't decided on the date.

94
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,160
By the way,

95
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,120
I have to tell you.

96
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,160
My best friend's husband

97
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
is also a investment investor.

98
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,240
I heard that you're

99
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,800
the ED of MH Investment Investment Department.

100
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,360
I admire you a lot.

101
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,040
I really want to know you.

102
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,920
ED?

103
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,640
What ED?

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Yes.

105
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,280
Well,

106
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm ED.

107
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I remember you.

108
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,920
Baby,

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,280
before you come back,

110
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,880
tell me in advance.

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,800
Okay, baby.

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,920
I'll hang up now.

113
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,960
Love you.

114
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,640
ED?

115
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,600
Why did I forget it?

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
When did I

117
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,560
get it right?

118
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
Why hasn't Boss come yet?

119
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,840
Both of you are both experienced buyers.

120
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,960
Fifteenleth 有你, fight for your life.

121
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,960
scriptures

122
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,620
Go faster.

123
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,160
It's too late.

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,040
Slow down.

125
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,880
Otherwise I'll fall off.

126
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
Sorry for improving my skills and your time.

127
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,240
Do you really still want me to be calm?

128
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,560
You should be fast

129
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,400
and slow in time.

130
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,920
Is there someone else teaching you?

131
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
You're a loser.

132
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,600
You let me put a patient on the road.

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,560
You're not responsible for so many innocent lives.

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,520
You're responsible for yourself.

135
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,680
I really don't want to drive your car.

136
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm nervous.

137
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
So what great mission

138
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
is our God of War

139
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,520
taking soldiers to the battlefield today?

140
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,760
Do you remember

141
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,760
the new technology

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
I asked you to check?

143
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,160
I know.

144
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
Their previous performance was bad.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,880
The new system

146
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
has not been working.

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,400
The capital is not good.

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
The project is led by

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
the founder of Chen Xing Technology, Dr. Ren Zhu.

150
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Their team is very powerful.

151
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,920
But the development is too expensive.

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,400
They can't pay the debt.

153
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
The debtors don't agree to pay the debt.

154
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,760
So they face a sale.

155
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,120
I want to help them finance again

156
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,760
and get back the company's control.

157
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,680
I found a few

158
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,360
suspicious investors to go to the company today.

159
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,560
So you don't want to see the doctor

160
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,560
just because of this?

161
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,280
I like his project.

162
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,360
So I agreed to accompany him to the safety check.

163
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,600
You don't look

164
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,400
like a sentimental person.

165
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,760
He's ready

166
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,160
to lose everything.

167
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,080
I have no reason not to help him.

168
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,120
What?

169
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,080
The Mozi family

170
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,240
can you be the one to rule the world

171
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,840
without allowing me to be a thorn in someone else's side?

172
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,680
You'd better talk less and rest more.

173
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,240
Your partner needs you.

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Let's go.

175
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,680
President Du,

176
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,880
The result was ruined by me

177
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,520
All your anxiety and worries are negative energy.

178
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,120
Dr. Zhu, you can't solve any problem if you're nervous.

179
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,480
You must relax.

180
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
But I'm nervous when I see so many people.

181
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,240
You know I was the top student in the academic year.

182
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,720
But I didn't pass the answer-answer test twice.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,640
It's because I'm nervous when I see so many people.

184
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,720
The more I want to relax, the more nervous I am.

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
Dr. Zhu.

186
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm telling you.

187
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,960
Don't treat the meeting room

188
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:37,020
or as a

189
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,920
OK.

190
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
Well, the boss is not in a good mood today.

191
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,720
Yes.

192
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,760
He said he wasール fa myself to have the work day with the soldier.

193
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
Work is his life.

194
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Did you take your medicine today?

195
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,480
I did.

196
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,600
But I haven't taken my painkillers.

197
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,680
You're right.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
You're a human.

199
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
You need to take care of yourself.

200
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,760
You have two hours to rest.

201
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,040
You must relax now.

202
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,520
Don't be nervous.

203
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,600
Have a good rest.

204
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,440
Understand?

205
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,880
Okay, I will relax.

206
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm not nervous.

207
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,720
I'll go out for a while.

208
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,040
Have a good rest.

209
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,640
You can do it.

210
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,160
You...

211
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Come back.

212
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
Come back quickly.

213
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,640
Dr. Zhu seems to be very nervous.

214
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,400
It seems like

215
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,120
a habitable emotional anxiety.

216
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
She is too nervous.

217
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
But there is no way.

218
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,280
It's already this step.

219
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,880
She can only rely on herself.

220
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,440
I...

221
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,040
Are you willing to let me try?

222
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,960
You?

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,520
Okay.

224
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,160
I'll leave it to you.

225
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,760
Su Chang, do me a favor.

226
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,920
Thank you.

227
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,760
By the way,

228
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
adjust the air conditioner for me.

229
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,280
Boss,

230
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,840
why did you take the medicine?

231
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,880
Why do you adjust the air conditioner?

232
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,440
Psychologically speaking,

233
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,080
while reducing the temperature,

234
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,200
you can also reduce the psychological risk of a person.

235
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
Zhu You...

236
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

237
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm here to analyze

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,920
your recording data.

239
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,440
Hello.

240
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,680
March 18, 2011.

241
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
It's a Wednesday.

242
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,440
Do you remember what day it is?

243
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,000
I...

244
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,880
I don't remember.

245
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,680
That day,

246
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,640
you won the Australian National Engineering Award

247
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,320
for the first time in the electronic engineering award.

248
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,040
I don't even remember the date.

249
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,280
July 15, 2013.

250
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,600
You won the IEEE industry award.

251
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,520
It's also a Wednesday, right?

252
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,920
What a coincidence.

253
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,720
It's all Wednesdays?

254
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,720
The image video compression technology you invented

255
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,000
won the entire award of the Chinese People's Congress.

256
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,760
It's still a Wednesday.

257
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,440
Then...

258
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,960
What day is it today?

259
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,160
It's also a Wednesday, right?

260
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes, it's a Wednesday.

261
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
It seems that Wednesday is your lucky day.

262
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
Yes, it is.

263
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,800
It is.

264
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,520
This is a drink that has been infused with

265
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,080
tea, acid, and concentrated juice.

266
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,480
It has a calming effect.

267
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Director Yuan asked someone to add

268
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,720
a famous Chinese medicine in it.

269
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,160
You should be able to fall asleep soon after drinking it.

270
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,160
But the meeting will be called soon.

271
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,840
It's not good to start now.

272
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,840
Don't worry.

273
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,320
Time flies so slowly.

274
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
I'll let you sleep.

275
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,720
How about this?

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,360
I'll help you finish the data.

277
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,480
You can take a rest.

278
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,280
Okay.

279
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
This... This smells weird.

280
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,440
I've turned off your phone.

281
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,840
Close your eyes and take a rest.

282
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,080
I'll call you in advance.

283
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,400
I'll go to bed first.

284
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.

285
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,200
It's really his lucky day.

286
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,680
I lied to him.

287
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
I knew it.

288
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,640
He needs someone

289
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,640
to give him a conscience.

290
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,280
You did a good job.

291
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,240
Thank you for your compliment, Director Yuan.

292
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,440
I put all the fruits

293
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,280
in the tea and water.

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,520
It doesn't smell bad.

295
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,200
He can drink it.

296
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,240
I lied to him that Director Yuan

297
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,840
added a famous Chinese medicine in it.

298
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,560
It doesn't smell bad too.

299
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,320
Yes, Director Yuan had good taste.

300
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
I know he liked it.

301
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,960
I think you're right.

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,760
Look at the fruits found on incarcerated workers,

303
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,040
they're not dry.

304
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,000
I forgot to tell you

305
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:05,820
that it's time to have a

306
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,760
morning massage every evening.

307
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,200
They all have a doctor.

308
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Mr. Yuan, did you take your medicine?

309
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
I'll go now.

310
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,040
Are you going to work in the office here?

311
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,640
Yes.

312
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,680
This is a place for both business and work.

313
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,200
Look.

314
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,320
We can work in this area.

315
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,400
We can go up and rest when we are tired.

316
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,840
There are shopping malls and subway stations nearby.

317
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,200
It's very convenient.

318
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,480
Many famous IT companies are located here.

319
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
The point is...

320
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,120
Look.

321
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,680
My favorite is this.

322
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,280
The floor.

323
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
The floor?

324
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,080
You have a good taste.

325
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,720
I think the floor

326
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
and the hardware are all good.

327
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,360
How much is it?

328
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,240
It's four yuan per square meter.

329
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,960
So expensive?

330
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,720
Mr. Du, do you accept it?

331
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,440
I don't think it's a good price.

332
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,520
It's not suitable.

333
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,680
Have you talked to him?

334
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,400
No.

335
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,840
He will talk to you.

336
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,760
Talk about the price.

337
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,440
It's a blind comparison.

338
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,560
Hello.

339
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,800
Look.

340
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,960
This is the beauty.

341
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,120
I brought the rent.

342
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,360
Are you satisfied with the house?

343
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,440
Yes.

344
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,080
Wait and see the price.

345
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,560
Okay.

346
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,600
It's so expensive.

347
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,760
Young man.

348
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,320
We are all college students.

349
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,040
We just started our business.

350
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,280
It's really not that cheap.

351
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
Can you help us

352
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
to lower the price?

353
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,160
Miss.

354
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,000
You are all going to be the boss.

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,160
Why do you have to make it difficult for me?

356
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,720
Besides,

357
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,120
I can't bargain with you.

358
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,360
I'm not a boss.

359
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,800
I can bargain with you.

360
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,680
I want to pay for it.

361
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,560
To be honest,

362
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,400
we have seen the one next door.

363
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,560
It's better than yours.

364
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,800
It's cheaper than yours.

365
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,760
If it wasn't for the place

366
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,640
that Mr. Li likes,

367
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,960
we would have booked their place.

368
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,600
Miss.

369
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,720
To be honest,

370
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
the one next door is also our agency's.

371
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,520
They are all the same price.

372
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,720
Tell me who it is.

373
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,760
Let me see which one

374
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,120
is the unruly one.

375
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,440
Forget it.

376
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,160
To be honest,

377
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,880
I think you are

378
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,160
quite lucky.

379
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,400
Mr. Du.

380
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,520
This is the best

381
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,280
commercial residential apartment nearby.

382
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,760
Tell me if you have any problem.

383
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
The parking outside

384
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,040
is too small.

385
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,600
And it's not enough.

386
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,240
Basically,

387
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,720
it's occupied by the mall next door.

388
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,640
We will solve this problem

389
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,840
very soon.

390
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
We will book the

391
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,920
nearby malls.

392
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,720
And

393
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,360
there is a problem with your property management.

394
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,320
Look.

395
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,000
Look at the mop.

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,320
The shelf is so dirty.

397
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,560
I can't bear to change it.

398
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,120
It's not clean.

399
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,080
And...

400
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,640
And the water leak.

401
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,560
Look.

402
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,760
In this environment,

403
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
we need to pay four yuan a day.

404
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,200
That's a lot.

405
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,320
Well...

406
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,720
Well...

407
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,760
Anyway,

408
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,560
we need to

409
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,840
pay cheaper.

410
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,480
Yes.

411
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,200
Please.

412
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,800
Okay.

413
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,440
Come on.

414
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,040
Let's talk inside.

415
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,840
Come on.

416
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,440
This way, please.

417
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,120
Okay.

418
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,760
Hello.

419
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,440
Dad asked you to go home.

420
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,200
But I have something to eat outside.

421
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,080
He is angry with you.

422
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,600
Dad knows that

423
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,040
you are starting a business with your friend.

424
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,160
If you don't come back,

425
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
you will know what dad is like.

426
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,520
Okay.

427
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,320
I'll be back soon.

428
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Xiaochun.

429
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,520
I have something to do.

430
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
Take your time.

431
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,480
Thank you, Mr. Du.

432
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,720
Goodbye, Mr. Du.

433
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,400
Goodbye.

434
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,120
Hello, everyone.

435
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,480
I am one of Chen Xin's founders.

436
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,360
No, I am not.

437
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
I am Zhu Youyi.

438
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,960
I believe that

439
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,080
you have seen it on the information.

440
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
I have developed a

441
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,640
internet-based evaluation system with my team.

442
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,400
It has estimated 200 million

443
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,840
before it was released.

444
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,640
What does it mean?

445
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,480
It means that my research and development

446
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,720
is valuable,

447
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,960
innovative,

448
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,280
and limitless.

449
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,560
I promise

450
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,640
that this project

451
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,920
will be launched within two months.

452
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,160
By then,

453
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,080
I can not only

454
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
use my own products,

455
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,280
but also evaluate

456
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,000
and face the world's development

457
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,880
so that everyone

458
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,160
and all enterprises

459
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,600
can buy and use it.

460
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Please believe that

461
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,440
my team and I

462
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
will make it

463
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
an important part of the

464
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
internet-based social platform.

465
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,440
All right.

466
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,720
Mr. Du,

467
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,240
with your every single word,

468
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,120
it will be our first project with members.

469
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,120
If you agree,

470
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,160
you can take stock of the

471
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,040
experiment.

472
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,600
Everyone,

473
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,120
and all enterprises

474
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,560
as well.

475
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,200
Everyone,

476
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,720
stay strong

477
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,720
and become a bold person.

478
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Mr. Du,

479
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Please, everyone.

480
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Are you okay, Yushuai?

481
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Yushuai.

482
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,520
Yushuai.

483
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,920
Yushuai.

484
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,840
Yushuai.

485
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,040
Help me.

486
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,640
You're breathing.

487
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,400
Does it hurt here?

488
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,880
No.

489
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,640
It hurts.

490
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,080
It hurts here.

491
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,160
It hurts here, too.

492
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,360
Okay.

493
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:18,960
It hurts.

494
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,720
Come down.

495
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,800
Come here. Sit.

496
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,320
Does it still hurt?

497
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,720
Yes.

498
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,200
Doctor.

499
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,240
How about we just do the surgery today?

500
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,920
Surgery?

501
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,400
No, no, no, doctor.

502
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,080
Well,

503
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,400
let's just take some medicine.

504
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,080
It's a conservative treatment.

505
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,000
No.

506
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,280
This kind of disease can only be cured

507
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,520
after the surgery.

508
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,200
Can you

509
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,920
listen to me first?

510
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
Yuxuan, please.

511
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,920
Your disease today

512
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,240
is acute laryngitis.

513
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,920
According to the current patient report,

514
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,200
it really needs an immediate surgery.

515
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,680
Okay.

516
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,800
We'll do our best to cooperate.

517
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,360
What?

518
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,760
No surgery.

519
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,440
Doctor.

520
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,920
I suddenly feel

521
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,160
less painful.

522
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,840
I think we should just take some medicine.

523
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,440
I think...

524
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,040
Doctor.

525
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,040
Don't believe him.

526
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,400
He's been in pain for days.

527
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,120
I believe...

528
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,160
Young man.

529
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,400
Here's the point.

530
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,360
If we don't do the surgery now

531
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,920
and just take conservative treatment,

532
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,920
it may recur in the future.

533
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,120
It will cause more complications

534
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,600
and increase the difficulty of the next surgery.

535
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,320
Yes.

536
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,920
We won't wait.

537
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,880
Let's do it now.

538
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,200
We must do it.

539
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,760
You...

540
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
Let's do it today.

541
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,880
Today?

542
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,320
I don't think we can do it today.

543
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,520
Because we need

544
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,800
24 hours of time before the surgery.

545
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,720
Yes. Yes. Yes.

546
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,400
Doctor, I...

547
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,080
He can do it.

548
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,000
He hasn't eaten anything

549
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,040
since yesterday.

550
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,080
Okay. Okay.

551
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,760
Young man.

552
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
You're lucky.

553
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,880
Your wife has prepared everything for you.

554
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,280
You're so considerate.

555
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm not.

556
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,160
Why not?

557
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
You're shy.

558
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,680
I am, doctor.

559
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
This little girl is so shy.

560
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,080
I'm not.

561
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,320
You haven't got your license yet.

562
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,400
I know.

563
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,120
Girlfriend.

564
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
Doctor, you know so much.

565
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,960
When we get married,

566
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,160
please have some candy.

567
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,280
What are you talking about?

568
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,960
What are you talking about?

569
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,480
Okay. Okay.

570
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,520
Don't joke.

571
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,040
Come on.

572
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
Let's do a pre-surgery first.

573
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,360
If there's no problem,

574
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,320
we can finish the surgery today.

575
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Okay, doctor.

576
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,000
If my wife

577
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,440
doesn't talk much to me,

578
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,240
I won't return the favor.

579
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:39,960
So I'd better

580
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,400
do a pre-surgery.

581
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,320
Doctor,

582
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,440
right now,

583
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,560
let's do a

584
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,040
pre-surgery.

585
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,480
Go.

586
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,000
Go away, wife.

587
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,160
Have her

588
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,080
done?

589
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,880
This little girl justES

590
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,000
You're the one who decided to make the decision for me.

591
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,680
Of course I'll give you a title.

592
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,800
Otherwise, it's not good.

593
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,880
You'll be punished for it.

594
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,160
Anyway, you'll have to sign for me later.

595
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,440
Why do you explain so much?

596
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,400
It hurts.

597
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,880
It hurts so much.

598
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,040
Hello, we're the nurses.

599
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
Which one is the patient?

600
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,880
Me.

601
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,840
Then you go to change your clothes with me.

602
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
Then the owner will go to the third floor to pay the bill.

603
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,240
I'll go to the third floor to pay the bill.

604
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,160
You go to pay the bill.

605
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
You go to pay the bill.

606
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,640
Go ahead, my dear.

607
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,120
Where are you going?

608
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,720
Is our God of War starting to get nervous?

609
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,160
It's just a small operation.

610
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,520
How can I be nervous?

611
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,480
You're underestimating me.

612
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,720
Zhang Jun,

613
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,560
I'm going in right away.

614
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,760
Yes.

615
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,360
Otherwise, why do you think we're here?

616
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,160
Playing games?

617
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,120
You know,

618
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,600
there's a big difference between doing an operation and not.

619
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm not a doctor.

620
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,520
I'm a doctor.

621
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,440
I'm a doctor.

622
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,360
I'm a doctor.

623
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,480
It's not a big deal.

624
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,000
But it's dangerous.

625
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,800
Is it a surgery?

626
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,240
I think the doctor should be able to do it with his eyes closed.

627
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,320
It's an operation, anyway.

628
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,080
Can you stop talking like you're playing?

629
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,440
Am I still trying to comfort you?

630
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Yes.

631
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,160
You won't understand

632
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,520
how I feel when I lie down.

633
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,960
Don't worry.

634
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,240
I'll send you a uniform outside.

635
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,120
Zhang Jun,

636
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,520
if you're done with the operation,

637
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,800
I'll come out with my eyes closed.

638
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,480
Remember,

639
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,440
my parents' phone is in my phone.

640
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,040
You can easily find them.

641
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,920
If you can't find them,

642
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,080
you can find Lu Xiaochun.

643
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,120
And,

644
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,560
remember to help me look after her.

645
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,240
If you're willing,

646
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,120
she can follow your heart.

647
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,960
Her name is

648
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,000
Jiang Langtai.

649
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,440
Do you want to tell me

650
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,400
all your bank accounts?

651
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,320
What else do you want to tell me?

652
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,040
Just tell me, Wang Can.

653
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,080
I don't care.

654
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,960
You must be by my side

655
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,720
after the operation.

656
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,400
I want to see you at first sight.

657
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,480
Okay, I know.

658
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,760
Don't worry.

659
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,080
You want to be by my side?

660
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,520
I'm sorry. I have to go in now.

661
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,240
Wait.

662
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,920
I have one last question.

663
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,920
I've loved you before.

664
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,840
Hurry up.

665
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,720
Come on.

666
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,600
Let's go.

667
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,880
Go.

668
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Wait for me.

669
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,800
I'm coming.

670
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Remember to wait for me.

671
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,160
My password is 12345678.

672
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,000
I believe in you.

673
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,920
Really?

674
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,120
No matter what happened in your life,

675
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,680
it was true to yourself.

676
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,760
Every girl has an experience after graduation.

677
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,040
It looks easy to me.

678
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,360
Once I get out,

679
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,520
everything changes.

680
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,800
Xiang facing a knife

681
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,480
suddenly changed her posture with everyone.

682
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,280
Yes.

683
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,120
Xiaeno is always

684
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,640
capable to change her attitude.

685
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,920
Is it your attitude or your strategy?

686
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
How do you want me to answer you?

687
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,200
Do you know why I like

688
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,320
to cut the basin so much?

689
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,760
Du Lei.

690
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,280
If you want to cut a basin

691
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
that has a value,

692
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,160
you have to cut off

693
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,960
some unnecessary branches.

694
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,880
Only in this way

695
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,240
can you achieve

696
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,760
a perfect work of art.

697
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,480
I have been training you

698
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,160
for so many years.

699
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,000
I have strict requirements.

700
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,760
It's the same principle.

701
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,280
But now I suddenly realize

702
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,520
that you are too strong.

703
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,680
You are about to fly.

704
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,160
I am a man,

705
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,120
not a fountain.

706
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,760
And it's not

707
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,600
the perfect work of art.

708
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,000
Very good.

709
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Son.

710
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
I suddenly realize that

711
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,600
we have never

712
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,160
talked so openly.

713
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,720
Today, as your sister,

714
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
if you have any dissatisfaction with me,

715
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
I hope you can say it.

716
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,800
Say it.

717
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,880
From today on,

718
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
I want to be myself.

719
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,240
Be myself.

720
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,920
Son.

721
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,560
I didn't expect you to be so old

722
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
and still so naive.

723
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,920
Do you think

724
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,120
you have achieved

725
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,920
all these achievements

726
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,040
by yourself?

727
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,320
Ask your sister.

728
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,720
Your sister knows better than you.

729
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,160
Without me,

730
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,160
you, you,

731
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,480
you are nothing.

732
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,280
I have done enough

733
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,560
for the 18 years of replacement.

734
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,480
Okay.

735
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,560
Okay.

736
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
You have done enough, right?

737
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,320
Do you know that

738
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,280
you have to pay

739
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,720
a price for this?

740
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,040
I can achieve it.

741
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,520
I can also

742
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,280
destroy you

743
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,520
like a dead ant.

744
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,440
How?

745
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,760
I just want to take back

746
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,160
everything you gave me.

747
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Wealth,

748
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,240
status,

749
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,480
reputation.

750
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,240
I can give them all back to you.

751
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,360
Including the name of the dead child.

752
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,040
I can also give them back to you.

753
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,720
You...

754
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,360
How can you say that to your dad?

755
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,160
Dad.

756
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,760
Dad.

757
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,080
Dad.

758
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,680
Dad.

759
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,440
Get out.

760
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,600
Dad.

761
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,480
Get out.

762
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,080
Get out.

763
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,840
Get out.

764
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,600
Get out.

765
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,120
I'll go get the dead child back.

766
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,280
Don't be angry.

767
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,000
Okay.

768
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,080
Okay.

769
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,560
Dad, get out.

770
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,720
Wait.

771
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,800
Du.

772
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,840
Wait.

773
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,600
Do you know what you just said?

774
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,640
Dad, he's doing this for your own good.

775
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,440
For my own good?

776
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,560
He's planning my life step by step.

777
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,880
He's trying to make you blame me

778
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,640
for his so-called survival.

779
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,160
You can't have your own emotions.

780
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,600
You can't have your own feelings.

781
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,480
Since I was a kid,

782
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
I've been a devil who's been divorced.

783
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
He's running away from me.

784
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,160
I...

785
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,160
I really envied you when I was a kid.

786
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,040
Really.

787
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,200
You can do whatever you want

788
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
freely.

789
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
So,

790
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,400
I tried my best to prove it to you.

791
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,800
Until I realized it was my fault.

792
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,800
I didn't want this.

793
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,880
We're born different.

794
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,200
You're Du.

795
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm not.

796
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,600
I'm not.

797
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,680
Du.

798
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,880
Sister.

799
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,760
Do you remember my name?

800
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,280
I don't know how to hear

801
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,840
You walk so fast

802
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,040
It's okay.

803
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,680
I can't catch your light

804
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,560
You fly so high

805
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,440
Leave all the things behind

806
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,360
And I'll still live a life of no way

807
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,280
To fight

808
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
To fight

809
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:08,840
Hello.

810
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,600
How long will he wake up?

811
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,120
Maybe two hours.

812
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,080
Your boyfriend will take longer.

813
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,040
He's too scared.

814
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,800
He needs to be anesthetized.

815
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,440
About four to five hours.

816
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,000
He's not...

817
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,880
It's okay. Thank you.

818
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm not talking about you.

819
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,800
You're so weak.

820
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,360
But you're still in bed.

821
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,880
You're so weak.

822
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,920
You must eat on time.

823
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,440
You're the real revolution.

824
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
Now you can only lie here

825
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,720
and be a good man.

826
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,800
Look at you.

827
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,880
You have a high nose.

828
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,240
I didn't notice you when I was a kid.

829
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,680
You look pretty.

830
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,360
You have a big face.

831
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,720
So shameless.

832
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,520
You're so quiet now.

833
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,760
You don't get angry or talk back.

834
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,080
You're so gentle.

835
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,400
Why do you have to be so nice?

836
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,280
Isn't it good to be harmonious?

837
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,120
But it's rare

838
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,240
to see you so good.

839
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,600
Mom.

840
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,280
From now on, you must eat well.

841
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,240
Don't stay up late.

842
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,800
Listen to Jiang Jun.

843
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,840
He's taking the risk.

844
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,920
To change his mind.

845
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,480
President Huo asked me

846
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,520
to open the restaurant.

847
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,200
So I'm,

848
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,960
satisfied.

849
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,200
Congratulations.

850
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,160
Is this good?

851
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,120
This point scenario

852
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,280
speaks volumes.

853
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
I was late when I was driving over from school.

854
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Being yourself?

855
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Do you think you got all these achievements today

856
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
because of being yourself?

857
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Ask your sister.

858
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Your sister understands better than you.

859
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Without me, you, you, you are nothing!

860
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Yes!

861
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
It's here.

862
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Mr. Du.

863
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Are you sure his birth date is December 10th, 6.15 a.m.?

864
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Yes.

865
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Child, what's your name?

866
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Say it.

867
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Say it.

868
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
Don't come over.

869
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Go. Go.

870
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Child, you must remember.

871
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Your name is Du Lei.

872
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,800
He is my son.

873
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Do you remember?

874
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Do you know?

875
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Son, I welcome you home.

876
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
I just want you to remember that

877
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
from today on,

878
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,800
all the things and memories

879
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
that you have

880
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
must be lost.

881
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Okay?

882
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
I know, Dad.

883
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
He doesn't understand.

884
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Don't you understand?

885
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Come back.

886
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Come back.

887
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
I'm sorry.

888
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm sorry.

889
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
I'm sorry.

890
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
I'm sorry.

891
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
I'm sorry.

892
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
I'm sorry.

893
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
I'm sorry.

894
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
I'm sorry.

895
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
I'm sorry.

896
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I'm sorry.

897
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
I'm sorry.

898
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I'm sorry.

899
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
I'm sorry.

900
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
I'm sorry.

901
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm sorry.

902
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm sorry.

903
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
I'm sorry.

904
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
I'm sorry.

905
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm sorry.

906
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm sorry.

907
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
I'm sorry.

908
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I'm sorry.

909
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
I'm sorry.

910
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I'm sorry.

911
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm sorry.

912
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
I'm sorry.

913
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
I'm sorry.

914
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I'm sorry.

915
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm sorry.

916
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm sorry.

917
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm sorry.

918
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
I'm sorry.

919
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
I'm sorry.

920
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I'm sorry.

921
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
I'm sorry.

922
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
I'm sorry.

923
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I'm sorry.

924
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm sorry.

925
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
I'm sorry.

926
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,800
I'm sorry.

927
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,800
I'm sorry.

928
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
I'm sorry.

929
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
I'm sorry.

930
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I'm sorry.

931
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
I'm sorry.

932
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I'm sorry.

933
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm sorry.

934
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
I'm sorry.

935
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I'm sorry.

936
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
I'm sorry.

937
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800

940
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
I'm sorry.

941
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm sorry.

942
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
I'm sorry.

943
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
I'm sorry.

944
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm sorry.

945
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
I'm sorry.

946
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
I'm sorry.

947
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
I'm sorry.

948
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800

949
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
I'm sorry.

950
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
I'm sorry.

951
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
I'm sorry.

952
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
I'm sorry.

953
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,800
I'm sorry.

954
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
I'm sorry.

955
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
I'm sorry.

956
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I'm sorry.

957
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
I'm sorry.

958
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
I'm sorry.

959
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
I'm sorry.

960
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm sorry.

961
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
I'm sorry.

962
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
