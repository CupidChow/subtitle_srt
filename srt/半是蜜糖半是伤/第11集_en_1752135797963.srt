00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,580
I'm going to make a

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,580
I'm going to make a

3
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,580
I'm going to make a

4
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,580
I'm going to make a

5
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,580
I'm going to make a

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,580
I'm going to make a

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,580
I'm going to make a

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,580
I'm going to make a

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,580
I'm going to make a

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,580
I'm going to make a

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,580
I'm going to make a

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,580
I'm going to make a

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,580
I'm going to make a

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,540
murdered

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,540
Prepare for outer work

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,180
Well what

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,340
It's BET BET

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,340
Ultrasound

19
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:18,600
How to do

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
How to do

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,180
What?

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,380
What

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,440
Palmer

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,440
The Long Ballad

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Episode 18

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Tang Xin has withdrawn from the dormitory.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Do you still have evidence?

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Evidence?

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
Do you have it?

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
I can prove it.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,440
The Long Ballad

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,440
President Mai, thank you for your hard work.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,440
As the new CEO of Lin Wei,

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I want to thank MH for always trusting us.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,440
But this time, it's just to improve his personal behavior.

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
He can't decide the management direction of our company.

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,440
I will also show the world that

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Wanxing Entertainment is determined to keep the industry order.

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
This time, we can get rid of Wan Shan.

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
General and General are in a good position.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Of course.

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
You have to thank President Luo for his help.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
President Fan, I'm leaving.

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Okay.

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
General

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
You brat.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,440
I almost thought you couldn't turn the tables.

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I was wondering how to help you.

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
You made a mess.

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
But the result is good.

51
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,440
President Fan, you said that.

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
When did I disappoint you?

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
This is the General you mentioned.

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
You did well today.

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Thank you, President Fan.

56
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Wan Shan must have a mastermind behind it.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Otherwise, he can't be so ungrateful.

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Even if he has a dog head military counselor behind him,

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
he will never be defeated.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
He is just a small bug.

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
But President Fan,

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,440
the surprises we just suffered,

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,440
we have to rely on your bonus to comfort him.

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
You brat.

65
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
You are so good.

66
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Okay, I will miss you.

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
By the way, I have an appointment.

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
I'm leaving.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Okay, President Fan, you can go first.

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Bye, President Fan.

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
You did well on this mission.

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Thank you for your compliment.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Should you treat me to a cup of coffee?

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
General

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Thank you.

76
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Thank you.

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
I thought you wouldn't come.

78
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
I came because of you.

79
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
I don't want to disappoint the people who believe in me.

80
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Although I know that the impact I have

81
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
can't change anything,

82
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
I want to find a direction for those girls

83
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,440
who are still like me and suffering from difficulties.

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
You did well.

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
The End

86
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
I have told you,

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
don't let this dagger strike you.

88
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
You are too self-righteous.

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
No matter the result, success or failure,

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
I will choose it myself.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
I will bear all the consequences.

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,440
You will bear all the consequences?

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Why?

94
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Is your heart hot-blooded?

95
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Yuan Shuai has become your heart demon.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
You have to listen to me this time.

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Go back to the company.

98
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
There are many things to deal with.

99
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Only I and Junwu can help you defeat him.

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
How to defeat him is my own business.

101
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
If you still think I am that Li Ren Min,

102
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
then it's not difficult to defeat him.

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Then I will change my mind.

104
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
I have something else to do. I'm leaving.

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
The End

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Here.

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Tang Xin is too pitiful.

108
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
She has encountered this kind of disaster when she first entered society.

109
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,440
I believe that Wan Shan will be punished by law this time.

110
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,440
After the Wanxian Entertainment IPO application is over,

111
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
can I apply to sleep well?

112
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Sleeping is fine.

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
A vacation is also fine.

114
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
But before that,

115
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
shouldn't you do a self-review?

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Where exactly is your problem with this Wan Shan case?

117
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
I know.

118
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
I almost lost a big client to AMS.

119
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
But it's not just that.

120
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
So serious.

121
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,440
You won't let me pass again, right?

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,440
I haven't let anyone finish the victory celebration for three seconds.

123
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Now the review meeting is about to start.

124
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
You are for Tang Xin's justice.

125
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
That's right.

126
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
You are the heroine of Mozi.

127
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
But the investment is not mixed with the world.

128
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,440
You actually went to record a video secretly.

129
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Do you know how dangerous this is?

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
It was you who rejected me at first.

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
I had to fight alone.

132
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
I hid it from you.

133
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,440
That's because I didn't want you to get involved.

134
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
You said Wan Shan is a scumbag.

135
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,440
You mean you believed me at first?

136
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
I...

137
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Of course I used my wisdom.

138
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
I knew Wan Shan was wrong.

139
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
You are bragging.

140
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
You.

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Your brain is just like your brain capacity.

142
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
It's not reliable.

143
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Are you going to hold the box and cut the gold coins behind my back?

144
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
You know how to hold the box?

145
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
What do you mean?

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Nothing.

147
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
I just heard a story about holding the box two days ago.

148
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
It's quite inspiring.

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
What's that sound?

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
It's the sound of saving lives.

151
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
I didn't sleep last night.

152
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
I didn't eat today.

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
I finally understand what it is called.

154
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Since my employees are working so hard,

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
as the boss, I'll treat you to a meal.

156
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Say it.

157
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
What do you want to eat?

158
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Really?

159
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
I'm so hungry that I can eat a cow.

160
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
But I think we can only eat cow's meat.

161
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
How about this?

162
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Go to my house.

163
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
What do you want to do?

164
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
What do I want to do?

165
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
It's time to show the real skills.

166
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
What skills?

167
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
The cooking skills.

168
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
You can cook?

169
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
I found two movie tickets.

170
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Is this yours, Xiao Chuan?

171
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Yes.

172
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Mr. Li Xiao Chuan,

173
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I found two movie tickets.

174
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I heard they were good.

175
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
I want you to watch it with me.

176
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Do you want to take a picture with me?

177
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I've seen it.

178
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Okay.

179
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Okay.

180
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I'll take a picture with you.

181
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm destined to be with you.

182
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,440
I'll find a way to meet you.

183
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Go for it.

184
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Honey, what are you doing?

185
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
I heard there's a horror movie.

186
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
It's very scary.

187
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Do you have time to watch it together?

188
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Why don't you talk to me?

189
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Are there other girls around you?

190
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Yes.

191
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm not afraid of you.

192
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I have a convenient store.

193
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Do you think it's pretty?

194
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Why are you here?

195
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,440
I want you to experience the difference between real people and AI.

196
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
Like the Turing test.

197
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
What Turing test?

198
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Do you know how AI is judged by AI?

199
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Turing has a theory.

200
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
When you separate a person from an AI,

201
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
this AI can only be used to make a person's question.

202
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
And this person must judge whether the other person is a human or an AI.

203
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
It's upgraded to artificial intelligence.

204
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
So

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I think it's a good point.

206
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
It's a good point.

207
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
This is a good point.

208
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
God

209
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,440
The way of the brain of the student is different from that of the normal person.

210
00:12:48,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Equがとう具いる意味で悲しくなりたい

211
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,820
yet you Peppa knows thick skin.

212
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,960
Peppa knows enchantment.

213
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,340
Then you're a tao.

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,120
Sure

215
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,660
The Services Bar ge Barn.

216
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,260
Ms. Zeyu

217
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,600
Hello

218
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,280
Hello

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Problem.

220
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,440
struggling

221
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,840
and helping my mother.

222
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm moving.

223
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm not going to show my face.

224
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm not going to show my face.

225
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,400
Just take a picture of him.

226
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,680
No, no, no.

227
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,040
A thousand miles to send a goose feather.

228
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,040
A thousand miles to send a goose feather.

229
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,800
I, Yuan Shuai,

230
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,600
have always been a person

231
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,800
who values

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,960
the gift of others.

233
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,000
This is the least respect

234
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
for the sender.

235
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
It's all snacks.

236
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,760
Okay.

237
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,840
Miss Jiang.

238
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,680
This is our celebration anyway.

239
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,880
Just, just eat this.

240
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,920
Being a person,

241
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,800
the most important thing is to be happy.

242
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,800
Yes.

243
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,400
Are you hungry?

244
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,120
I'll cook you noodles.

245
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,840
I'll cook

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
for you tonight.

247
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,120
You can eat

248
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,480
something better next time.

249
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,480
Okay, okay, okay.

250
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,440
You

251
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,680
just sit in the living room

252
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,440
and wait for the taste test.

253
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,320
You want to cook?

254
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,640
You really know how to cook?

255
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,920
The sky is gray.

256
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,720
The time I miss you.

257
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,520
Is it delicious?

258
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,880
Why are you so good?

259
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,800
My only one only love oh.

260
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,200
What complicated methods should I use?

261
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,040
Just wait a little longer.

262
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
It'll be ready soon.

263
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,440
You are the only one of my life.

264
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,720
I can't read the book.

265
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,480
I still want to remember.

266
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,200
I think I got caught in that line.

267
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,280
I can't find you.

268
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,680
It's here.

269
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,120
I love you.

270
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,200
It's true.

271
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,320
I can't stop thinking of you.

272
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,240
Every minute, every second.

273
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
I didn't expect he would still be here.

274
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,400
Yes.

275
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,120
He said he would let me be the master of his life.

276
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,840
I have to be responsible for him for the rest of my life.

277
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,280
Why are you drawing on the door?

278
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,480
That's...

279
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,600
That's a plan I made for practice.

280
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,080
I can't go this time.

281
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,920
I saw Sun Nian Que in at a restaurant last time.

282
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,040
I wonder how he did.

283
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,080
I really...

284
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:33,280
I have to first of all check my

285
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,760
itinerary.

286
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,680
Time flies.

287
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,560
Thank you again.

288
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
When it is done,

289
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,040
dip it in water

290
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,800
and then we can copy the doll.

291
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,880
It smells good, too.

292
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,760
I like it here.

293
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,460
Thanks, Auntie Huang.

294
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,680
According to your Accepting chance rules,

295
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,400
any kind of fakeate

296
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,160
is a good way to claim your money justement.

297
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,360
Why don't we

298
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,320
make a deal on all our accounts

299
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,200
by using our bank accounts?

300
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,360
Sure, thank you.

301
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,880
Say it.

302
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:39,740
Little

303
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,740
Do.

304
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,560
I didn¡¯t expect that you¡¯d prepare all these dishes on the table.

305
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,640
Living abroad,

306
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,120
if you don¡¯t want to starve yourself to death,

307
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,540
that¡¯s the first thing you¡¯ll want to do.

308
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,280
Give me that glass.

309
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,580
Though lightweight,

310
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,780
Try some of this some raw materials.

311
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,220
Is it for real? So expensive.

312
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,180
Is it real?

313
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,740
Your turn.

314
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,660
Tasty.

315
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,660
Tasty?

316
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,980
It's tasty.

317
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Slow down.

318
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,420
Even the wood-of-ex wood is notCómo put.

319
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,420
You're so stubborn.

320
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
When you wanted to wear

321
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,180
the red dress

322
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,980
and go to school,

323
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,940
I didn't say that.

324
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,300
What are you looking at?

325
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,860
I don't remember.

326
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,580
I haven't worn it.

327
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,380
Even if you become

328
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,580
the general manager of MS,

329
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,260
you can't erase

330
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,700
your dark past.

331
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,180
Listen,

332
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,380
you'd better not wear my shoes.

333
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,780
Or I'll take out

334
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,500
all your glory.

335
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:05,940
Jiang Jun.

336
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,020
I want to see

337
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,420
the now-general

338
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,660
MS manager.

339
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,500
Back then,

340
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,700
he was chasing

341
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,380
our fat cow for a pig.

342
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,060
Eat your eggplant.

343
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,020
Eat you.

344
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,340
Your mouth will be covered with it.

345
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,500
It's slippery.

346
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,900
Right.

347
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,420
It's delicious.

348
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,460
Can I see you?

349
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,620
You have work?

350
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,420
I got a call.

351
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,140
Try it.

352
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,740
It's delicious.

353
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:38,940
Really?

354
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,020
It must be made by me.

355
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Yes.

356
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,060
Is it delicious?

357
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:45,900
Yes.

358
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,980
Is it delicious?

359
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,660
Do you dare to eat this?

360
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,620
Don't go.

361
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,660
Die.

362
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,980
Pity.

363
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,700
Almost lost the job,

364
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,340
but it doesn't matter.

365
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,540
If it were not for you,

366
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,100
how could General Staff be so impulsive

367
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,660
and run away to find Tang Xin without me?

368
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,020
He trusted you so much

369
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,540
and took you as his son.

370
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,140
So why did he also

371
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,260
ask if you can't stop him?

372
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,140
What is he waiting for?

373
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,860
Stop him?

374
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,900
I can never stop him from doing that.

375
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,900
But He died

376
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,780
in the encirclement of Runic Kingdom,

377
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,620
anybody elseur.

378
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,460
and treat you as a real friend.

379
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,060
But you used him to deal with me.

380
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,180
Are you so afraid of losing to me?

381
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,380
Mr. Yuan.

382
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,940
You look down on me.

383
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,340
I've resigned.

384
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,700
You asked me to come here to tell me this?

385
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,260
That's not you.

386
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,220
I asked you here today

387
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,940
mainly to cut the wheel.

388
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,420
Secondly,

389
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,100
I want to tell you

390
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,380
that you can let go of some things,

391
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,180
but you can't let go of some things.

392
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,100
What do you mean?

393
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,780
This is from her.

394
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,980
You should have seen her.

395
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,220
General is a good girl.

396
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,420
I promised her before.

397
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,540
Du Lei.

398
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,060
I'm warning you.

399
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,460
Stay away from her.

400
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,780
Don't go.

401
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,100
I told her that

402
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,180
you can let go of some things,

403
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,460
but you can't let go of some things.

404
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,100
Interesting.

405
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,780
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,180
You want me to ask Li Xiaochuan to watch a movie?

407
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,860
I really...

408
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,580
I've tried all kinds of ways

409
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,700
but he still can't get used to it.

410
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,900
So?

411
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,660
I can only come to beg you.

412
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,700
It's useless.

413
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,580
I'm not familiar with him.

414
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,300
It's okay.

415
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,380
I've thought about it.

416
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,220
You asked him to fix your phone, right?

417
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,100
Then you can tell him

418
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,820
that you want to thank him

419
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
and ask him to watch a movie.

420
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,580
You can also take me as your sister.

421
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,580
That's it.

422
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,340
But the one who asked him to help is General.

423
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,340
My kind, lovely, beautiful and elegant Junjun.

424
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,220
It's a big thing in my life.

425
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,100
I can only rely on you.

426
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,620
I'm begging you.

427
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,580
Okay.

428
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,460
I'll help you ask him.

429
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,420
Really?

430
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,540
You can tell him the answer to it.

431
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,300
From now on,

432
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,180
I can only leave Junjun

433
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,100
Derui.

434
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,100
You're my girlfriend.

435
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:18,940
What are you up to?

436
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,060
You are back.

437
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,980
What are you doing here?

438
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,580
I brought you some food.

439
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,620
Just feed me.

440
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,620
I want to watch a movie with him.

441
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,580
Li Xiaochuan?

442
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,380
You asked me to find that expert.

443
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,780
He's always in the convenience store downstairs.

444
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,020
It's the one that Li Li runs.

445
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,700
It's a online store.

446
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,140
It's Li Li's favorite store.

447
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,260
Online store?

448
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,580
Convenience store?

449
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,660
But...

450
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,940
Why are you so suspicious?

451
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,340
No wonder I asked him to come back

452
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,780
and get his phone back.

453
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,540
Wait.

454
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,860
Why did you ask him to watch a movie?

455
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,300
What's your relationship with him?

456
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,260
What?

457
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,700
It's not me.

458
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,780
It's Li Li who wants to meet him.

459
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,060
I helped him get a job.

460
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,100
We've only met once.

461
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,740
We don't know each other.

462
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,700
How can we know each other?

463
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,900
I'm thinking about it.

464
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,580
Didn't you ask him to help you?

465
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,740
You two should know each other better.

466
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,980
Li Xiaochuan and I?

467
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,020
We know each other.

468
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,300
But...

469
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,500
Forget it.

470
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,580
I don't think you can do it.

471
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,820
We're just friends on the phone.

472
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
He can't do it.

473
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,540
Really?

474
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,540
Forget it.

475
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,860
Let's make an appointment.

476
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,900
An appointment.

477
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,180
An appointment?

478
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,860
Four tickets.

479
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,180
Four? Why?

480
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,700
Five is fine.

481
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,980
Five?

482
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,700
Four.

483
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,020
Four tickets for five.

484
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,300
Deal.

485
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,340
Deal.

486
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,900
Li Xiaochuan and Xu Li?

487
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,060
You...

488
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,220
I'm going to

489
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,620
meet Xiaochuan now.

490
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,620
You...

491
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,820
You...

492
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,380
Look.

493
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,180
Is this one good?

494
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,540
Yes.

495
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,860
Where are the pants?

496
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,700
I'll get them first.

497
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,300
You're annoying.

498
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,100
What about this one?

499
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,660
This one.

500
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,020
It's beautiful.

501
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,540
Which one is better?

502
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,140
Which one is better?

503
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,540
It's very important today.

504
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,300
I know.

505
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,980
But you've tried it for three hours.

506
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,340
Do you really want to know the truth?

507
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,980
Give it to me.

508
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,100
This one is the best.

509
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,740
Really.

510
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,540
Really?

511
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,460
Then I'll wear this one.

512
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,260
Look. It's beautiful.

513
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:18,980
So cute.

514
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,660
Xiaochuan will definitely like it.

515
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,340
Why are you so dry today?

516
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,220
You didn't wash your face?

517
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,620
I'm just thinking

518
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,900
about a date today.

519
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,100
I'm so lucky.

520
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,340
You're so lucky.

521
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,340
Here.

522
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,940
Apply a small layer of

523
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,580
essence.

524
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,780
The movie is about to start.

525
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,660
Right.

526
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,380
You should apply

527
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,500
essence before you put on makeup.

528
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,540
Thank you, my dear friend.

529
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,180
Bye.

530
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,780
I'll get it.

531
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:52,900
Really?

532
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,820
Really?

533
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,120
Take a pink slit is better.

534
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,300
Why did Xiaochuan

535
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,260
decide to leave?

536
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,180
Don't worry.

537
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,500
Xiaochuan will be late.

538
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,340
Lu.

539
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,500
I thought you've arrived?

540
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,220
Lu.

541
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,500
You look just like him.

542
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,940
Don't you look everything looks same to me?

543
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,660
Mingyue.

544
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,940
I wonder why you came to my house

545
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,540
so quickly with your phone.

546
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,300
Didn't you come back to study?

547
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,100
What are you doing every day?

548
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,900
You've been squatting down in my house for so long.

549
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,620
Why don't you come up to say hello to me?

550
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,340
Do you know that there's a light network in your community?

551
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,500
It's very fast.

552
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,580
The school's network speed is too slow

553
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,020
to send you to your house.

554
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:45,860
If you want to go online,

555
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,700
why don't you just come to my house?

556
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,180
Why should I go to your house and be tortured by you?

557
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,300
What?

558
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm afraid that I'll disturb you.

559
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,420
If you want to go online,

560
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,900
just come to my house directly.

561
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,860
Do you hear me?

562
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,380
Okay.

563
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,460
You're really a low-key lunatic.

564
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,420
Well, our movie

565
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,460
will start in two minutes.

566
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,100
Let's go.

567
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,980
Oh, right.

568
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,700
I bought you a movie ticket.

569
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,940
This is yours.

570
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,700
This is yours.

571
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
What's wrong?

572
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,980
This is...

573
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,260
No, we're not together?

574
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,220
Junjun,

575
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,660
didn't you say that you wanted to watch this movie the most?

576
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,900
You told me yesterday that you forgot.

577
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,860
For the victory of the revolution,

578
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,860
I bought two different movie tickets.

579
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,460
Take care.

580
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,580
Our movie will start in two minutes.

581
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,660
Let's go.

582
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,420
You really...

583
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,500
You know what I'm thinking.

584
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,260
What?

585
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,580
So we're just going to watch this?

586
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,180
What?

587
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,580
Do you have any opinions?

588
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,620
Watch it carefully.

589
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,740
Let's go.

590
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,020
What's wrong?

591
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,700
I'm fine.

592
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,300
It's me?

593
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,940
He dashes late

594
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,140
like this.

595
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,980
Did he do it on purpose?

596
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,380
It doesn't matter.

597
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,380
I'll try again.

598
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,980
I'm sorry

599
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Well

600
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,980
If you are afraid

601
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
You can

602
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Wait outside the door

603
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
I want to see

604
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
I'm sorry

605
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
There used to be a sheep

606
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
It stands in the sheep's group and counts

607
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
One sheep

608
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
Two sheep

609
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Three sheep

610
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Finally it counted itself and fell asleep

611
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Uncle

612
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
Can you be quiet

613
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Watch a movie

614
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Are you asleep

615
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,980
If you rise your tongue a little bit more

616
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
I can pour the coke

617
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,980
Did you go

618
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
Not yet

619
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,700
and family?

620
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,860
I feel so sorry

621
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,020
that you can't original

622
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,700
change because of your relationship and parents.

623
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,620
Close your eyes.

624
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,820
It's quite useful for me.

625
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,700
It's also useful for you to grow up.

626
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,460
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

627
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,740
I'm not going to the cinema.

628
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,380
Why?

629
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,380
Because Lily always

630
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,820
cries in a bad mood.

631
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,580
She can't even comfort me.

632
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,700
Then in the future,

633
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,940
I'll come with you.

634
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,900
I'll come with you.

635
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,500
Okay.

636
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,020
You can't take the money.

637
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,780
Okay.

638
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,100
You can't

639
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,460
let me buy you a flower.

640
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,820
Okay.

641
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,340
That's good.

642
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
That's to save me

643
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,860
from being ungrateful.

644
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,740
Okay.

645
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
I'll buy you a movie.

646
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,580
Okay.

647
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,700
plot twist

648
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,140
Older brother, elder sister,

649
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,180
you two go back

650
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,100
to play idol drama, okay?

651
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,980
I've been here

652
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,100
for ten minutes.

653
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,620
The next movie is going to be Также Lebowiat.

654
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,700
I'm sorry.

655
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,900
I'm sorry.

656
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,580
You look like Luo Yunxi.

657
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,780
You're so handsome.

658
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,700
You're getting a discount, big sister.

659
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,260
Big sister?

660
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,780
What's wrong with you?

661
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,980
I look like Bai Lu.

662
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,100
Have you heard of Bai Lu?

663
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,260
Big sister.

664
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,540
Uncle.

665
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,180
Big sister.

666
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,660
Uncle.

667
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,180
Big sister.

668
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:39,820
Uncle.

669
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,580
It's your fault.

670
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,380
Stop it.

671
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,580
I'm sorry.

672
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,020
Guangcai.

673
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,300
You're here.

674
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,860
Why are you looking at me

675
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,780
with such a confused look?

676
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,100
You don't believe me?

677
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,940
Listen.

678
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,740
He will show up later.

679
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:32,820
So you

680
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,780
Chinese.

681
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,260
Did you hear me?

682
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,860
to get it out?

683
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,580
If it doesn't work,

684
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,460
don't force yourself.

685
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,140
You can ask the owner.

686
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,380
It's so hard.

687
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,580
Don't look down on me.

688
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,180
I just need a little bit.

689
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,340
Didn't you check the formula?

690
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,180
I don't check it.

691
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:58,900
I just check it myself.

692
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,700
Just wait.

693
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,420
If you don't check the formula,

694
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,180
I don't believe you can get it out.

695
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,140
You're throwing things at my house again.

696
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,700
You're throwing things at my house again.

697
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,140
Jiang Xue.

698
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,540
I'm here.

699
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,980
Miss Jiang, hello.

700
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,100
I'm from the neighborhood.

701
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,140
Last time, your house was flooded.

702
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,500
I didn't fill up the space for you.

703
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,300
I brought you some inconvenience.

704
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:25,820
I'm sorry.

705
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,660
Our leader

706
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,860
asked me to bring you some gifts

707
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,660
and send them to you.

708
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,100
Thank you.

709
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,980
By the way,

710
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,580
if you have any questions next time,

711
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,620
you can ask the owner.

712
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,300
The owner

713
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,860
can fill up the space for you anytime.

714
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,500
But I don't know the owner.

715
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,780
Really?

716
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,780
I don't know the owner?

717
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,580
I don't know the owner.

718
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,580
I don't know the owner.

719
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,620
I don't know the owner.

720
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,260
No way.

721
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,940
You've been living here for so long.

722
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,580
You haven't seen him?

723
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,540
He's right opposite the door.

724
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,380
Qu Yuan Yi?

725
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:51,940
Yes.

726
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,900
He's the original handsome man

727
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,940
of 701.

728
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,980
He's a good man.

729
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,460
I'm so unlucky.

730
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,300
I'm so unlucky.

731
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,180
Why are you always like this?

732
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,860
You're so lucky.

733
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,820
I'm not lucky.

734
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,660
The house on the third floor

735
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,660
has so much money left every month.

736
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,860
It's not bad.

737
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,260
Don't be too careful.

738
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,860
Don't say that.

739
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,380
I've just observed it.

740
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,900
Since he paid the money,

741
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,500
he never came here.

742
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,740
So I plan to

743
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,300
earn it again.

744
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,260
You're so lucky.

745
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,220
I'm so lucky.

746
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,260
I know.

747
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,300
I'll go.

748
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,180
Auntie.

749
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,740
You're here.

750
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,620
Long time no see.

751
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,420
Come on.

752
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,940
Long time no see.

753
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,300
Ah Zhi.

754
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,500
Can you help me to get a row?

755
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,420
Long time no see.

756
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,540
Let me see you.

757
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,660
Where's your son?

758
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,860
How's your daughter-in-law?

759
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,220
Son?

760
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,420
That brat.

761
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,380
He told me

762
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,140
that life is about

763
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,820
trying hard to get a job.

764
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,300
I left him a good house.

765
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,420
He can't live here.

766
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,660
I can only rent it in Chong Xun.

767
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,460
Really?

768
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,020
Yes.

769
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,740
I happen to have a friend

770
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,540
who wants to rent a house.

771
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,100
Auntie Zheng,

772
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,820
open the price.

773
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,780
Really?

774
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,620
The price is reasonable.

775
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,820
As long as he's a good man.

776
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,100
How about you?

777
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,220
A rich man with a noble family

778
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,340
is not a bad thing.

779
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,700
That's great.

780
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,460
I don't believe it.

781
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,860
Let's talk face to face.

782
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,540
How about this?

783
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,740
I happen to have a picture.

784
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,380
Take a look.

785
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,420
Okay.

786
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,620
This one.

787
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,860
Him?

788
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,060
Him?

789
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,460
What's wrong with him?

790
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
He's too arrogant.

791
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,340
I'm going to rent it to the teacher.

792
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,900
How?

793
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,620
Let me see.

794
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,500
He's the one who rents your house.

795
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,140
Why is yours everywhere?

796
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,660
What's wrong with you?

797
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,940
Sorry.

798
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,980
It seems that

799
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,060
your tenant is also Yuan Shuai.

800
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,820
Look.

801
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,780
Why are you asking

802
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,140
when you know it?

803
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,740
You're so emotional.

804
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,220
I was just kidding.

805
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,980
Since I took his rent,

806
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,020
how could I rent it to someone else?

807
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,140
Am I right?

808
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,620
Thank you, Aunt Zhang.

809
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,580
I'm leaving.

810
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,260
Good girl.

811
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,500
Come and play.

812
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,540
Aunt Zhang.

813
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,500
See you.

814
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,380
Go wash your clothes.

815
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,100
Go wash your clothes.

816
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,740
I'm coming.

817
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,340
Don't move.

818
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,540
Good shot.

819
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,700
It's your turn.

820
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,420
It's your turn.

821
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,460
Yuan Shuai.

822
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,900
Wait for me.

823
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,020
Here.

824
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,140
Boss.

825
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,420
Did you read my message?

826
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,540
You're right.

827
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,100
It's related to Du Lei.

828
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,580
And they've called each other many times.

829
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,340
I know.

830
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,260
One more thing.

831
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,260
Mr. Luo wrote a letter to the headquarters

832
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,780
to congratulate you and Jiang Jun.

833
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,780
The company will officially announce it

834
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,020
and let Jiang Jun transfer the money in advance.

835
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,220
Are you happy?

836
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,020
Why should I be happy?

837
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,580
I think it's him.

838
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,220
Stop working.

839
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,500
I have something to announce.

840
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,180
Mr. Luo wrote a letter

841
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,500
to congratulate us.

842
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,300
Of course,

843
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,540
Mr. Yuan will make a great contribution.

844
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,860
Another colleague is doing very well.

845
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,820
Jiang Jun.

846
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,780
Congratulations.

847
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,060
You've made a great contribution.

848
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,300
The company has decided to terminate your term

849
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,580
and officially transfer the money.

850
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,820
You can continue to follow up

851
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,180
on Wan Xin's case.

852
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,380
Congratulations.

853
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,380
You're officially admitted to the M&H.

854
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,780
Thank you.

855
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,220
I'll keep working hard.

856
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,060
Congratulations.

857
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,740
You've successfully passed the first round.

858
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,620
Keep working.

859
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,940
You're working hard.

860
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,780
You can transfer the money in advance.

861
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,140
If it weren't for us,

862
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,180
you wouldn't have been able to make it.

863
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,580
Jiang Jun.

864
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,980
Congratulations.

865
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,060
As the first one

866
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,340
to transfer the money,

867
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,420
you have to treat us to a meal.

868
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,700
Tomorrow.

869
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,060
I have something to do today.

870
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,460
Tomorrow is fine.

871
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,380
I won't be polite to you anyway.

872
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,740
Thank you.

873
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,700
Go to the rooftop.

874
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,820
You still have to thank me.

875
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,020
Bring a new person.

876
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,860
You don't have to thank me.

877
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,780
Really?

878
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,940
Is there a house

879
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,700
that's free of charge?

880
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,420
Jiang Jun.

881
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,100
What are you doing?

882
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,700
Can I have a look?

883
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,540
You promised to return it to me.

884
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,900
Of course.

885
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,100
I'll give it to you when I see it.

886
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,460
Jiang Jun.

887
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,260
Do you know why the M&H is called M&H?

888
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,260
I don't know.

889
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,060
The reason why it's called M&H

890
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,300
is because in every M&H,

891
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,020
there's a spirit who can cast magic.

892
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,980
Spirit?

893
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,700
Yes.

894
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,140
Every M&H spirit

895
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,460
has lived in the M&H for hundreds of years.

896
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,900
They're all waiting for

897
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,820
the one who can cast the magic.

898
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,900
The one who can cast the magic will appear.

899
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,420
Appear?

900
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,500
Because only when the magic is casted,

901
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,100
they can come out and move.

902
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,700
Only the real owner of the magic

903
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,540
will know how to cast the magic

904
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,660
and release them.

905
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,380
Release?

906
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,820
Did you just

907
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,020
cast for a long time?

908
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,020
Did you not do it well?

909
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,380
Did you hear the sound

910
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,820
of the magic

911
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,460
when you just turned the magic?

912
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,620
I think

913
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,940
you're not the real owner of the magic.

914
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,980
Because the sound of the magic

915
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,620
is the sound of the spirit's crying.

916
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,140
Do you know that

917
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,260
if you torture the spirit too much,

918
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,140
it might be a nightmare at night?

919
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,660
What should we do?

920
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,340
I think I need to try it for you.

921
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,100
For your safety,

922
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,740
I'll take this magic back to my house tonight.

923
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,460
Tomorrow,

924
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,300
we'll find the owner of the magic together.

925
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,260
Okay?

926
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:40,980
Okay.
