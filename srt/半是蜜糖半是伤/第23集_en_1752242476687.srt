All Is Well

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,960
Episode 03

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,140
Zhang Que

23
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,780
Boss!

24
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,380
Boss!

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,860
Boss, what should I do?

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,500
Boss!

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,940
Boss, are you okay?

28
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,940
She's not here near that gate.

29
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,900
I think she's not at my workplace.

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,620
Who are you?

31
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,300
Boss, are you okay?

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,140
Brother Tao, she's not here.

33
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,020
Let's go to the hotel to pay her Charity Tax.

34
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,020
It's his duty

35
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,940
and I'll be working from home.

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,780
Okay?

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,100
Hello?

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,020
Section Chief median to Demand

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,500
Lady Yilu.

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,420
especially the stock market.

41
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,140
I'm taking Mr. Luo to Hong Kong.

42
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,860
Okay.

43
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,100
Mr. Luo.

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,220
Su Chang,

45
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,540
collect all the IPO data of Wanxin You for me.

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,140
I need to go to Hong Kong urgently.

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,820
Besides, help me and Mr. Luo's secretary

48
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,100
to confirm the flight information.

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,660
Okay, I'll do it right away.

50
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,460
Dad,

51
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
the speed is low in the airport.

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,340
You sit here.

53
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,980
You sit down.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,340
I have a business to take care of.

55
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,140
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,980
It's okay.

57
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,940
We can film.

58
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,340
You stay safe.

59
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,860
I can't bear to leave you.

60
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,940
Me, too.

61
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,020
New Year's Eve

62
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,820
Why is there so much dust lately?

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,900
What?

64
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,100
What's with the Lunar New Year cleaning?

65
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
I'll wipe it clean. I'll leave first.

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
You went to Hong Kong to chase after these few places.

67
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Zheng Qian will report you.

68
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
I'll take it on the way.

69
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Thank you.

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
You're pulling the curtains in the daytime.

71
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
Are you afraid that people won't know

72
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
that you two are secretly doing things inside?

73
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Can't you pretend that you didn't see it?

74
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
I'm just reminding you.

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,100
You have to open the curtains in the daytime.

76
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
You have to open the doors.

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
Office gossip.

78
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
It's so scary.

79
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
I'll just open it.

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Did Mr. Qiao discover anything?

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
Yes.

82
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
He knows that we're together.

83
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
I forgot to tell you.

84
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,100
I've become a fool again, right?

85
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
I was wrong.

86
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
How could you be wrong? You're always right.

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Mr. Qiao.

88
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,100
I don't know what Yuan Shuai likes about you.

89
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,100
It's better for Mr. Qiao to ask you this question.

90
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,100
You don't have to pretend in front of me.

91
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
Then, Mr. Qiao, just say it.

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,100
I found out about you and Yuan Shuai.

93
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,100
If Yuan Shuai hadn't stopped you,

94
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I would have already exposed your relationship to the company.

95
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
When?

96
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Although the company doesn't have a rule that doesn't allow office romance,

97
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
you know it very well.

98
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
If everyone knows about you two,

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,100
you'll be the one to suffer.

100
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Yes, I understand.

101
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Thank you for your reminder and tolerance.

102
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
There's something I have to tell you.

103
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,100
You can tell that I like Yuan Shuai, right?

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Yes.

105
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,100
I can't compare to you buying tickets and entering the market.

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
But things haven't come to an end.

107
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Who should not know?

108
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,100
So if you don't look after him,

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,100
or always fight over the chicken and cat things,

110
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,100
I will seize the opportunity to take him away.

111
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Okay, Mr. Qiao. I understand what you mean.

112
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,600
I...

113
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
During a 오래an term, I've played a tout how to become a boss.

114
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
True mystery.

115
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
áis

116
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
The sky is a gray light

117
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,700
When I think of you, I think about our days

118
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,140
While talking, the rain fall

119
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,280
You are my only one, my only love

120
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,040
Howight a complicated words

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Every minute, every second

122
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Baby I love you, it's true

123
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Because of you, I know

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Love is everything going for you

125
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Take good care of Wang Cai these days

126
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Wang Cai, sit down

127
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Here, take a picture for your dad

128
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
He's good and fat again

129
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Come on, let's go

130
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Hello, you have a face-saving filter in this photo

131
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
I have to watch the original film

132
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Otherwise, how would I know

133
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
whether Wang Cai is really fat or fake fat

134
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Okay, let me show you

135
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Look

136
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
You are really fat

137
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Okay, okay

138
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Let me see you

139
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Why do you want to see me

140
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Let me see

141
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
What's up, Mr. Yuan

142
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
What can I do for you

143
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I tell you

144
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Wang Cai can't be fat anymore

145
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,040
From now on, you have to take Wang Cai to exercise

146
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
and start losing weight

147
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
I'm taking him to exercise

148
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Didn't you see your daughter

149
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
can't wait to go running

150
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
I won't talk to you, bye

151
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Wait, wait

152
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
You

153
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Remember to give it to Xiao Chuan before you take a vacation

154
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Okay, I got it

155
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Why is your nose so heavy

156
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
You have a cold

157
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Yes, it's true

158
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
No one is taking care of me

159
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
I have a cold

160
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm waiting for you to take care of me

161
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
I don't know when I can come back

162
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
I'll fight for No. 31

163
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
If I can't

164
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,040
then I'll only fight for No. 1 or No. 2

165
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Okay, I got it

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Have a good rest

167
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
Remember to miss me

168
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Let's go, Wang Cai

169
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
There are a few hours until the New Year

170
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
You don't have to give us a holiday in advance

171
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
What you said

172
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
is the awareness of our investment bank

173
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Look at Mr. Yuan

174
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
He is still on a business trip in Hong Kong

175
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,040
He is really a great general of MH

176
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Jiang Jun

177
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm so sorry that I'm so rude

178
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Aren't you going home for the New Year today

179
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm not unhappy

180
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Come on, be quiet

181
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Dear colleagues

182
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Today is the last day of 2019

183
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
This year, we all work hard

184
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
and work together

185
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
I always take the credit

186
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
for the achievements of MH

187
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
At the time of this old and new

188
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I have already specially voted with Mr. Fan

189
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
to give you a holiday in advance

190
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Go home and hurry up

191
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
It's okay

192
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Hurry home

193
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
Thank you, thank you

194
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Still not going home

195
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Happy New Year

196
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Happy New Year

197
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Master

198
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Master

199
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
I'm waiting for you on Anshun Road now

200
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm wearing white clothes

201
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
and holding this black suitcase

202
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
It's so fast

203
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
A little kid in her early years

204
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
works overtime alone

205
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
I feel sorry for her

206
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Is it a holiday for her alone?

207
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
It's okay

208
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
I can't do it anymore

209
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
I don't want to hear your explanation

210
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Jingjing

211
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
You

212
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Let me explain

213
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Jingjing

214
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Mingxuan

215
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Mingxuan

216
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
What's wrong with you?

217
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Did she get hurt?

218
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Are you a doctor?

219
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Help me save her

220
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm not a doctor

221
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
I don't know how to save people

222
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Wait, I'll call you 120

223
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Help

224
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Mingxuan, are you okay?

225
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Mingxuan

226
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Someone fainted on Anshun Road

227
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
I got it

228
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
I'll be there in an hour

229
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Mingxuan

230
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I promised you I'd propose

231
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Don't shake it

232
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
You'll kill me if I don't die

233
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
What did you say just now?

234
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Then you promised me you'd propose

235
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Mingxuan

236
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
You scared me

237
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Mingxuan

238
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Don't worry

239
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,320
You scared me.

240
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,520
You scared me.

241
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,280
Xu Fei.

242
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,400
If this kind of thing

243
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,560
happens to you,

244
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,520
what should you do?

245
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,640
Do you have to wait until

246
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,120
there is no chance

247
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
before you regret

248
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
that you didn't confess earlier?

249
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,680
I want to...

250
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
I'll wait for you.

251
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
The new year is coming.

252
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,680
The wheels of time

253
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,520
leave a deep mark.

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,840
But with the warm sunshine in winter,

255
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
the new year is coming.

256
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,360
Congratulations on the new year.

257
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Today, the Internet...

258
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,600
Hello.

259
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,120
Hello.

260
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
I'm Cao Heng.

261
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,880
Aren't you looking for me?

262
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I'm in Suzhou today.

263
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,200
Come on.

264
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,200
Okay.

265
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,320
I'll be there soon.

266
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,120
Let me do it.

267
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,840
Thank you.

268
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
I'll pass by.

270
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,880
Thank you.

271
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,520
Hello.

272
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,920
Hello.

273
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,400
Here is the tea bag.

274
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,840
Here is the tea bag.

275
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,400
My swimming suit and sunglasses.

276
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,840
They have my work.

277
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,360
You can have what do you want.

278
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,080
All right.

279
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,040
This policy is just for you.

280
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Didn't the case

281
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,600
disappear without leaving in the first place?

282
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,320
Seriously?

283
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,320
I'll change your seat.

284
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,600
You're not kidding, are you?

285
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
No.

286
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
You're a good man.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,440
It's all because of someone else.

288
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,920
Thank you.

289
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,760
Hey.

290
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,040
Why are you back?

291
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,960
Xiaochun.

292
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
I...

293
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,040
I...

294
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
The matchmaking system in the western world

295
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,880
is fine.

296
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,040
What about the matchmakers?

297
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,120
It's simple.

298
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,000
One percent means

299
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,440
they're impossible

300
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,000
because they're not suitable.

301
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,160
I...

302
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,240
I...

303
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,040
I almost missed the time.

304
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,680
I couldn't get back

305
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,520
before I got there.

306
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,240
I'll remind you to put on a mask.

307
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,720
I'll come back to accompany you.

308
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,880
Have you eaten?

309
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,120
I ordered a lot of things.

310
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
You must like them.

311
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,720
Let's eat together.

312
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,600
Why did you order the food I like?

313
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,080
I can't digest vegetables.

314
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,600
Cut.

315
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,320
It's not bad.

316
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,160
You can keep it later.

317
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,320
I...

318
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,240
Don't know.

319
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,320
You said

320
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
I must have a sense of ceremony in life,

321
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,120
so I wanted

322
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
to eat something

323
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,800
that has sense of ceremony.

324
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,080
Anyway,

325
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,340
are you willing to live

326
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
in the seat of your brother?

327
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,980
That's a good answer.

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,120
It's just such a small matter.

329
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,620
Well, your sister

330
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,980
looks even younger than before.

331
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,400
Go on.

332
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,020
What do you want to talk to me about?

333
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,680
Tang Tang asked me to come and see

334
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,140
what happened back then.

335
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,980
Don't you want to tell anyone?

336
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,400
Just about that?

337
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm not saying he doesn't trust me.

338
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
You don't know.

339
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
Recently, someone is investigating this matter.

340
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,680
So, he wants me to come and see it personally.

341
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,880
Ask him if there are any traces of the case

342
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,680
that were left from the past.

343
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Did he clean it up?

344
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
Let me tell you.

345
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,480
I deleted the chat records in front of him.

346
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
What else does he want me to do?

347
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,280
What did he want me to do?

348
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,080
Oh, it's just some chat records.

349
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Don't you know?

350
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
I know.

351
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
You deleted it in front of him.

352
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,480
But...

353
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
It wasn't Lin that asked you to come, right?

354
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Tell me.

355
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
What do you want from me?

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,680
You don't need to lie to me anymore.

357
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,680
I know what you want to say.

358
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,680
There are no chat records.

359
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
I'm warning you.

360
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,280
Don't come to me again.

361
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
I don't know anything.

362
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,680
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm sorry.

371
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm sorry.

373
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm sorry.

377
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
You're here.

378
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,680
Come here.

379
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,080
Poor thing.

380
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Teacher Du, it's a puppy.

381
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Hm.

382
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,840
Jiang Ou.

383
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,040
Is it a bus?

384
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,960
No?

385
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,680
This bus is one of the first petrol stations in Chengdu,

386
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,080
you can go to the overloaded part of the city we just arrived at.

387
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,560
How many years has this been here?

388
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,840
and wish you a happy new year.

389
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,240
This flight

390
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
is specially prepared for you.

391
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,040
Thank you.

392
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,680
Happy new year.

393
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,640
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,320
Why are you here?

395
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,760
I miss you.

396
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,760
Four, three, two, one.

397
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,560
Happy new year.

398
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,840
Happy new year.

399
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,880
Come on.

400
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,000
Come on.

401
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,360
You're my miracle.

402
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,360
I want you to be with me.

403
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Untie the knot.

404
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Heal my wound.

405
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,760
You're my miracle.

406
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,960
You're my miss everything.

407
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,160
My promise.

408
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,360
Wait for a moment to say good-bye.

409
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Wait for a moment to say good-bye.

410
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Oh miracle.

411
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,560
You are my love.

412
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Happy new year.

413
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,560
I can be miracle.

414
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,560
I want you to be with me.

415
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Untie the knot.

416
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Heal my wound.

417
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,560
You're my miracle.

418
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,560
You're my miss everything.

419
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
My promise.

420
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Wait for a moment to say good-bye.

421
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Happy new year.

422
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Wait for a moment to say good-bye.

423
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Happy new year.

424
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Let's make a wish together.

425
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Make a wish?

426
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I heard that the wishes made in the new year will be fulfilled.

427
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Okay.

428
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,560
I hope the western world can be the most popular app.

429
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,560
I hope he can know that I like him.

430
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Xiao Zhan.

431
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Since the first time I saw you,

432
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,560
I like you very much.

433
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
I...

434
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
I...

435
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Although I know

436
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,560
I may not be your 100% girl,

437
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
I still love you.

438
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I...

439
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
I may not be your 100% girl,

440
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I may just be one percent.

441
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
But I'm willing to change for you,

442
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
to work hard,

443
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,560
to work hard to be your 100% perfect girl.

444
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Xiao Zhan.

445
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
I like you.

446
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,560
But why do you like me?

447
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
I...

448
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Why can't I like you?

449
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
You just said it yourself.

450
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,560
We are one percent match.

451
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
One percent is impossible.

452
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Then you don't try.

453
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
How do you know?

454
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Look at me.

455
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Look at me carefully.

456
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Is there any possibility?

457
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Even if it's 0.1,

458
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
I don't want to have regrets.

459
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I...

460
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,560
I really don't know.

461
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
I...

462
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Hello?

463
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Hello, I'm Cao Hang.

464
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Didn't you say stop contacting me?

465
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Didn't you say stop contacting me?

466
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
I ask you,

467
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
did you ask your brother to come to me?

468
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
I asked you,

469
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
did you ask your brother to come to me?

470
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
No.

471
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
I didn't ask him to contact you.

472
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
You are right.

473
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Your brother came to me in your name.

474
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
He wanted to get my painting.

475
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
I see.

476
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
I'll deal with the rest.

477
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Let's do this first.

478
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Okay.

479
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Hello, this is me.

480
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Hello, this is me.

481
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Jiang Yaoming's daughter

482
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
is in MH now.

483
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
No.

484
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Master, we made an appointment.

485
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
The plane is only 20 minutes late.

486
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
You can't be so happy.

487
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
I have no choice.

488
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
My wife asked me to go home immediately.

489
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Come.

490
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
I'll go with you.

491
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
I'll go with you.

492
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
I'll go with you.

493
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
I'll go with you.

494
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
I'll go with you.

495
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
I'll go with you.

496
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
I'll go with you.

497
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
I'll go with you.

498
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
I'll go with you.

499
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
I'll go with you.

500
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
I'll go with you.

501
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I'll go with you.

502
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
I'll go with you.

503
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
I'll go with you.

504
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
I'll go with you.

505
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
I'll go with you.

506
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I'll go with you.

507
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Lift her up.

508
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Lift her up.

509
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
Lift her up.

510
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Lift her up.

511
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Lift her up.

512
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
Lift her up.

513
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Lift her.

514
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Lift her.

515
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Lift her.

516
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Hurry up!

517
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Lift her up.

518
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,960
Are you watching the news?

519
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,120
Why are you talking about me?

520
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
I'm worried about you.

521
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,800
I was waiting for you to come back.

522
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,560
I bought the most expensive plane

523
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
before I could wait for you.

524
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,440
Okay, I'll figure it out.

525
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,960
Mom,

526
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,240
the plane is late.

527
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,560
We may not be able to come back tonight.

528
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,080
Don't wait for me to sleep.

529
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,560
I'll go back as soon as possible.

530
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,400
Uncle,

531
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm in Jiangsu now.

532
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,080
Can you send a car to pick me up?

533
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,680
Don't worry.

534
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,720
I'm with my colleague.

535
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,480
I won't go back.

536
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,280
Okay, thank you.

537
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,200
Bye.

538
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,720
Light Blue

539
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,600
You can't move.

540
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,440
Stop moving.

541
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,120
You're mad at you.

542
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,720
It will be only a tool for you to worry me.

543
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,320
I won't hurt anyone.

544
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
I'm sorry.

545
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I'm sorry.

546
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
I'm sorry.

547
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
I'm sorry.

550
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm sorry.

551
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm sorry.

552
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm sorry.

553
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I'm sorry.

554
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
I'm sorry.

557
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
I'm sorry.

558
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm sorry.

561
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
I'm sorry.

562
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
I'm sorry.

563
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm sorry.

564
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm sorry.

566
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
I'm sorry.

567
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
I'm sorry.

568
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
I'm sorry.

573
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
The way to you

574
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Across the ocean

575
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
You'll be waiting

576
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
A lighthouse

577
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Hello, welcome.

578
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Shining down forever

579
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Watch me fly so high

580
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
See how my colors

581
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
bright as sky

582
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Hello, what are you looking at?

583
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Let me see.

584
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,180
Just listen to me

585
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,960
How I live with

586
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,880
You

587
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,920
Sometimes I ask myself

588
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,700
I lost the way

589
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,860
of my life

590
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,080
Tell me

591
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,560
How I live without you

592
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,960
Wang Cai

593
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,320
Do you know I'm poor?

594
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,680
Thank you

595
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm sorry

596
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,640
Actually, I have thought of the worst result on my way back.

597
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,320
But I didn't expect that he would be scared away by me.

598
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm only one percent of him.

599
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
He may not like me.

600
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Li Yaochan

601
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,440
I'm leaving

602
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,440
I won't bother you again.

603
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,480
By the way, I'll give you the shares.

604
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,200
Keep the girl you deserve.

605
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,760
Bye

606
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,680
Don't say that.

607
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,800
It's been so many years.

608
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,480
It's really the same.

609
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,440
I'm telling you.

610
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,800
You should behave yourself when you meet my mom.

611
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,360
Don't worry about it.

612
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,600
I've been a good father since I was a kid.

613
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,400
I'm telling you.

614
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm handsome and have a good temper.

615
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,560
If my mom sees me, she will love me so much.

616
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,400
Shut up.

617
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,720
Mom, happy new year.

618
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,640
Happy new year.

619
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,080
Xinxin, why are you back?

620
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,640
Let me see if you've lost weight.

621
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,600
No.

622
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,800
Come on, let's go in.

623
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,520
Mom

624
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,760
I have another one.

625
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,160
Hello, aunt.

626
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,360
You are...

627
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,160
Mom, he is Yuan Shuai.

628
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,480
You don't recognize him?

629
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,400
Put him down.

630
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
We'll stay here for a few days.

631
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Aunt, I'm Yuan Shuai.

632
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,760
Is he the Yuan in the Yuan family?

633
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Oh my god.

634
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,760
It's been so many years.

635
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,000
He's grown up.

636
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,200
Let's go to his room.

637
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,960
Come on.

638
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:21,440
Okay.

639
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,240
Come on.

640
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,360
Who said he would be loved

641
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,320
after meeting me?

642
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,240
Does it hurt?

643
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,360
That means you are not

644
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,320
a superficial person.

645
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,240
I've told you everything.

646
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
You are wrong.

647
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,200
Aunt, look.

648
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,520
I prepared these for you.

649
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,480
Please accept them.

650
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,520
I hope you like them.

651
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,560
You are so kind.

652
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,960
You are happy

653
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,200
to see me.

654
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,600
Look at the gift you brought.

655
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,640
It's so expensive.

656
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,720
It's my duty.

657
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,080
Thank you, Yanyan.

658
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,040
You are welcome.

659
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,640
It's been so many years

660
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,280
since you moved out.

661
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,880
I've never seen you before.

662
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,560
You have become

663
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,720
a handsome man.

664
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,840
Aunt,

665
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,240
you haven't changed at all.

666
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,520
It's been so many years.

667
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,200
You are still so beautiful.

668
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,520
You are so elegant.

669
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,480
You are like

670
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,560
General's sister.

671
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,680
Yanyan is so good at talking.

672
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,880
You are old.

673
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,080
No.

674
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,040
Junjun,

675
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,920
how did you contact

676
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,240
your colleagues in Shanghai?

677
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
You said you would

678
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,080
come back with your colleagues.

679
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,400
Colleagues?

680
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,160
Aunt,

681
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,840
I am that colleague.

682
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,080
Here's the thing.

683
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,480
One day,

684
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,040
General came to my company for an interview.

685
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,160
Then we

686
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,680
worked together.

687
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,400
Yes.

688
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,360
He is my superior now.

689
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
You know that?

690
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,600
Really?

691
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,680
Yuanyuan,

692
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,800
you are a senior now?

693
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,840
You are so good.

694
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
You are so young.

695
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,240
Listen,

696
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,640
when you were young,

697
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
Junjun's father and I often said

698
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,160
that you would be successful

699
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,600
when you grow up.

700
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,400
See?

701
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,720
It's true.

702
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,920
Yuanyuan,

703
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
thank you.

704
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,000
With you taking care of Junjun in Shanghai,

705
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,840
I feel more at ease.

706
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,800
But Junjun's father...

707
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,720
Mom, mom.

708
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,920
Make some food.

709
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,880
We haven't eaten

710
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,600
since last night.

711
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,320
We are starving.

712
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,000
Okay.

713
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,960
Okay.

714
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,400
It's the New Year.

715
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,320
I will add two more dishes

716
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
when Yuanyuan comes.

717
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,400
You should have a rest.

718
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,320
I will go to buy them now.

719
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
I will be back soon.

720
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,520
Aunt,

721
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,280
let me go with you.

722
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,640
No need.

723
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,000
You can have a rest at home.

724
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,880
I will be back soon.

725
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,080
It's okay. Let's go.

726
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,160
Let's go.

727
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,640
Let's go.

728
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,360
Hurry.

729
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,080
You two,

730
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,760
be careful.

731
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,320
The corner of my heart

732
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,920
is a black humor.

733
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,440
Why do I still love you?

734
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,000
The happy and sad

735
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,400
are not the main characters.

736
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,360
I am doubtful and brave.

737
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,880
But I am still pulling.

738
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:09,880
How many passers-by in this world

739
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,200
prove your uniqueness?

740
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,520
Love can be miracle.

741
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,680
I want you to be with me.

742
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,720
Unlock the silence.

743
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,720
Heal my wound.

744
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,200
You're my miracle.

745
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,400
You're my means everything.

746
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,440
My promise

747
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,120
is waiting for you.

748
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,120
Aunt,

749
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,080
I bought so many dishes today.

750
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,160
I will cook for you tonight.

751
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,040
I will show you.

752
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,040
No, you're a guest.

753
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,680
Wanqing, happy new year.

754
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,760
Happy new year.

755
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,040
Who is this young man?

756
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,720
He looks handsome.

757
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,000
Yes.

758
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,240
He looks like a star.

759
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,680
Is he Junjun's boyfriend?

760
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,240
No.

761
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,320
That's good.

762
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
That's good.

763
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Cui Ping, Shu Jun.

764
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,760
Let me introduce.

765
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,400
This is my neighbor's son,

766
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,200
Yuan Yuan.

767
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
Yuan Yuan?

768
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,240
This is my friend,

769
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,760
Cui Ping and Shu Jun.

770
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,640
Hello, aunties.

771
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,120
Hello.

772
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,760
Happy new year.

773
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,000
Hello.

774
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,520
Aunt Shu Jun,

775
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,360
your coat is very beautiful.

776
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,040
It looks very elegant.

777
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,840
And it makes your skin white.

778
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,040
Cui Ping,

779
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,600
your hairstyle is the most popular this year, right?

780
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,840
With your light makeup,

781
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,400
it looks so beautiful.

782
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,960
And you look young.

783
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,640
Happy new year, auntie.

784
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,120
New year, new aura.

785
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,600
He's so good at talking.

786
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,320
Yes.

787
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,280
Yuan Yuan, right?

788
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,400
If you're free,

789
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,600
go to auntie's house.

790
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,280
Okay.

791
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,480
Aunt's daughter.

792
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,440
I have a daughter like this.

793
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,360
Junjun, Cui Ping.

794
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,120
We're in a hurry to cook.

795
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,000
Let's talk another day.

796
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
Let's play cards together.

797
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,640
Okay.

798
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,240
Okay.

799
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,920
Play cards.

800
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,320
We'll play cards.

801
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,000
Sit down.

802
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,080
Bye, auntie.

803
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:17,840
Bye.

804
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,680
Bye.

805
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,480
Yuan Yuan,

806
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,480
you and Junjun are really...

807
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,320
What's wrong, auntie?

808
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,440
It's okay.

809
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,680
Let's go.

810
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,680
Okay.

811
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
I'm going to be someone

812
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
who only wants to know

813
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,400
Then you'll be staying

814
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,400
every day of my life

815
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,400
I'm going to be someone

816
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,200
who only wants to know

817
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,040
Then you'll be staying

818
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,200
every day of my life

819
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,560
Try to understand

820
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,160
Try to say goodbye a thousand times

821
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,240
You can tell me lies

822
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,240
I've been so brave

823
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,560
I will run away

824
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,680
If it's what you want

825
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,920
What you like

826
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,400
I don't mind

827
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,080
I can close my eyes

828
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,440
I can stay behind

829
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,640
Waste my time

830
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,600
Walk into your plan

831
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,040
Like I never knew

832
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,880
You were not mine

833
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,520
Make you satisfied

834
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,200
Wear another mask

835
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,200
You never realize

836
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,680
Things I do for love

837
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,760
I think I'm tired

838
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,120
I think I'm blind

839
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,960
Don't know how to feel

840
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,120
Don't know how to heal

841
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,880
You walk so fast

842
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,240
Can't catch your light

843
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,040
You fly so high

844
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,360
Leave all the things behind

845
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,280
And our story

846
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,000
Leave all love nowhere to find

847
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,720
I think I'm tired

848
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,120
I think I'm blind

849
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,920
Don't know how to feel

850
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,160
Don't know how to heal

851
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,960
You walk so fast

852
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,360
Can't catch your light

853
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,120
You fly so high

854
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,360
Leave all the things behind

855
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,320
And our story

856
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:05,160
Leave all love nowhere to find
