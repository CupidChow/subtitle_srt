1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,860
Have you ever taken the car?

2
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,840
Are you not going anywhere?

3
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,600
So what?

4
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,600
The King's Avatar

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Episode 16

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
What is it that you can't talk about on the phone?

7
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Du Lei came to see me.

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
He came to see you?

9
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,400
What is it?

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,000
It seems like you really don't know.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Recently, I've been too busy.

12
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
And I haven't contacted Du Lei for a while.

13
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
He came to talk about a deal with me.

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,000
He wanted to deal with Yuan Shuai together.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,600
But I always feel that

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
he's too stubborn.

17
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,520
He has a problem.

18
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,520
What problem can he have?

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,080
He has always been the enemy of Marshal.

20
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,640
In order to defeat Marshal,

21
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,640
it's normal for him to do anything.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
What were you surprised about just now?

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,440
I was just surprised.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,600
I didn't expect him to cooperate with you.

25
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,000
Who told him about the matter of C Group?

26
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,640
I didn't expect that.

27
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,880
It's my fault.

28
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,880
When I jumped from Mh to G Group,

29
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,320
in order to avoid Jiang's suspicion,

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,320
I handed Jiang Nanfeng's case to Du Lei.

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
I just didn't expect him to think I used him.

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
So I had to tell him about something.

33
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,680
But don't worry.

34
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,040
I didn't say a word that I shouldn't have.

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
That's good.

36
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,880
Linda, you have to understand.

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,840
Jiang Yaoming's death

38
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,200
is different from other things.

39
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,640
If you don't stand firmly,

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,560
we'll be in trouble.

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,880
What do you want?

42
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,680
Two.

43
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,000
One.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,680
Two.

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,360
Three.

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,040
Four.

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,920
Five.

48
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,400
Six.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,880
Seven.

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,600
Eight.

51
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,280
Nine.

52
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,640
Ten.

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,360
Ten.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Contact Jiang Kuji.

55
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,000
And also...

56
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,560
....try to replace me.

57
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,080
Clear.

58
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,480
smoke

59
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,720
You are entering the chat room after bothering.

60
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm not sure.

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
And,

62
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,760
if you don't like your brother,

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,520
I'll take care of him.

64
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
He's smart.

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
I can't trust him.

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Let's drink.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,960
OK.

68
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Find it.

69
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,120
Du Lei.

70
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,520
What the heck do you want?

71
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
and betrayed my parents.

72
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,680
Why are you so serious?

73
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,000
Isn't this to make your show

74
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
look more realistic?

75
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,080
What's the situation?

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,680
Jiang Jun was locked in the elevator.

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,560
Fortunately, I went there in time.

78
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,200
There was no big problem.

79
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,520
Who watched it?

80
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,000
I watched the surveillance footage.

81
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Shen Wei Mei went to another small analyst.

82
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
But I think this person

83
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
has no reason

84
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,880
to do this to Jiang Jun.

85
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
It's Lin Tai Mo.

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,080
He must think

87
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,200
Jiang Jun was trying to get into the MH

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,880
to investigate his father.

89
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
That's why he did it.

90
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,200
It seems that

91
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,560
Uncle Jiang's death

92
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,320
was not an accident.

93
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,320
What do you think?

94
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,320
I've been investigating Lin Tai Mo for years.

95
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,680
But this person is too cunning.

96
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,920
There's not much we can find.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,360
I wanted to get his ID card

98
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
and expose all his crimes.

99
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,960
But I'm afraid he's doing it to Jiang Jun.

100
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,160
So I have to fight him right now.

101
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,280
Lin Tai Mo is a very skilled person.

102
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,480
So he must have hidden his own person

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,000
in the MH and Chen Qian Hui.

104
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
The information you gave

105
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
may have been published online

106
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,320
before your board

107
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,360
was pressed.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,320
I know that.

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,320
That's why I didn't do anything rash.

110
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,680
But

111
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,360
to get the death certificate,

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,960
I have to do it again.

113
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,520
He trusts Linda so much.

114
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,200
Can he

115
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
start from her?

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,680
I've already talked to her.

117
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,320
She won't help me for now.

118
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,120
I'll talk to her first.

119
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
How about

120
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,720
We've been in this field

121
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,680
for so many years.

122
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,920
We all know it.

123
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,160
How about I surrender?

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
The enemy's enemy is a friend.

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Everyone knows

126
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,680
I couldn't be friends with Lin Tai Mo.

127
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,200
You...

128
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
You underestimated Lin Tai Mo.

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
to cooperate with us.

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
New technology, Dr. Zhu.

131
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,800
Isn't he Yuan Shuai's client?

132
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,800
How do you know

133
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,560
they have full-time teachers?

134
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I've been with Yuan Shuai for too many years.

135
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
I can say that

136
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,120
no one knows him better than me

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
except for himself.

138
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,720
As for Dr. Zhu,

139
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,680
as long as we can give him

140
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,960
and Yuan Shuai can't,

141
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
he will definitely do everything for us.

142
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,480
Are you sure?

143
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Of course.

144
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Let him in.

145
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,640
Dr. Zhu, you must have known

146
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
why Du Lei invited you

147
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,560
to his visit.

148
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,280
I know.

149
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm going to destroy Yuan Shuai.

150
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,520
You said you were going to

151
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,880
destroy Yuan Shuai.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,800
Where's the evidence?

153
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,520
I have evidence.

154
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,240
I borrowed some money from him.

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,560
It was quite a large sum.

156
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,280
When I paid the money,

157
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
I went to a private house.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,360
There was no ticket.

159
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,520
That's interesting.

160
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,520
Lin Tan Mo may not fully trust me,

161
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
so he let me enter the MH.

162
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,880
I guess he wants to keep an eye on me.

163
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,640
Although Mr. Bai

164
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,160
is watching my flight,

165
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,520
in order to avoid long-term troubles,

166
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
we should start our plan as soon as possible.

167
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Information from the press.

168
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Jia Yuanji,

169
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,800
the only son of Chairman Ji,

170
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,840
is the only son of Chairman Ji.

171
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,840
He's the only son of Chairman Ji.

172
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,640
He's the only son of Chairman Ji.

173
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,840
He's the only son of Chairman Ji.

174
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,200
He's been studying abroad

175
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
and returning to China recently.

176
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
He likes to listen to music.

177
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,400
I heard he's been

178
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,640
on the bar street recently.

179
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,360
And he's not

180
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,520
a very good person.

181
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,760
In this world,

182
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,120
I can't get a man

183
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,560
who hasn't been born yet.

184
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,200
Yuan Shuai, Yuan Shuai.

185
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm sure I'll never be able

186
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
to see your

187
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,040
self-confident face again.

188
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,800
Liu Yaning, let me warn you.

189
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,360
During this period,

190
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
you can't let General

191
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,840
get into a little bit of danger.

192
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,800
And,

193
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,960
don't do anything

194
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
that's too much for him.

195
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,080
Otherwise,

196
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,960
I won't let you off.

197
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,520
Don't worry.

198
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm not

199
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,280
a person who's just a member of the committee.

200
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,160
Besides,

201
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,280
I'm still confident

202
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
in General's business.

203
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,560
But,

204
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,960
he's already suspicious of me.

205
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,960
Because he doesn't believe

206
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm a spy.

207
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,120
So, I have to be careful.

208
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,640
It seems that our little Mian Yang

209
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,840
has become smarter.

210
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,040
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

211
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
What's up, Yuan Shuai?

212
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,280
Just tell me.

213
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,160
It's simple.

214
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,160
You just need to

215
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
deal with one person.

216
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
He should be looking for you.

217
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,280
Don't worry.

218
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,720
Since the last time,

219
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,360
I've been so good at acting

220
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,160
that I've been so lucky.

221
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,240
You don't have to act this time.

222
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,320
You just need to do one thing.

223
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,200
Ask him and he won't know.

224
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Okay, okay, okay. I got it.

225
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,760
I won't say anything.

226
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,400
I hope that Dr. Zhu

227
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,320
can resist the pressure of General.

228
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Dr. Zhu,

229
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,760
MSH's staff came to say

230
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,560
they want to show you

231
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,080
the follow-up information of the Dong Si project.

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,360
Just say I'm not here.

233
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,000
Just give the information to the financial office.

234
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,160
Dr. Zhu, are you going to act

235
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,080
as a big change person

236
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,320
or disappear in a moment?

237
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,960
Miss Jiang.

238
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,880
Why are you here?

239
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,080
Dr. Zhu is in a good mood.

240
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,960
He's playing games.

241
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,760
I know why you're here.

242
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,120
But I'm afraid that I can't

243
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,800
answer any of your questions.

244
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,040
You misunderstood.

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm here to send you

246
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,240
the new-customized

247
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,880
Chen Xinrong's

248
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,240
after-sales monitoring plan.

249
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,240
I see.

250
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,240
Okay, okay, okay.

251
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,320
Thank you.

252
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,080
Dr. Zhu, what game are you playing?

253
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,040
I just developed a physical sensation game

254
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,120
to develop for the next step of the Internet.

255
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm testing the sensitivity.

256
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,360
It looks interesting.

257
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm honored to play it.

258
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,240
Really?

259
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,280
You want to play?

260
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,480
Okay, okay, okay.

261
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,520
You can help me.

262
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Let's test it.

263
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
You're good, Dr. Zhu.

264
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,400
You're good at playing games.

265
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
Not bad.

266
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Chen Xin has been

267
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,040
winning the game recently.

268
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
I heard that she won the prize two days ago.

269
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,440
Congratulations.

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,760
Thank you.

271
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,840
You're welcome.

272
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,840
Thanks.

273
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,240
Great.

274
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,440
There are some members

275
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,040
who they are playing with.

276
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,960
You can try them.

277
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,680
Okay.

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,400
So,

279
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
what do you want to secure?

280
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,520
Brother,

281
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
I want to have

282
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,080
a toxic power

283
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,840
on those two bottles.

284
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,440
Space is still more important

285
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,600
as long as one's intuition works.

286
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,800
Okay.

287
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,080
These two bottles

288
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,920
may be used

289
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,640
in theders relationship.

290
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,760
What does it mean?

291
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,480
In this case,

292
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,840
No, no, no. I...

293
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,720
I don't know anything.

294
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,880
Miss Jiang, don't ask.

295
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,640
They won't let me say anything.

296
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
They? Who?

297
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,560
I have something to do.

298
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,960
I'll leave now.

299
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,960
Who is that?

300
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,800
Give me the information.

301
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Except this design.

302
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,480
No, no, no.

303
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,120
Since you won't say anything,

304
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,080
I won't ask.

305
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,040
I'll leave now.

306
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,280
But I still have to thank you.

307
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,880
What did you say?

308
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,720
What?

309
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,600
I didn't say anything.

310
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
I asked two questions.

311
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
You didn't answer any of them.

312
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
Lily, are you in the West Room?

313
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,440
I'll go find you.

314
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,600
No, I'm not there. What's wrong?

315
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,200
I have something urgent to talk to Xiaochun.

316
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,760
It's okay. I'll go find him myself.

317
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,240
No, no, no.

318
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
Yao Chuan is an ordinary person.

319
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,880
It's hard to communicate with him.

320
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,080
You know that.

321
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,720
How about this? I'll go with you.

322
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,480
Okay.

323
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,360
I have something important to do.

324
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,960
I'll go with him.

325
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
But I don't want to see him at all.

326
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
Not at all.

327
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,960
That's it.

328
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,120
Xiaochun,

329
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,240
don't worry.

330
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
Xu Li is in the East Room.

331
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,960
What's going on with him?

332
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:27,760
Want to

333
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,480
report it?

334
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,280
Yes.

335
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,080
Help me check

336
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
where your brother is now.

337
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,800
Okay.

338
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,040
Xiaochun,

339
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,000
tomorrow afternoon,

340
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,640
Beijing time is four o'clock.

341
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,880
Help me

342
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,480
locate my phone

343
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,680
and computer IP

344
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,640
to Tanzania.

345
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,080
Okay.

346
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,080
If Jiang Zheng is looking for you,

347
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,320
just tell him

348
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
you don't know where I am.

349
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,600
If you have your virtual IP,

350
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,160
you can send it to him.

351
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
But why?

352
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,440
You were lying to him.

353
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,600
I can't tell you now.

354
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,880
I'll explain to you

355
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,800
when the time is right.

356
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,600
Yuan Le,

357
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,880
I got it.

358
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,640
اح he's going to Africa.

359
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,160
You knew that?

360
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,560
He said that

361
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,520
he was going abroad,

362
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,760
but he didn't tell me

363
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,560
where to go.

364
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,560
So I thought

365
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,480
it is to Africa.

366
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,080
When you asked, he didn't contact me.

367
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,080
It was after you asked, he contacted me.

368
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,080
You didn't even say a word.

369
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
You really have a problem.

370
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Do you want to say it or not?

371
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Africa.

372
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
You don't want to say it, right?

373
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Lily, let's go.

374
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Wait.

375
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Xu Li, I have something to tell you.

376
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
But I have nothing to say to you.

377
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Xu Li.

378
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Lily.

379
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Well, before you ask me,

380
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
I want to ask you a question.

381
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Where is Yuan Shuai now?

382
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
If you don't say, I'll go.

383
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Go away.

384
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
But...

385
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Yuan Shuai is in Shanghai now.

386
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
You sold your brother like this?

387
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,080
He just said he didn't want to tell you and others.

388
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Xu Li is not another person.

389
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Where is Yuan Shuai now?

390
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Lily, he won't tell me.

391
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
There must be a reason for him.

392
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
I'll go first.

393
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
I think Xiaochuan has something to tell you alone.

394
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Hurry.

395
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
What do you want to say?

396
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,080
I want to apologize to you for the last time you confessed.

397
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
I...

398
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
You don't have to apologize.

399
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,080
It's not your fault that you don't like me.

400
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
It's not your fault.

401
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
No.

402
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Then do you like me?

403
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I thought about it for a long time.

404
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,080
You are not intelligent.

405
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
You have a different education.

406
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Our environment and background.

407
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Our personal hobbies are different.

408
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
To be honest,

409
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
sometimes I really don't know what you're thinking.

410
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,080
This may be the reason why we are only one percent of the same.

411
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
But I want to...

412
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Is this what you want to say?

413
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,080
One percent.

414
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,080
One percent.

415
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
I know.

416
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
I...

417
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Maybe...

418
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
I'm not perfect.

419
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
I don't deserve you.

420
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
But...

421
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Can you not...

422
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Don't force me again and again?

423
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
I...

424
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
But...

425
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
No buts.

426
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
Mr. Yi, I'm sorry to bother you.

427
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
I won't come again. Bye.

428
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
But...

429
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,080
I can't control my love for you.

430
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
Can you wait for me?

431
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,080
I want us to be one hundred percent.

432
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Hello, everyone.

433
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,080
I'm the lead singer and lead guitarist, Xia Yuanqi.

434
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,080
We are the best music band.

435
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Today, we are going to sing our new song,

436
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Blue Horse.

437
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Under the sea spring,

438
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Blue Horse.

439
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm not afraid of the fire.

440
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,080
Blue Horse.

441
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Stop singing.

442
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
What are you doing?

443
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm in a hurry.

444
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Please, Mr. Cheng.

445
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
Stop singing.

446
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Look, I have no guests.

447
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
How can you do that?

448
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
We are the band's tour guide.

449
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Yes.

450
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
You...

451
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
There is another person.

452
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
How can I do business alone?

453
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I think his music is good.

454
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
You like it?

455
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Yes.

456
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Good luck to the music band.

457
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
I think your music is very soulful.

458
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,080
It's full of the shout of the world.

459
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Especially, it's a condemnation and condemnation

460
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
to the owner of that blue horse.

461
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
It's very arrogant and very stupid.

462
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Very real.

463
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
You know me, brother.

464
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Wait a minute.

465
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Brother, you know music.

466
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
I've been driving a bar for so many years.

467
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,080
I've never heard such a fast-paced music.

468
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
And what? Soulful.

469
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Right.

470
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I think you don't need any more training.

471
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Brother, so good.

472
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
Brother,

473
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,920
although I don't know much about music,

474
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,520
I think music is an art tool

475
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
to express my feelings

476
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,120
and my views on the world.

477
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,400
A young, energetic and energetic

478
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,920
youth band like the Jixiang Ruyi Orchestra

479
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,600
should be faced with encouragement,

480
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,440
right?

481
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,080
Well said, brother.

482
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,720
You are my soul mate.

483
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,600
I finally found you.

484
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,520
Brother,

485
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,040
if you need anything in the future,

486
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,240
just tell me.

487
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm here for you.

488
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,720
You're here for me?

489
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,280
Yes.

490
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,520
I like you.

491
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,200
Okay.

492
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,120
How about this?

493
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,920
You go home with me tonight.

494
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
We need to discuss it.

495
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,920
Okay.

496
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,360
Mom,

497
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,320
do you have food?

498
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,040
I'm hungry.

499
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,160
It's a meeting at the same time.

500
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,640
Brother,

501
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,560
what do you want to eat?

502
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,200
I don't know.

503
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,160
Just tell Mom Wang.

504
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,440
Her cooking is very good.

505
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,520
I'm at your service.

506
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,320
Thank you, Mom Wang.

507
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,640
Let's go.

508
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,520
Why are you going in now?

509
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,360
Go to my room and listen to my song.

510
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,200
Mom Wang,

511
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,720
don't add chili in my food.

512
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,960
Don't add...

513
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,200
Keep your voice down.

514
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,760
I'm eating.

515
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,400
I'm eating.

516
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,520
Don't listen to him.

517
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,200
You know to come back?

518
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,720
Dad,

519
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,240
you're deaf.

520
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,360
How can you hear that?

521
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,280
I'm sorry.

522
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,560
By the way,

523
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,600
this is my friend.

524
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,400
His name is...

525
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,400
Yuan Shuai.

526
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,440
He's the senior executive of the competition company.

527
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,720
Why are you

528
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
here at my house at this time?

529
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,680
President Jia,

530
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,120
because of some

531
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,480
things related to the future and reputation of memory,

532
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,720
I want to tell you.

533
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,520
So I'm sorry to bother you.

534
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,920
Go back to sleep.

535
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,120
Dad,

536
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,880
how can you...

537
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,400
If you don't go,

538
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,960
I'll stop that credit card.

539
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,640
Go to my room and sleep.

540
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,400
Sit.

541
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,600
I understand what you said.

542
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,040
If

543
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,160
you really are suspected of internal transactions

544
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,560
and corruption,

545
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,480
then

546
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,280
clearing the door

547
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,400
and maintaining the reputation of memory

548
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,320
are what I should do.

549
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,400
But you asked me to check Lin Taimo.

550
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,400
What's the benefit of memory?

551
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,400
President Jia,

552
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,280
I understand what you mean.

553
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,160
But now,

554
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,840
MH and Memory are two major executives

555
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
who are both guilty of abusing violence.

556
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,880
Once they are found out in the future,

557
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,360
it will be easy to tolerate

558
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,720
and easy to damage.

559
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,280
Now, in the industry,

560
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,880
it's hard to supervise the corruption.

561
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
It can only be done by the moral consciousness

562
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,400
and strict self-examination of our securities employees.

563
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,440
So, President Jia,

564
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,800
please...

565
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,320
Lin Jie,

566
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,120
don't worry.

567
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,960
I agree with everything you said.

568
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,840
This is why I appreciate you

569
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,440
and sit down to listen to you.

570
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,800
But I'm a businessman.

571
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,040
To do good and to maintain justice,

572
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
I need to be a good exchange.

573
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,120
I understand.

574
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,520
President Jia,

575
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,720
if you need anything,

576
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
just tell me.

577
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,040
Since you've fired yourself from MH,

578
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,600
after the end of this period,

579
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,520
what will you do?

580
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,840
Here, Jiang Jun.

581
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,800
Delivery.

582
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,720
I've brought it for you.

583
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,320
Thank you.

584
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,360
You're welcome.

585
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,000
Here.

586
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,680
What did you buy? A recorder?

587
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,640
What for?

588
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm afraid that sometimes

589
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,840
I can't remember the content of the meeting.

590
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
I'll be more at ease after recording it.

591
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,840
You're really something.

592
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,120
Come in.

593
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,200
Mr. Du,

594
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,760
there's a document that needs your signature.

595
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,760
Okay, let me see.

596
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,760
I'm sorry.

597
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,920
It's done.

598
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,640
Thank you.

599
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:09,960
unconditionally.

600
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,800
in your face and heart.

601
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,440
Really?

602
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,520
Hey.

603
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,480
Mr. Lin,

604
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm here for public relations work.

605
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,720
I'm leaving.

606
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Hello, I like you.

607
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,560
I really like you.

608
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,560
I really like you.

609
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Who?

610
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,560
How did I hear someone say they like me?

611
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Could it be that I appeared in a fantasy?

612
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Or is he not distracted by his soul?

613
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Lily, I'm here. You can get off work.

614
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
I'm here.

615
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Thank you.

616
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
I happened to go see my niece.

617
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Her father doesn't know where Xiao Shi went.

618
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Her mother is very worried about her.

619
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
I think she's working overtime at this time.

620
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
This child is so pitiful.

621
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Who says it's not pitiful?

622
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
The child can eat.

623
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I guess she's still at home eating.

624
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Who says it's not pitiful?

625
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Why are there still so pitiful children now?

626
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
You hurry up and go.

627
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Don't let the child suffer again.

628
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Okay, I'll go first.

629
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm going to the bathroom.

630
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
You're a child now.

631
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Do you know that? You're still not obedient.

632
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Your parents broke up.

633
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
I don't know where you are now.

634
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
You're lucky to have such a beautiful and kind aunt like me.

635
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
You have to cherish me, okay?

636
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Come here and rest for a while.

637
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Wang Tai.

638
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Wang Tai.

639
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Do you think men are all big-headed?

640
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm not.

641
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Do you think men are all big-headed?

642
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,560
I'm not the one who's the most important person.

643
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Do you know that your boyfriend will be very eye-catching in the future?

644
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
He doesn't even know how to cherish a girl who has met such a good girl like me.

645
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
He'll regret it.

646
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Wang Tai.

647
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Let's go home and eat.

648
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Nothing can't be solved with a meal, right?

649
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Let's go.

650
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Jiang Jun, you're still here.

651
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Aren't you still here?

652
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,560
I'm going to work overtime and go down to buy coffee.

653
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
I'm leaving now. You guys go ahead.

654
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
Wait a minute, Jiang Jun.

655
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,560
I want to say a few words to you.

656
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Say it.

657
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,560
I know that you're not the only one who's worried about me.

658
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
I know that you're worried about me.

659
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,560
I know that Mr. Du is the top of Mr. Yuan.

660
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
You must think there's something wrong with this.

661
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,560
But I think I need to remind you two things.

662
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,560
After all, Mr. Du is Mr. Lin's man.

663
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
If you start a fight with him now,

664
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
it will definitely have an adverse effect on you.

665
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Don't look at Mr. Lin. He looks kind.

666
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,560
Actually, the elevator thing last time was him who instigated me behind my back.

667
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
You mean Mr. Lin and Lin Tai Mo?

668
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
I've always thought it's weird.

669
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Why did he call you in?

670
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,560
But he treated you like that.

671
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
I think you should think about it yourself.

672
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
See if you've been bothering him lately.

673
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Okay, I know. Thank you.

674
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
I'm leaving first.

675
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Okay.

676
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Okay.

677
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Jun Jun, I know you've been working overtime lately.

678
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,480
So I've helped you clean up your room and

679
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
take care of yourself and eat on time.

680
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,560
The most important thing is to take care of yourself no matter how busy you are.

681
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
I've prepared the face mask you like.

682
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Please apply it.

683
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Stay in good shape at all times.

684
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
A little bit of strength.

685
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
Hello, Jun Jun.

686
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Hello, Li Li.

687
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
I saw the note you wrote for me.

688
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
You've prepared the mask for me.

689
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
You're so sweet.

690
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
You really love me the most.

691
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,560
But how do you know I like the yogurt from this brand?

692
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
I know you've been busy lately.

693
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
You have to take care of yourself.

694
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Wait, what kind of yogurt did you say?

695
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
The yogurt in the fridge.

696
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Fridge? I didn't make you a fridge.

697
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Didn't you buy me these fruits, bread, ice cream in my fridge?

698
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
No.

699
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Jun Jun, I'm not going to tell you now.

700
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm going to the supermarket.

701
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
I'll talk to you another day.

702
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,560
I happen to have something to tell you.

703
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Go ahead.

704
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Bye.

705
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Isn't it a play?

706
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
It's hot.

707
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I'm going to the supermarket.

708
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
I'll talk to you another day.

709
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Bye.

710
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
How's it going, Mr. Du?

711
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,560
Are you used to working at MS?

712
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
The work arranged by Mr. Lin

713
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
is naturally important in every aspect.

714
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Then do you like the room I arranged for you?

715
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,560
You don't know it yourself, of course you like it.

716
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
This is serious.

717
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,560
I'm just a little bit of a troublemaker.

718
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
I'm just a little bit of a troublemaker.

719
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,560
I'm just a little bit of a troublemaker.

720
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
I'm just a little bit of a troublemaker.

721
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,560
I'm just a little bit of a troublemaker.

722
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Isn't this for Mr. Du?

723
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Two-fold beauty, no end in the world.

724
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
It's all arranged by Mr. Lin.

725
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,560
But it seems that your relationship

726
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
is not very happy.

727
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
There are some things that are not in a hurry.

728
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Take your time.

729
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,560
What's the news about Yuan Shuai?

730
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
He hasn't made any big moves recently.

731
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
He's quite at ease.

732
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,560
You know, I've already let everyone in the industry know about him.

733
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
It's too hard to turn over.

734
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,560
If it weren't for him having to take on the case of Jiang Nan Feng Wei,

735
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
I wouldn't have made it hard for him.

736
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Jiang Nan Feng Wei?

737
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
I'm not interested in it.

738
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,560
You know, I've already let everyone in the industry know about him.

739
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
It's too hard to turn over.

740
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,560
If it weren't for him having to take on the case of Jiang Nan Feng Wei,

741
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,560
I wouldn't have made it hard for him.

742
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,560
So, you mean that Yuan Shuai is the talk of the town?

743
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
I don't think so.

744
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,560
I don't think so.

745
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,560
How does this work?

746
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,400
Yep.

747
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,760
You mean

748
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Lin Tan Mo didn't come back

749
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,120
for any winds up?

750
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,560
He came back for

751
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,760
Jiang Nan rode case.

752
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,320
Yes.

753
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,680
It's my dad's mission.

754
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,600
Excuse me.

755
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,000
We didn't know

756
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,400
about that either.

757
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,460
So they wanted to

758
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,040
deal with you,

759
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,840
and wanted to deal with Yuan Shuai

760
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,800
because he was in search

761
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,320
some cases for you.

762
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:30,920
I thought

763
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,840
that case wouldn't beem a truth facial,

764
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
I didn't expect it to be like this.

765
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
But I think

766
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Yuan Shuai doesn't want you to know.

767
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
It means he knows this case will be very dangerous.

768
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
He is worried about you.

769
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
He has his own reasons for everything he does.

770
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
He has already planned a plan.

771
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,840
I suggest we just wait and see.

772
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
But I learned from Zhu Youing

773
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
that Yuan Shuai did this to get back on his feet.

774
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,840
And it seems that there is another person helping him.

775
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
Could it be Su Chang?

776
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
I don't think it's Su Chang.

777
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Su Chang followed him away.

778
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,840
This person should be able to make a good relationship with him in MH.

779
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
It must be Mr. Fan Qichang.

780
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,840
Yuan Shuai is Mr. Fan's favorite apprentice.

781
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Although he was suppressed by Mr. Lin,

782
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,840
he still has some influence in MH.

783
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
It's not Mr. Fan.

784
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
If Mr. Fan does anything,

785
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
he will definitely be noticed by Lin Taimo, the old fox.

786
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
It's impossible that it's Secretary Bai.

787
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Secretary Bai is a person who Lin Taimo carefully trained.

788
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
It's impossible to be casual.

789
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
If Yuan Shuai reveals him,

790
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
it will be too dangerous.

791
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Could it be...

792
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Yes, I think it's him.

793
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
From the beginning of the report,

794
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
he is planning to pretend to be in the forest.

795
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,840
They should be looking for the most important evidence of Lin Taimo.

796
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Come in.

797
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Mr. Lin, there is a document here.

798
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Please correct it yourself.

799
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
Okay, wait a moment.

800
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Okay.

801
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Thank you for your hard work. I won't bother you anymore.

802
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Okay.

803
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Yuan Shuai,

804
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
according to the clues you provided,

805
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,840
I checked all the information of the C Group shareholders.

806
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Among them, Huixin, which accounts for 5.36% of the shares, is very suspicious.

807
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Five years ago,

808
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
this was a subsidiary of the Du Group.

809
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,840
But this small company

810
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,840
is the highest price of C Group.

811
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,840
It's 1.02% shares

812
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,840
and RMB 3.2 billion.

813
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
Later, this company ran away alone.

814
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
But it still holds the shares of C Group.

815
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Who is their legal representative?

816
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
This is the most suspicious place.

817
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,840
His legal representative

818
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,840
is a regular female secretary of the Du Group.

819
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
It has nothing to do with Lin Taimo.

820
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,840
It doesn't.

821
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Are you sure that Lin Taimo is behind this?

822
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
I'm sure.

823
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
If all the shares of this 5.36%

824
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
are cashed in, it will exceed 10 billion.

825
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Lin Taimo will not refuse.

826
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,840
He is such a smart person.

827
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
He will be replaced.

828
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Lin Taimo is not a friend of Lin Taimo.

829
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,840
So, he won't trust Lin Taimo.

830
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,840
They must have an agreement.

831
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
Mr. Jia,

832
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
please ask Lin Taimo

833
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
to come to my office tomorrow.

834
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Okay.

835
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
Mr. Jia,

836
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
I'm here.

837
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Mr. Jia,

838
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
why are you in such a good mood today?

839
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Why do you want me to be your guest?

840
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,840
I asked you here today

841
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
because I have a friend

842
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,840
who wants to meet you.

843
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
Yuan,

844
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,840
Yuan Shuai.

845
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,840
Yuan Shuai.

846
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
Yuan Shuai.

847
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,840
Yuan Shuai.

848
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
Yuan Shuai.

849
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Yuan Shuai.

850
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,840
Yuan Shuai.

851
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Yuan Shuai.

852
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Yuan Shuai.

853
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Yuan Shuai.

854
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Yuan Shuai.

855
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Yuan Shuai.

856
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Yuan Shuai.

857
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Yuan Shuai.

858
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,840
Yuan Shuai.

859
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Yuan Shuai.

860
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Yuan Shuai.

861
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
Yuan Shuai.

862
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Yuan Shuai.

863
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Yuan Shuai.

864
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Yuan Shuai.

865
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Yuan Shuai.

866
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Yuan Shuai.

867
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Yuan Shuai.

868
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Yuan Shuai.

869
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Yuan Shuai.

870
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Yuan Shuai.

871
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
Yuan Shuai.

872
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
Yuan Shuai.

873
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,840
I think I'm tired

874
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,840
I think I'm blind

875
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,840
Don't know how to feel

876
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,840
Don't know how to heal

877
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,840
You walk so fast

878
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,840
Can't catch your light

879
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,840
You fly so high

880
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Leave all the things behind

881
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
And our story

882
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Leave all of nowhere to find

883
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,840
I think I'm tired

884
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,840
I think I'm blind

885
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Don't know how to feel

886
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,840
Don't know how to heal

887
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,840
You walk so fast

888
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Can't catch your light

889
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,840
You fly so high

890
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,840
Leave all the things behind

891
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,840
And our story

892
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:12,840
Leave all of nowhere to find

893
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,840
I think I'm tired
