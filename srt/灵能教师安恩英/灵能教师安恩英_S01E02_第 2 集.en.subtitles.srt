1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,757
Hey!

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,554
Seung-gwon!

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,185
Get down!

4
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,954
-Seung-gwon!
-My body's getting better,

5
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,998
getting better, getting better!

6
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,918
-Hui-cheol, wait!
-Wait, hold up. What's going on?

7
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,920
I don’t know, the kids are going crazy.

8
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,296
Where's the class president?

9
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,048
-Wait. What's going on?
-All together!

10
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,090
What? I don't know.

11
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,425
-Damn it.
-Seung-gwon!

12
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,135
My body's getting better,

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,929
-What…
-getting better, getting better!

14
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,097
-Shit.
-My body's getting better,

15
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,141
-Damn stairs…
-getting better, getting better!

16
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,520
My body's getting better,
getting better, getting better!

17
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,529
You. Get down from there.

18
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,539
This damn thing...

19
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,142
Stick close!

20
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,518
My goodness.

21
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,899
Don't do it. Please.

22
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,868
Get up!

23
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:46,541
Quiet! Calm down! All together now!

24
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,461
Everyone to their positions! Let's begin!

25
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,006
-I just made it up here, for fuck's sake.
-My body's getting better,

26
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,757
getting better, getting better!

27
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,803
My body's getting better,
getting better, getting better!

28
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,939
That's one fucking ugly monster.

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,616
Shit.

30
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,495
Damn it.

31
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,054
Over there!

32
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,574
You. Seung-gwon's friend.

33
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:07,163
In my office, there's a red pouch
in my right desk drawer.

34
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,123
You'll find a key in it.

35
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,584
Use it to open the cabinet
behind the door.

36
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,628
You'll see a lot of stuff.

37
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,006
If you look closely,
you'll find an array of beakers.

38
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,550
I must seem crazy to you now.

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,512
I also think that about myself.

40
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,389
It's...

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,224
It's all over for me now!

42
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,124
-You... Fuck.
-My body's getting better,

43
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,709
-Oh Seung-gwon, you bastard!
-getting better, getting better!

44
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,086
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

45
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,754
-Shit.
-getting better, getting better!

46
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,881
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

47
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,591
-getting better, getting better!
-getting better, getting better!

48
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,677
-My body's getting better,
-Shit.

49
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,054
-getting better, getting better!
-getting better, getting better!

50
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,974
Damn it.

51
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,143
What the hell?

52
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,548
Hey!

53
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,219
Hey!

54
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,939
Hey!

55
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,653
Hey, Min-u!

56
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,074
Jin-su!

57
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,493
Seong-mun!

58
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,120
Ui-tae!

59
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,207
They're all flying away.
Jeong-min, hold on!

60
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,549
Ms. Ahn, behind you!

61
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,612
We're so high up.

62
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,702
Help me.

63
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,914
What's going to happen to us?

64
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,650
What are you...

65
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,236
What the fuck are you doing?

66
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,545
Die!

67
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,038
You're the class president, right?

68
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,125
Get your friends
and hurry down the stairs.

69
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,711
If you're down from the fence,
help the others.

70
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,504
It's dangerous, so get them down!

71
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,630
-I almost fell off.
-Take that off

72
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,132
-and don't forget...
-Don't pull. It hurts.

73
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,550
-...the necklace.
-Hey, wait.

74
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,718
Hurry up.

75
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,802
Are you really okay?

76
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,514
Hey, are you okay?

77
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,729
The presidents of each class
will lead its class downstairs.

78
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,274
Stop joking around
and slowly get back down here.

79
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,538
Are you all right?

80
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,375
-My cheek's burning for some reason.
-One by one, guys. Wait for your turn.

81
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,674
Gosh. This is cute. What is this?

82
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,010
I rode him up here.

83
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,430
You did? Well, he's adorable.
Is he your pet?

84
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,723
Don't come back out.

85
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,688
Don't smile.

86
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,857
That's even scarier. Don't laugh.

87
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,163
Let me recharge first.

88
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,291
Spare me.

89
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,548
I'm sorry about this,
but I feel like I'm about to die.

90
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,429
Shit.

91
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,978
Please spare my life.

92
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,650
I will.

93
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,860
Fuck.

94
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,826
Thank you.

95
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,496
I'm truly grateful.

96
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,037
Hi.

97
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,502
Sorry, I'm late.

98
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,425
Hi.

99
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,653
An earthquake took place
in Yongsan-gu of Seoul this afternoon.

100
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,324
The epicenter was revealed
as Mong-lyeon High School.

101
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,368
Reporter Kim is at the site
with a detailed report.

102
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,286
Reporter Kim?

103
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,830
Yes, this is Kim Yu-jin.

104
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,124
Could we have the outline of events?

105
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,004
The incident took place
during the school's lunch break.

106
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,548
The seismometer measured
a big earthquake of 4.8,

107
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:24,386
but the tremors were only sensed
in the vicinity of Mong-lyeon High School.

108
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,140
Many students were outside
enjoying the sun at the time,

109
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,518
but thankfully, there weren't
any devastating tragedies.

110
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,645
Before the earthquake,
the school was reported

111
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,522
to have been hit with multiple tremors.

112
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,357
Thanks to the quick response
of the teachers,

113
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,692
all the students evacuated safely.

114
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,948
I will now interview a student
who was at the site.

115
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,950
How was it?

116
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,914
How was it? It must've been terrifying.

117
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,668
It wasn't scary at all.

118
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,879
We just followed
the teachers' instructions.

119
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,922
What?

120
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,132
What are you, crazy?

121
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,176
-Excuse me, your skirt...
-Leave me alone.

122
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,429
They all ran up there to jump.

123
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,432
It seems you've injured your head.
Are you all right?

124
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,811
What good would
an epidemiological investigation do?

125
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,230
They'll never know.

126
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,941
I'm all right.

127
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,442
No one will ever know.

128
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,862
-Hold on.
-They won't know why.

129
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,073
-Aren't you Radi?
-Who knows why this happened?

130
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,533
Could you say a few words?

131
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,996
I want to thank our teachers
for saving our lives today.

132
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,915
I’ve been wondering
why she looked familiar.

133
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,710
She's Radi, Joshua Jang's daughter.

134
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,253
She's a K-pop idol.

135
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,215
-Anyway, we're glad that everyone is safe.
-I'm so damn tired.

136
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,904
ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT THE TRUTH?

137
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,660
"Ap,

138
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,037
ji,

139
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,080
seok."

140
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,628
"U-ta-u-seom-seok choi-gi-sa-che
yuk-bu-jeom-ja."

141
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,466
To make things worse,
fishes, toads, and lizards

142
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,052
that fed on the corpses grew bigger.

143
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,304
I have no idea.

144
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:37,269
"Go gwan-bu-ha-myeong
sa-to-sa-jeon-gi-eon."

145
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,440
That is why the authorities ordered
the pond to be filled.

146
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,362
"Sang-in-yuk-yi-bi-ja
yi-ryo-so-hu-ga-sal."

147
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,616
Those that grew fat
by feeding on the flesh of men

148
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,619
could be destroyed
by torching their throats.

149
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,662
You're right.

150
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,374
That monster had the shape
of a freshwater fish or a toad.

151
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,501
It also said this.

152
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,255
"Ja-go-shi-ji bu-sil-jeong-in-so-ja
yi-so-tu-sin."

153
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,383
This pond was where
young people who lost their lovers

154
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,134
-threw themselves in.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

155
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,012
You keep showing yours later.

156
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:12,972
Okay, I'm sorry.

157
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,306
Rock-paper-scissors.

158
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,059
A-ra, why do you keep losing today?

159
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,688
So...

160
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,939
Wait. What's this?

161
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,857
-My school uniform.
-...what does jeongin mean?

162
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,694
Don't you know what jeongin means?

163
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,947
A close friend
that you feel a connection to.

164
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,740
-Your hair's looking good today.
-Thanks.

165
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,325
Do you want to go watch
the ball game later?

166
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,785
-I see.
-Basketball? Sure.

167
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,869
It sounds about right.

168
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,748
By the way, I don't see Seung-gwon.

169
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,377
He's right over there.

170
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,546
No, not him.

171
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,801
Well, I'm glad.

172
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,643
There could be accidents
so take care not to...

173
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,771
Why did they have to build a school
in a place like this?

174
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,692
Are you seriously going to steal
all of it?

175
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,074
You stay there. You might jinx it.

176
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,249
VOLUNTEER CERTIFICATES

177
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,209
Found it.

178
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,712
SEO JIN-GYEONG, MONG-LYEON HIGH SCHOOL

179
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,548
ORGANIZATION: HOUSE OF CULTURE

180
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,551
Just think about it.
This is worth three days.

181
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,515
One certificate alone
will buy us three more days.

182
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,351
Where will you eat and sleep
for three days then?

183
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,311
Don't be such a pussy. It'll all work out.

184
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,946
Can we really do this?

185
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,784
We'll keep two for ourselves
and sell the rest for 30,000 won each.

186
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,370
What we don't have is a seal.

187
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,789
-Right.
-You need to make one.

188
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,291
Do we need to have them stamped?

189
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,043
They're not viable without a seal.

190
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,838
How do I make one though?

191
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,131
With an eraser.

192
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,633
And how are you supposed to do it?

193
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,302
It's your job, not mine.

194
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,471
Right,

195
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,390
so how am I supposed to do it?

196
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,600
You're in the Art Club.

197
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,478
At least make most
of being in a crappy club.

198
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,732
You say that like you're
in the Ping-pong Club or something.

199
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,609
I am.

200
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,903
I see.

201
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,532
I need a smoke.

202
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,995
We'll get caught because of the smell.

203
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,371
HEO WAN-SU (LUCKY)

204
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,622
I never get caught. Ever.

205
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,252
That's just how I am.

206
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,879
KANG MIN-U (RUCKUS)

207
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,255
But I always get caught.

208
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,141
Min-u and Wan-su?

209
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,812
Well, they do spend
a lot of time together.

210
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,732
Why do you ask?

211
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,278
Do they ever get into trouble together?

212
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,992
Oh, Min-u and Wan-su?

213
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,369
They're both in my class.

214
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:11,001
Wan-su's nickname is Lucky.
Luck always finds her.

215
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,961
Meanwhile,

216
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,172
Min-u is Ruckus.

217
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,799
He always ends up complicating things.

218
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,720
-Go for it.
-Min-u had feelings for Jellyfish.

219
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,263
No, he didn't.

220
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,389
Yes, he did.

221
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,642
He didn't!

222
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,559
As if you'd know.

223
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,561
-You didn't even know that I liked you.
-Damn it.

224
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,067
You didn't know that I liked you either.

225
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,778
Hey, you two.

226
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,114
Get out.

227
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,637
To be honest, Min-u tends to
cause trouble.

228
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,394
This one time, he brought a hamster
to school and lost it.

229
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,105
Why would you even bring a hamster?

230
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,903
The hamster is my friend.
My cute little friend.

231
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,238
My sweet little buddy.

232
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,948
Its name is Fried Ham.

233
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,867
Min-u brought a rat to school.

234
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,953
Why would you bring it to school?

235
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,706
Tiny and stupid. They're so alike.

236
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,625
It was during gym.

237
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,377
I left Fried Ham in a box.

238
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,004
But when I came back,

239
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:38,922
Fried Ham was gone.

240
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,841
I was sure I closed the lid
before I left.

241
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,758
No, you didn't.

242
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,011
How did Fried Ham leave the box?

243
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,429
To get away from you.

244
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,847
Where did Fried Ham go?

245
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,598
Where did Fried Ham go?

246
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,184
No!

247
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,938
Could Wan-su have done it on purpose?

248
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,357
Hide the hamster for six hours?

249
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,484
No way.

250
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,486
Where did you go, Fried Ham?

251
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,156
Where did that damn rat go?

252
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,326
What an idiot.

253
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,579
I highly doubt it.

254
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,874
I see something like an umbilical cord
connecting the back of their heads,

255
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,167
and it’s bothering me.

256
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,378
There's nothing I can do about them.

257
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,510
Wan-su went to the cafeteria
and checked the soup container.

258
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,055
The kids threw up during
and before their meals

259
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,140
thinking that they ate hamster soup.

260
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,850
They cried their eyes out.

261
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,561
How could they
when Fried Ham is super adorable?

262
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,773
But Wan-su found Fried Ham for me.

263
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,982
Ta-da.

264
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,942
It was in the trash can
in another classroom.

265
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,404
We are happy.

266
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,156
We are friends forever.

267
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,325
-Best friends forever!
-Whatever.

268
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,285
This one time, Wan-su

269
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,497
was in trouble
for selling porn to the students.

270
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,626
I knew it.

271
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,338
Does that really help you
recharge your aura?

272
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,135
Whatever you take
should be used for a good cause.

273
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,681
Om pra mani dhani svaha.

274
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,367
People only wish for good things,

275
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,952
so I can't help myself.

276
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,082
You don't have many friends, do you?

277
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,459
Look who's asking.

278
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,461
What about you then?

279
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,717
Well, you're not doing this
for your own benefit.

280
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,887
You really don't even have one, do you?

281
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,141
That’s too bad. I have one.

282
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,477
You're right. I don't have friends.

283
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,608
I may not attend class reunions
or go to others' weddings,

284
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,194
but I still have a friend
who's like family to me.

285
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,320
Refreshing, right?

286
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,531
-Do you see better now?
-I went from being a nurse

287
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,574
to a school nurse

288
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,075
because of her.

289
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,036
-Hold on.
-We met last year.

290
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,288
It'll come to you soon.

291
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:20,041
You may ask how we can
become like family in just a year.

292
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,794
But true friendships
don't take long to form.

293
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,672
-You either click or you don't.
-Your tongue.

294
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,675
Stick out your tongue.

295
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,051
That's it.

296
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,515
Well, you did say that
your school was full of jellies.

297
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,936
Right. But those two were born with that.

298
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,980
I can't do anything about it.

299
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,777
Do they have curly hair?

300
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,779
Yes.

301
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,157
What about that though?

302
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,951
Jellies like to imitate.

303
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,120
They like hair.

304
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,750
Could that be the reason?

305
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,171
So,

306
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,341
what's bad about them
being tangled with each other?

307
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,929
It's not good for two friends
to be tethered to one another.

308
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,265
How is that no good?

309
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,809
They're just kids.

310
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,023
No.

311
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,778
I've seen people die because of that.

312
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
It's not good at all.

313
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,828
Then...

314
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,040
shave it off.

315
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,333
That's right.

316
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,961
Shave all their hair off.

317
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,880
Since it's because of their hair.

318
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,055
But I don't want to.

319
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,695
It could be some other hair on the body.

320
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,241
Unbelievable.

321
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,704
Who's going to give them
a bikini wax then?

322
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,881
It's all right. It could be armpit hair.

323
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,177
But hair grows back.

324
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,309
Or...

325
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,644
how about a regular hair removal?

326
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,355
And who's going to make them?

327
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,072
Shit. Seriously, what do I do
about their hair?

328
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,247
How about

329
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,960
tying off the ends so that jellies
can't get stuck on them?

330
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,423
Their hair will keep growing back anyway.

331
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,633
That's another option to consider...

332
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,595
Gosh, seriously.

333
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,474
Do you want me to help you
with your hair problem?

334
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,189
The anatomical classification,

335
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,690
PLAN 1: THE HAIR ON THEIR HEADS

336
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,069
in layman's terms,
has to do with where things stem from.

337
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,072
There are two main classifications.

338
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,616
The first is...

339
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,161
No, that's wrong.

340
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,245
Wait, it isn't.

341
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,289
Actually, that's not it.

342
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,041
YOU'D BE CUTE IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOUR CURLY HAIR, FROM A-RA

343
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,000
Not sympathetic.

344
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,213
It should be the autonomic nervous system.
I was wrong.

345
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,632
The autonomic nervous system.

346
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,343
And this is
the sympathetic nervous system.

347
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,597
And this is
the parasympathetic nervous system.

348
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:08,603
All right then. So what does
the sympathetic nervous system do?

349
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,605
It stimulates.

350
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,899
And this

351
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,277
hinders stimulation.

352
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,115
These two have opposite functions.

353
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:25,370
So the anatomical classification.
Let's see where they stem from.

354
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,582
It's split into two categories again.

355
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,751
So, first,

356
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,963
the cranial nerve.

357
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,590
It stems from the cranial nerve.

358
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,218
And then...

359
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,430
That's right, the spinal cord.

360
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,851
How many pairs
of cranial nerves are there?

361
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,063
That's right. 12 pairs.
Isn't it easy to remember?

362
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,523
I THINK YOU'LL LOOK CUTE
WITH YOUR HEAD SHAVED

363
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,482
FROM A-RA

364
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,525
And the spinal nerve?

365
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,694
Yes, 31 pairs.

366
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,154
Buzz it all off.

367
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,656
Again, it's easy to remember.

368
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:07,287
Also, the sympathetic nerve
and the parasympathetic nerve

369
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,123
work in opposite ways.

370
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,438
It's even bigger now.

371
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,023
Do I have something on my head?

372
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,193
It's just so fun to touch.

373
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,194
No way. It hurts.

374
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,322
Please, just let me.

375
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,329
We're fucked.

376
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,997
Why?

377
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,958
Maybe it’s not the hair on their heads.

378
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,795
Then...

379
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:06,763
How about tying off the ends so
that jellies can't get stuck on them?

380
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,351
Their hair will keep growing back anyway.

381
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:17,690
PLAN 2: THE HAIR ON THEIR ARMPITS

382
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,694
All right. Lastly,

383
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,822
put this end

384
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,907
through the loop here.

385
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,576
Then pull it through.

386
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,791
No, not like that.

387
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,501
Try again.

388
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,962
Let the other end guide you.

389
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,050
Pull it through, straight along the line.

390
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,177
Pull.

391
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,221
You should start over.

392
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,515
It's all wrong.

393
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,435
No, not like that.

394
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,687
Just start over.

395
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,313
You did it wrong.

396
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,943
It should be two strings at a time.
But yours is a mess. It's wrong.

397
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,823
You did it.

398
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,283
This is the ring knot.

399
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,162
The difference between the ring knot
and the flat ring knot is this.

400
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,208
Pull on one end, and the former
becomes the latter.

401
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,128
Tuck the end back in
to have the ring knot again.

402
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,754
Okay?

403
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,299
We're running out of time.

404
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,677
Since we're in a hurry,
we'll move on to the strawberry knot.

405
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,680
Can't we just stick to one?

406
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,726
I told you we can't.

407
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,271
Don't you frown at me.

408
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,901
I wasn't frowning.

409
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,547
PING-PONG CLUB

410
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,597
Listen up.

411
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,265
This is Giseong Girls' High.

412
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,393
There are three buildings
if we enter through the back gate.

413
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,020
Out of those,

414
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,813
this is the one with the classrooms.

415
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,151
No one uses the back gate
when college exams are near.

416
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,444
They think it'll jinx them.

417
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,282
At the back gate, there's a bridge
that connects to the building.

418
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,203
Through there,
we can reach the center staircase.

419
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:41,751
The bridge is closed off at 6:30 p.m.,
so we must enter before sundown.

420
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:47,215
BRIDGE

421
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,718
On every floor,
there is a teacher on night duty.

422
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,805
Then what do we do?

423
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,181
Look here.

424
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,518
On the third floor, the classrooms
for 11th graders should be empty.

425
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,734
Exactly from 8:10 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.,
the teachers will shift positions.

426
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,444
That's our window.

427
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:23,001
It will take less than a minute
to go up a flight of stairs.

428
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,171
Once we pass the hallway, we'll be safe.
There are no teachers in the classrooms.

429
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,012
Will that really help us get into college?

430
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:19,557
You idiot. How do you think
we got into college?

431
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,768
I'll sell it for 50,000 won each.

432
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,688
What if the girls report the theft?

433
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,025
They find it entertaining too.

434
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,321
Some even offered us their cushions
in exchange for our numbers back then.

435
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,867
We eventually set up
a group date with them.

436
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,704
That being said, I wish you the best.

437
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,372
Yes, in English…

438
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,561
No, you can't.

439
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,316
That belongs to a dead person.

440
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,986
That belongs to a dead person.

441
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,365
That belongs to a dead person.

442
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,699
That belongs to a dead person.

443
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,368
That belongs to a dead person.

444
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,703
That belongs to a dead person.

445
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,499
It's arrived at last.

446
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,307
This isn't easy.

447
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,063
Then, I guess that's enough for today.

448
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,485
In our next class, you'll finish learning
the butterfly knot and the dragonfly knot.

449
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,821
The dragonfly knot

450
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,240
will be a little trickier.

451
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,744
I'll explain it with an image.

452
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,876
In case of the dragonfly knot,

453
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,794
a bud knot,

454
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,963
a wing knot,

455
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,800
and a double knot
is used to make the shape of a dragonfly.

456
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,596
This double knot
is also called a dori knot.

457
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,099
Because it looks like a baby
that shakes his head sideways.

458
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,726
They call that dori dori.

459
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,394
-It resembles--
-Do I have to learn

460
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,604
all these complicated knots?

461
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,814
Of course.

462
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,151
This is something
we need to be meticulous about.

463
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,195
We need to find the knot
that'll work the best.

464
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,740
I'll explain it from the top.

465
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,116
Here's the dragonfly's head.

466
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,786
The head is made using a bud knot.

467
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:31,290
This knot got its name
because it looks like the bud of a lotus.

468
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,084
You tried this, right?

469
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,335
This was probably the easiest.

470
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,128
You tried it, right?

471
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,089
Next are the wings.

472
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,465
The wing knot is easy too--

473
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,676
Why are you doing this to me?

474
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,682
Shall we stop then?

475
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,894
No, please carry on.

476
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,147
To explain it more in detail,

477
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:59,318
let me use this book
to show you how the knot is made.

478
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,021
MATHEMATICS

KANG MIN-U

481
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:11,760
Hey.

482
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,434
What is it?

483
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,770
Gyeong-hwa's being too noisy with her pen.

484
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,400
Gyeong-hwa.

485
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:28,986
Your pen.

486
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,030
Keep it down, all right?

487
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,665
Can I get another answer sheet?

495
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,638
You press down 30 times like this.

496
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:42,434
Please make sure
your fingers don't touch the breasts.

497
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,437
Also, between chest compressions,

498
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,441
let the chest relax sufficiently so that
the blood can flow back into the heart.

499
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,985
Raise your hand if you'd like to try.

500
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:27,021
LAUGHING WILL BRING GOOD FORTUNE

501
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,668
What are you doing here?

502
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,256
This isn't your school.

503
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,010
Eun-young.

504
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,932
Ahn Eun-young!

505
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,762
BASED ON THE SCHOOL NURSE FILES
BY CHUNG SE-RANG

506
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,152
It's the school nurse
Let's quickly run away

507
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:01,198
We're all going to die
Let's quickly run away

508
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:12,501
It's the school nurse
Let's quickly run away

509
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:16,213
We're all going to die
Let's quickly run away

510
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,765
The hamster is my friend
My cute little friend

511
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,392
My sweet little buddy

512
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,561
Its name is Fried Ham

513
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,397
Min-u brought a rat to school

514
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,691
Why would you bring it to school?

515
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,111
Tiny and stupid
They're so alike

516
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,862
It was during gym

517
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:49,199
I left Fried Ham in a box
But when I came back

518
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,535
Fried Ham was gone

519
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,538
-I was sure I closed the lid before I left
-No, you didn't

520
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,540
How did Fried Ham leave the box?

521
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,833
To get away from you

522
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,336
Where did Fried Ham go?
Where did Fried Ham go?

523
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,964
No

524
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,801
Could Wan-su have done it on purpose?

525
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,971
Hide the hamster for six hours?

526
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,347
No way

527
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,182
Where did you go, Fried Ham?

528
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,810
Where did that damn rat go?

529
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,480
What an idiot

530
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,525
I highly doubt it

531
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,570
I see something like an umbilical cord
Connecting the back of their heads

532
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,904
And it’s bothering me

533
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,533
There's nothing I can do about them

534
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,373
Wan-su went to the cafeteria
And checked the soup container

535
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,376
The kids threw up during
And before their meals

536
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,171
Thinking that they ate hamster soup
They cried their eyes out

537
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,840
How could they
When Fried Ham is super adorable?

538
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,218
But Wan-su found Fried Ham for me

539
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,345
Ta-da

540
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,513
It was in the trash can
In another classroom

541
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,602
We are happy
We are friends forever

542
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,063
-Best friends forever
-Whatever

543
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,149
-My body's getting better
-My body's getting better

544
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,068
-Getting better, getting better
-Getting better, getting better

545
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,363
-My body's getting better
-My body's getting better

546
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,323
-Getting better, getting better
-Getting better, getting better

547
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,993
-My body's getting better
-My body's getting better

548
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,953
-Getting better, getting better
-Getting better, getting better

549
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,374
-My body's getting better
-My body's getting better

550
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,417
-Getting better, getting better
-Getting better, getting better

551
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,712
-My body's getting better
-My body's getting better

552
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,714
-Getting better, getting better
-Getting better, getting better

553
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,176
-My body's getting better
-My body's getting better

554
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,303
-Getting better, getting better
-Getting better, getting better

555
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,098
