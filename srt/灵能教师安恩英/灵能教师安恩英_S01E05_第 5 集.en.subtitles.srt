1
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,479
Ahn Eun-young.

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,774
Can you swap seats with me?

3
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:33,450
I've picked number five!
I'm going to be alone in the back.

4
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,367
That's so cool.

5
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,410
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,539
You can sleep during class
if you're at the back.

7
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,999
Shut up!

8
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,960
It's fine with me, but...

9
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,130
Then,

10
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,258
is it okay for me to be fine as well?

11
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,843
-It's settled then.
-Hey, wait.

12
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,929
Who did this? You went over the line.

13
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,227
Quit pulling my leg, you son of a bitch.

14
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,022
Have you been there?

15
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,106
No, I haven't.

16
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,783
Fuck. For a moment there,
I thought she wouldn't swap.

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,454
KIM KANG-SUN

18
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,623
It's because of
Kim Kang-sun's sister, right?

19
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,624
Yes.

20
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,460
All of my brother’s teeth got knocked out.

21
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,545
Because he got on his sister's nerves.

22
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,466
I'm glad he survived though.

23
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,842
What do you mean?

24
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,304
Kang-sun's dad kills people for money.

25
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,933
Really?

26
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,768
That's what my mom said.

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,062
Shit, I knew it.

28
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,239
I didn’t want to sit
with Ahn Eun-young anyway.

29
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,573
What about Ahn Eun-young?

30
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,702
AHN EUN-YOUNG

31
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,581
I hear you see ghosts.

32
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,583
Ahn Eun-young sees ghosts.

33
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,377
She sees ghosts?

34
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,174
By any chance,
do you see anything haunting me?

35
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,692
Is your dad perhaps...

36
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,539
They're fighting!

37
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,583
Again. Hit her some more.

38
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,919
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry.

39
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,214
-Don't cry.
-Hit her some more!

40
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,341
The third-person omniscient point of view.

41
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,595
Let's follow the story of the novel first.

42
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,807
The one that came to see me
before the incident.

43
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,393
There was this flyer.

44
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,279
Ahn Eun-young.

45
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,837
It's me, Kang-sun.

46
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,841
Kang-sun?

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,676
Yes.

48
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,304
Kim Kang-sun, seventh grade, class three?

49
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,514
Yes. It's been a while.

50
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,610
I'm sorry about this,
but I just wouldn't shatter into pieces.

51
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,196
So I stopped by to see you.

52
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,051
Would you like to come inside for a while?

53
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,097
Okay.

54
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,192
Why though?

55
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,945
Were you curious about how I was doing?

56
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,572
Yes. Always.

57
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,374
I guess dead people have
static electricity too.

58
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,002
I guess so.

59
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,187
Is that a landscape drawing?

60
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,440
There’s no way this would be a landscape.

61
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,150
I see.

62
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,159
What's up with your lunch?

63
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,579
What about you? Why aren’t you eating?

64
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,209
I...

65
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,254
Just because.

66
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,465
My stepmom packed it for me.

67
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,052
She obviously couldn't care less.

68
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,264
And what's with your face?

69
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,353
Jellies do this to me sometimes.

70
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,148
They scratch my face when they're pissed.

71
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,274
"Jellies"?

72
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,651
Yes.

73
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,653
Is your stepmom's name "Jelly"?

74
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,405
No, it's something else.

75
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,952
They look like your drawing.

76
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,539
Liar.

77
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,875
I'm not lying.

78
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,424
I'm not.

79
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,679
You're pretty good.

80
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,534
Still, it's breakfast...

81
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,541
Hye-min, are you free today?

82
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,710
Why?

83
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,920
Radi is taking us
to the backstage of a music show.

84
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,505
At the broadcasting station?

85
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,841
-Yes.
-I already saved you a seat.

86
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,759
Me too?

87
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,011
Yes.

88
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,432
How far away is it from here?

89
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,684
It took me about 20 minutes by car.

90
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,519
Then 40 minutes by bus.

91
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,439
Time will fly by though
since we're going as a group.

92
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,192
But Hye-min...

93
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,276
Oh, I forgot.

94
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,445
Sorry.

95
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,699
I don't think I'll be able
to make a trip that far.

96
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,244
That’s too bad. I was so freaking
stressed out, I really wanted to go.

97
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,246
I'll invite you again next time.

98
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,137
This is within the 5.38km radius.

99
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,931
I'll be back after my shoot,

100
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,016
-so wait for me there.
-Damn, are you serious?

101
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,267
Sounds like fun.

102
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,227
-What?
-What?

103
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,898
Can I help?

104
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,650
-With what?
-With what?

105
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,735
It sounds like fun, though!

106
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,841
Shut up

107
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,177
Hello?

108
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,513
That mite eater...

109
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,849
I found a place.

110
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,602
Apparently, there's someone
who does surgery for their kind.

111
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,939
She'll help you once you tell them
that Doraji introduced you.

112
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,575
Stop fooling around
and keep your distance.

113
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,369
What will you do if you get hurt?

114
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,328
Right.

115
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,580
Why won’t you just listen?

116
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,344
I think I found a way
for you to live over 20.

117
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,516
It could be dangerous,
but then again, it might not be.

118
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,608
Is it nice to grow old?

119
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,318
Hell no.

120
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,904
Then why are you suggesting it for me?

121
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,117
Isn’t it better to have a normal life
and die

122
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,203
instead of eating mites forever?

123
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,808
What about school then?

124
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,395
Hye-min.

125
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,355
Put yourself first.

126
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,899
You've done enough.

127
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,697
I'll think about it.

128
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,098
MS. AHN
CAN WE MEET UP AFTER SCHOOL?

129
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,414
Why are you seated like that?

130
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,583
You can sit up now.

131
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,725
What the hell did you do in here?

132
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,687
Oh, I gave Ga-young a lift.

133
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,064
It was Ga-young.

134
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,483
She has a bad back, you see.

135
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,990
I don’t need you to tell me about
your personal life.

136
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,411
I guess
I can’t hold your hand anymore then.

137
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,121
No, that's fine.

138
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,166
It is.

139
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,061
Just a second.

140
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,320
You have terrible taste in men.

141
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,697
Shut it.

142
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,201
But I didn't say anything.

143
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,540
Look at you blushing, my gosh.

144
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,127
Hold on. Jeez.

145
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,753
Goodness.

146
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,131
How do I turn this off...

147
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,758
The car is...

148
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,597
I'm sorry.

149
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,336
I'll take that one.

150
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,048
All right.

151
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,762
Actually, Doraji introduced me
to this place.

152
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,389
Oh, I see.

153
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,730
It's 35,000 won per kilogram.

154
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,191
So that's 58,000 won,
but I'll take 50,000 won.

155
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,442
Okay.

156
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,736
Are you two a couple?

157
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,820
-Yes.
-No.

158
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,043
Which one of you needs treatment?

159
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,127
Me.

160
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,015
Two hundred million.

161
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,851
-Sorry?
-That's what the surgery will cost.

162
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,103
What?

163
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,022
It's not even that much

164
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,943
considering how the stomach has to be
completely removed.

165
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,362
Could I live if I have 200 million won?

166
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,410
I can't operate on you.

167
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,121
You only have a few days.

168
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:44,753
Rockfish, flatfish, 23,000 won per kilo!
It's cheap!

169
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,755
Come take a look!

170
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,049
Do you need a tax invoice?

171
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,099
Will the removal of the stomach
have guaranteed results?

172
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,562
Yes.

173
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,026
I'll think about it then.

174
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,986
How about 160 million?

175
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,989
Then 150 million.

176
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,615
I'll be in touch.

177
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,492
How about 50 million?

178
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,748
I'm only joking.

179
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,260
What's wrong? Is it because of the money?

180
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,429
It's too expensive.

181
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,932
Isn't 150 million won a good bargain?

182
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,143
We're talking about
a new life for someone.

183
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,232
If a stomach removal is all we need,
then we'll look for someone better.

184
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,446
Life just isn't easy, is it?

185
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,957
He's not the kind of student
to skip school, so I called.

186
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,919
I scolded him for being out for too long.

187
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,005
Apparently,
something had happened at home.

188
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,548
That's what happened.

189
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,758
I'm just saying.

190
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,512
I was just bored, that's all.

191
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,897
Ms. Ahn.

192
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,024
ALMAGEL

193
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,985
I've been thinking.

194
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,534
I’d like to just live this way.

195
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,786
Why?

196
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,956
If I become a human,

197
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,336
who will protect Radi, A-ra,
Seung-gwon, Ji-hyeong, and Gyeong-hwa?

198
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,089
What?

199
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,637
If I give up on my job,
mites will bring them bad luck.

200
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:04,935
The mites need to be removed immediately
or they'll end up ruining their souls.

201
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,939
After 100 days,
the effect will be irreversible.

202
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,736
When misfortune continues,
people eventually become miserable.

203
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,997
Right, well...

204
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,503
You live that way forever.

205
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,515
ALMAGEL

206
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,313
There are two people in my life
at this moment,

207
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,649
but I can't help either of them.

208
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,279
Why can't people just do
what I want them to do?

209
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,868
Actually, they're not even human,
so why won't they just listen to me?

210
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,461
I have another friend who isn't human.

211
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,129
Hello, Ms. Ahn.

212
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,132
Please come on in.

213
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,134
CHEONGWON FOREST KINDERGARTEN

214
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,150
Do you want to see
who can hang upside down longer?

215
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,736
No.

216
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,202
Fine, whatever.

217
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,914
What time is it?

218
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,791
Don't know.

219
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,336
That's fine.

220
00:20:55,837 --> 00:21:01,093
I think this snack was better
when it came in the hexagonal packaging.

221
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,347
I agree. You think so too?

222
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,478
Jeong-hyeon slipped and fell
from this tree

223
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,398
and died before I was even born.

224
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,359
Although, I'm not 100 percent sure.

225
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,619
Doesn't your head hurt?

226
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,204
No, it doesn’t.

227
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,250
If she were in pain

228
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,504
or were a danger to others,
I'd have eliminated her.

229
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,223
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

230
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,268
I'll see you tomorrow Sae-rom.

231
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,771
Go have something delicious to eat today.

232
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,481
I should get going now.

233
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,694
I've been wondering
if you were my mom. Are you?

234
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,655
Now you're making things weird.

235
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,740
Right?

236
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,203
Your mom hasn’t been visiting lately?

237
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,248
Sometimes. She's an old lady now.

238
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,543
But, I’ve lost track of time these days.

239
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,129
What do you mean?

240
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,256
My mom came by yesterday,

241
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,633
but I'm not so sure.

242
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,969
I sometimes feel like she never existed.

243
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:32,267
A few days ago,
you and I were the same age,

244
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,521
so why aren't you today?

245
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,025
Mom...

246
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,570
What is a mom?

247
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,992
While some make a ruckus
when they depart this life,

248
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,831
some slowly melt away like soap

249
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,584
just like Jeong-hyeon.

250
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,561
Jeong-hyeon, I'm not your mom.

251
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,731
I'm...

252
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,572
It's fine even if you don't remember.

253
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,331
I'll be back tomorrow.

254
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,583
Okay, we'll play again tomorrow.

255
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,628
You don't even know what "tomorrow" means.

256
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,046
Do you remember

257
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,049
the fire that broke out
at the pub near our school?

258
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,635
Of course, I do.

259
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,394
The women who worked there
were trapped inside and they all died.

260
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,438
Right.

261
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,860
All of them turned into jelly

262
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,156
and stuck around the school
until I graduated.

263
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,788
They were all bald because of the fire.

264
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:00,999
I see.

265
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,377
One only had half of her face left,

266
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,589
one lost her legs,

267
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,342
and one only had her head left.

268
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,642
Every time they saw me, they begged me
to save them and to hear them out.

269
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,062
And they’d cling onto me.

270
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,691
I was so scared.

271
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,195
I can only imagine.

272
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,034
It wasn't them

273
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,870
that I was scared of.

274
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,669
But I was terrified of the fact

275
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,798
that I had to keep living like this.

276
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,721
If you have no choice
but to face something,

277
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,808
What other choice do you have
but to live it?

278
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:08,942
No.

279
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,445
I think I'll be able to help Hye-min

280
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,282
since a stomach removal is all she needs.

281
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,601
"I suggest you have another drink."

282
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:44,978
Also...

283
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,647
"Seo-chul-yang-gwan

284
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:54,321
mu-go-in."

285
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,492
It means that you won't find any friends
once you leave for the west.

286
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,425
If a stomach removal is all I need,

287
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,303
how is it going to happen?

288
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,056
There's a doctor.

289
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,185
I met her when I used to
work at a hospital, and she's trustworthy.

290
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,270
I see...

291
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,693
Isn't Ms. Ahn acting weird?

292
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,236
Right.

293
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:40,992
Be careful.

294
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,708
Will Hye-min listen to you though?

295
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,419
Of course.

296
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,171
I know

297
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,508
how much Hye-min wants to live.

298
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,262
How can you possibly be sure?

299
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,557
How am I sure?

300
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,186
Because that’s how I feel.

301
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,980
I want to

302
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,441
live everyday.

303
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,614
I want to live a normal life
just like everyone else.

304
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:35,964
Look at all these.

305
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,842
Aren't I the best?

306
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,180
I caught all of the mites at the school.

307
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,437
And?

308
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,021
You eat them all.

309
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,533
Then,

310
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,077
you'll be reborn.

311
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:13,084
You’ll have a stomach ache if you eat
on an empty stomach, so have this first.

312
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,171
But...

313
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,923
what about you?

314
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,844
I caught them for you, didn't I?

315
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,771
But I'm the one who has to eat them.

316
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,897
Right.

317
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,205
Open.

318
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,460
Why should I have to do all that?

319
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,672
You were born this way,
so who can you blame?

320
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,266
Then...

321
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,020
what about the school?

322
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,358
Hye-min,

323
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,030
don't you want to live a new life?

324
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,533
Of course, I do.

325
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,501
I'll find a way to protect the school,

326
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,171
so put your faith in me
and follow my lead.

327
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,061
Chew thoroughly before you swallow.

328
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,976
Do you feel more at ease now?

329
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,478
Yes.

330
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,659
Let's go.

331
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,591
I'm curious though.

332
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,679
Is there someone who keeps bringing you

333
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,307
back to life?

334
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:23,232
You know better than anyone
that no one will come to save us.

335
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,070
Right.

336
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,031
You're right.

337
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,454
Why are you disappointed
when you already knew this?

338
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,836
Ahn Eun-young.

339
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,884
Does it hurt a lot?

340
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,222
Yeah, it does.

341
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,313
Why haven't you asked me

342
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,232
how I died?

343
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,822
You’re really not going to ask me,
are you?

344
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,576
Did you live a life of crime
just like your dad?

345
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,453
No.

346
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:19,956
I died at work.

347
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,544
Well...

348
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:29,257
I left home and tried to make a living
for myself in any way possible.

349
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,509
It was a construction accident.

350
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,139
I extended the tower crane
to work on the upper floors

351
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,474
but it bent in a flash.

352
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,814
I know it sounds stupid,
but I always thought

353
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,359
that I'd be able to jump to safety
if anything like that happened.

354
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,331
But I froze in place even though I saw it
coming right at me.

355
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,628
The crane was probably worth more
than some worker,

356
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,506
so they were still using an old crane.

357
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,727
I saw that on the news,

358
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,857
but I didn't know that was you.

359
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,906
Did it hurt a lot?

360
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,452
There wasn't any time to feel pain.

361
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,590
Have I ever told you
what makes you so pretty?

362
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:54,717
No.

363
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,678
You've never said anything remotely close.

364
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,890
Right here.

365
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,975
At the corner of your forehead,

366
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,481
The hair there makes it look
as if your forehead is blurred.

367
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,733
What am I, a painting?

368
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,985
What's this about a blur?

369
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,623
You should quit your job at the school.

370
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,044
I want to quit, you know.

371
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,381
I want to quit everything.

372
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,094
Bad things will keep happening

373
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,012
and you'll end up getting hurt.

374
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,683
Still,

375
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,478
don't let it pull you down...

376
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,606
no matter what happens.

377
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,114
What can I do if I have no choice
but to face it?

378
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,408
I just have to live it out,

379
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,247
like how you couldn't avoid
the crane coming at you.

380
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,133
Thank you

381
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,760
for coming to see me, even for a moment.

382
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,596
Wait.

383
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,684
I feel like I can finally
shatter into pieces.

384
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,274
Eun-young, come with me.

385
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,532
I don't want to live this way either.

386
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,540
How could I leave with you though?

387
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,046
Take me there.

388
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,632
Take you where?

389
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,681
No! Where are you going?

390
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,648
Kang-sun!

391
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,754
The problem with you

392
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,924
is how you choose to express yourself.

393
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,760
What?

394
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,015
Instead of letting your life
be grim and dark,

395
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,893
you should make it adventurous
like a comic book.

396
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,147
Then the other kids won’t hate you.

397
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,276
What do you know about me anyway?

398
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,571
You told me that you see things
that look like my drawing.

399
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,165
You...

400
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,294
Did you actually believe what I said?

401
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,255
Was it a lie?

402
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,886
No.

403
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,472
Okay.

404
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,936
That's why I drew something for you.

405
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,400
Flip it from back to front.

406
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,262
This isn't how I usually draw,

407
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,931
so it might not look that good.

408
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,355
My problem isn't some story
in a comic book.

409
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,025
They're not that different.

410
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,319
I'm saying you should use weapons.

411
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,117
Don't hurt yourself
and have fun while you're at it.

412
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,871
Be someone who is loved by others.

413
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,191
How am I supposed to fight them alone
with this, Kang-sun?

414
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,703
Hey, Eun-young.

415
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,041
Has everything been well?

416
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,711
Of course.

417
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,632
I haven't heard from you in a while
so I wanted to know how you were.

418
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,680
Sorry.

419
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,144
I hope you're not sick or something.

420
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,482
I...

421
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,110
dreamed that I died.

422
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,614
That's a good dream.

423
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,826
It's fascinating.

424
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,204
It feels like
all my worries have vanished.

425
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,542
Well, I'm glad.

426
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,504
Want to meet up?

427
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,758
It's all right.

428
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,136
I'll just stop by your place sometime.

429
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,563
The truth is,

430
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,149
I can't see

431
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,026
jellies anymore since I woke up.

432
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,244
BASED ON THE SCHOOL NURSE FILES
BY CHUNG SE-RANG

433
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:41,663
