1
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:08,633
Doctor,

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,595
this patient doesn't have a belly button.

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,563
It's just too small for us to see.

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,986
Right. How can a person
not have a belly button?

5
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,702
Can a person's belly button
be this tiny though?

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,501
Yes, and it's fine not to have one.

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,964
Pass me the iodine.

8
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,182
The surgery was a success.

9
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,394
But Hye-min had this

10
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,396
in place of her stomach.

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,735
Take a look at this.

12
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,321
There are Chinese characters
engraved on it.

13
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,448
Guje.

14
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,039
GUJE: SAVING OTHERS IN TROUBLE

15
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,040
I see.

16
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,417
Take care then.

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,979
Shall we get going?

18
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,940
Sure.

19
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,950
ALMAGEL

20
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,015
A belly button.

21
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,894
I have one now.

22
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,406
Let's go then.

23
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,749
You shouldn’t eat spicy food
for the time being.

24
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,918
That includes chili flakes.

25
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,797
For three months,
eat small portions five times a day.

26
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,216
It's most important to eat slowly.

27
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,345
You'll have trouble with digestion,
so chew everything thoroughly.

28
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,764
Yes, Ms. Ahn.

29
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,895
Mr. Hong,

30
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,356
before I go back to the facility,

31
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,734
could I take a trip somewhere
further away?

32
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,652
Where would you like to go?

33
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:19,073
I'd like to go outside
my usual 5.38km radius for once.

34
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,158
What?

35
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,454
Just drive straight for now.

36
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,607
This is the place. Please stop.

37
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,698
This is...

38
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,617
the farthest I could go.

39
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,438
We can go now,

40
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,024
but slowly.

41
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,243
What could possibly be inside this jug?

42
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,101
Hey, what are you doing there?

43
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,394
Yes.

44
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,065
Come to think of it, this basement,

45
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,860
don't you think it'd be perfect to use
as a clubhouse?

46
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,656
What?

47
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,802
Right?

48
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,429
That's a great idea, isn't it?

49
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,347
Yes.

50
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,018
Everyone’s been going crazy trying to look
for a clubhouse.

51
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,021
Tell me about it.

52
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,712
Everyone's going to love this, right?

53
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,260
When did you live before this life?

54
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,681
It was back when
Mong-lyeon High School was being built.

55
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,646
The locals were worried about
the school being built on this ground.

56
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,649
Why were they worried?

57
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,360
Didn't your grandfather tell you?

58
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,405
It's because that’s where
the breathing hole is.

59
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,247
You know about that?

60
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,083
Of course I do.
I've lived all of my lives here.

61
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,587
In the past, there used to be a pond.

62
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:12,176
But people kept jumping into it,
which was why it was filled.

63
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,889
That place has a powerful aura.

64
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,977
Of course everyone was worried
that a school was being built on it.

65
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,022
The aura there is drawn to
the laughter of children.

66
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,819
Your grandfather wanted to channel
that aura.

67
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,530
That's why he was frowned on
by the locals.

68
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,243
He wanted to change the world
with Safe Happiness.

69
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,912
Chi-heup-hyeol e-gok-dae-un ga-ja-guk.

70
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,748
That's right.

71
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,502
Controlling the breathing
hole can turn luck to your favor

72
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,297
and allow you to control
the nation as you wish.

73
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,258
That is the goal of Safe Happiness.

74
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,221
That place appears ordinary
to those with powerful aura.

75
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,391
However, it draws in
those who have weak aura.

76
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,436
That's why people kept jumping in.

77
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,650
I believe it's just like how people
will keep looking for food

78
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,277
when they're hungry.

79
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,948
It's no place for a school then.

80
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,958
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

81
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,433
JUNE 30TH
AHN EUN-YOUNG

82
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,693
Why did you want to see me here?

83
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,010
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

84
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,101
AHN EUN-YOUNG, THE SCHOOL NURSE
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

85
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,770
I CAN NO LONGER BE OF SERVICE
AT MONG-LYEON HIGH SCHOOL

86
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,313
JUNE 30, 2019

87
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,815
AHN EUN-YOUNG

88
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,941
Hold on.

89
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,111
Why all of a sudden?

90
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,700
If you quit,

91
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,453
what about the school?

92
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,751
Ms. Ahn?

93
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,089
"I'm sorry about building a school
on top of a place like this."

94
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,808
Isn't that what you should be saying?

95
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,145
On behalf of your grandfather.

96
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,741
I'm sorry.

97
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,386
Lee Ji-hyeong.

98
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,224
It's been a while.

99
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,817
What are you looking at?

100
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,700
Fuck.

101
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,369
Isn't this weird?

102
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,581
What is?

103
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,457
The other kids.

104
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,378
What the fuck are you staring at?

105
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,758
I think it's me.

106
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,510
Why?

107
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,138
Because Radi and I are going out.

108
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,016
Unbelievable.

109
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,851
You two? Are you insane?

110
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:55,978
Lucky you.

111
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,441
You're all insane.

112
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,984
What's wrong with that?

113
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,820
She likes someone and that someone
happened to like her back.

114
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,155
You guys are lucky.

115
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,490
What a joke.

116
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,342
Ji-hyeong,

117
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,595
are you perhaps seeing someone too?

118
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,057
Although I doubt anyone would
date someone poor like you.

119
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,600
He's poor.

120
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,231
She's also dating a poor person.

121
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,651
You two will probably get AIDS.

122
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,861
-You bitch.
-You're sick.

123
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,879
I'll kill you!

124
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,948
We should quickly inform

125
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,618
the parents of the situation.

126
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,666
When the children are old enough
to know how to stay safe,

127
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,543
we can tell the parents then.

128
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,628
Homos...

129
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,714
should be dealt with at a young age.

130
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:47,965
It'll be easier to fix them.

131
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,385
I believe the correct term is
homosexuality.

132
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,099
Sexual preference isn't something
that needs fixing.

133
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,192
What's so funny?

134
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,487
What's going on?

135
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,615
Baek Hye-min and Radi

136
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,201
are a lesbian couple!

137
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,413
That's disgusting.

138
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,547
Next week, a new student will join
the 11th grade.

139
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,675
Which class should we
assign the student to?

140
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,431
I already have 30 students in my class.

141
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,851
It's the same for my class.

142
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,395
Ms. Kang, how about your class?

143
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,396
What?

144
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,440
What kind of a student is it?

145
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,443
What do you mean by
"what kind of a student"?

146
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,488
This new student's leg

147
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,615
is disabled.

148
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,020
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

149
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,773
You will be charged
for the following services.

150
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,112
Hello. You have reached
the voicemail service.

151
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,947
Press one to leave a voicemail

152
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,951
and press two to leave a contact number.

153
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:30,002
Please leave a message after the beep
and press the pound or the star key.

154
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,298
Ms. Ahn,
I'm having trouble contacting you.

155
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,307
I think we have to find
Ilgwang Sterilization.

156
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,646
The whole school's gone insane.

157
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,693
The students keep picking fights

158
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,531
and the teachers keep laughing.

159
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,706
There's no one here I can talk to anymore.

160
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,047
I'm on my way to my grandfather right now.

161
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,174
There may be someone who could help me

162
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,927
at that fishing site in Busan.

163
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,562
I know I shouldn't be saying this,

164
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,194
but I liked it better
when my grandfather was around.

165
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,407
Now, I have no one.

166
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,039
Now that you're gone,

167
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,626
life is boring.

168
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,173
Once again,

169
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,344
I'm all alone.

170
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,102
Message deleted.

171
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,465
MR. HONG, I'M SORRY

172
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,761
BUT I CAN'T SEE JELLIES ANYMORE

173
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,890
Yesterday afternoon,
at Mong-lyeon High School in Yongsan,

174
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,810
students and faculty members
mysteriously fell into a coma.

175
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,811
The city health center

176
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,105
is currently conducting
an epidemiological investigation.

177
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,983
The school has been closed indefinitely

178
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,194
and 12 faculty members
as well as over 40 students

179
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,113
-were taken to two nearby hospitals.
-Over here!

180
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,573
-Please help.
-The Health Authority

181
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,034
will arrive on scene
to conduct a prompt investigation--

182
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,703
The Seoul Education Office
will investigate

183
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,539
Mong-lyeon High School
and the Mong-lyeon Foundation.

184
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,918
The authorities will look into matters

185
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,629
not just regarding the current status

186
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
but also the concealment
of past accidents.

187
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,717
The shut-down of the school
will also be discussed.

188
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,135
This is MBC News...

189
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,848
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

190
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,851
You will be charged
for the following services.

191
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,072
You have exceeded the time limit.

192
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,472
MR. HONG

193
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,308
Look. The fishing site has been abandoned.

194
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,062
I doubt I'll be able
to find Ilgwang Sterilization.

195
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,316
Did you check the photo?

196
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,026
Yes.

197
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,404
Someone stole all the aura.

198
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,906
I asked around,

199
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,285
and I don’t think
the school belongs to Safe Happiness.

200
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,331
Safe Happiness is trying
to buy the school.

201
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,917
And the foundation wants to sell it.

202
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,672
The school is nothing but trouble
and doesn't generate any profit.

203
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,634
No way.

204
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,345
The old man
is also a member of Safe Happiness.

205
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,306
What?

206
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,476
Hold on. I stole some maps
from Mackenzie's house.

207
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,942
Busan...

208
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,452
Busan.

209
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,205
Namsandong.

210
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,753
Su.

211
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,589
The fishing site was their doing.

212
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,549
Are you sure?

213
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:10,967
Yes.

214
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:15,764
Safe Happiness is going
to target the school next.

215
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,974
Then I was right.

216
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,602
It's weird though.

217
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,439
Mackenzie is a member of Safe Happiness.

218
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,901
So why wasn't he able to
enter the basement?

219
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,322
Because it's locked?

220
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,160
No. With his abilities,
there’s no way he couldn’t have entered.

221
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,259
ILGWANG STERILIZATION

222
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,811
RECIPIENT
HWA SU

223
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,333
ILGWANG STERILIZATION
PRESIDENT HWA SU

224
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,464
I found Ilgwang Sterilization.

225
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,593
Eun-young,

226
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,096
how long has it been?

227
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,182
Mackenzie chose not to enter.

228
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,809
I missed you a lot.

229
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,647
It's not that he couldn't.
He just chose not to.

230
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,820
And Ilgwang Sterilization couldn't enter
because of Safe Happiness.

231
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,575
They're waiting for the chance to keep
the school for themselves.

232
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,705
That's why I've been managing it,

233
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,042
so that whoever takes over the basement

234
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,794
can use it for their best interest.

235
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,632
After Mr. Hong Jin-beom died,

236
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,760
Ilgwang Sterilization
was struck off the list.

237
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,221
They kept believing that the school
belonged to them.

238
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,181
SAFE HAPPINESS

239
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,224
Mr. Hong Jin-beom was eliminated as well.

240
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,519
The school is ours.

241
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,733
There's no need to get in the way
between families, right?

242
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,322
We need Hong In-pyo.

243
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,410
So stop being a smart ass
and come back to us.

244
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,871
Well,

245
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,832
my abilities are gone now.

246
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,595
Just come.

247
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,099
If you do, we can fix that for you.

248
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,435
Did you take the fishing site
in Busan too?

249
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,645
Yes.

250
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,442
Don't lay a finger on Mr. Hong In-pyo.

251
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,823
Don't be like that. You'll regret it.

252
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,035
You know that

253
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,454
family is all you have left in the end.

254
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,043
They all needed In-pyo.

255
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,962
Move.

256
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,382
Because they need him
to harness the power of the school.

257
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,135
It's because

258
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,805
In-pyo has a forcefield.

259
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,270
SAFE HAPPINESS

260
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,189
In-pyo and I are stuck
in the middle of a fight

261
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,109
that will only end
when either one of them dies.

262
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,995
How could you do this to me?

263
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,415
ILGWANG STERILIZATION
PRESIDENT HWA SU

264
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,422
HWA SU

265
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,064
What is it? Did you find anything?

266
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,028
Yes, I think I did.

267
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,615
I think I found Ilgwang Sterilization.

268
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,660
My goodness. What do we do now?

269
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,329
Why did you introduce me to the school?

270
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,296
I wanted you to manage
the school's basement.

271
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,007
Because I can't go in yet.

272
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,094
I refuse to take part in your war.

273
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,930
Because...

274
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,391
I'm not one of you anymore.

275
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,102
Don't be silly.

276
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,230
You are still one of us.

277
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,314
No.

278
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,859
Not anymore.

279
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,947
It's embarrassing.

280
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,368
You're all so weird.

281
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,372
Right, of course.

282
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:21,045
You can hate me all you want
but don't be embarrassed.

283
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,924
You're family too, you know.

284
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,097
You need a family, don't you?

285
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,186
-Eun-young.
-Yes?

286
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:17,518
You're the weirdest one in the world.

287
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,659
If you have the time,
stay at the school a while longer.

288
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,953
Shouldn't we at least stop Safe Happiness?

289
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,622
Isn't that right?

290
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,546
The taboo rope in the basement
needs to be tied securely,

291
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,923
but I still can't enter.

292
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,007
Understand?

293
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,483
You're even weirder than I am.

294
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,999
Hello.

295
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,712
Welcome.

296
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,897
Are you all right?

297
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,652
Why did you want to see me here?

298
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,303
What's all this?

299
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,390
Eerie, isn't it?

300
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:43,975
Yes.

301
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,435
They are,

302
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,814
but I love them.

303
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,613
What on earth are these things?

304
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,160
That's me in a nutshell.

305
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,131
Do you have the keys to the basement?

306
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,259
Why the basement?

307
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,512
We should destroy the school

308
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,806
while the students aren't here.

309
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,731
I can't protect them anymore,

310
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,776
now that my abilities are gone.

311
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,323
The kids will keep jumping off the roof

312
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,826
and some might die
because of all the laughing.

313
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,539
How can we destroy the school?

314
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,044
By opening up the Apji Stone.

315
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,118
I guess I can't even charge
your aura anymore.

316
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,415
Instead of closing it like last time,

317
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,960
let’s just keep it open.

318
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,422
We'll let everyone know that
this isn't a suitable place

319
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,467
for a school.

320
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,679
We're going to make a mess of things.

321
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,730
Sure, let's go.

322
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,150
Really?

323
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,151
Yes.

324
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:02,947
Lead the way.

325
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,918
If we enter, we might not
be able to come out.

326
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,546
So?

327
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,317
Wait.

328
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,362
Hold on.

329
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,198
The flashlight...

330
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,952
Wait for me.

331
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,801
I had a friend, you see.

332
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,099
I know.

333
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:57,061
You bragged about a friend
who's like family to you.

334
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,068
But not anymore.

335
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,738
Why not?

336
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,824
Did you two have a fight?

337
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,707
It's silly to argue with a friend
at our age.

338
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,009
I love how

339
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,179
I don't see jellies anymore.

340
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,895
I love being normal.

341
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,989
I'm sorry.

342
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,451
I find being normal boring.

343
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,165
Unless it's something bad,

344
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,295
it's better to be weird than ordinary.

345
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,303
I liked that my grandfather

346
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,764
was weird,

347
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,644
but he was bad.

348
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,702
APJI STONE

349
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,795
Are you...

350
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,675
going to make a run for it without me?

351
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,052
No.

352
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,179
Let’s leave together.

353
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,516
Really?

354
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,602
Can I trust you?

355
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,779
Damn it.

356
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,532
Wait. Hold on!

357
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,533
Gosh.

358
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,085
Sorry about that. I wasn't ready.

359
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,795
No!

360
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,089
Shit.

361
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,344
Fuck.

362
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,141
Fuck.

363
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,605
We're fucked.

364
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,148
What?

365
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,595
What's wrong?

366
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,162
Wait. Hold on!

367
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,041
You said we’d leave together!

368
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,420
Not again!

369
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:08,914
Damn it.

370
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,137
Goddamn it!

371
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,504
Seriously...

372
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,646
Ms. Ahn!

373
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,693
Ms. Ahn!

374
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,742
Ms. Ahn!

375
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,752
Ms. Ahn!

376
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,671
Where are you?

377
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,551
Ms. Ahn!

378
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,761
Ahn Eun-young!

379
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,683
Mr. Hong!

380
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,768
We're really doomed this time!

381
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:44,027
The world without jellies was
truly special.

382
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,950
It was peaceful and relaxing.

383
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:58,500
All the colors were harmonious,
and all the shapes were perfect.

384
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,509
Although it didn't last long,
I was truly happy.

385
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,723
I doubt that I was designed
by anyone in particular,

386
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,520
but I'd like to ask the following
if my maker does exist,

387
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,442
"Why did you hide

388
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,112
such a beautiful world from me?"

389
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,538
Kang-sun said

390
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,459
that I should just live it
if I can't avoid it.

391
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,338
Who's Kang-sun?

392
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,552
A friend.

393
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,014
He died.

394
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,808
I see.

395
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,984
We'll ban the laughing exercises first.

396
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,781
What about Safe Happiness though?

397
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,911
In-pyo.

398
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,582
Hong In-pyo.

399
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,380
Hong In-pyo.

400
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,006
You're here early.

401
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:33,470
The school building was restored
and faculty members were replaced.

402
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,183
A new season greeted us

403
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,520
and the students came back
as healthy as ever.

404
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,486
Of course I always dream
of quitting this school,

405
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,948
but it's not like I have
anywhere else to go.

406
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,995
At least, here at the school,

407
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,081
the things I can do

408
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,542
feel rather meaningful.

409
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,340
Is this what people call "worthwhile"?

410
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,489
"Jang...

411
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:35,949
Re..."

412
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,994
No, it's Radi. With an "A."

413
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,791
JANG RADI

414
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,335
All right, Radi.

415
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,546
It's short for "Radical One."

416
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,258
Do you see this?

417
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,515
All right, Radi.

418
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,017
What's bothering you?

419
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,438
It's not me who's in pain.

420
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,650
My mom sees ghosts.

421
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,371
Can you come to my house sometime?

422
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,378
Your house?

423
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,730

We're all going to die
Let's quickly run away
