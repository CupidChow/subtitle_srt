1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,803
You have no idea
how confusing it was at first.

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,891
I thought I had an extra pair of eyelids.

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,565
One that allowed me to see
a special world of my own.

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,567
Eun-young.

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,486
Eun-young.

6
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,575
What does this drawing look like to you?

7
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,872
Eun-young?

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,667
What's wrong?

9
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,627
Do you feel uncomfortable?

10
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,883
Is the drawing scary?

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,139
Can you not tell what it is?

12
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,103
What is it?

13
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,064
Do you see jellies again?

14
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,195
My mom hoped that I never found out,

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,489
but I gradually came to realize

16
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,618
that all living things excrete jellies.

17
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,291
Sometimes, even after one passes,
one's jelly is left behind.

18
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,589
But they usually erode into bits
before they can hurt anyone.

19
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,261
Just like the traces of slime
snails leave behind,

20
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,432
jellies are the traces
of people's desires.

21
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,817
Don't worry too much, sir.

22
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:58,910
It's just that she's at an age
where she needs a mother.

23
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,913
Thank you.

24
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,792
-Eun-young.
-Stop. Eun-young, don't.

25
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,920
You're at an age where you need a mother.

26
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,048
Eun-young.

27
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,344
Don't cry.

28
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,849
Smile.

29
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,726
That's how you'll be happy.

30
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,937
All right?

31
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,524
Mom!

32
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,236
The world I see is a secret.

33
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,661
Mom!

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,835
Mom!

35
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,754
-Mom!
-And I...

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:02,056
was destined from birth
to help others in secret.

37
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,725
Fuck.

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,444
-Eight.
-Eight.

39
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,655
-Seven, six, five,
-Seven, six, five,

40
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,535
-four, three, two, one.
-four, three, two, one.

41
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,287
Stop them.

42
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,268
I'm Ahn Eun-young, the school nurse.

43
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,729
BASED ON THE SCHOOL NURSE FILES
BY CHUNG SE-RANG

44
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,321
-…getting better, getting better!
-…getting better, getting better!

45
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,073
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

46
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,908
-getting better, getting better!
-getting better, getting better!

47
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,994
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

48
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,079
-getting better, getting better!
-getting better, getting better!

49
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,206
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

50
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,083
-getting better, getting better!
-getting better, getting better!

51
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,876
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,753
-getting better, getting better!
-getting better, getting better!

53
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,047
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

54
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,174
-getting better, getting better!
-getting better, getting better!

55
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,634
-My body's getting better,
-My body's getting better,

56
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,428
-I started working at this school
-getting better, getting better!

57
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,764
-a little less than a month ago.
-My body's getting better, getting better,

58
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,182
-The students here
-getting better!

59
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,768
-are healthy and they receive good grades.
-My body's getting better, getting better,

60
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,686
-getting better!
-getting better!

61
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,354
-At a glance,
-My body's getting better,

62
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,481
-they all seem happy.
-getting better, getting better!

63
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,359
Lastly, for 15 seconds,

64
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,903
let's laugh out loud
at the top of our lungs.

65
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,287
They looked happy at least until noon.

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,667
SCHOOL MORAL
LAUGHING WILL BRING GOOD FORTUNE

67
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,338
Hello.

68
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,007
Welcome.

69
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,732
Jeez. Whatever.

70
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,317
Let's go.

71
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,777
-Okay.
-Let's get going.

72
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,694
Hold on.

73
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,613
Don't you dare drop that janggu.

74
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,074
Okay, let's go.
Let's bring the house down!

75
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,537
Aren't you coming?

76
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,164
Will Jellyfish accept it?

77
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,666
What about Jellyfish?

78
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,376
Accept what?

79
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,504
Hoop Squid
is going to ask her out at lunch.

80
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,089
We need to go support him.

81
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,882
Jellyfish must be single again.

82
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,926
What's up with her?

83
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,096
She's a fan of Hoop Squid.

84
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,141
Why does it have to be Jellyfish though?

85
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,559
Why do you think?

86
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,520
Because it's Jellyfish.

87
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,355
She'd go out with everyone except him.

88
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,109
But Hoop Squid? God damn.

89
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,944
Fuck, no.

90
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,451
She's so damn loud.

91
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,828
Yeah.

92
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,173
Have you seen Jellyfish?

93
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,216
No.

94
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,178
Jellyfish?

95
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,389
Where's Jellyfish?

96
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,765
Jellyfish isn't here.

97
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,183
-She's not here.
-Shit.

98
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,265
Don't fool around and get them in line.

99
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,520
Place the candles at 90 degrees.

100
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,106
You'll be punched once
if the heart is out of shape,

101
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,317
and twice if you knock over a candle.

102
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,155
You'll all be rounded up today
if she rejects me.

103
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,740
-Got it.
-Got it.

104
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,953
Is Jellyfish coming?

105
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,875
Stand up straight and answer me!

106
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,297
Sung A-ra will be right over, Captain.

107
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,844
"She'll be right over, Captain."

108
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,354
SUNG A-RA

109
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,066
The basketball team?

110
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,108
Hello, sir!

111
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,945
Basketball Team,
what do you think you're doing?

112
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,739
-You can't block people's paths like this.
-He's right.

113
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,075
-We should move it up the path.
-Clean all this.

114
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,577
-You're blocking the road.
-Yes, captain!

115
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,538
You're lighting them up too?

116
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,915
And what if it leads to a fire?

117
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,708
Sorry. But there will be no fire.

118
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,793
The boys are in charge

119
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,294
-of three each anyway.
-Hoop Squid?

120
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,464
-Yes.
-Are you kidding me?

121
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,884
-Can we go somewhere else, then?
-What the hell is he up to?

122
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,011
I told you to clean them up,
not move them elsewhere.

123
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,138
We've got this covered, one, two!

124
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,620
Fuck, what the hell is this?

125
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,417
Where did you feel it sting?

126
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,211
The second floor of the central staircase.

127
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,218
You didn't see anything weird?

128
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,596
What were you doing?

129
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,432
Can I go now?

130
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,392
No.

131
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,353
It could be toxic.

132
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,023
You should leave school early
and go to the hospital.

133
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,651
Name and class?

134
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,154
I'm Oh Seung-gwon,
11th grade of class six.

135
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,824
I can't leave school early today.

136
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,285
I might not get another chance.

137
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,746
A chance to do what?

138
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,833
All right.
I'll leave school in just a moment.

139
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
OH SEUNG-GWON

140
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,129
I'm good, right?

141
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,380
Wait, I'm not done yet.

142
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,244
Sometimes, there are jellies
made of heavy thoughts and worries.

143
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,166
They must be eliminated
if they harm others.

144
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,297
I can shoot 22 rounds of BB bullets

145
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,549
and swing my plastic sword
for 15 minutes per day.

146
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,888
My fingernails have been dyed with balsam
to fend off evil spirits.

147
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,976
If I use the Egyptian Ankh,
the Vatican rosary,

148
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,356
prayer beads from Buseok Temple,
and a talisman from Kyoto Shrine,

149
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,817
I can shoot up to 28 bullets per day.

150
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,406
I doubt I'll ever need them though.

151
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,075
I'd probably die before then.

152
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,916
Radi, have you seen Jellyfish?

153
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,960
I just got here.

154
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,129
I see.

155
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,381
Jellyfish is on her way down
from the roof!

156
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,674
She's coming!

157
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,384
Run, run, run!

158
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,847
It's going to start soon.

159
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,012
THE BASEMENT MUST BE DISINFECTED
EVERY 6 MONTHS

160
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,805
I want to ask you something.

161
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,307
What is it?

162
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,641
What do you like about me?

163
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,810
Be nice and I'll tell you.

164
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,861
Come on. Just tell me already.
What do you like about me?

165
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,030
From head to toe.

166
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,115
Me too.

167
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,659
Are you wearing perfume?
You smell incredible.

168
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,619
It's just my skin.

169
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,829
What? You're killing me.

170
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,374
Why do you smell so good?

171
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,667
Because I'm in love.

172
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,837
Me too.

173
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,923
I love you.

174
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,595

178
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,034
Sir, I've been preparing for this moment
for the past year.

179
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,329
I've loved this one woman all year.

180
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,122
If you allow me to do this,

181
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,334
I will lead the basketball team
to win the championship cup

182
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,211
and make Mong-lyeon High School proud.

183
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,630
Sir, please let me do this.

184
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,553
What if I don't?

185
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,139
Sir, you know what it's like
to be in love.

11TH GRADE, CLASS 6 HOMEROOM TEACHER
HONG IN-PYO, CHINESE CHARACTERS TEACHER

191
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,837
Excuse me.

192
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,216
You're the homeroom teacher
of 11th grade, class six, right?

193
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,720
SCHOOL NURSE AHN EUN-YOUNG

194
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,680
Hello, Ms. Ahn.

195
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,196
I'm looking for a student of yours,
Oh Seung-gwon.

196
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,700
He's a tall and slender boy
with a small head.

197
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,037
He's a bit stubborn, which is why I must
force him to leave school early.

198
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:21,503
You want him to leave school early
because he's stubborn?

199
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,215
What on earth are you talking about?

200
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,487
Is there something wrong with your leg?

201
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,536
It's odd

202
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,665
seeing someone like you
with an injury like that.

203
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,502
I need to find Seung-gwon first.

204
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,170
His wound is swelling exponentially,

205
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,756
and he'll soon be sick with a fever.

206
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,343
I don't know what stung him,
but it seems bad.

207
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,015
Can you please find him and ask him
to come see me?

208
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,810
Right now. Hurry. Move!

209
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,148
-Where the hell is he? Shit.
-Hello, Mr. Hong.

210
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:30,197
MONG-LYEON GYMNASIUM

211
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,907
Have you seen Seung-gwon?

212
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,077
Seung-gwon!

213
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,830
-Hello, Ms. Ahn.
-Hello, Ms. Ahn.

214
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,511
Hey, where are you going?

215
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,610
Seung-gwon,

216
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,863
are you waiting for someone?

217
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,680
Hello, Ms. Ahn.

218
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:27,147
RESTRICTED AREA
DO NOT ENTER

219
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,499
Damn it.

220
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,674
I don't have time for this.

221
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,447
Hey, have you seen Oh Seung-gwon?

222
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,785
Oh Seung-gwon!

223
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
Sir.

224
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,337
Can I borrow the key to the basement?

225
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,132
What for, Ms. Ahn?

226
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,594
Kids have been coming to me all day
with irritations and itches.

227
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,180
It turns out they're all students
from the club room downstairs,

228
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,140
so I was hoping to check out the basement.

229
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:48,228
But Mr. Hong is in charge
of the basement key.

230
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,521
Mr. Hong In-pyo?

231
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,732
Yes, the Chinese Characters teacher.

232
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,651
The homeroom teacher
for 11th grade, class six?

233
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,611
Yes.

234
00:19:56,069 --> 00:20:00,574
He’s the grandson of the school's founder.

235
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,034
He's the chairman's grandson.

236
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,370
I see. No wonder.

237
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,416
I doubt Mr. Hong can help though.

238
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,128
Ever since the chairman
passed away last year,

239
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,339
no one has been able
to open the basement door.

240
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,175
Why not?

241
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,344
There's this sterilization company.

242
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,596
They used to manage
the basement for the school,

243
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,432
but I think they went bankrupt.

244
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,809
We haven't heard from them
for about a year.

245
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,229
ILGWANG STERILIZATION

246
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,402
Damn it.

247
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,522
-Hey, In-gyeong.
-Yes?

248
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,648
Have you seen Seung-gwon?

249
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,526
The one in class one or class six?

250
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,446
I'm asking you because you're in my class.

251
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,449
I think the Seung-gwon in class six
went that way.

252
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,284
Outside?

253
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,621
You got sauce on your lips.

254
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,820
What...

255
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,841
Wait, the lock...

256
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,428
Fuck you all!

257
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,434
My gosh!

258
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,690
Ms. Ahn?

259
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,569
Ms. Ahn?

260
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,619
What are you doing here?

261
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,789
It's all the rage these days.

262
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,459
It's Zumba.

263
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,752
In here?

264
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,343
I didn't want the kids to see me.

265
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,345
Then you should do it at home.

266
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,347
How am I supposed to do Zumba at home?

267
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,772
What about Seung-gwon then?

268
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,952
It's hard to explain,
but I'm looking for something.

269
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,038
Jellyfish.

270
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,707
Hey, you're here.

271
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,557
I came to get my earphones
you borrowed yesterday.

272
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,518
Gosh, I forgot.

273
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,187
Did you come all the way up here for that?

274
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,734
Are you all right?

275
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,529
You're sweating.

276
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,738
I'm fine.

277
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,615
It's because I've been running.

278
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,575
The reason Seung-gwon is sick is--

279
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,868
Because of the basement?

280
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,430
If you don't find anything,
you'll be fired.

281
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,768
I wanted to tell you something.

282
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,286
I've been meaning to tell you
for quite a while.

283
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:46,956
Seung-gwon, what's wrong?

284
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,083
Are you sick?

285
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,925
Maybe not.

286
00:27:58,676 --> 00:27:59,511
I'm all right.

287
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,221
A-ra!

288
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,727
You said you were coming.
Why are you doing this to me?

289
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,855
Everyone's looking for you.

290
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,192
Don't go.

291
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,276
Hurry.

292
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,778
I can't just not go.

293
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,987
Just don't.

294
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,325
I'll be right back, so stay here.

295
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,327
Come on!

296
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,504
-Come on.
-Sorry. Thanks for the earphones.

297
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,588
He's going to kill me.

298
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,925
Damn it.

299
00:28:56,025 --> 00:29:00,029
ILGWANG STERILIZATION

300
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,835
What is this place?

301
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,138
What is it?

302
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,978
Is this your first time down here?

303
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,605
Yes.

304
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,555
My goodness.

305
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,022
We should head back.

306
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,775
Why? We already made it this far.

307
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,111
It’d be a shame to turn back now.

308
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,948
Damn, this place is endless.

309
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,692
Mr. Hong.

310
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,235
Yes?

311
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,574
Why did you become a teacher?

312
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,661
You could've done
something more with your life.

313
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,789
It was my grandfather's lifelong wish.

314
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,375
Me being a teacher here.

315
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,836
I see.

316
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,768
As the school nurse,

317
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,856
I rarely get to meet the other teachers.

318
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,316
Right.

319
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,861
So I was surprised when I met you earlier.

320
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,492
Saying this might make me seem weird,

321
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,370
but frankly speaking,

322
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,582
you have a particular aura about you.

323
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,795
You give a good first impression.

324
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,365
Are you...

325
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,162
interested in the mystic arts?

326
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,627
I got him good.

327
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,478
She's crazy, isn't she?

328
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,735
Taboo ropes.

329
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,862
When was the school founded?

330
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,782
In 1976.

331
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,576
It used to be a girl's school

332
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,204
but it turned into a co-ed school
the year I was admitted.

333
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,582
I see. You're an alumnus.

334
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,462
I guess that makes sense

335
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,589
since your grandfather built it.

336
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,798
Could you hold this?

337
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,551
A-ra. Thank you for being here with me
on this beautiful day.

338
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,222
A-ra, I need to tell you something.

339
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:03,976
Today will be our first day as a couple.

340
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:14,445
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

341
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,365
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

342
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:47,436
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

343
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,525
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

344
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,979
APJI STONE

345
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,522
"Apji Stone"?

346
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,321
Wait, the "ji" hear means
pond and not land.

347
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,450
Did this place use to be a pond?

348
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,872
It looks like I'm all out.

349
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,294
The dampness of ponds
can be bad for your health.

350
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,132
Why does such a place exist?

351
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,691
APJI STONE

352
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,652
I think we should go now.

353
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm certain there's something
written on the back.

354
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,325
Don't flip it, damn it!

355
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,542
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

356
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,587
What the hell?

357
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,488
-Move!
-Are you all right?

358
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,698
Sir!

359
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,325
Hurry, get a teacher!

360
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,745
-What the hell?
-Ye-na?

361
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,541
-Move, you moron.
-Ye-na?

362
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,926
MONG-LYEON GYMNASIUM

363
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,686
Guys!

364
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,659
What the hell?

365
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,619
What the hell is that?
Why are you all running?

366
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,997
This way!

367
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,665
What...

368
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,423
Hey!

369
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,383
Shit!

370
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,230
Mic test.

371
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,607
One!

372
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,902
All students return to your class rooms!
Stay where you are!

373
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,862
Do not panic!

374
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,700
You will stay there
until the teachers tell you otherwise.

375
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,828
-Until the teachers say otherwise,
-Seung-gwon!

376
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,663
do not move.

377
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,415
Keep it together

378
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,667
and let's do the laughing exercise.

379
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,669
Stay where you are, children.

380
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,923
Seung-gwon.

381
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,222
Ms. Ahn?

382
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,566
Where did she go?

383
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,727
Seung-gwon!

384
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,816
Seung-gwon!

385
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,739
"Ja-go-shi-ji..."

386
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,492
-From old times, this pond...
-"bu-sil."

387
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,036
"Jeong..."

388
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,455
"in-so-ja."

389
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,623
...was where young people
who lost their lovers...

390
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,625
"Yi-so..."

391
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,336
-...threw themselves in.
-"tu-sin."

392
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:18,267
However, their numbers have been
on the rise recently...

393
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,274
I said come over here.

394
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,988
...and bodies were

395
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,533
thrown in the pond...

396
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,327
"Wi-gi-eo-cha..."

397
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,245
...disguised as a suicide.

398
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,872
"gi-pye..."

399
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,292
"sim."

400
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,314
To make things worse,

401
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,484
fishes, toads, and lizards

402
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,695
that fed on the corpses grew bigger.

403
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,243
Hey!

404
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,797
That is why the authorities ordered
the pond to be filled.

405
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,723
Don't do it!

406
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,812
Those that grew fat
by feeding on the flesh of men

407
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,023
could be destroyed
by torching their throats.

408
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,052
RESTRICTED AREA
DO NOT ENTER

409
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,473
Don't do it!

410
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,036
-No!
-Seung-gwon!

411
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,709
Get down!

412
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,389
BASED ON THE SCHOOL NURSE FILES
BY CHUNG SE-RANG
