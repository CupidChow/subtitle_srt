1
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,537
No.

2
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,261
Move.

3
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,510
Class six is
Min-u and Wan-su's class, right?

4
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,386
Yes.

5
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,805
How many are there?

6
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,890
Around 16 students stayed behind to study.

7
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:39,891
I knew it.

8
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,226
They're all crying.

9
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,020
-Why?
-They won't tell me.

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,814
I don't know why they're in pain.

11
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,441
It's a good thing I stayed late today.

12
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,026
-Move!
-Nurse Ahn is here.

13
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:50,944
Move it!

14
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,862
Careful.

15
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,873
A-ra, take the kids
who aren't sick outside.

16
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,836
Take the kids outside.

17
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,921
-Okay.
-Guys, Ms. Ahn said we should leave.

18
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,548
-Everybody out! Come on.
-Come on. Hey.

19
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,092
-Hurry on out.
-Move it.

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,970
-Hurry!
-Hurry out!

21
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,973
Hurry on out. There you go. Come on.

22
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,393
Close the door.

23
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,665
Did you go cushion hunting?

24
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,379
Did you really think they would
help you get into college?

25
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,426
Mom!

26
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,930
Mom!

27
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,440
Mom!

28
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,752
Mom!

29
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,797
Move!

30
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,484
GEUP-GEUP-YEO-WUL-RYEONG
IT WILL COME TO PASS QUICKLY

31
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,490
SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

32
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,596
PLAN 3. CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE

33
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:52,060
LET'S TIE THE ARMPIT HAIR

34
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,777
That's nice.

35
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,528
Keep at it.

36
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,197
It might outlive me.

37
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,038
I hear that when tortoises
get an eye disease

38
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,623
-their eyes get red--
-Min-u, Wan-su!

39
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,542
Hong In-pyo asked you both
to come to the nurse's office.

40
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,377
-Why?
-Why?

41
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,754
Beats me.

42
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,714
Fuck.

43
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,758
I wonder what it's about.

44
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,472
Damn it.

45
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,561
Can I spray this on myself?

46
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,606
-It's better than nothing.
-No.

47
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,609
Let's go.

48
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,569
Hey, what's that?

49
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,709
Come in.

50
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,799
NURSE'S OFFICE

51
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,360
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

52
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,294
We're doomed if this doesn't work.

53
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,046
It has to work.

54
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,591
Otherwise, one of us
will have to give them a bikini wax.

55
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,429
No, not a bikini wax.
You’ll have to tie their hair.

56
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,322
DRAGONFLY KNOT

57
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,040
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

58
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,677
NURSE'S OFFICE

59
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,070
Ms. Ahn.

60
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,865
I didn’t know you worked so late.

61
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,826
What about you?

62
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,703
I had some work left to do.

63
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,163
I run the Gardening Club, you see.

64
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,793
Why is the nurse's office
under construction?

65
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,547
Actually, I'm in the middle
of an important surgery.

66
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,215
I see.

67
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,517
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

68
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,830
Jeez, I really hope this ends
at their armpits.

69
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,592
He should be awake by now.

70
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,688
I wonder though.

71
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,567
Whatever connection they have,

72
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,028
do we have the right to end it?

73
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,741
Isn't that another form of violence?

74
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,703
As teachers,
we should do what's best for them

75
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,914
while respecting their wishes.

76
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,416
Fuck. Just graduate already.

77
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,433
Me too.

78
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,518
-Right?
-Yes.

79
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,521
I suddenly have a surge of energy.

80
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,439
-Right?
-I feel like I can do anything.

81
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,650
-I think I can even go mountain climbing.
-Really?

82
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,528
-It's not like that for me but...
-I doubt anyone will die anytime soon.

83
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,155
My throat feels fresh.

84
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,954
Please come on in.

85
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,208
Guys, let's push the desks back.

86
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,135
Right foot.

87
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,929
Right foot.

88
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,681
Right foot.

89
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,809
Do you want to step down or keep going?

90
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,811
I want to step down.

91
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,063
No, I'll keep going.

92
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,732
You bum.

93
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,653
How can you be a starter
when you don't even pay tuition?

94
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,160
Come down,

95
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,996
you poor piece of shit.

96
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,397
Finally.

97
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,817
Now pack up your things and get lost.

98
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,328
-We didn't do anything.
-Bastards.

99
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,497
-Just go.
-Let's go.

100
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,131
Are you all right?

101
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,793
No matter where you live,
schools are always shit.

102
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,753
Right?

103
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,215
And what’s wrong with being shitty?

104
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,970
Let me grant you a favor.

105
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,769
I will grant you a favor.

106
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,856
Anything?

107
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,024
Of course.

108
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,031
As if.

109
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,956
Think about it.

110
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,017
Did you meet the one you’re destined for?

111
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
What?

112
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,771
I'm talking about you.

113
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,233
I think you met
the one who you're destined to be with.

114
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,194
And who's that?

115
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,286
You have tough competition.

116
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:22,249
Someone else wants that person badly.

117
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,917
You better be careful.

118
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,586
He’s your destiny.

119
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,004
So who is that person?

120
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,717
Is it the Chinese characters teacher?

121
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,433
My goodness, Eun-young.

122
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,851
You...

123
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,108
I’m going to live alone.

124
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,738
LEE JI-HYEONG: CONTUSION

125
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,077
Ji-hyeong,

126
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,039
how did you get hurt?

127
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,791
I fell down the stairs.

128
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,302
You tumbled on your own?

129
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,263
Yes.

130
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,975
Someone beat you to a pulp again.

131
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,780
Thank you.

132
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,196
Did you see Ji-hyeong's face?

133
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,117
Yes, I did.

134
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,995
By the looks of it,

135
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,539
the basketball team ganged up on him.

136
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,960
No way. He said he fell down the stairs.

137
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,337
No, that’s not true.

138
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,090
The team said that Ji-hyeong quit,

139
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,593
but he never would have.

140
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,597
Then why did the team say that he did?

141
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,393
Because if they get in trouble,
the entire team could be suspended.

142
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,106
At the end of the month,
they have a game with Haemun High School.

143
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,401
Coaches from university teams
and professional teams will be there,

144
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,695
so the competition between the kids
has crossed the line.

145
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,281
It's abnormal.

146
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,118
Then why did Ji-hyeong lie to me?

147
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,330
Because he wants to keep
playing basketball.

148
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,626
I should go and teach the whole team
a lesson or something.

149
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,420
Mr. Hong!

150
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,547
Let's play soccer together.

151
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,759
Join us.

152
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,136
Play soccer with us.

153
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,804
Come on. Join us.

154
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,306
We need another player.

155
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,433
-But my leg...
-What about your leg?

156
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,893
Come on.

157
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,229
How can he play soccer
when he can barely run?

158
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,732
Please, Mr. Mackenzie.

159
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,151
Sure. I'll be right down.

160
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,201
What's that teacher's name?

161
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,745
Don't know.

162
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,970
I found my competition.

163
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,222
His name is Mackenzie.

164
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,809
He's an American who recently
started working as an English teacher.

165
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:14,189
Wait, hold on. Mackenzie?
The name seems familiar.

166
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,444
Yes. He's with Safe Happiness.

167
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,783
Handsome, isn't he?

168
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,786
Really?
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

169
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,747
My eyes are fine.

170
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,251
What's an American citizen
doing here though?

171
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,588
Right. Well, he's obviously
a member of the family.

172
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,300
He keeps making a move
on the Chinese characters teacher.

173
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,635
I think he can see the forcefield.

174
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,179
Is that so?

175
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,139
Anything else?

176
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:54,062
His address, phone number,
and a handsome photo. That's it.

177
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,522
What now?

178
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,150
Why has the website become so complicated?

179
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:02,487
I see you didn't know.
It was renovated last year.

180
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,656
PAY THE 100,000 WON REGISTRATION FEE?

181
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,242
Even after all this time,
it still gives me the creeps.

182
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,180
Mr. Mackenzie.

183
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,640
Hi, Ji-hyeong.

184
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,730
Kids from the Gardening Club made this.

185
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,315
They spelled my name wrong though.

186
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,577
What is it?

187
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,588
Hey, wait for me!

188
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,590
I...

189
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,347
I want to be back on the basketball team.

190
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,141
I want to play again.

191
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,851
Sure thing.

192
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,356
I used to get beaten up all the time
at your age.

193
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,276
This one time, I was so badly hurt
that I couldn't even move.

194
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,030
I went to the doctor with my mother
and this is what he said.

195
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,700
"Ma'am,
how could you have let it get this far?"

196
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,371
My mother answered him back
wearing a scowl.

197
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,040
"How is that my concern?"

198
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,513
How many kids ganged up on you?

199
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,723
Why?

200
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,396
Take this.

201
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,691
One.

202
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,861
Two.

203
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,739
Three.

204
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,451
Four.

205
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,288
Four kids beat you up, right?

206
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,333
Put one in their belongings
or in their pockets.

207
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,508
Will this put me back on the team?

208
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,386
Maybe.

209
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,517
I'm exhausted.

210
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,227
Hey. I'm hungry today.

211
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,395
This way. I'm starving.

212
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,605
Damn it.

213
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,231
Let's go.

214
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,734
Let’s quickly wash up
and grab something to eat.

215
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,985
-Hey.
-What should we have?

216
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,195
Move!

217
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,946
-I'm starving.
-Shit.

218
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,448
Wait. Who took my vitamins?

219
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:52,908
Damn, it hurts.

220
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,409
Get lost!

221
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,952
Why? Do you have something to hide?

222
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,165
Let's shower quickly and get some food.

223
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,126
-Korean barbecue!
-Me too. Sounds great.

224
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,509
Hello, Ms. Ahn.

225
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,302
Yes, hello.

226
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,220
Well...

227
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,851
You see, the teachers
are gathering for dinner this evening.

228
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,520
I came to ask if you knew about it.

229
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,563
No, no one told me.

230
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,440
I see.

231
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:18,910
Please come on in.

232
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,090
I'm glad I came to check then.

233
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,137
If you don't have other plans,

234
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,431
join us for dinner.

235
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,601
I don't know if I should though.

236
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,186
Of course, you can.

237
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,481
There is nothing wrong with you.

238
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,361
It’ll be at 5 p.m.

239
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,489
I teach Life Sciences.

240
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,159
And my name is Han A-reum.

241
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,582
-I'm the school nurse--
-We already know everything.

242
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,090
Okay, let's study the last line.

243
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:19,012
"Everything happens in a heartbeat."

244
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,931
Let's start over.

245
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,572
"And so..."

246
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,490
Yes.

247
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,334
How can I help you?

248
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,794
I'm sorry to interrupt,

249
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,753
It's okay.

250
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,104
Ji-hyeong.

251
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,399
Pack up your bag and follow him out.

252
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,779
Why?

253
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,869
Last night,

254
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,957
three players
including the captain were injured.

255
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,752
It looks like
they'll be out for the season.

256
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,759
How did they get hurt?

257
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,934
LEE JI-HYEONG

258
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,730
GET LOST, YOU BUM

259
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,523
BASTARD

260
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,772
-Hey, defense! Defense!
-You are doing great!

261
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,607
Go, team!

262
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,777
Mark him! Turn around!

263
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,945
Defense!

264
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,447
Block him!

265
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,783
Don't rush it.

266
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,910
Look for an opening. Nice!

267
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,662
Pass, Ji-hyeong. Pass the ball.

268
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,080
Ji-hyeong, pass!

269
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,298
Offensive foul.

270
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,884
-Why?
-What?

271
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,178
Ji-hyeong!

272
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,429
What are you doing?

273
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,806
Get back in.

274
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,682
Get back in the game!

275
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,186
Hey!

276
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,400
There, in the middle! Keep your formation
and don't lose your marks.

277
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,529
Oh, come on!

278
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,240
Nice!

279
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,950
Nice!

280
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,451
Nice.

281
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,911
Don't get greedy out there.

282
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,121
-Jeez.
-Shit!

283
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,206
Damn it.

284
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,667
Go, team!

285
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,589
Man-to-man defense. Don't rush it.

286
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,299
Man-to-man defense. Watch your mark.

287
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,635
Defense!

288
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,387
Focus on your mark, not the ball.

289
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,600
Focus. Man-to-man defense.

290
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,271
Come on. No one's beneath the hoop.

291
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,731
That's it. Go!

292
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,025
Just go. Run for it.

293
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,516
Nicely done!

294
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,934
Yes!

295
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,361
Mr. Hong is a weird one, right?

296
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,324
Why all of a sudden? Are you interested?

297
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,792
That's absurd.

298
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,712
Who in the hell would like him?

299
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,720
To be honest, he's dull and boring.

300
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,143
Then why do you show interest in him?

301
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,147
Because he'll lead this school one day.

302
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,900
So, of course,

303
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:33,279
-we're interested in you both.
-No, it won't work!

304
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,657
Are you going to get married?

305
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,494
How about another round? Let's go!

306
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,083
-Over here!
-Let's go!

307
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,585
Okay, I'm watching.

308
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,549
-Let's drink!
-Cheers.

309
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,973
Mr. Hong, where are you off to?

310
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,183
-Hey.
-I'm leaving,

311
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,810
but you should stay and have fun.

312
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,104
Wait, you're going to leave me here?

313
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,565
They all seem to be drunk,
what am I supposed to do alone?

314
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,859
Just stay a while longer. Come on.

315
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,695
You should look for an opening
and make a run for it.

316
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,073
Come on, Mr. Hong.

317
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm afraid you'll have to fire Mackenzie.

318
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,590
That came out of the blue.

319
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,678
Why him all of a sudden?

320
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,065
Sorry.

321
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,406
I'll figure out the rest.

322
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,495
And for the time being,
don't touch anyone else but me.

323
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,793
What else is there to figure out?

324
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,631
Lee Ji-hyeong.

325
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,399
You, Mackenzie.

326
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,739
Yes, you.

327
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,698
Sorry?

328
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,743
I know who you are.

329
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,996
Sorry?

330
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,291
Stop what you're doing.

331
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,792
Do what?

332
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,794
This.

333
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,922
Mr. Hong's forcefield.

334
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,717
It doesn't make any difference anyway.

335
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,519
What the hell are you saying, you fuck?

336
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,729
Speak Korean.

337
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,273
Make some money off it.

338
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,235
Don't eliminate them,
but capture them and sell them.

339
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,945
Everyone works because of money.

340
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,365
Wear proper clothes as well.

341
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,369
Buy yourself a new car
and find a better place to live.

342
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,371
I've got a nice house, you prick.

343
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,082
As if. All you have is a gardenia plant.

344
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,754
How do you know where I live?

345
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,512
We know everything.

346
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,936
-Bang.
-Hold on.

347
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,147
-Bang.
-Are you selling jellies to them?

348
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,274
I am.

349
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,776
Don't.

350
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,531
Do you like the school, Ms. Ahn?

351
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,408
Who on earth ever likes schools?

352
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,034
Then why do you work there?

353
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,953
Because a friend recommended it to me.

354
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,331
Ms. Ahn,

355
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,126
you can't handle that school by yourself.

356
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,757
You'll never get a hold
of Mr. Hong's forcefield.

357
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:31,017
I know all too well what happens
to naive people like you.

358
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,914
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

359
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,213
I don't feel uneasy at all.

360
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,592
What was that you just said though?

361
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,475
What the hell is that bastard saying?

362
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,713
That son of a bitch.

363
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,514

I didn’t know you worked so late
