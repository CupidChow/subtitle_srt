1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,466
I SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT I WILL ABIDE
BY THE NATION'S CONSTITUTION

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,219
AND PERFORM MY DUTIES AS
A PUBLIC SERVANT TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,140
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT
FOR TEACHING AT MONG-LYEON HIGH SCHOOL

4
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:19,227
NAME: HONG IN-PYO

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,314
Yes?

6
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,654
In-pyo.

7
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,701
Do I know you?

8
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,245
It's me, Hwang Ga-young.

9
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,376
I see you don't remember me.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,503
We played together all the time
in elementary school.

11
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,678
Oh, right! Seongmun Elementary School.

12
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,764
Second grade, class eight,
number thirteen?

13
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,681
Right.

14
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,393
Hey. Please come in.

15
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,155
My back has been troubling me.
Do you mind if I sit comfortably?

16
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,158
Of course not. Go ahead.

17
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,884
Mom told me she was going over
to see your mom, so I tagged along.

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,934
Because of my surname,
I was number 18 in alphabetical order.

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,646
It was the same for you,
but there were more boys than girls.

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,398
-Our homeroom teacher's name was Go--
-Go Pil-sun.

21
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,566
-That's right.
-Remember how

22
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,777
she got fired
for trying to sell the water dispenser?

23
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,575
Just a second.

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,789
Okay, that's better.

25
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,341
I heard about your accident too.

26
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,804
I'm glad to see you're doing all right.

27
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,518
So what have you been up to these days?

28
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,149
Not much.
I've been doing some volunteer work,

29
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,401
like mentoring
socially disadvantaged children.

30
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,111
So you're a social worker.

31
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,238
Something like that.

32
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,783
The salary isn't much,
but the job is worthwhile.

33
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,202
I've only just started.

34
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,580
Well, what you're doing is admirable.

35
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,502
Are you married?

36
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,131
Oh, this? It's nothing.

37
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,257
I see.

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,020
Gosh, I keep...

39
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,147
I'm sorry. I spat at you, didn't I?

40
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,067
-What the hell? That's insane!
-Oh, gosh.

41
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:19,365
Gosh, my back. My back's killing me.

42
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,912
Ji-hyeong,

43
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,958
where did you get those sneakers?

44
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,961
I bought them.

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,214
How can you afford basketball shoes
when you're a student?

46
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,968
Why did you want to see me?

47
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,898
Ji-hyeong.

48
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,860
Are you fond of Mr. Mackenzie?

49
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,964
Something doesn't feel right.

50
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,176
Enjoy the rest of your day.

51
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,224
Mr. Hong, did you hear from Mr. Mackenzie?

52
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,685
No. Why?

53
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,814
He asked for the key to the basement.

54
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,900
I heard there were
gardening tools in there.

55
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,323
Sir, I told you that
the basement was off-limits.

56
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,409
Right.

57
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,036
-Have a good day then.
-Sure.

58
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,084
Why do you think Mackenzie is interested
in the basement?

59
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,880
He seems to know something.

60
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,301
-I'll look for Ilgwang Sterilization.
-Hi.

61
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,764
I'll keep looking into Mackenzie.

62
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,683
You keep looking
for Ilgwang Sterilization.

63
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,206
SEARCH BY NAME: MACKENZIE

64
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,875
-I knew it.
-He's handsome

65
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,794
He sure is handsome.

66
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,588
Which picture are you looking at?

67
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,049
-He's so handsome.
-But he is good looking.

68
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,719
You had better stay strong.

69
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,057
Don't worry. I'm a woman of self-control.

70
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,560
Could he have a girlfriend?

71
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,105
Don't worry. I highly doubt it.

72
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,441
What should I do then?

73
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,276
I'm hanging up.

74
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,127
I found the address
for Ilgwang Sterilization on the internet.

75
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,088
It says "HSP" in big, bold letters.

76
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:12,366
Safe Happiness. One, we always smile.

77
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,485
We do not look down on those
who look down on us.

78
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,655
We embrace them with our smiles.

79
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,198
Seven.

80
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,450
PLEASE "DUN'T" TOUCH WHAT'S IN THE TUB

81
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,218
Eight.

82
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:18,432
We always laugh out loud. And lastly we...

83
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,400
Fifteen...

84
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,295

87
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,257

are busy at the moment.

88
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,926

Yongsan-gu, Seoul."

92
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,890
Fuck, that's our school's address.

93
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,348
IT'S NOT A GARDENIA
IT'S A BALSAM TREE

94
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,066
PLEASE "DUN'T" TOUCH "WAT'S" IN THE TUB

Hwang Ga-young

96
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,778
-…getting better, getting better!
-…getting better, getting better!

97
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,655
-My body's getting better,

-getting better, getting better!

99
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,825

100
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,119
-getting better, getting better!

101
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,996

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,831
-getting better, getting better!

105
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,171

106
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,215

107
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,092
-My body's getting better,

108
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,969
-getting better, getting better!

109
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,012
-My body's getting better,

110
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,098
-getting better, getting better!

111
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,059

-And lastly,

112
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,143
-getting better!
-all together.

113
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,312
let's laugh at the top of our lungs!

114
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,721
What's wrong?

115
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,139
I don't see Ms. Ahn.

116
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,724
I wonder where she went.

117
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,899
SCHOOL NURSE AHN EUN-YOUNG

118
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,282
It looks like poison ivy.

119
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,826
What on earth did you touch?

120
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,830
Call in sick at work for a few days.

121
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,541
Take this medicine, and rest at home.

122
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,844
What is it like to live a life like yours?

123
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,473
What do you think?

124
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,516
It would be exhausting.

125
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,686
Still, you're fun to be around.

126
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,022
I'm sorry I said that.

127
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,900
I LOVE YOU, CHEAT AND I'LL KILL YOU

128
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,777
My grandfather's will was hilarious.

129
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,196
"So-mun-man-bok-rae."

130
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,283
"Laughing will bring good fortune."

131
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,912
If only he hadn’t passed away so suddenly,
he would have left behind a proper will.

132
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,123
He always had high blood pressure.

133
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,293
But he was just getting surgery
for a broken ankle,

134
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,420
and he never woke up from that.

135
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,551
It's all right though.

136
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,263
I keep forgetting about it
since he passed away so suddenly.

137
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,604
Can you still not get in touch
with Ilgwang Sterilization?

138
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,690
I went to its office, but it was closed.

139
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,070
Are you finally intrigued by my story?

140
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,072
A little.

141
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,075
Then there's something
I'd like to show you.

142
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:33,993
Save it.

143
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,123
Sorry.

144
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,129
Who has he been hanging out with?

145
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,258
I'm home.

146
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,386
Yes, welcome. Head on upstairs.

147
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,763
I'll trust you and leave you two alone.

148
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,856
My grandfather used
to spend his time here.

149
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,653
I can't believe it's almost been a year.

150
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,914
I've lived with my grandfather
since I was a boy.

151
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,918
My father passed away
when I was young, you see.

152
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,256
So I learned Chinese characters quickly.

153
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,912
I see you were very fond of him.

154
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,416
I was. If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't have become a teacher.

155
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,971
It looks like your grandfather read
these books the most often.

156
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:19,973
You're right.

157
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,524
FENG SHUI

158
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,653
A RELIGIOUS TERM RELATED TO
THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE EARTH

159
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,492
Actually, the word "heuphyeol" appears
multiple times here.

160
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,411
Here.

161
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,622
And here.

162
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,126
Here too.

163
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,462
Bloodsucking?

164
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,339
No, breathing hole.

165
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,271
"Chi-heup-hyeol,

166
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,357
e-gok-dae-un

167
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,441
ga-ja-guk."

168
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,072
CHI-HEUP-HYEOL E-GOK-DAE-UN GA-JA-GUK

169
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,782
IF YOU CAN CONTROL THE BREATHING HOLE,

170
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,450
YOU CAN TURN GREAT LUCK TO YOUR FAVOR

171
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,077
AND CONTROL THE NATION AS YOU WISH

172
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,933
Aren't you going to translate it?

173
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,268
Sorry?

174
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,347
When did you hurt your leg?

175
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,434
It was a motorcycle accident.

176
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,652
I slipped on the road while driving it.

177
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,156
And I got sucked under a moving bus.

178
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,913
Doctors told me
it was a miracle that I survived.

179
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,503
Thanks to the injury,
I was exempted from military service

180
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,421
and began my career sooner than others.

181
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,634
It's hard to believe
that I used to ride a motorcycle, right?

182
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,055
I used to be quite an athlete
when I was young.

183
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,783
STRENGTH RECOVERY RETURN COMPLETION

184
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,535
Do you know how to read
Chinese characters?

185
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,869
Of course not.

186
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,748
I only know what the Chinese characters
for my name means.

187
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,167
"Eun" means subtle,
and "Young" means a flower’s petals.

188
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,179
I’m not compatible
with the character “Young.”

189
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,146
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

190
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,231
Why?

191
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,447
Things keep circling back
to Safe Happiness with this school.

192
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:13,081
But that's not really his fault.

193
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,875
What the fuck.

194
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,015
How many people have you saved until now?

195
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,726
Just a few clients.

196
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,187
I guess I helped them.

197
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,650
Have you ever failed?

198
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,736
Of course.

199
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,531
How can I succeed every time?

200
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,952
Back when I used to work at the hospital,

201
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,498
I failed many times too.

202
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,542
How can you save everyone at a hospital?

203
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,504
That's just what hospitals are like.

204
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,132
But I work at a school now.

205
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,844
If I make a mistake

206
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,971
or fail...

207
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,671
Your destiny has been entwined
to yet another person.

208
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,471
I hate the word, destiny.

209
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,391
So stop saying that.

210
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:03,024
But yet again,
you have a tough competition.

211
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,777
Who is it this time?

212
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,989
How should I know?

213
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,366
Forget it.

214
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,870
I refuse to live as I was destined to.

215
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,750
Can you please open the window for me?

216
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,796
My eyes are burning.

217
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,070
Hye-min.

218
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,782
Baek Hye-min.

219
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,368
Baek Hye-min is coming.

220
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,307
What's this?

221
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,808
Hey.

222
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,979
Why won't it die?

223
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,315
What on earth is this?

224
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,635
I heard she lives in an institution.

225
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,428
-Really?
-Just look at her uniform.

226
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,763
It's obviously second-hand.

227
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,933
-Hurry!
-You shouldn't say that.

228
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,601
-I need to go to the toilet.
-I bet she smells.

229
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,270
-She does smell.
-Really?

230
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,063
She must not be able to shower.

231
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,398
Oh, dear.

232
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,440
Gosh.

233
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,776
-What's there to feel sorry about?
-But she smells.

234
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,655
-You're talking about yourself, right?
-I smell? Do I smell like her?

235
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,284
You smell like Baek Hye-min.

236
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,494
Get lost. You're a Baek Hye-min.

237
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,955
But, you know, I think
she really does smell.

238
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,458
Come on.

239
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,171
-Do you want to go get a snack?
-What?

240
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,756
-Shouldn't someone tell her
-Let's go.

241
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,300
that she should wash herself?

242
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,885
I don't think a shower
will get rid of her smell.

243
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,930
You guys should go take a shower.

244
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,390
Let's go.

245
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,228
-Why would you do that?
-It's easy.

246
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,938
-He said he's coming.
-Where is he?

247
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,649
-Did you get it?
-That's not going to work.

248
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,568
Ms. Ahn.

249
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,445
Go wait over there.

250
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,617
Ms. Ahn, gosh. That hurts.

251
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,998
Ms. Ahn, that hurts.

252
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,292
Ms. Ahn!

253
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,626
Seo-u, you're next.

254
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,794
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,592
How did you injure yourself?

256
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,218
I think I have the bad luck mites.

257
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,721
This is the third time today already.

258
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,108
Are you injured too?

259
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,778
No.

260
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,868
I’m a mite eater.

261
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,328
I'm a transfer student.

262
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,832
What's a mite eater?

263
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,585
I eat mites.

264
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,466
Mites can only be killed with
the stomach acid of a mite eater.

265
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,010
Don't.

266
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,846
Don't.

267
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,681
Don't you dare.

268
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,526
I don't usually exist.

269
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,071
I only come into being
when mites begin to spread.

270
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,906
And this is my district.

271
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,535
Mites are migrating towards this school.

272
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:29,499
The large number suggests
that the ground here is unstable.

273
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,295
Did you do something to the Apji Stone?

274
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,008
You know what that is?

275
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,010
Of course.

276
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,972
I have been through many cycles of life
in this area.

277
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,600
The administrative districts
have changed a lot.

278
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,353
But the area
within 5.38km radius of this place

279
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,522
seems to be my world.

280
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,698
So you're saying

281
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:10,331
that she eats mites
that are known to bring bad luck?

282
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,332
Yes.

283
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,759
Are there any on me right now?

284
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,397
She said that mites are migrating
towards this school.

285
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,235
I think it's because we messed with
the Apji Stone in the basement that day.

286
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,697
Starting now,

287
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,366
everyone will gradually become miserable.

288
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,624
Are you all right?

289
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,470
Well...

290
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,014
I met an old friend, you see.

291
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,018
Her name is Ga-young.
I'm sure you'd like her as well.

292
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,437
Hwang Ga-young.

293
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,066
Oh, right.

294
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,068
That reminds me.

295
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,946
I found an old photo.

296
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,781
Please have a seat.

297
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,093
This is when me and my grandfather
went fishing.

298
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,388
This is the first fish I ever caught.

299
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,935
And if you look closely,
you'll see some Chinese characters.

300
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,396
These characters say

301
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,273
"Ilgwang Sterilization."

302
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,611
The Chinese characters on the back
of the jacket is Ilgwang Sterilization.

303
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,282
ILGWANG STERILIZATION

304
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,537
How long have you
and Ga-young been friends?

305
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,625
For a long time.

306
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,631
ONLY ILGWANG STERILIZATION
IS ALLOWED IN THE BASEMENT

307
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,472
I found the fishing site in this photo.

308
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,684
Would you like to go there with me?

309
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,105
Where is it?

310
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,567
In Busan...

311
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,738
No, thanks.

312
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,366
We're not even dating.

313
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,912
I'll pass.

314
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,801
I have another tough competition.

315
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,180
Her name is Hwang Ga-young,
In-pyo's friend from school.

316
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,057
Hold on.

317
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,643
Hwang Ga-young?

318
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,771
Yes, the name seems familiar...

319
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,274
She used to be one of us.

320
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,778
-Let's check.
-Hurry and look it up.

321
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,822
SEARCH BY NAME: HWANG GA-YOUNG

322
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,990
HWANG GA-YOUNG, 27, FEMALE

323
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:35,745
Yes, it's her. Her mother's Go Sun-jeom.

324
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,914
Last year,
she became the head of the order.

325
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,833
Why are they all trying to get to him?

326
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,502
Bitch.

327
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,172
-Those are bread too?
-Yes.

328
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,799
-She really loves bread.
-Eat up.

329
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:48,925
Yes.

330
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,637
Hello.

331
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,013
-Hello.
-Hello.

332
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,092
I love your sneakers.

333
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,515
Why?

334
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:38,850
Where to then?

335
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,812
It'll be better with chili flakes.

336
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,647
-Have some more.
-You're so right.

337
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,606
And with kimchi.

338
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,858
Eat up.

339
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,120
Ms. Ahn, can I get some antacids?

340
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,667
There are too many mites at school.

341
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,296
I get stomach aches
if I eat mites on an empty stomach.

342
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,591
That's why I need
to keep eating other things.

343
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,032
Are you ready?

344
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,243
Come on. Let's go to our next class.

345
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,413
Hurry.

346
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,752
What's wrong? Are you all right?

347
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,339
Menstrual cramps are so annoying.

348
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,049
She's in pain.

349
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,262
She has cramps.

350
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,765
Does it hurt?

351
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,227
It's her first time being a girl.

352
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,021
Why would you tell her that?

353
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,940
-It's all right.
-What?

354
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,316
You can tell her.

355
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,652
Ms. Ahn understands everything.

356
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,570
That's what you think.

357
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,994
I've been living my lives
only as a man so far.

358
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,039
This is my first time being a woman.

359
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,666
What?

360
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,669
Technically speaking, I'm genderless.

361
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,964
Hye-min wasn't born.

362
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,217
She just wakes up one day and exists.

363
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,720
She was never a baby and has no parents.

364
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,639
That much I know.

365
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,560
So she's a lot like Radi in a way.

366
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,313
I was adopted from an orphanage.

367
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,566
I see.

368
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,401
This just hit me recently.

369
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,070
If we were in a computer game,

370
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,657
then I'd be what you would call
a non-playable character.

371
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,662
I exist automatically
and I'm stuck in my designated area.

372
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,457
Her memory goes all the way back to
the age of Baekje.

373
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,045
How does it feel
to live in a woman's body?

374
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,511
Well...

375
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,473
It's new.

376
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,687
Apart from the cramps, I like it.

377
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,650
But it's scary to wander around
at night alone.

378
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:43,159
As a man, I went to fight on a battlefield
when my life was coming to an end.

379
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,704
I deliberately fought at the front

380
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,414
since I was going to die anyway.

381
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,142
Lie down.

382
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,110
It's nice and warm.

383
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,032
Dying is easy.

384
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,909
It's over so quickly.

385
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,495
I'll come back to life anyway.

386
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,959
However,

387
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,878
I'm curious this time around.

388
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,760
It's fun coming to school.

389
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,515
I would like to live over
the age of 20 for once.

390
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,478
What are you talking about?

391
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,855
She dies when she reaches 20.

392
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,652
Back in the day, dying at 20
wasn't something to be sad about.

393
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,446
Can't you save her?

394
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:08,202
I'm supposed to live until I'm 20
and then disappear.

395
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,706
Nothing's set in stone for anyone.

396
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,877
That's just how it is.

397
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,589
Liar.

398
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
That young girl

399
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,898
has been eating all of these alone.

400
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,282
Isn't there any way for you to help her?

401
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,043
I could catch them all for her,

402
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,212
but she still has to be the one
who eats them.

403
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,258
I can't catch them
only to give them to her to eat.

404
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,678
She's having stomach issues as it is.

405
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,807
But you have to catch them all

406
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,144
to make the school safe for everyone.

407
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,943
What about our safety?

408
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,987
We live the life we were given.

409
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,989
What's the point in blaming others?

410
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,424
Maybe that's easy for you to say
because you're a healer.

411
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,094
Not for us, since we’re the soldiers.

412
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,772
Look. This is how we are.

413
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,172
Fuck.

414
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,842
I forgot to dye my fingernails.

415
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,936
Why are you being silly all of a sudden?

416
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,396
My gosh.

417
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,735
Gosh.

418
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,698
Jeez.

419
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:13,095
Why do you think Ilgwang Sterilization
abandoned the school?

420
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,983
I just want to quit this school.

421
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:36,368
ILGWANG STERILIZATION

422
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,084
FEBRUARY 5, 2000, SEONGHWA FISHING SITE
IN-PYO'S FIRST CATCH

423
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,763
BASED ON THE SCHOOL NURSE FILES
BY CHUNG SE-RANG

424
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,262
