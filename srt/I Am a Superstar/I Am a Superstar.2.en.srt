You're talented.

You'll have a bright future.

00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,220
I have faith in you.

I'll tell you one last time.

My surname is not Wang.

19
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,170
And I don't have any relatives with the surname Wang.

20
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,940
Do you understand?

21
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,140
It wasn't a dream.

23
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,700

My whole body hurts.

Your whole body hurts?

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,820
You should have told me earlier. I can cure you.

Come on, let me give you a massage.

28

No need.

29
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:44,900

No, no, no.

31

It's to refresh you mind before you get to work.

Refresh my mind?

No, wait, how to refresh my mind?

Advanced gamers in this game

can have more opportunities than others.

76
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,770
But this doesn't mean you can just sit idle and enjoy the fruit.

77
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,780
You still need to count on your own

is the total value of your fame.

So of course you need to work hard to get it.

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,050
this is

94
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,870
a game which one either becomes famous or dies .

95
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,740

understood and appreciated by as many people as possible

97
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
can survive in the game.

98
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,620
Either become famous or die.

99
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,640
Advanced gamer.

100
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,830
And I'm the only one.

101
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,780
This means

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,510
I can do whatever I want.

106
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:57,800

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,730
Your payment for the six-month trial period is

4000 yuan per month.

109
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,550
I deduct the rent, water and electricity fees,

110
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,430
and your food expenses. And also minus the tea set

111
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,910
you broke two days ago.

112
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,570
This month,

113
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,640
this is all you can get.

114
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,150
Just... just 50 yuan?

115
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,180
What? You think this is too little?

116
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,860
Then quit.

117
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,020
Wait.

118
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,340
I thought you would provide the food and housing here.

119
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,780
How can you deduct this part of the money?

120
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,490
Yes, I provide you with the food and housing.

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,640
Do you have a place to stay?

122
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,540
Yes.

123
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,830
Did you miss any meal?

124
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,060
No.

125
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,340
That's it.

126
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,420
Back then,

127
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,100
I knew you had no family here and

128
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,970
looked miserable.

129
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,500
That's why I agreed to give you a job

130
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,300
and take you in.

131

133
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
You said that, right?

134
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,940
Yeah.

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,070
you won't be able to find one with a rental fee less than 3000.

139
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,720
Although your room is small,

140
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,410
it's still a single room.

141
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,400
3000 yuan a month is not inappropriate.

142
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,420
Well,

143
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,180
I'll give you a raise after the trial.

144

Don't worry.

145
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:27,970
No.

146
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,380

even my feet are blistered.

151
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,620
The money

152
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,980
is not enough for me to buy a pair of shoes.

153
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,460
Then quit.

154

155

Want to even the score with me?

157

Don't look at me.

blame your mom.

162

163

She treats me as if I am the Yang Bailao.

Call the security. Call the security.

351
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,120
Yes.

352
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,980
Hurry up. Call the security.

353
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,980
Call the security.

354
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,180
Get him out.

355
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,800
What's going on?

356
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,120
Did you hear me? I will call the security.

357
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,460
Bye.

358
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,580
Zhang Ye.

359
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,490
Hello, mentors. My name is Zhang Ye.

360
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,050
Are you going to ask me to recite the manuscript?

361
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,780
Yes.

362
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,700
I have finished.

363
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,740
July 28th,

364
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,860
is the factory anniversary of Yuan Tu Company.

365
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,820
Every July 28th,

366
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,660
Yuan Tu Company

367
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,700
will host a series of rewarding activities.

368
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,760
Last July 28th,

369
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,020
Yuan Tu Company grandly launched

370
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
Stone Plasma motorcycles.

371
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,940
This has brought the plasma trend to

372
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,220
the motorcycle industry

373
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,140
and caused a huge stir

374
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,820
in the motorcycle industry.

375
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,780
Especially in 2015,

376
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,460
from January to March,

377
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,660
the sales of the plasma motorcycles

378
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,420
continue to decrease.

379
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,300
In March,

380
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,380
the sales reached the lowest point of 909 vehicles.

381
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,300
Although after April,

382
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,890
the company adopted

383
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,820
a series of rewarding policies.

384
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,020
In addition, the production of the regular model stopped,

385
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,180
the sales of the plasma motorcycles

386
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,060
started to rise gradually.

387
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,930
But they haven't reached

388
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,880
last year's best level.

389
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,610
Let alone to reach

390
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,930
the sales that could support the company.

391
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,230
Besides the influence of the industry's big environment,

392
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,930
in the distribution link,

393
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,860
the lack of enthusiasm

394
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,140
in the promotion of plasma motorcycles is also a key reason.

395
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,380
Besides, this year, the company

396
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,370
has reorganized its publicity policy.

397
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,060
In the first half of the year,

398
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,420
the company didn't organize nationwide

399
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,700
plasma motorbike promotion activity.

400
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,940
The activities held in each area

401
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,780
are also of varied quality

402
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,720
which is also one of the contributing factors.

403
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,200
Of course, the problem of the product line.

404
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,230
The quality of the products

405
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,050
also affects

406
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,540
whether the sales of the plasma motorcycle will increase.

407
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,100
Therefore, in the next half of the year, the company has decided to

408
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,180
launch a series of combination measures

409
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,990
to promote the sales increase of plasma motorbikes.

410
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:29,810
In terms of the product,

411
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,680
the company will further expand

412
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,900
the product line of plasma motorcycles

413
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,240
and set up a comprehensive quality rectification

414
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,180
of plasma motorcycles

415
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,740
to enable all-round quality improvement

416
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
of the motorcycles

417
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,740
which will lead to a revolution in quality.

418
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,460
In terms of the policy,

419
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,850
the company will put forward a series of reward policies

420
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,020
targeting agents and retailers.

421
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,780
In terms of promotion,

422
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,140
the company will organize one or two

423
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,380
nationwide plasma motorcycle

424
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:44,980
promotion activities,

425
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,340
and continuous to launch

426
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,580
regional promotions.

427
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:47,980
The company has also decided

428
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,740
on July 28th,

429
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,730
the activity will start

430
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,270
and the first shot of this sales battle will start.

431
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,700
I am done.

432
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,890
We need a foreign language host.

433
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,320
English, Spain...

434
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,420
Russian.

435
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,350
Russian will do. Recite a poem for us.

436
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,140
What do you think?

437
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:19,870
Russian?

438
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,460
Yes.

439
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,050
It's not on the recruitment notice.

440
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,580
That means you can't.

441
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,500
Forget it.

442
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,140
Wait.

443
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:32,410
High above the silvery ocean,

444
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:38,900
winds are gathering the storm-clouds,

445
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,060
and between the clouds and ocean,

446
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,340
like a streak of sable lightning,

447
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:59,620
proudly wheels the Stormy Petrel.

448
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,630
OK?

449
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,580
What did he say?

450
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,580
Translate it.

451
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,500
He... He said that...

452
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,170
His pronunciation is very good.

453
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,300
Very standard.

454
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,020
Well, how about

455
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,860
you

456
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
translate it yourself for us.

457
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,070
In Chinese this poem means,

458
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,420
High above the silvery ocean,

459
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,970
winds are gathering the storm-clouds,

460
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,530
and between the clouds and ocean,

461
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,820

You wrote all these yourself?

467
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,840
This is the Song of the Stormy Petrel written by Maxim Gorky.

468
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,100
What?

469
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,740
Russian poet, Gorky.

470
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,780
Stop kidding.

471
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,330
No Russian has a surname Gao.

472
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,250
The people in this game,

473
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,690
they don't even know Gorky,

474
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,120
or Song of the Stormy Petrel?

475
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,690
He's too tall.

476
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,290
Right. He is so handsome.

477
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,770
We can't keep him here.

478
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,500
Yes.

479
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,130
All right, stop arguing.

480
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,110
My department wants him.

481
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,740
Don't argue with me.

You went out all afternoon to buy these vegetables?

Did you go grocery shopping

or planting vegetables?

where you bought the groceries.

What a coincidence.

507
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,660
What?

508

Don't explain.

515
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,160
Explain is just a cover-up.

516
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,410
And the cover-up is the truth.

517
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,420
I'll be honest then.

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,100
can't hold

524
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,340
you anymore.

525
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,460
How about this?

526
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,700
Pay your rent for this month.

527
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
And you can go wherever you want.

528
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,780
No, no, no.

529
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,860
Look, I found this job

530
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,340
to

531
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,700
pay back the money earlier.

532
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,020
You may not know

533
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,500
I majored in broadcasting.

534
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,120
I just want to

535
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,620
use my strength

536
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,070
and make more money.

537
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,580
Make more money?

538
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,460
Apart from your long face,

539
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,630
you also have this strength.

540
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,250
Just a little bit.

541
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,570
Don't worry.

542
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,490
I won't delay

543
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,500
my work here.

544
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,820
I will do my best

545
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,660
for every single work.

546
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,270
And for your meal.

547
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,620
Before I go to work,

548
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,650
I'll cook your meals

549
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,400
for the whole day.

550
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,380
I won't starve you or Chi'ou.

551
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,180
And...

552
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,860
And this kid.

553
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,020
Kid?

554
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,980
Niece?

555
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,020
Say it again.

556
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,440
Chenchen?

557
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,860
Call her Madam from now on.

558
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,620
Madam.

559
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,700
I won't starve Madam here.

560
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,530
Okay, cut your salary by half.

561
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,990
-Ah? -What?

562
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,620
You're working part-time.

563
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,890
And you want to take the same amount of money as a full-time job?

564
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,020
No, but I do all my work...

565
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,460
Do it or not?

566
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,430
Yes.

567
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,420
What's your name?

568
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,580
My name is Zhang Ye.

569
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,140
Where are you from?

570
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,850
I am a local.

571
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,940
Madam.

572
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,330
Why are you always looking at me?

573
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,740
You look familiar.

574
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,920
I have a common face.

575
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,660
What are you looking at? Quickly trim the vegetables.

576
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,940
Don't delay my meal.

577
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,340
This interview

578
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,140
is to interview a person

579
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,100
or a copy machine?

580
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,460
Let me tell you.

581
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,810
Such a long article.

582
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,020
Just ten seconds.

583
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,660
Less than ten seconds.

584
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,090
This is embarrassing.

585
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,310
Who can recite it?

586
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,170
Who can memorize it?

587
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,340
I can.

588
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,060
You memorized it?

589
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,180
There's a word called

590
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,300
photographic

591
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,300
memory.

592
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,540
In Chinese,

593
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,180
it's called "unforgettable".

594
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,860
I have

595
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,260
this ability myself.

596
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,540
My eyes

597
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,140
are just like the cameras.

598
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,730
Anything,

599
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,820
just let me take a look.

600
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,780
I'll just memorize it

601
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,880
by taking a photo in my mind.

602
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,260
And this photo

603
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,500
will be kept in my mind.

604
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,870
I can do everything.

605
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,380
I stood there

606
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,220
and recited the whole passage to them.

607
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,950
The judges were shocked.

608
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,560
Then they hired you?

609
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,380
Not really.

610
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,900
They even gave me a harder task.

611
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,540
They gave me another question.

612
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,860
They asked me to speak Russian.

613
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,700
You can speak Russian?

614
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,740
Of course.

615
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,850
Let me show you.

616
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,010
Let it

617
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,580
break in all its fury!

618
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,080
Wait.

619
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,620
Translate

620
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,540
this line first.

621
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,680
Let it

622
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,390
break in all its fury.

623
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,500
Did you write this?

624
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:52,860
Well...

625
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,300
Not really.

626
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,210
But I'm good at writing poems.

627
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,370
I'm better at

628
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,740
love poems.

629
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,500
Do you want one?

630
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,510
Sure, show us.

631
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,110
I wake up from my sleep.

632
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,180
What wakes me up

633
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,340
is not the sunshine outside the window,

634
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,820
but your big face.

635
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,210
What a stupid poem it is!

636
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,460
Wash the dishes.

637
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,690
Go do your homework.

638
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,220
What is this?

639
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,930
I'll lend it to you.

640
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,450
Now you need to go to work.

641
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,590
I don't expect you

642
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,940
to come at any time.

643
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,100
But if anything happens,

644
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,280
remember to call me.

645
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,500
Be aware.

646
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,780
Don't break it.

647
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,370
Thank you.

648
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,420
Wait, what are you doing?

649
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,070
What are you doing, Madam?

650
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,950
Calm down. We can talk.

651
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,880
Why are you so aggressive?

652
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,790
You really don't remember me?

653
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,730
You look familiar.

654
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,300
When I was killed by you,

655
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,570
I didn't get the chance to have even one bite of

656
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,810
the sugar-coated haws.

657
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,050
Sugar-coated haws!

658
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,780
It's you.

659
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,300
Why are you here?

660
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't know.

661
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,660
I only know that when I woke up,

662
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,890
my home was gone,

663
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,270
and my parents were gone too.

664
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,780
Strangely,

665
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,060
I have an aunt now.

666
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,170
I want to go home.

667
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,380
Give my parents back!

668
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,930
Listen to me.

669
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,580
We

670
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:39,880
don't have

671
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,710
the luck to born on the same day.

672
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,510
But we have

673
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,250
the luck to die on the same day.

674
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,290
Put down the knife.

675
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,470
You can't go back even if you kill me.

676
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,060
Come on. Give it to me.

677
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:58,570
Yes.

678
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,750
Even if I kill you,

679
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,730
I can't go back.

680
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,300
Sit down.

681
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,520
Actually, we're not dead.

682
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,780
We just

683
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,890
enter into a game world.

684
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,220
Game?

685
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,090
Have you seen this before?

686
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,280
You have seen this.

687
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,500
So you're also a gamer.

688
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,880
What's your mission?

689
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,020
Sanzhi said

690
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
my mission is to study hard

691
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,160
and get along well with my classmates.

692
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,970
I have to use my grades and my relationship with others

693
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,830
to earn Fame Value.

694
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,010
Why is this different?

695
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,170
Can you draw a prize?

696
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,070
What's the reward?

697
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,320
No.

698
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,250
No?

699
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,060
Let's go. Let me ask them for you.

700
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,930
The gene seeds

701
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,260
we left on Earth.

702
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,270
Only humans

703
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,900
evolved into intelligent creatures.

704
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,680
Compared to 50000 years ago,

705
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,610
the intelligence of chicken

706
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,670
still hasn't evolved.

707
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,950
But their meat is better.

708
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,640
The same goes for sheep.

709
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,590
Maybe the reason why these creatures can't evolve

710
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,300
is that they are so delicious.

711
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,100
The imagination

712
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,480
has indeed improved a lot.

713
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,700
The little snail saved the earth.

714
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,830
If I hadn't

715
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,990
accidentally transmit these two people.

716
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,480
I want to directly copy

717
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,700
the main line of this game.

718
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,220
Welcome, two gamers.

719
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,060
Why does my Fame Value

720
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,900
keep dropping,

721
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,140
but her Fame Value

722
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,210
doesn't move at all?

723
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,010
Juvenile mode.

724
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,190
Before 18,

725
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,730
the Fame Value is in the storage stage.

726
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,910
After 18,

727
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,340
the Fame Value will be in the consumption stage.

728
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,600
18 years old.

729
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,480
How long will I have to play this game?

730
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm only 12 years old now.

731
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,930
Well,

732
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,660
this depends on your teammate.

733
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,690
After all, he brought you

734
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,560
into this game.

735
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,930
Can I draw a lottery?

736
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,310
No.

737
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,690
Don't worry.

738
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,580
Since I

739
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,950
brought you into this game,

740
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,460
I will try my best to pass the test

741
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,390
so that you can go home early.

742
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,690
Congratulations on pairing up.

743
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,280
Open the treasure box! It will give you hope

744
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,020
and allow you to have a successful life.

745
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,390
A variety of props can assist you

746
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,770
to win the game.

747
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,239
The Internet media is developing rapidly now.

748
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:10,960
[Qomolangma Internet Radio]

749
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,440
There are five departments in our radio station.

750
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,110
I'm going to assign you to Department One.

751
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,219
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

752
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,179
Hello, your hairstyle has changed.

753
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,650
This is Department One. Come on.

754
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,460
Everyone.

755
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,860
Please stop.

756
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,300
Let me introduce

757
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,480
a new colleague.

758
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,650
Intern host, Zhang what?

759
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,050
Hello, I'm Zhang Ye.

760
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,949
Zhang Ye.

761
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,170
Look at me.

762
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,290
Zhang

763
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,909
is a talented student from the Broadcasting College.

764
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,540
He has a good memory.

765
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,710
He can even write poems.

766
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,670
He's a real talent.

767
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,710
I'm flattered.

768
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:45,699
In the future,

769
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,560
I am looking forward to working with you guys.

770
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,020
Work hard.

771
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,929
In our place,

772
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,340
talents will not be buried.

773
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,220
Tian Bin.

774
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,660
Mr. Zhao.

775
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,260
Hello.

776
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,820
This is

777
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,080
the host of Late Night DJ

778
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,590
Tian Bin.

779
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,370
You two...

780
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,030
Sisi and I are together.

781
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,200
The wedding is on the 10th of this month.

782
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,400
Look, Zhang Ye gave it to me.

783
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,620
Good brother.

784
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,050
I won't let you down.

785
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,450
Zhang Ye, I'm Tian Bing.

786
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,900
I want to say

787
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,370
if you really

788
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,690
feel sorry,

789
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,580
you don't have to come,

790
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,970
in case everyone is embarrassed.

791
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,430
Why should I be embarrassed?

792
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,240
Why

793
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,350
don't you expose me

794
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,250
in front of Sisi?

795
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:35,690
I stole

796
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,250
your graduation design

797
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,300
to participate in the host competition.

798
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,730
That's why I could get this opportunity

799
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,610
to become the DJ of night radio station.

800
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,140
Don't you want to...

801
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,530
What? Are you afraid of me?

802
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,750
What am I afraid of?

803
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,100
I've deleted

804
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,130
all the backup files in your computer.

805
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,780
Nobody will believe it even you tell others.

806
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,950
Besides, someone like you,

807
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,110
even if you come to the competition,

808
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,970
you might just be a joke to others.

809
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,260
Tian Bin

810
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,820
is the pillar

811
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,480
of our Internet Radio.

812
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,080
Many people like him.

813
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,550
He cured many people's insomnia,

814
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,210
including me.

815
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,130
No.

816
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,060
Mr. Zhao,

817
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,860
are you talking about the hypnotization effect of my program?

818
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,740
It has nothing to do with

819
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,410
my ability.

820
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,510
It's mainly about the time period.

821
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,770
You can transfer me to

822
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,970
the golden period.

823
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,150
No way.

824
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,650
You're the one who's supporting the night show.

825
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,780
Zhang,

826
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,720
learn more

827
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,700
from Mr. Tian.

828
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm flattered.

829
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,400
Zhang Ye, right?

830
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,420
Yes.

831
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,820
I heard that

832
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,970
you amazed the judges at the interview.

833
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,320
Not only can you read fast,

834
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,060
you also have a good memory.

835
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,870
And you even improvised

836
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,680
a Russian poem. This is quite impressive.

837
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,790
I'm flattered.

838
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,500
I'll leave him to you from now on.

839
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,850
Mr. Zhao, don't worry.

840
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,130
I will tell him everything

841
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,560
and teach him everything.

842
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,900
With Zhang's talent,

843
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,850
it won't be long

844
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,450
before he can handle everything himself.

845
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,100
OK.

846
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,620
Come on.

847
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,890
Keep working.

848
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,160
-Don't worry, Mr. Zhao. -Take care, Mr Zhao.

849
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,830
Goodbye, Mr Zhao.

850
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,700
Tian Bin from the game world

851
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,490
is not a gamer.

852
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,180
Mr. Tian,

853
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,550
what should I do?

854
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,970
What should you do?

855
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,950
Didn't Mr. Zhao say

856
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,830
you should arrange something to do for me?

857
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,060
Right.

858
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,330
Every morning at 9,

859
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,620
when I sit here,

860
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,660
I hope my breakfast is ready.

861
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,620
I want soy milk every Monday, Wednesday and Friday

862
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,930
and porridge every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

863
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,760
As for the main food, you can choose whatever you want.

864
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,630
Make it light

865
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,750
and not too greasy.

866
00:37:59,170 --> 00:37:59,570
Also,

867
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,300
after breakfast,

868
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,870
I hope my manuscript

869
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,220
has been proofread.

870
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,660
I think your assistant should be doing this.

871
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,260
Then you are...

872
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,490
Mr. Zhao said

873
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,920
you should arrange some work for me.

874
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,190
I've already arranged it.

875
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,090
Where should I sit?

876
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,910
Yeah, you...

877
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,910
Right here.

878
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,580
Look.

879
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,560
It's full here.

880
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,040
You can sit here.

881
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,120
This is the company's best place.

882
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,340
Look, soundproof.

883
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,780
It's my first day at work.

884
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,020
I will put up with it.
