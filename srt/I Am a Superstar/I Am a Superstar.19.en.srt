Just because you know some kungfu,

you just bully the others,

I don't want to draw, I just want to learn martial arts.

31
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,060
It'd be best for unlocking the acupoints.

32

Any recommendations?

33
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,310

Luck depends on character.

Besides, I'm a man.

128

I'm under a lot of pressure.

Stop persuading me.

138

the business is too complicated

153
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,770
and I shouldn't get involved?

154
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,210
I can do it myself.

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,770
Anyway, I can live.

156
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,450
Besides,

157
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,260
even if I

158
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,980
work here for the rest of my life,

159
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,130
it is good, isn't it?

160
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,130
How happy we are making dumplings here.

No.

You can't stay here

174
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,820
Everything about people's relation

175
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,740
and snobbery,

176
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,210
I saw it clearly.

177
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,990
Those snobbish

178
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,450
who fawned on me

179
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,010
are now

180
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,090
far away from me, aren't they?

181
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,260
Why should I go there

182
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,300
and be despised?

183
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,970
You can't say that.

184
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,100
Right?

185
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,970
Qi

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,330
meant well.

187
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,130
It's for your own good.

188
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,460
Go. Go.

189
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,310
You really agree to let me go?

190
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,730
Aren't you afraid that

191
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,090
she's after me?

192
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,530
What?

193
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,260
Are you waiting for her

194
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,420
to use the honey trap for you?

195
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,420
Yes, honey trap.

196
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,770
If I keep doing this,

197
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,650
will she use the honey trap

198
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,530
to me?

199
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,470
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

200
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,420
In this world,

201
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,250
only what you do to me is honey trap.

202
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,520
What others use

203
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,690
is just a bitter trap.

204
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,130
Don't worry.

205
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,570
I will keep myself safe.

206
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:49,740
Go.

207
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,830
I'm really going?

208
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,480
Go. Don't bother me at home.

If a dog bites someone,

315
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,290
will the dog apologize

317
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,080

you did it first,

330

Li Anxu and his bodyguards

331
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,200
did wrongs at first.

332
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,780
It's understandable

333
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,260
that you helped the one who was pushed down by him.

334
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,619
Li Anxu went to the hospital for a medical check-up.

335

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,330
the damage you caused

340
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,860

Let me put it this way.

343
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,890
Li Anxu's injury is not bad,

344
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,020
but not mild.

345
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,090

346
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,140
he won't accept it.

347
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,940
But according to the procedures here

348
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,620
to solve it,

349
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,150
the matter can be regarded either big or small,

350
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,730
and it all depends on your attitude to admit your mistake.

351
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,600
Who started it?

352
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,690
How many people were involved?

353
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,410
Did they hit you?

354
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,380
I admit.

355
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,740
Li Anxu

356
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,620
and his bodyguards

357
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,690
were all hit by me.

358
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,170
You did it?

359
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,850
But his bodyguards...

360
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,440
Yes, I did it.

361
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,100
The footprint on Li Anxu was stepped by me.

362
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,060
I also twisted his arm

363
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,970
and broke his leg.

364
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,790
I also scratched

365
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,650
on his bodyguard's face.

366
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,810
You hit so many people alone.

367
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,170
I was overwhelmed.

368
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,120
Anyway, look.

369
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,810
I've come here.

370
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,140
I just want to admit my mistake.

371
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,170
You can punish me

372
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,930

373
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,450
I will listen to you.

374
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,620

375
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,460
Okay.

376

378
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,230
I don't understand

379
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,470
why you still drove drunk.

380
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,230
There are so many designated drivers nowadays.

381

382

After you came in,

383
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,270
should your wife and children be worried about you?

384
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,700
Will your job be gone?

385
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,570
If you get 12 points deducted,

386
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,440
will the driving licence be gone also?

387
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,170
What were you thinking?

388
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,260
Drive without drinking.

389
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,870
If you drink, don't drive.

390
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,570
What if

391
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,540
something happens to you?

392
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,870
If it is small, it's okay.

393
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,710
What if you hit someone

394
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,820
and they die?

395
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,090
What should we do?

396
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,210
It concerns

397
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,320
another family.

398
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,500
And it is caused by you drinking.

399
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,260
Do you understand

400
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,430
what I just said?

401
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,060
Repeat it.

402
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,500
What do you mean by turning around?

403
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,540
How can you avoid me?

404
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,450
Why don't you take it seriously since you are here?

405
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,400
Reflect on yourself.

406
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,380
What will you do in the future?

407
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:37,960
I think you look kind

408
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,700

I'm helping you.

411

You say,

412
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,570
if you meet someone

413
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,510
who sneers at you,

414
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,180
you must be very upset, right?

I'm just putting myself in your shoes.

If you didn't listen,

419

I'll tell you again.

Right?

424
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,100
You insisted on driving drunk.

425

You drove drunk now.

Your wife and children are worried.

And if the leader knows,

428
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,060
you'll lose your job.

429
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,660
Your driver's license will be revoked.

430

Drink without driving.

431
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,880
If you drink, don't drive.

You're detained to reflect on yourself,

not to sober up.

434

You can't get out

Do you have alcoholic liver disease?

these days,

474

I've reflected on myself

475
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,540
and thought deeply

476
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,450

for my actions.

478

I'd like to

seriously criticize myself in front of you.

I feel

481
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,380
this is

482
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,620
a very dangerous tendency.

483
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,650
It's also

484
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,170
a very bad potential.

485
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,140
If I continue to be careless

486
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,740
and develop it,

487
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,780

and make a deep self-criticism.

Please learn from me.

If you can be reasonable,

494
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,230
try not to quarrel.

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,380
have a line.

522
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,330
I'll pat it for you later.

523
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,330
Maybe it's gone.

524
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,570
It's dirty.

525
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,380
Let me scratch it down for you.

526
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,280
Don't move.

527
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,170
Don't pick it. It hurts.

528
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,380
It hurts.

529
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,260
This is a mole.

530
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,830
You are sweet again.

531
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,810
What are you doing here?

532
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,720
Zhang Ye almost got arrested because of you.

533
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,720
How dare you come here?

534
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,420
I think he should thank me.

535
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:52,950
Look online.

536
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,670
He's a hero now.

537
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,260
His reputation is back.

538
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,210
I didn't expect you

539
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,710
to make a comeback like this.

540
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:02,800
Look.

541
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,480
This is your chance.

542
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,150
[Hero of Fist of Fury]

543
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,980
What is this?

544
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,850
Director Chen Baige’s new play.

545
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,450
He invites you to play a role.

546
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,970
[Hero of Fist of Fury]

547
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,850
The international director Chen?

548
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,730
Who else?

549
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,450
You are in it too, right?

550
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,500
He invited me to be the leading actress.

551
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,090
Did you recommend Zhang Ye

552
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,110
to Director Chen?

553
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,540
Not this time.

554
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,430
The director invited him

555
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,890
because of the incident this time.

556
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,840
Really?

557
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,540
The script is here.

558
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,960
Think about it.

559
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,230
I...

560
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,260
I'm not going.

561
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,290
Go.

562
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,410
I'm not going.

563
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,970
Acting is a waste of time.

564
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,740
Go ahead.

565
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,430
Isn't Director Chen your idol?

566
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,270
I can't just go there casually.

567
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:14,630
Right?

568
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,810
We need to see the characters.

569
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,050
Director Chen's recent audition

570
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,170
is indeed problematic.

571
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,380
What are you looking at?

572
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,550
This is a great opportunity.

573
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,570
Go. You can go.

574
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,270
You really agree to let me go?

575
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,810
I'll do as you say.

576
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,810
Go.

577
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,210
Let's read this together.

578
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,450
This sentence.

579
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,430
Why are you taking off your clothes?

580
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,700
Right, I don't know.

581
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,950
This may be a

582
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,180
special treatment of the director.

583
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,560
You have to video call me every night.

584
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,950
So sweet.

585
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,130
We need a video call no matter how late it is.

586
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,330
Why did you...

587
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,870
And don't slack off.

588
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,980
Brush your teeth.

589
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,890
Okay.

590
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,220
Chi'ou, don't slack off.

591
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,270
Remember to brush your teeth.

592
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,170
You too.

593
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,570
Don't be too tired.

594
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,850
Let Chenchen do some errands.

595
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,320
She's not a child anymore.

596
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,780
Okay.

597
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,980
Call me anytime.

598
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,170
Eat well.

599
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,480
And sleep well.

600
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:18,810
I'm leaving.

601
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,500
Go.

602
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,370
Bye. Bye.

603
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,290
Bye.

604
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,930
Give it to me.

605
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,690
Aunt.

606
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,530
As Zhang Ye leaves this time,

607
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,070
it will be two or three months.

608
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,220
Do you think he can make it?

609
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,700
Don't worry.

610
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,020
Zhang Yuanqi is there, right?

611
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,210
He won't suffer.

612
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,930
You're right.

613
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,850
He works for Zhang Yuanqi.

614
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,140
Others won't

615
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,160
make him suffer.

616
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,510
Who's working for Zhang Yuanqi?

617
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,320
Go do your homework.

618
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,480
Come on. Yes.

619
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,160
Let go of your movements.

620
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,920
More.

621
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,900
Come on. Pull.

622
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,200
Okay.

623
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,020
Don't move the camera.

624
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,020
Keep it.

625
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,180
Go. Go.

626
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,380
Yes. Pull.

627
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,560
Release.

628
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:39,840
Okay.

629
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,330
Here, let's add another one.

630
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,820
The filming is fake.

631
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,380
How's the preparation going?

632
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,730
You have a lot of lines today.

633
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,840
Don't worry, Qi.

634
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,620
Everything is ready.

635
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,500
Zhang. Zhang.

636
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,540
The script has been changed

637
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,660
and added a page. Please take a look.

638
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,300
Why did my lines get deleted?

639
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,700
Yes, get ready.

640
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,860
We'll shoot the next scene, okay?

641
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,260
I've prepared for nothing

642
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,260
for so long.

643
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,490
I'll tell the director.

644
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,070
Just do

645
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,850
as the director says.

646
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,170
It's a test of acting if you don't have many lines.

647
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,330
Get ready.

648
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,090
Scene 23, Shooting 1, First time.

649
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,050
What era is it now?

650
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,480
It's still old-fashioned.

651
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,430
Chinese traditional martial arts are profound.

652
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,700
How about we have a try?

653
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,330
Sure.

654
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
If I win,

655
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,910
you'll learn western boxing from me.

656
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:54,970
If I win,

657
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,240
you stake stand with me.

658
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,870
Come on.

659
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,860
Stop, stop, stop.

660
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,010
Zhang Ye, you played

661
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,280
a man of martial artist family.

662
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,870
Why are you acting like noodles?

663
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,700
Martial art guide, Xuesong,

664
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,620
please give him more guidance.

665
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,490
Okay, director.

666
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,750
No, director.

667
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,380
Isn't my role rebellious?

668
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,740
I...

669
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,310
Do as I say.

670
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,170
No kicking.

671
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,930
Director, I'm ready.

672
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,450
I'm ready.

673
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,010
Let's do it again.

674
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,080
But this character...

675
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:27,670
Back to the original position.

676
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,400
Stand still. No kicking.

677
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,200
Go back to your place.

678
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,160
Have the board.

679
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,450
The board, log keeper.

680
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,920
Ready. Ready. Action.

681
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,530
Record.

682
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,410
Scene 23, Shooting 1, Second time.

683
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,670
What era is it now?

684
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,210
You still follow the rules.

685
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,860
Chinese traditional martial arts are profound.

686
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,540
How about we have a try?

687
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,490
Sure.

688
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,720
If I win,

689
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,420
you'll play western boxing with me.

690
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,570
If I win,

691
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,060
you'll stake stand with me.

692
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,460
Come on.

693
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,030
Stop, stop, stop.

694
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,690
What now, director?

695
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,380
Zhang Ye, you are getting beaten.

696
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,460
What's with that face?

697
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,850
Why doesn't it seem to be painful at all?

698
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,180
No, I'm fine.

699
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:09,940
Again.

700
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,570
I see.

701
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,410
This is exaggerating, director.

702
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,580
Do as I say.

703
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,210
Back to your place.

704
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,630
Come on, guys.

705
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,410
Back to your place.

706
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,700
Come on, log keeper. The board.

707
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,360
The machine is ready.

708
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,040
The machine is ready.

709
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,330
Ready.

710
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,020
Good. Good.

711
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:23,980
Ready.

712
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,020
Scene 23, Shooting 1, Third time.

713
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,180
Ready, three, two, one, go!

714
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,540
What era is it now?

715
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,230
You still follow the rules.

716
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,090
Chinese traditional martial arts are profound.

717
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,570
How about we give it a try?

718
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,740
Okay.

719
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,770
If I win,

720
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,280
you'll learn western boxing from me.

721
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,210
If I win,

722
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,430
you'll stake stand with me.

723
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,080
Come on.

724
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,660
Cut.

725
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,320
Zhang Ye, what are you acting?

726
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,570
Well, my expression followed the guidance of...

727
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,730
The light is not working.

728
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,850
You're wasting time.

729
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,260
Of the martial arts guide...

730
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,410
Come on, take a rest.

731
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,330
Song.

732
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,540
Director! Director!

733
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,250
Director, over here.

734
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,900
Do it. Hurry up.

735
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,600
Your movements...

736
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,460
Don't jump.

737
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,690
Just hit me. Harder.

738
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,600
I did it directly.

739
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,990
Then you react like this.

740
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:20,620
I...

741
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,290
Control your expression.

742
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,930
I learned it from you.

743
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,980
Be serious, okay?

744
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,540
There's no light.

745
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,690
Look at the sun.

746
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,860
Makeup. Makeup.

747
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,930
Fix his makeup.

748
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,690
Grab his hair a little more.

749
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,380
Cut.

750
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,290
Cut.

751
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,410
Again. Again.

752
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:44,690
Cut.

753
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,790
Hello, is acting tiring?

754
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,230
No, I'm telling you.

755
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,260
I didn't practice

756
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,370
for nothing these days.

757
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
For me, this acting

758
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,530
is just like warming up.

759
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,140
You've never learned acting.

760
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,750
The director must scold you every day.

761
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,980
I finally understand

762
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,100
about acting.

763
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,770
The most important thing is talent.

764
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,190
For me,

765
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,740
it's just a piece of cake.

766
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,030
I know how to do it without a teacher now.

767
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,450
Stop bragging.

768
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,210
Acting as the fourth male lead, and you're in the sky?

769
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,580
Are you acting all the reactions?

770
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,480
Maybe all your acting

771
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,780
will be cut in the end.

772
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,480
I may not have many scenes,

773
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,740
but these

774
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,330
are all eye-catching.

775
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,960
If the director really

776
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,510
cut my part,

777
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,650
that means the director

778
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,080
is not good enough.

779
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,320
However,

780
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,040
the martial arts guidance

781
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,100
of our play is not good.

782
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,030
The tricks he uses

783
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,470
are very old.

784
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,940
If he fights with you,

785
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,620
he will be beaten within three moves.

786
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,190
Of course.

787
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:03,740
Who is it?

788
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,660
Qi wants to see you.

789
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,540
I have something to do.

790
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,330
I have to go.

791
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,220
It's late.

792
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,710
What are you thinking? Let's go.

793
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,690
Qi,

794
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,310
you are still up at this hour?

795
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,710
Nan told me

796
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,250
the martial arts guide has high requirements for you.

797
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,910
Nan, you've been

798
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,010
wandering around the crew

799
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,970
and don't do your business

800
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,160
and just gossip.

801
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,940
Maybe yes. I...

802
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,030
The guide and I

803
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,300
often discuss together.

804
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,540
We may have

805
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,450
different opinions sometimes.

806
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,290
Maybe Nan saw it.

807
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,420
Don't worry, Qi.

808
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,380
I know

809
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,720
how hard it is for you

810
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,660
to get this role for me.

811
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,330
I'll work hard and obey the orders.

812
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,690
I'll do whatever they say.

813
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,300
Although I introduced you,

814
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,690
I can't be biased towards you.

815
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,929
You have to work hard

816
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,290
with your own efforts to get everyone's recognition.

817
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,780
Yes, I understand.

818
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,210
Qi, tomorrow,

819
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,639
I have a big scene.

820
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,469
I will work hard

821
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,760
through my efforts and get the recognition of the director.

822
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,580
I'll go back and get ready.

823
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,400
Rest early.

824
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,190
Call and ask

825
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,570
what's going on.

826
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,590
Can they film it?

827
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,470
Okay, director.

828
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,040
Qi, what's wrong?

829
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,150
What happened?

830
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,410
Why aren't you working?

831
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,840
I don't think we can shoot today.

832
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,400
Why?

833
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,950
I heard there are two wanted murderers

834
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,220
of the city

835
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,740
be reported by the villagers.

836
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,140
They saw them

837
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:18,930
at our scene.

838
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,890
The police have blocked

839
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,890
the whole mountain

840
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,990
and are searching.

841
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,130
What should we do?

842
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,210
I have a big scene today.

843
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,450
I've been preparing all night.

844
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,210
What's going on?

845
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,150
Sister, call and ask.

846
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,310
Why are you standing there?

847
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,710
I'm asking, director.

848
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,340
Director, no one answered.

849
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,490
Let me ask again.

850
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,340
We must finish

851
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,220
the scene of the village today.

852
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,490
The scene will be changed today.

853
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,860
Ask the villagers

854
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,320
if anyone can

855
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,540
take us in from another way, okay?

856
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,390
Okay.

857
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,990
Director, it's done.

858
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,690
We can start now.

859
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,940
Great! Great!

860
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,500
Let's get to work.

861
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,300
Let's start.

862
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:00,730
Qi.

863
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,210
Those who raise the stick,

864
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,930
come here.

865
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,350
Come on. Raise your stick.

866
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,340
The shoot is about to start.

867
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,200
Where are the props?

868
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,330
Are the props for the next scene ready?

869
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,210
We'll start soon. Don't make any mistakes.

870
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,230
Hurry up. The shoot is about to start.

871
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,740
Where's my board? Hurry up.

872
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,760
It's ready.

873
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,930
We'll start soon.

874
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,400
Please take a rest over there.

875
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,910
Have the two fugitives been caught?

876
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,920
I heard not yet.

877
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,420
Is it safe to film here?

878
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,450
Don't worry.

879
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,920
There are so many people in our crew.

880
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,020
If we meet them,

881
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,280
we can get them and be rewarded.

882
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,450
You're right.

883
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,100
My Lady.

884
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,850
Master asked me to take you home.

885
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,540
Go back and tell him

886
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,540
I won't go back anymore.

887
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,180
What? Do you want to fight?

888
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,870
Cut.

889
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,850
Director.

890
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,890
When we went up the mountain,

891
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:56,650
the actor sprained his ankle

892
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,430
and cannot act.

893
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,940
What?

894
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,250
Okay, I got it.

895
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,820
Let's get ready for the next scene.

896
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,790
Thank you, Qi.

897
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,420
Thank you.

898
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,020
I'll get some rest.

899
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,690
Wait, Qi.

900
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,310
Can you do me a favor?

901
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,120
Can you leave the handsome guy

902
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,290
behind you for me to take a role?

903
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:17,810
Is that OK?

904
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,980
Please.

905
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,260
I have to go down the mountain with Qi.

906
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,330
That's easy.

907
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,380
Someone will accompany her.

908
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,340
Come on, clothing girl.

909
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,930
Come here.

910
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,690
Coming, Director.

911
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,240
Go accompany her to the mountain.

912
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,540
Keep her good company.

913
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,100
Okay.

914
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,880
Qi, is that okay?

915
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,940
Let me do it, Nan.

916
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,550
I'll go down by myself.

917
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,540
What am I playing?

918
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,220
You play an outcast.

919
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,720
Come on. Dress him up.

920
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,130
Dress him up.

921
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,220
Director, bad news!

922
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:01,870
It's filming. What's going on?

923
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,500
Director, bad news.

924
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,060
Something happened to Qi.

925
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,570
We were halfway down the mountain.

926
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,440
But the two fugitives

927
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,270
hid nearby

928
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,570
and kidnapped her.

929
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,790
How do you know they are two fugitives?

930
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,950
Who would carry a knife

931
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,760
to the mountain?

932
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,680
It must be them.

933
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,400
They have knives.

934
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,020
Hurry up!

935
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,380
Grab your weapons. Hurry up.

936
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,390
Save Qi.

937
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,290
Hurry up.

938
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:17,930
No, this...

939
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,900
Hurry.

940
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,200
Hurry up.

941
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,580
Nan. Nan.

942
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,040
You go there. I’ll go upstairs.

943
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,840
Be careful.

944
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,340
Hurry up.

945
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,080
Let's go.

946
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,750
Hurry up. This way.

947
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,170
Hurry!

948
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,340
Hurry!

949
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,060
Over there.

950
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,100
You idiot.

951
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,540
How many times have I told you?

952
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,110
The police didn't notice us for so many days.

953
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,280
If we hang in there for a few more days,

954
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,450
we can leave.

955
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,200
Why did you kidnap that woman

956
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,620
and make such a fuss?

957
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,660
It'll be harder

958
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,870
for us to withdraw.

959
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,450
Do you understand?

960
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,340
With a hostage,

961
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,750
the police won't dare to arrest us.

962
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,170
It will be easier for us

963
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,250
to escape.

964
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:12,690
Bullshit!

965
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,160
How can we escape with her?

966
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,250
She's just a burden.

967
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,130
At this point,

968
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,030
we have to kill her

969
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,220
before the police come.

970
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,250
No.

971
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:20,880
Zhang Ye!

972
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,330
Don't move!

973
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,320
Help me!

974
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,530
I'll kill you if you shout again.

975
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,840
Don't shout! I'll kill you!

976
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,820
Who do you want to kill?

977
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,830
Don't touch her!

978
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,580
Zhang Ye, watch out!

979
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,820
Zhang Ye!

980
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,220
Brother, you...

981
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,440
Don't move!

982
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,430
I'll kill her if you come closer.

983
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,130
I told you not to move!

984
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,170
I'll kill her if you move! Don't move!

985
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,460
Don't move.

986
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,670
Qi, are you okay?

987
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,630
Protect Qi.

988
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,130
Qi, are you okay?

989
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,050
Let's go. Fight.

990
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,890
Call the police!

991
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,570
What do they do?

992
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,240
I heard they're in a movie.

993
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,580
Action movie.

994
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,450
They booked

995
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,490
the whole village.

996
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,130
They just have no place to spend money.

997
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,580
There's nothing to film

998
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,730
in our place.

999
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,020
That's right.

1000
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:07,890
Come on, brother.

1001
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,500
Come on.

1002
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,890
Here, have some more.

1003
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,390
Thank you.

1004
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,040
To be honest,

1005
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,120
when I heard

1006
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,500
about the fugitives,

1007
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,360
I...

1008
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,180
I was really nervous.

1009
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,440
I had no appetite

1010
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,420
and I couldn't act well.

1011
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,660
You really solved a big problem

1012
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
for me.

1013
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,630
It's nothing.

1014
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,700
Zhang Ye, I didn't know

1015
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,770
you're also a master of martial arts.

1016
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,380
You didn't show yourself in the group.

1017
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,790
How many times have I scolded you

1018
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,600
but you didn't reply.

1019
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,160
Everyone has its own field.

1020
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,450
Fighting is fighting.

1021
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,740
Filming is filming

1022
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,290
Thank you for today.

1023
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:43,680
Here.

1024
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,390
Here.

1025
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,400
I'm really old.

1026
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,980
If I were ten years younger,

1027
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,480
I could beat ten of them.

1028
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,030
Fine.

1029
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060
Yes.

1030
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,120
That's it. Bottoms up.

1031
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,720
Cheers.

1032
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:58,990
Director.

1033
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,700
Come on.

1034
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,780
Brother, I don't want to drink anymore.

1035
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,090
If I drink again,

1036
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,310
I won't be able to go back.

1037
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,700
It's not close to the end yet.

1038
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,460
Fill it up.

1039
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,150
That's right.

1040
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:08,910
I really cannot drink.

1041
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,400
Why didn't I see Qi?

1042
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,470
She must be scared.

1043
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,520
She hasn't recovered yet.

1044
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,630
I'll go check on her.

1045
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,490
You two drink first.

1046
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,120
Drink for a while.

1047
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,550
Well...

1048
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,430
You eat first.

1049
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:20,940
Come on.

1050
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,590
Come on, Director.

1051
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,210
Tell me.

1052
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,870
If you don't like Zhang Yuanqi,

1053
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,800
I won't believe it.

1054
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,190
Let's go for a drink.

1055
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,450
I'm not in the mood.

1056
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,250
What's wrong?

1057
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,260
I've been with her for so long.

1058
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,170
I never let her

1059
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,040
suffer in any danger.

1060
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,850
With the accident today,

1061
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,980
how can I face her?

1062
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,240
Nothing happened.

1063
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,120
Besides,

1064
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,070
didn't you save her?

1065
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,220
I didn’t expect that

1066
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,320
you are also emotional.

1067
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,020
I'll go in and see her.
