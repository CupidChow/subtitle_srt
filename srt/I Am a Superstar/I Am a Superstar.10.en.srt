4
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,289
Can you eat more?

5
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,420
Auntie, I really can't eat.

6
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,250
Your cooking

7
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,060
doesn't seem to make me have an appetite.

8
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,740
You and Zhang Ye

9
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,210
eat too much street stalls food.

10
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,970
It's all Zhang Ye's fault.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,990
He kept feeding me

12
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,950
with crayfish.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,060
Don't blame him.

14
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,610
Every time you go out

15
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,280
and eat street stall food,

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,330
you must be the one who make the proposal.

17
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,940
Auntie.

18
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,419
How can you speak for Zhang Ye?

19
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,870
Am I wrong?

20
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,060
Zhang Ye is brainless.

21
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,360
He's so innocent.

22
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,900
You're a bad influence.

23
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,890
Zhang Ye is innocent.

24
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,900
You've never met him before?

25
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,130
Zhang Ye is not as bad as you said.

26
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,630
Yes, ugly, stupid.

27
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,890
Inconsiderate.

28
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,660
He's actually a good person.

29
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,300
So cheesy.

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,030
Stop eating.

31
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,060
Zhang Ye.

32
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,760
Let's have skewers tonight.

33
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,250
Chenchen.

34
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,700
What's the situation

35
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,310
with your aunt?

36
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,140
Auntie praised you

37
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,220
a lot.

38
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,650
Really?

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,980
She doesn't usually praise me.

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,060
Zhang Ye.

41
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,420
Can you be more considerate?

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,140
Can't you tell?

43
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,060
She wants you to

44
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,700
give her an out.

45
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,290
Can't you take the initiative?

46
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,610
How?

47
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,140
Be friendly

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,590
and make a compromise.

49
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,650
Why doesn't she do it?

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,220
You don't understand women's thoughts.

51
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,810
Preparing flowers

52
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,250
and sweet words

53
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,110
will be enough.

54
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,140
Flowers and sweet words.

55
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,530
I need to practice the sweet talk.

56
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,340
Help yourself.

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,980
I'll buy you more if it's not enough.

58
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,370
If anything happens,

59
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,010
tell me immediately.

60
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,220
Sure.

61
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,649
Did he really say that?

62
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,770
He said

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,180
he is very busy now.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,530
But he has been thinking about you

65
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,790
and Chi'ou.

66
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,290
He has a conscience.

67
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,150
So,

68
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,090
he insisted on coming back.

69
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,500
He has to come to apologize tonight.

70
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,180
Tonight?

71
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,460
Who allowed him

72
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,210
to apologize tonight?

73
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,180
Did I agree?

74
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,490
You don't want him to come?

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,300
These days,

76
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,020
he has been nowhere to be found.

77
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,490
Isn't he living a carefree life?

78
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,740
Actually,

79
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,770
he hasn't been well

80
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,300
lately.

81
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,330
He doesn't want to eat or drink.

82
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,330
He has lost weight.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,480
No matter how delicious the food outside is,

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,360
it's not as delicious as yours.

85
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,180
Right?

86
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,230
He's still so picky.

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,140
There's nothing in our house.

88
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,280
Go buy some.

89
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,810
Aunt,

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,190
don't forget to bring me a bottle of yogurt.

91
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,010
Okay.

92
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,860
Zhang Ye, come home for dinner tonight.

93
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,450
Don't be shy.

94
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,210
I'll eat mine.

95
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,130
You guys continue.

96
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,050
You too.

97
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,610
It's okay.

98
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,180
It looks good.

99
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,370
The dishes are cooked well.

100
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,790
Let's eat.

101
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,280
Eat.

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,170
Eat it.

103
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,870
No, no.

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,770
My stomach hurts.

105
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,340
Go on. Go on.

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
Go on.

107
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,810
Chenchen told me

108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,650
you are quite busy lately.

109
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,580
Not bad.

110
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,860
Why didn't you tell me

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,440
about the hotel decoration?

112
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,160
I'll definitely come and help.

113
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,880
You are so busy.

114
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,990
I can't always bother you.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,180
You seem to

116
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,720
lose weight lately.

117
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,290
Really?

118
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,990
Is the food outside

119
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,390
not good?

120
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,300
It's just that I haven't eaten your food

121
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,770
for a long time.

122
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,330
No.

123
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,420
Can I eat now?

124
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,210
Hurry up.

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,320
It'll get cold. Look.

126
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,330
Eat more.

127
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,140
This is not bad.

128
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,900
Eat more meat.

129
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,650
Well,

130
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,640
you should have told me

131
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,090
earlier, right?

132
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,400
Yes, you...

133
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,310
-You don't have to wait that long. -Right.

134
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,250
Delicious.

135
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Eat more.

136
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,950
I heard that you are not in a good spirit

137
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,930
lately.

138
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,990
Is something bothering you?

139
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,420
Aunt, why is there no tissue?

140
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,650
There's no tissue.

141
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,090
It's in the cabinet. Find it yourself.

142
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,700
So annoying.

143
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,810
Go on.

144
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,620
It's not bothering.

145
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,020
How should I put it?

146
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,360
I just

147
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,560
don't feel like eating or drinking.

148
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,020
Look.

149
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,160
Why? Why?

150
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,750
Why?

151
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,160
Why else?

152
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,370
It's all because of you.

153
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,370
You should know

154
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,860
I just started my career.

155
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,930
I have a lot of fans and a lot of pressure at work.

156
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,930
A female fan keeps

157
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,800
following me every day.

158
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,450
I can't wait to find a substitute.

159
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,270
Zhang Ye is such a fool.

160
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,650
That's all?

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,540
That's what you want to say

162
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,350
when you came back?

163
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,170
Are you jealous again?

164
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,380
I can see

165
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,260
your thoughts.

166
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,970
Stop kidding. What am I thinking?

167
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,990
What other thoughts do you have?

168
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Zhang Yuanqi and I

169
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,890
are really colleagues.

170
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,890
Nothing else.

171
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,250
You two keep flirting.

172
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,880
You even said that I have thoughts.

173
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,860
No, I'm not flirting with her.

174
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,940
I've been explaining to you,

175
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,570
but you didn't listen.

176
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,570
Explain what?

177
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,890
What's there to explain?

178
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,180
Who's blind? Can't you see?

179
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,260
Look, this again.

180
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,740
You two talk it out.

181
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,620
I've finished anyway.

182
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,550
Have a good chat.

183
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,220
Have a good chat.

184
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,680
Zhang Ye.

185
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,770
If there's nothing else, you can leave.

186
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,260
Okay, go ahead.

187
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,860
You are so busy.

188
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,200
No one will stop you.

189
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,060
Chenchen.

190
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,880
She was the one who kicked me out

191
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,490
and insisted that I ran out on my own.

192
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,180
She is talking nonsense.

193
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,740
Well.

194
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,320
What's wrong of me kicking you out?

195
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,660
You deserve it.

196
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,730
Why?

197
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,050
Interesting.

198
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,620
You waited for me

199
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,460
so badly.

200
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,770
I'm coming over for dinner.

201
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,060
Why are you so cold to me?

202
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,570
No, Zhang Ye.

203
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,420
Shame on you!

204
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,180
How am I shameless?

205
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,450
If you hadn't told Chenchen

206
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,300
you wanted to go back,

207
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,770
kneel down, and apologize to me.

208
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,180
how could I cook?

209
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,940
It is interesting.

210
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,260
Chenchen told me everything.

211
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,450
She said that you have a crush on me.

212
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,940
She...

213
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,980
I'm going to the toilet for a while.

214
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,450
You cooked so many dishes for me.

215
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,500
I see.

216
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,890
I know how you feel.

217
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,500
But with your personality,

218
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,260
and temper,

219
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,710
you should control yourself.

220
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,260
Shut up.

221
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,090
You have a crush. You can have a crush on me.

222
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,690
Shut up!

223
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,420
-Chenchen told me everything. -How dare you point at me?

224
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,260
How dare you point at me again?

225
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,210
Rao Aimin.

226
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,820
You...

227
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,250
Are you still pointing at me?

228
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Still pointing at me?

229
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,740
Damn you!

230
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,550
[Shiyi Hospital]

231
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,180
Why is there no mirror

232
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,860
in this room?

233
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:01,890
Nurse.

234
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,750
Does any of you have a mirror?

235
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,860
I do.

236
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,410
Can I borrow it?

237
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,860
Why do you need a mirror?

238
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,130
Everyone has the heart of beauty.

239
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,860
I'll return it to you later.

240
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,450
Okay.

241
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,980
Thank you.

242
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,020
That tigress.

243
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,420
If I don't

244
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,620
teach her a lesson,

245
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,500
I won’t be Zhang.

246
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Mestinon.

247
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,650
Fast combat training.

248
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,420
Zhang Ye.

249
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,740
Why are you here?

250
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,820
Where's your aunt?

251
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,930
What are you up to now?

252
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,270
How can I be worse than your aunt?

253
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,060
If she missed a little more,

254
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,940
I'll be paralyzed.

255
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,120
You deserve it.

256
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,210
My aunt made that rib soup.

257
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,060
She said

258
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,170
she is afraid that the dog will have diarrhea after drinking it.

259
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,900
It's a waste to pour it away.

260
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,720
She can only give it to you.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,150
Tell her.

262
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,070
I won't forgive her.

263
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,300
No need.

264
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,380
Get well soon.

265
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,510
Apologize to my aunt.

266
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,220
Apologize? Impossible.

267
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,070
In 100 days,

268
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,850
we will fight at the peak of the Forbidden City.

269
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,740
Chenchen is here too.

270
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,940
Business talk?

271
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,220
I'll leave now.

272
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,510
Take care. Goodbye.

273
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,010
You little brat.

274
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,620
What's wrong with you?

275
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,770
Nothing serious.

276
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,870
I accidentally hit a tree.

277
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,030
I'll be fine in a few days.

278
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,810
Who is this?

279
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,490
Let me introduce.

280
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,820
This is Zhang Ye.

281
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,640
This is Mr. Xiang from the Best Snail Company.

282
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,940
-Hello. Nice to meet you. -Hello. Hello.

283
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:01,620
You...

284
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,620
It's just a minor injury.

285
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,550
I'll be fine in a few days.

286
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,130
This is troublesome.

287
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,260
Mr. Zhang,

288
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,620
we want to invite you

289
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,530
to endorse an advertisement.

290
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,500
But you...

291
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,690
Yes, Zhang Ye.

292
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,410
Mr. Xiang is my best friend.

293
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,290
You must think of a way.

294
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,010
To be honest,

295
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,740
our advertisement is a bit urgent.

296
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,260
We want to take advantage of

297
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,810
MC Cat's popularity

298
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,890
to promote our game.

299
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,500
What kind of ad are you shooting?

300
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,450
Best Snail.

301
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,210
Best Snail.

302
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,300
I've played this game before.

303
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,090
My snail

304
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,450
has evolved several levels.

305
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,680
There is

306
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,300
a solution.

307
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,020
How about this?

308
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,050
Put your advertisement

309
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,810
on my bandage.

310
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,350
It goes wherever I go.

311
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,780
I'll show it.

312
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,920
Good idea.

313
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,990
Will it work?

314
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,620
Everyone has posted small advertisements.

315
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,150
All of our audiences.

316
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,010
Hello, everyone.

317
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,380
Welcome to the big variety show.

318
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,300
Super Loud.

319
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,330
This is

320
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,420
your own stage.

321
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,610
If you have a music dream,

322
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,570
if you like music,

323
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,240
this stage belongs to you.

324
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,810
The stage, the professional team,

325
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,180
superstar mentors and sharp comments.

326
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,940
As long as you are ambitious,

327
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,570
you can join the famous teachers' team

328
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,890
and start a music life.

329
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,820
What are you waiting for?

330
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,890
Super loud, sing a good future.

331
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,760
Mr. Zhang Ye,

332
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,940
I heard that the price your advertisement position

333
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,330
has hit hundreds of thousands.

334
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,970
What do you think about it?

335
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,380
First of all, I didn't expect

336
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,860
my advertisement position

337
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,570
is so popular.

338
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,290
And the demand has exceeded

339
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,240
the supply.

340
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,050
So,

341
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,260
my arm is not feeling well lately.

342
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,380
So I hope the advertisers

343
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
won't be too anxious.

344
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,450
Many positions

345
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,530
will be available soon.

346
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,570
Sir,

347
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,860
can I take a photo with you?

348
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,980
Of course. Here.

349
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,010
Brother.

350
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,680
Why are you here?

351
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,620
I'm here for a show.

352
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,650
So I came to see you.

353
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,730
I saw this in the ad.

354
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,570
Be careful.

355
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,060
Be gentle. It hurts.

356
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,220
Really?

357
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,610
Yes.

358
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,690
I fell down

359
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,500
the stairs

360
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,290
and hurt my arm.

361
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,010
My goodness.

362
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,060
I'll ask my mom

363
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,420
to make you some bone soup.

364
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,450
No, no.

365
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,320
I'll take a rest now

366
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,190
and take care of myself.

367
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,460
Okay, take a rest.

368
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
Thank sister-in-law for taking care of you.

369
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,270
Right?

370
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,950
Sister-in-law?

371
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,450
Aren't you having an affair

372
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,890
with your female landlord?

373
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,430
What? What?

374
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,690
I...

375
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,740
I'm moving out.

376
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,090
Where do you live?

377
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,420
I'm staying here.

378
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,860
The rest area. Isn't it good?

379
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:04,490
You...

380
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,130
You're injured.

381
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,210
You live here alone?

382
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,070
Are you crazy? Let's go.

383
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,210
Come home with me.

384
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,060
You can't live here alone.

385
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,330
You need someone to take care of you. Go.

386
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,690
Hurry up.

387
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,550
Be good.

388
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,210
I'll ask my mom

389
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,530
to make bone soup for you.

390
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
I'll call her later.

391
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,680
Here, Chenchen.

392
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,800
You stewed so much soup, auntie.

393
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,440
I just bought too much. It's okay.

394
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,530
We can't eat it.

395
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,360
Send some to your classmates later.

396
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,360
I think you want to give it to Zhang Ye.

397
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,680
Who will give it to him?

398
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,940
I can feed the dog.

399
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,380
Enough.

400
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,860
I know what you're thinking.

401
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,700
But Zhang Ye

402
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,720
was discharged long ago.

403
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,440
He was discharged?

404
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,380
Why didn’t he come back?

405
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,810
He went to Zhang Hua’s home.

406
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,440
His parents

407
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,010
take good care of him.

408
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't worry.

409
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,329
I don't care about him.

410
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,089
He can go wherever he wants.

411
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,290
Coming.

412
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,810
The best duck rice noodle.

413
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,660
Thank you.

414
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,460
Thank you.

415
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,960
You look so happy.

416
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,530
Is your son back?

417
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,859
Keep an eye on this old man.

418
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,660
This is a fat sheep.

419
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,170
The money is just right.

420
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:27,900
Okay.

421
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,210
Count it.

422
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,690
Take care.

423
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Okay.

424
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,550
Old man, you hit my car.

425
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,920
My bike didn't move.

426
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,890
Hey, young man,

427
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,330
why did you put the car here?

428
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,810
I was holding the cart.

429
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,690
I didn't move.

430
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,690
Old man, you hit a car?

431
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,210
No.

432
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,850
Old man.

433
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,730
It's okay.

434
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,290
Let's talk inside.

435
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,210
Have a chat.

436
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,050
Let's talk.

437
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,370
Buddy, park the car in front.

438
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,040
It's okay.

439
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,010
Let's talk.

440
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,330
No.

441
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,110
It's okay.

442
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,900
Let's talk over there.

443
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,460
[Best Snail]

444
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,090
Good job.

445
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,090
Good job.

446
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:11,930
One more.

447
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,830
Good.

448
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,600
This is good.

449
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,080
Hua.

450
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,210
What are you doing?

451
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,470
Best Snail.

452
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,090
I just finished the advancement stage.

453
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,780
I'm about to

454
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,900
upgrade soon.

455
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,810
Put the snail

456
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,470
aside.

457
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,280
Right away.

458
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,010
Okay.

459
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,570
What's wrong?

460
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,800
Hit me?

461
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,210
Why?

462
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,610
Hit me! Come on!

463
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,660
Come on.

464
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,750
Brother, I said I won't hit you.

465
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,770
But you insisted.

466
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,450
Are you okay?

467
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,330
I'm sorry.

468
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,850
I'm sorry.

469
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,170
Are you okay?

470
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:12,860
I'm fine.

471
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Come on. Again.

472
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,730
Come on.

473
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,390
Again.

474
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,020
Hello, dad.

475
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,570
Okay, okay.

476
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,130
Brother.

477
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,230
You have to do me a favor.

478
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:30,970
What is it?

479
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,170
My dad went shopping

480
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,170
and forgot to bring money.

481
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,540
Send him the bank card.

482
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,590
No.

483
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,540
I am playing the game.

484
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,570
Please.

485
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,990
Where is the supermarket?

486
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,570
Just

487
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,410
across the road.

488
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,280
You're so lazy.

489
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,010
Thank you.

490
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,410
Don't do this.

491
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:46,930
OK?

492
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,540
Okay?

493
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,110
No.

494
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,300
Give me 50,000 yuan.

495
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,940
I won't hold you accountable.

496
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,470
No, that scratch...

497
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,700
No, 1,000 yuan at most.

498
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,950
1,000 yuan?

499
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,500
Take a look, old man.

500
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,470
Do you think it's enough?

501
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,100
Look.

502
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,740
Do you know what kind of car this is?

503
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,130
It costs 10,000 yuan

504
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,540
a month.

505
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,840
How can you ruin it?

506
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,740
No, no, no.

507
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,120
Cut the crap. Take the money.

508
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,560
No.

509
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,050
100 yuan per minute.

510
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,500
No, no.

511
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,780
Let's discuss it.

512
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,830
Hurry up.

513
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,500
Or I'll beat you up.

514
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,200
Stop dawdling.

515
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,660
Stop!

516
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,170
In broad daylight,

517
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,040
how can you bully others?

518
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,800
Is that you?

519
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,950
Who are you?

520
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,540
Don't move. Behave yourself.

521
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,540
You called him.

522
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,870
Well, civilization.

523
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,970
Behave yourself.

524
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,600
No.

525
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,490
Behave yourself.

526
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,380
A gentleman uses his words but not his fists.

527
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,210
Why do you need civilization?

528
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,170
Got it.

529
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:48,980
Beat him up!

530
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,260
No, no, no.

531
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:50,740
Don't.

532
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,090
Don't move.

533
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,540
Don't.

534
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,930
No, no, no.

535
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,560
Dad.

536
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,700
Are you okay?

537
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:08,820
Let's go.

538
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,430
Here, take care.

539
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:22,850
Give it to me.

540
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,140
Sir, your car...

541
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,860
No.

542
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,360
This way.

543
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,350
Dishes

544
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,130
Sir, your dishes.

545
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,870
Let me.

546
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,690
Go back.

547
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,620
No.

548
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,930
You and Dad go first.

549
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,380
Yes.

550
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,020
You go first.

551
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:37,930
Godfather, let's go.

552
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,190
Don't bully others anymore.

553
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,170
Take care.

554
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,690
Go back.

555
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,270
Goodbye.

556
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,790
Why are you so slow?

557
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,470
I didn't ask you

558
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,980
to obtain sutras in the west.

559
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,950
I was almost

560
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,070
trapped by the demon.

561
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,400
Well, it's not my godfather's fault.

562
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,860
It's me.

563
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,810
I watched

564
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,020
two old men playing chess.

565
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,050
I was too obsessed.

566
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,080
What's so interesting about playing chess?

567
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,780
Why don't you know

568
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,290
bring the child home early for dinner?

569
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,050
My godfather called me.

570
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,900
But

571
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,620
those two old men

572
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,780
are terrible at playing chess.

573
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,620
So I asked my godfather

574
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,500
to show his skills.

575
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,570
All right, wash your hands.

576
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,690
Thank you for today.

577
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,780
It's all my fault.

578
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,490
It's okay.

579
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,620
I will forget it.

580
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,890
I'm going to wash the vegetables for my godmother.

581
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,350
Dad, you're back.

582
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,430
When are we going to eat?

583
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,050
All you know is eating.

584
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,050
If there's nothing else, just...

585
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,560
Go away.

586
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,380
Now you come to me.

587
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,420
What were you thinking when you chased me away?

588
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,530
Now you know your fault.

589
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:46,610
Fine.

590
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,640
I heard you have a lot

591
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,860
to tell me.

592
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,770
It's from the bottom of my heart.

593
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,720
Go ahead.

594
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,330
Okay, you don't have to.

595
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,430
If you don't tell me,

596
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,590
I still have a lot

597
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,530
to tell you.

598
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,340
Rao Aimin.

599
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,670
Can you stop hitting me?

600
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,500
Can you stop staring at me?

601
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,210
Can you stop throwing me?

602
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,010
And this.

603
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,610
Now you know

604
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,750
how it feels to be hit.

605
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,100
Stop staring at me.

606
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,330
I was so nice to you.

607
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,660
I went to work.

608
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,500
I had no choice, right?

609
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,510
I really like you.

610
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,030
I'll forgive you

611
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,850
if you say a sentence.

612
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,580
I forgive you.

613
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,250
Fine.

614
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,180
Let's shake hands and make peace.

615
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,810
Actually,

616
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,820
I always have you in my heart.

617
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,670
Let's just date.

618
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,070
Sometimes,

619
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,570
work is work.

620
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,640
I was forced.

621
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,820
Look at you.

622
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,670
Why is your hair gone?

623
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,450
It's fine.

624
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,170
I'll wear a wig for you.

625
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,180
Don't be afraid.

626
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,330
Aimin.

627
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,070
Let's watch the night view together.

628
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,650
I want to get some fresh air with you.

629
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,740
Look at that building.

630
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,330
See?

631
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,540
The night is beautiful.

632
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,290
We won't be angry anymore.

633
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,440
Why do you have to hold my hand?

634
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,210
So annoying.

635
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,540
Okay, I'm almost done.

636
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,330
I'm going to find Rao Aimin.

637
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,910
I'll say what I have practiced.

638
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,620
I'll teach her a lesson.

639
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,040
What are you doing?

640
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,020
Is your arm healed?

641
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Are you here to give in today?

642
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,490
A man should be strong.

643
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,450
Today,

644
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,770
I am here to challenge her.

645
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:12,740
Where is she?

646
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,090
My aunt went out. She's not here.

647
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,290
What are you doing here?

648
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,570
I just

649
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,900
want to eat sweet and sour carp.

650
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:25,930
You...

651
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,570
You are

652
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,410
You're just a starving ghost.

653
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,170
You're so greedy.

654
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,230
Do you think I want this?

655
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,600
My parents are gone.

656
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,350
Unbelievable.

657
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,530
An auntie shows up

658
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,860
and regulates me everyday.

659
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,260
It is good for you.

660
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,500
You have a godfather and mother.

661
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,690
Look at your face.

662
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,850
You are fatter in a few days.

663
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,230
I just want to eat something sweet

664
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,540
to suppress the pain in my heart.

665
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,540
Your aunt treats you quite well.

666
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,040
You little girl.

667
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,130
You're so young.

668
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Don't be too greedy.

669
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,690
Being too fat will affect your growth.

670
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,910
Although she is your aunt,

671
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,570
she treats you as her own daughter.

672
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,280
She is a bit fierce.

673
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,050
But

674
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,000
she's a girl.

675
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,320
She owns such a big shop.

676
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,610
If she doesn't be fierce,

677
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,190
she will be bullied.

678
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,660
She takes you

679
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,820
such a burden every day.

680
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,530
Apart from those who know she is helping you,

681
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,060
someone must be

682
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,540
talking behind her back.

683
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,130
Also.

684
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,920
Look at her.

685
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,090
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

686
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,930
Look at her.

687
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,780
How could she be in a good mood?

688
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
How can she not bully others?

689
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,090
You are immature.

690
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,170
You should

691
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,930
think about these problems

692
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,620
in her position.

693
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:40,460
Stupid.

694
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,740
With her temper,

695
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,460
who would dare to date her?

696
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,690
Me.

697
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,880
I'm cheap.

698
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,290
If I don't get beaten for three days,

699
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,330
I feel uncomfortable.

700
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,660
She likes to beat people.

701
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,980
So I will ask a famous teacher to teach me

702
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,450
and practice

703
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,690
golden bell shield and iron cloth.

704
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,050
If fighting is love,

705
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,860
let our love become

706
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,470
more fiercely.

707
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,370
Let me help you.

708
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:06,780
Here.

709
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,500
Which one?

710
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,440
A big one and the best.

711
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,870
Rao Aemin, I want to challenge you.

712
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,690
I won't do it again.

713
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,970
Tell me if you want to eat sweet and sour carp.

714
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,430
Why did you get it from the water?

715
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,740
Aren't you afraid of falling?

716
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,570
It's okay.

717
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,170
Let me.

718
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,170
The water is cold, but it's fine.

719
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,930
It's warm in my heart.

720
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,380
Why do you keep crooked your neck?

721
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,540
I just hurt it

722
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,330
when I was practicing.

723
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,910
My neck is crooked now.

724
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,440
Am I elegant?

725
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,290
What are you doing?

726
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,080
Let me give you a massage.

727
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,280
Don't move.

728
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,170
Be gentle.

729
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,610
Relax.

730
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,410
Relax.

731
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,460
Relax.

732
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:23,970
Are you done?

733
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,680
It's going to break.

734
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,810
Be gentle.

735
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,430
You're a man.

736
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,220
Don't you need to practice

737
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,860
the golden bell shield and iron cloth?

738
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,590
You can't even bear this pain.

739
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,680
Don't.

740
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,140
Auntie.

741
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,430
Zhang Ye is here

742
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,390
to...

743
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,740
Don't talk while eating.

744
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,050
Watch your mouth.

745
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,010
The fish bone will hurt your throat.

746
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,700
Tell me, why did you come back?

747
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,210
I just

748
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,500
have nowhere to stay.

749
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,260
Zhang Ye, your room

750
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,690
has been upgraded

751
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,050
luxury presidential suite.

752
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,250
You're so polite.

753
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,120
I'm just leaving for a few days.

754
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,540
Cheers.

755
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,890
Cheers

756
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,070
♫I thought no matter how dark the city was♫

757
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,900
♫There wouldn't be any tears in my eyes♫

00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,810

761
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,980
♫We're as uneasy as each other♫

762
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,960

763

♫Who can tell me what is right to do♫

765
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,170
Director Yang

766
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,980
On behalf of all judges,

767
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,860
I want to talk to you.

768
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,120
The quality of contestants is getting worse.

769
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,780
We can't keep recording like this.

770
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,710
There's no outsider today.

771
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,810
I just want to be honest with you.

772
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,440
You can’t touch these guys.

773
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,960
They are sponsors.

774
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,310
We will find a way.

775
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,040
Please help us, okay?

776
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,550
What do you mean, fraud?

777
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,690
We've already made a rule

778
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,660
that we can't do it.

779
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,300
Yes, once the rules are set,

780
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,090
we didn't do any of this.

781
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,230
These are all the exceptions happened

782
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,060
before this rule is published.

783
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,640
How about this?

784
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,210
Let’s hang in there.

785
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,770
When we reach the top ten stage,

786
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,430
let them all get lost.

787
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,050
Top 10 again.

788
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,090
If this goes on,

789
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,370
the show will be horrible.

790
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,740
It will be good.

791
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,890
As long as you are here,

792
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,350
the audience will be happy.

793
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,950
Who do you think this show is watching?

794
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,890
They are not watching the guys.

795
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,730
The audience

796
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,080
are targeting you.

797
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,790
Am I right?

798
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,710
It's okay.

799
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,810
Let me think of a way.

800
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,500
By then,

801
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,260
I'll find two topics to promote.

802
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,070
No problem.

803
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,410
Don't worry.

804
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,450
Does Zhang Ye know t?

805
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,740
I'm so busy.

806
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,320
I forgot to tell him about this.

807
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,560
I'll tell him now.

808
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,400
Zhang Ye.

809
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,350
You must have a talk

810
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,420
with Director Yang.

811
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,460
Director Yang.

812
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,980
Are you drinking?

813
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,770
This is not coffee, right?

814
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,159
Good timing.

815
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,090
I just received a limited edition.

816
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,920
Here.

817
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,620
No, no, no.

818
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,350
I don't want it.

819
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,070
Come on.

820
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,860
Can your heart

821
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,700
take it?

822
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,850
It's okay now.

823
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,130
Life is full of joy.

824
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,170
Throw this away.

825
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,270
Let me change it for you.

826
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:09,700
Here.

827
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,560
I don't know wine.

828
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,930
But

829
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,660
I am wondering

830
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,340
if it is not so good

831
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,770
to drink this?

832
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,780
We need to be normal.

833
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,470
But our taste

834
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,750
should be improving.

835
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,260
If you want drink something good,

836
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,170
just let me know.

837
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,350
I recently know

838
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,060
a very awesome sponsor.

839
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,530
He showed me different things.

840
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,990
When I visited him,

841
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,580
the wine was...

842
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,670
Don't worry about it.

843
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,130
I like

844
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,740
Erguotou with Sprite.

845
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,560
It's good to be friendly and normal.

846
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,150
Just like our show,

847
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,020
we speak for the normal person.

848
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,330
Am I right?

849
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,000
Zhang Ye,

850
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,730
You don't treat me as your friends.

851
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,340
Can't you just

852
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,290
say what you want to say?

853
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,330
Do you think I can't

854
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,530
tell that you have different opinion?

855
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,780
Did Zhang Yuanqi

856
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,610
tell you?

857
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,390
Nothing.

858
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,020
Director Yang.

859
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,860
If the sponsor keeps adding people,

860
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,020
our show will be ruined.

861
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,770
Yes, I understand.

862
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,450
It's your first time doing such a big show.

863
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,900
You feel worried.

864
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,620
I understand.

865
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,000
But to be honest,

866
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,910
I really admire you these days.

867
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,060
I really admire

868
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,370
your work attitude.

869
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,110
You're a serious person.

870
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,320
For this reason,

871
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,740
the show will be good in the future.

872
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,320
How about this?

873
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,360
Don't worry

874
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,270
about these things.

875
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,410
Leave it to me.

876
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,800
I'll handle it, okay?

877
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,300
Just focus on

878
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,050
your show.

879
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,240
You said that.

880
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,950
I did.

881
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,770
Then I'll leave it to you.

882
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,240
Leave it to me?

883
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,930
Deal.

884
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,910
Drink some wine.

885
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,950
No, thanks.

886
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,080
Young people like coffee.

887
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,520
Okay, let's do the show.

888
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,100
Get ready.

889
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,430
Okay, I'm going.

890
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,300
Sing loudly. Come on.

891
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,150
I'm from the deep mountains.

892
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,000
It was the first time that I had rice

893
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,580
when I came to the show.

894
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,020
My father died when I was three.

895
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,200
My mother died when I was five.

896
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,340
When I was seven,

897
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,840
my grandma and grandpa passed away.

898
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,010
Even the dog

899
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,210
who grew up with me

900
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,370
died when I was eight.

901
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,010
But I never gave up

902
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,880
the dream of music.

903
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,280
I always want it.

904
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:41,860
Stop.

905
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,790
Stop.

906
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,500
Turn off his microphone.

907
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,730
Stop recording.

908
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,680
Let's suspend the recording.

909
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,690
I flew here today

910
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,860
to listen to music.

911
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,680
I'm really sorry, mentors.

912
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,260
The contestants

913
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,320
are completely different from those who are

914
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,120
on the list.

915
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,850
I think it is useless

916
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,550
to record this show.

917
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,910
I'll send the mentors out.

918
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,370
In this situation,

919
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,320
it's really hard for us to work together.

920
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,250
Well...

921
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
We still need to cooperate.

922
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,810
How about this?

923
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,740
Let's solve the problem.

924
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,940
Actually,

925
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,720
I've been trying to find a way.

926
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,270
Director Yang.

927
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,320
We're not trying to make things difficult for you.

928
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:40,810
Of course.

929
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,420
I'm just an errand man.

930
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,220
I have to explain to the boss.

931
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,120
I understand.

932
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,560
As for the person in charge,

933
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,250
I am the person in charge.

934
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,940
But in art creation,

935
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,710
there are something different.

936
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,250
Because we have hosts

937
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,580
and mentors.

938
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,900
So, you have to say

939
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,940
there's nothing wrong

940
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,000
about administration.

941
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,660
But

942
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,730
when it comes to art creation,

943
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,370
I am really...

944
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,940
We can change the host.

945
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,830
You can invite another mentor.

946
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,570
You're welcome.

947
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:24,930
You...

948
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,090
It is too precious.

949
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,360
It's too precious.

950
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,210
Let's think of another way.

951
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,530
I know.

952
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,770
He is young.

953
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,710
Don't worry. I have an idea.

954
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,600
Mr. Zhang, this way please.

955
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,040
Our great man, we are waiting for you.

956
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,860
Hurry up.

957
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,530
Hurry up.

958
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,800
What took you so long?

959
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,300
Just the three of us.

960
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,600
Just the three of us.

961
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,800
Director Yang,

962
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,680
you came all the way here

963
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,020
and you asked me to come.

964
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,050
After I came,

965
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,660
you don't let me meet clients.

966
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,910
You think of me

967
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,910
when it is time for dinner.

968
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
There are so many dishes.

969
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,770
Is it a trap?

970
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,730
I can prepare a trap for anyone

971
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,580
except for you.

972
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,270
You saved my life,

973
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:31,820
right?

974
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:33,890
Bro,

975
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,050
this is what I think.

976
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,830
I think

977
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,770
artists

978
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,400
are too hot-tempered.

979
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,660
If the investor

980
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,950
put on a long face

981
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,410
at the dinner table,

982
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,500
you would have been so angry.

983
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,530
How can I continue?

984
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,000
Actually, I've been having a hard time lately.

985
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,530
Very depressed.

986
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,090
Our show

987
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,950
wants good quality.

988
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,870
To pursue quality.

989
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,060
But do you know

990
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,910
our company

991
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,580
has been inconsiderate for a long time.

992
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,450
Every day,

993
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,300
I force myself

994
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,300
to deal with these investors.

995
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,740
Not to mention speaking up for the normal people,

996
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,980
it's hard to say

997
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,980
if we can have another episode.

998
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,690
It's really hard for me now.

999
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,940
I'm in the middle now.

1000
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,300
My superiors need performance.

1001
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,650
The audience asked me for the show.

1002
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,070
What should I do

1003
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,070
in the middle?

1004
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,770
Yes, it's hard for you.

1005
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,820
But have you noticed that

1006
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,320
our show

1007
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,370
has

1008
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,370
changed.

1009
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:43,940
Yes.

1010
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,560
So Director Yang

1011
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,890
invited you here

1012
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,110
because we cannot talk about it

1013
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,580
in the company.

1014
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,470
What cannot be discussed

1015
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,570
in the company?

1016
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,170
Why did you asked me to

1017
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,210
come here?

1018
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,510
I have to tell you here.

1019
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,130
I have an idea.

1020
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,700
I think I want to change it.

1021
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,880
If you want to change it,

1022
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,100
do you have any idea?

1023
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,260
Change it?

1024
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,100
Change it.

1025
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,600
Of course I have an idea.

1026
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,280
Tell me.

1027
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,740
I think

1028
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,820
the core of this show

1029
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,610
is these normal people.

1030
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,350
We should make a good reputation and boost the popularity.

1031
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,600
When there are more paying users,

1032
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,850
the sponsor will come.

1033
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:22,270
Yes.

1034
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,190
You're in my heart.

1035
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,850
What else? Tell me.

1036
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,380
Let's not talk about other things.

1037
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,450
Director Yang,

1038
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,980
With your trust in me,

1039
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,200
a toast to you.

1040
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,640
Thank you for your trust, Director Yang...

1041
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,930
Not at all.

1042
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,190
and appreciation.

1043
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,080
This...

1044
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,720
to you.

1045
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,540
Good brother.

1046
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,290
We drank a lot today.

1047
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,490
Alright.

1048
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,480
That's all for today.

1049
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,460
Angela.

1050
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,090
Take Mr. Zhang back to rest.

1051
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:13,920
OK.

1052
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,620
Mr. Zhang, let me send you upstairs.

1053
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,530
-See you off. -No, no, no.

1054
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,460
No, no.

1055
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,610
Let Angela

1056
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,300
to see you off.

1057
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,330
Mr. Zhang, be careful.

1058
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,980
No need.

1059
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,090
I can go back myself.

1060
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,880
601, I remember it all.

1061
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,410
No need.

00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,510
No, no, no.

1064
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,530
Can you do it yourself?

1065
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,410
I can. I can.

1066
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,340
I can do it.

Go back.

1068
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,370
Thank you, brother.

1069
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,710

What is this?
