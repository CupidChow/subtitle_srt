[Episode 5]

4
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,830
I'll drink first.

5
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,550
Young Master.

6
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,460
Young Master.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,330
Why did you

8
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,870
cut the shirt bought at the auction?

9
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,460
It's so precious.

10
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,140
This was worn by a great poet.

11
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,979
Young Master, please go back.

12
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,630
His Lordship and Her Ladyship are waiting for you.

13
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,080
And the 1,000 employees

14
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,370
can't eat, either.

15
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,810
Go back.

16
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,700
Young Master, let me help you put it on.

17
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,420
What is this?

18
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,100
Go take a look.

19
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,660
Hurry up.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,700
What's going on?

21
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,410
Thank you.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,990
You call me brother now.

23
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,420
I'll be your brother from now on.

24
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,900
From now on,

25
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,890
we're like family.

26
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,180
No one can bully you.

27
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,760
Are your parents still fighting?

28
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,340
I told them

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,970
you were my friend and you merely

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,980
joked with them as you were drunk.

31
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,690
You're smart.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,240
By the way, I forgot to ask you.

33
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,740
Do you really like Wang Shishi?

34
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,300
Yes.

35
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,220
I like her very much.

36
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,100
Give me your mobile phone.

37
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,920
Send this poem to her.

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
Face the sea and see the tides.

39
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,740
But she's getting married.

40
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,210
Isn't she getting married?

41
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,110
Then she's not married yet.

42
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,810
If you like her, chase her.

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,410
However,

44
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,390
be careful of your classmates.

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,260
Okay, brother.

46
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,300
Go.

47
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,580
Call me

48
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,900
if there's anything wrong.

49
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,340
Okay.

50
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
Sir, thank you.

51
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,899
I've transferred the money to you.

52
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,340
Please leave. Thank you.

53
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,410
Thank you.

54
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,640
You've been working for a month.

55
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,050
Haven't you got the salary?

56
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,280
The money

57
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,710
has been used up by me.

58
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,640
Zhang Guozhu.

59
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,980
Did you

60
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,420
do something wrong?

61
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,740
Why is there a pile of money here?

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,100
Zhang Ye is here.

63
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,910
Auntie, Zhang Ye is here.

64
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,770
I bought you a small gift.

65
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,860
I passed by the flower shop.

66
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,270
What's going on?

67
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,590
The flower shop was closing.

68
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,460
There were only these three flowers left.

69
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,040
It's not easy...

70
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,270
Cut the crap.

71
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,030
Pay the rent for this month.

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,530
Please give me two more days.

73
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,640
You have money to buy flowers but you can't pay the rent?

74
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,990
If you can't pay the rent, move out.

75
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,010
Don't always ask me to move out.

76
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,970
I still owe you money.

77
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,860
I remember

78
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,890
your kindness to me.

79
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,540
Look.

80
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,030
I've earned just a small sum of money.

81
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,900
I'm not able to pay

82
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,050
the debt for time being.

83
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,460
Why don't you let me

84
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,930
work for you

85
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,100
and pay back the money gradually?

86
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,340
Am I right?

87
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,180
You have a good attitude.

88
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,260
Massage my legs.

89
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,100
Be gentle.

90
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,659
You haven't eaten yet?

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,300
Do you want to kill me?

92
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,220
Come on. Again.

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,100
I've been working recently

94
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
and the strength of my hands is big.

95
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,540
The toilet, washing machine,

96
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,740
and the cracks between the tiles

97
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,070
should all be cleaned.

98
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,900
I'll check if you're done.

99
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,180
Okay.

100
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,940
What famous host?

101
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,380
In my place,

102
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,740
he's a servant in the hotel.

103
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,250
Anyway, I owe you money.

104
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,900
I have to whatever you want.

105
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,890
Clean the bathtub.

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,470
Disinfect it. I need to use it at night.

107
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,860
I owe you money,

108
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,700
and I can't pay you back anyway.

109
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,720
I might as well rub your back.

110
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,620
Alright, wait for me.

111
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,430
Let's go together tonight.

112
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,240
Okay, send me the address.

113
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,460
I'll take a taxi there.

114
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,900
Look how impatient you are.

115
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,890
It'll be quick. Don't worry.

116
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,380
Together.

117
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,180
Congratulations.

118
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,550
You're going to kiss and hug and lift her up.

119
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,010
You also heard her?

120
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,450
She said we should go together.

121
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,520
This happiness comes so suddenly.

122
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,390
Isn't there a process?

123
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,740
She even wants to take a bath with me?

124
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,260
So unrestrained.

125
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,620
Don't you

126
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,930
like Rao Aimin all the time?

127
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:54,980
No.

128
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,140
I'm not that kind of person.

129
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,580
You can refuse.

130
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,660
This is your game.

131
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,580
You decide.

132
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,070
What do you mean?

133
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,550
I, Zhang Ye,

134
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,230
am not such a lecher.

135
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,960
My muscles are sore.

136
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,980
I have to take a bath.

137
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,540
Let's stop here. I want a lucky draw.

138
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,540
The prize you got today is...

139
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,420
the fruit of charm.

140
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,180
As the name suggests,

141
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,330
after using the fruit of charm,

142
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,860
you can get more attention from women

143
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,000
and increase your personal charm.

144
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,370
The fruit of charm.

145
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,290
Is this really a lucky draw?

146
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,800
Or is it customized for me?

147
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
You're so bad.

148
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,950
Why must you set me up by

149
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,470
doing this?

150
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,280
You know the rules of

151
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,420
using props.

152
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,700
If you don't use it today,

153
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,090
you can use it later.

154
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,430
Dear customers,

155
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,290
have fun.

156
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,140
Aimin, it's too fast.

157
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,780
Let me think about it.

158
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,650
Is it comfortable?

159
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,660
Yes.

160
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,520
One more time.

161
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,620
Why isn't Rao Aimin here yet?

162
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,400
You are really something.

163
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,980
Were you starving?

164
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,350
You had some fried chicken,

165
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,710
and your clothes were splashed with ketchup.

166
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,170
Get in.

167
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,460
Take off your clothes.

168
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,330
I'll wash them for you.

169
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,020
I didn't know the bottle was leaking.

170
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,220
Besides,

171
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,940
you called

172
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,380
and asked me to wait for you.

173
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,050
I smelled the chicken

174
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,910
for half an hour.

175
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,990
I can't pay you back anyway.

176
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,100
I might as well rub your back.

177
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,810
Alright, wait for me.

178
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,580
Let's go together tonight.

179
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,240
Half an hour.

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,580
Look at the stains.

181
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,740
How can I wash them away?

182
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,190
You're reasonable, huh?

183
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,980
Why are you staring at me?

184
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,590
Take a bath with me.

185
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,230
Zhang Ye has just cleaned the bathtub.

186
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,070
Come here.

187
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,960
No, no, no.

188
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,420
I ate too much today.

189
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,290
If I take a bath now,

190
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,460
I'll throw up.

191
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Let me lie down for a while.

192
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,780
You're so lazy.

193
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,020
Fine, I'll take a bath myself.

194
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,330
[The Fruit of Charm]

195
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,250
All physiological functions

196
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,470
of the experiment target

197
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,260
are changing rapidly.

198
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,810
Heart beats faster and blood pressure rises.

199
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,020
His hormone level fluctuates fiercely.

200
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,040
His reaction is too primitive.

201
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,770
Humans haven't evolved into

202
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,870
a mechanism against primitive desires.

203
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,140
This will become

204
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,520
a bottleneck for civilization development.

205
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,970
It's hard for them to evolve into

206
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,000
advanced civilization.

207
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,380
Explode it and start again.

208
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,180
Then explain

209
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,570
your browsing records.

210
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,780
What is this?

211
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,060
It's ridiculous.

212
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,580
I feel ashamed for you.

213
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,940
It's so vulgar.

214
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,860
How could read it yourself?

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,660
Sharing is a virtue

216
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,290
for high-class species like us.

217
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,320
Do you know that?

218
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,450
I want to say...

219
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,460
I fell into it while cleaning the bathtub.

220
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,420
Can you believe it?

221
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,840
Is the water temperature appropriate?

222
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,660
Some newcomers only come after the work time.

223
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,940
What about the rules?

224
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,360
I've learned it from you.

225
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,740
Anchors of night shows don't work during the day.

226
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,190
Can you compare yourself with me?

227
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,150
I'm your senior.

228
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,880
You'd better behave yourself.

229
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,580
Yes.

230
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,310
I'm no match for you.

231
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,970
If I were like you,

232
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,290
I would be the last.

233
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,640
What are you talking about?

234
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,390
-Zhang. -You...

235
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,420
Isn't your show at night?

236
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,610
You're early.

237
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,620
I'll be careful next time.

238
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,280
I'll come a little later.

239
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,410
No, it's...

240
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,280
You look good today.

241
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,690
Do your best on the show.

242
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,430
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

243
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,380
Hello, dear audience.

244
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,620
Miss Xiaomei,

245
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,070
today is my birthday.

246
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,770
My boyfriend gave me a birthday gift.

247
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,890
But he said

248
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,170
he had an IELTS class today,

249
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,600
so he couldn't celebrate my birthday with me.

250
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,180
I'm very sad.

251
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,940
Do you think

252
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,810
he doesn't care about me anymore?

253
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,620
Little girl,

254
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,990
your boyfriend remembered

255
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,210
and gave you a birthday present.

256
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,740
It's very rare.

257
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,620
Few men

258
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,740
can remember

259
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,900
these special days now.

260
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,490
But Miss Xiaomei...

261
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,660
Miss Xiaomei is so mean.

262
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,150
She's the top anchor of the radio station.

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,630
Did he have an emergency?

264
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,560
Little girl,

265
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,470
you're too dependent on love.

266
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,550
Listen to me.

267
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,060
I've been through this.

268
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,930
You should learn

269
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,950
to be independent.

270
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,580
Don't need company for everything.

271
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,920
Thank you for listening to today's show.

272
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm Wang Xiaomei.

273
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,390
See you next time.

274
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,870
Done.

275
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,210
Ma'am.

276
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,940
-Hello, Miss Xiaomei. -You're early.

277
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,740
Make yourself at home.

278
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,110
Don't call me that.

279
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,210
Just call me Xiaomei.

280
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,660
No way.

281
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,460
Miss Xiaomei is experienced.

282
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,510
You're the top anchor of the company.

283
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,630
Of course I should call you Miss Xiaomei.

284
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,540
You're good, too.

285
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,340
So?

286
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,710
Give the seniors like us

287
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,510
some suggestions.

288
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,460
Give some suggestions?

289
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,290
I dare not.

290
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,620
Don't be modest.

291
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,910
You've just become an anchor,

292
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,430
and you rank second in the whole station now.

293
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,790
You're not that simple.

294
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,660
Do you really want to hear my advice?

295
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,010
I'll tell you then.

296
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm all ears.

297
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,090
Here's the thing.

298
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,020
I think

299
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:13,950
the music

300
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,220
you played just now

301
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,400
and the news you talked about

302
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,280
are not all that

303
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,660
the young people like to hear nowadays,

304
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,430
including

305
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,400
the love theory you mentioned

306
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,780
to that little girl.

307
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,260
I don't agree personally.

308
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,450
Because I think

309
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,610
if you want to understand young people,

310
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,110
you should make your state of mind

311
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:29,940
more similar

312
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,250
to that of young people.

313
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,050
Are you done?

314
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,020
Miss Xiaomei.

315
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,590
I'll treat you to barbeque tonight.

316
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,730
I won't hinder the progress of you young people.

317
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,070
I won't eat tonight.

318
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,940
Didn't she ask me to talk about it?

319
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,910
But you really dared to say it.

320
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,190
But I...

321
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,990
Alright. It's almost time.

322
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,910
Go get ready.

323
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,460
I shouldn't have said it.

324
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,910
Don't take it to heart.

325
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,460
Good evening, everyone.

326
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,330
Welcome to the Midnight Song.

327
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,260
I'm your old friend,

328
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,740
Zhang Ye.

329
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,460
First of all,

330
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,620
let's enjoy

331
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,430
today's hot single.

332
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:05,610
Chenchen.

333
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,000
Life is short.

334
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,950
Sometimes it's just as transient as a fleeting cloud.

335
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,470
Seize the time and

336
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,230
love yourself.

337
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,530
Alright.

338
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,380
Our online hotline

339
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,060
has been opened.

340
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
439888.

341
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,980
You're welcome to call us.

342
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,860
Hello?

343
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,860
Hello? Is that me?

344
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes, it's you.

345
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,630
Can I ask to broadcast a song?

346
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,740
Of course.

347
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,620
What's the song?

348
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,530
Can I ask to broadcast

349
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,920
Zhang Yuanqi's Imperfection?

350
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,930
Sure.

351
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,810
But I have a request.

352
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,820
Can the anchor

353
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,130
sing the song by himself?

354
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,190
Are you sure you want me to sing?

355
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,030
Yes.

356
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,240
You sing very well.

357
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,940
Then I'll have to sing it for you.

358
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,490
Alright.

359
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,520
Zhang Yuanqi's Imperfection

360
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,220
for you all.

361
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,940

♫There wouldn't be any tears in my eyes♫

363
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,700
This anchor has a good voice.

364
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,400
It's much better than last time.

369
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,540
By the way,

370
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,540
this young man

371
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,690

380

Zhang has a good voice.

381
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,080
Has he been trained on this before?

382
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,950
He always likes to show off like this.

383

The ranking of this week's ratings

421
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,820
is interesting.

422
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,950
♫I'm not tired no matter how far it is♫

423
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,150
Midnight Song ranks the first.

424
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,720
Daily Mood ranks the second.

425
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,140
The ratings have few changes.

426
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,930
But Midnight Song's rating

427
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,190
is 5 percent higher than that of 12 pm.

428
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,260
Anyway,

429
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,850
I'd like to praise Zhang Ye here.

430
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,910
As a newcomer of the company,

431
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,050
he has such achievements.

432
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,590
You should learn from him.

433
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,470
Not at all.

434
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,870
I still have a lot

435
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,540
to learn from my seniors.

436
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,810
Zhang,

437
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,300
don't be modest.

438
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,300
Your achievements are obvious to all.

439
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,900
Look, Cao.

440
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,390
Your Story Time for Young and Old

441
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,380
has got a higher ranking, the second last.

442
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,800
Even a senior like him has made progress.

443
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,880
That's because the young people

444
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,100
are passionate about their work.

445
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:39,900
It also encouraged seniors like me

446
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,270
to be passionate about the work.

447
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,140
Come on! Come on!

448
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,670
Come on! Come on!

449
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,010
Let's answer the call

450
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,120
from the next listener.

451
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,490
Miss Xiaomei.

452
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,720
Why are you so early today?

453
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,920
It's not time yet.

454
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,070
Get ready in advance.

455
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,140
I'll leave my phone here.

456
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:05,530
Okay.

457
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,180
He wants to break up with me.

458
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,850
What should I do?

459
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,060
What do you mean?

460
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,580
Just break up with him and cut the contact.

461
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,250
How is my guitar?

462
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,430
It's good.

463
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,290
Right?

464
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,330
Do you want me to teach you?

465
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,320
I'm a good teacher.

466
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,020
I'm afraid my fingers will hurt.

467
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,370
But I can't live without him.

468
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,760
Miss Xiaomei,

469
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,440
could you tell me

470
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,460
how I can keep him by my side?

471
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,690
Listen to me, little girl.

472
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,030
He has put studying abroad

473
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,100
as his top priority.

474
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,100
You are not

475
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,270
important to him at all.

476
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,820
Nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

477
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,060
You'd better let him go.

478
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,990
I can't live without him.

479
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,170
How old are you?

480
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,060
Just because of a man,

481
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,220
you decide your own life and death.

482
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,940
Think like this.

483
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,330
If your parents know it,

484
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,400
they'll be very disappointed.

485
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
Miss Xiaomei, stop lecturing me.

486
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,380
It's windy here.

487
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,990
My face hurts when I cry.

488
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,120
Don't cry, child.

489
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,890
Wipe your tears and move forward.

490
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,510
Don't look back.

491
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,300
But what if it's an abyss ahead?

492
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,300
Shuang.

493
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,340
The road ahead always remains unknown.

494
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,900
How do you know it's an abyss ahead?

495
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,120
It is an abyss if you look back.

496
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:09,980
But...

497
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,580
Little girl,

498
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,180
it's not safe out there if it's windy.

499
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
You should go back now.

500
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,810
Miss Xiaomei, stop persuading me.

501
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,750
I just want to jump down and end it.

502
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,340
Miss Xiaomei.

503
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,620
I think something is wrong.

504
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,420
Stall her first.

505
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,020
Hold on.

506
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,410
Where are you now?

507
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,270
I'm in a place

508
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,220
where no one disturbs me.

509
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,940
Do you want to die

510
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,020
for a man?

511
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,770
Shuang,

512
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,370
Remove the advertisements and

513
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,080
time reporting later.

514
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,720
Okay.

515
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,030
You need to grow on your own.

516
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,970
Aren't you afraid you'll

517
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,550
embarrass your parents by making such a decision?

518
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,110
Miss, calm down.

519
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,080
What are you doing?

520
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,670
What do you mean?

521
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,170
Your sharp tongue won't work.

522
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,560
Who is he?

523
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,900
I'm the host of Midnight Song,

524
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,500
Zhang Ye.

525
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,940
Today, I'm invited here as Miss Xiaomei's

526
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,040
special guest.

527
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,300
I want to say something to you.

528
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,340
Farewell.

529
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,850
Girl, don't be silly.

530
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,780
Listen to me.

531
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,570
Something wrong might happen.

532
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,000
Actually,

533
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,430
we have similar experience.

534
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,470
there's a girl

535
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,610
whom I really like.

536
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,550
She's getting married now.

537
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,930
I was very desperate.

538
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,840
I almost jumped off the building.

539
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,410
Stop persuading me.

540
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,440
I just want to end this quickly.

541
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,540
I understand.

542
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,660
But think about it.

543
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,260
Why do we

544
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,410
have to choose this way

545
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,130
to leave this world?

546
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,660
If we die,

547
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,420
we'll lose everything.

548
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,770
If we're alive, everything is possible.

549
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,750
Little girl, where are you now?

550
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,300
Can you tell me?

551
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,710
I'll go over and talk to you.

552
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,480
Kid, don't be silly.

553
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,230
It's not worth it

554
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,060
for a man.

555
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,890
Do you understand the feelings

556
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,600
of being loved and then abandoned?

557
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,370
What? You have nothing else to say?

558
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,740
Both of you are single, right?

559
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,340
Talking to you two

560
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,900
is like playing the lute to a cow.

561
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,590
Miss Xiaomei, stall her first.

562
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,710
Let me think of other solutions.

563
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:47,650
Okay.

564
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,570
Thank you.

565
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,380
I've called the police.

566
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,260
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

567
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,250
Are you listening to our show?

568
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,340
Yes.

569
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,300
Do you know where

570
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,210
we can hear the sound of

571
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,260
plane landing and

572
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,530
ship whistle inside the city?

573
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,090
If you can hear ship whistle,

574
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,350
it should be near the sea.

575
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,550
And the cross-sea bridge.

576
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,530
Please help me search there, too.

577
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,840
We night shift drivers

578
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,030
have a chat group.

579
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,190
I'll mention it there,

580
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,170
and ask them to look for her.

581
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,830
Hurry up.

582
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,030
You must stall her.

583
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:21,980
Kid,

584
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,390
love is not that simple.

585
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,520
Besides,

586
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,790
I'm not single all the time.

587
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,490
Those men are just not good enough.

588
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,540
So funny.

589
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,890
You don't understand

590
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,820
what I'm talking about at all.

591
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,880
I don't want to

592
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,950
talk to you anymore.

593
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,610
Okay. Since you've made up your mind,

594
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,210
I respect your choice.

595
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,530
But

596
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,500
before you

597
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,000
end your life, could you

598
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,070
listen to me sing a song for you?

599
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,670
You've decided

600
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,000
to leave this world anyway.

601
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,170
It's just a few minutes, right?

602
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,120
I've heard your show.

603
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,400
Go ahead.

604
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,060
You have a nice voice.

605
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,100
Sing me a song.

606
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,000
I'll take it as

607
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,620
my last wish

608
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,900
in this world.

609
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,630
What do you want?

610
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,660
Buy time.

611
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,580
Shuang.

612
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,490
Give me a simple chord.

613

♫Are you the same as me♫

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,260
Are you listening?

653
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,880
What's the name of this song?

654
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,380
My Future Is Not a Dream.

655
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,990
It's beautiful.

656
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,820
Actually,

657
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,700
my experience is similar to yours.

658
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,140
I didn't like this world, either.

659
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,900
I wanted to give up this world.

660
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,430
Until I met a girl.

661
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,060
She had a bad temper.

662
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,260
She was a bit fierce. She kept ordering me around.

663
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,350
However,

664
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,970
she gave me a ray of sunshine.

665
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,320
Because of this ray of sunshine,

666
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,980
my whole world was lit up.

667
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,290
Thank you.

668
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,220
You should thank yourself.

669
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,780
I had dreams, too.

670
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,770
And my dream was once dashed, too.

671
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,940
But anyhow,

672
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,250
I still believe

673
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,970
dreams will come true.

674
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,860
So, let's try our best together.

675
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,020
OK?

676
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,640
We've saved her.

677
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,610
Please rest assured.

678
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,500
Come on.

679
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,670
You'll be rewarded for the singing.

680
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:29,980
Tonight,

681
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,430
I'll help you host the show.

682
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,620
Thanks.

683
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,120
We should thank Miss Xiaomei.

684
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,220
You're being modest.

685
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:45,230
My Future Is Not a Dream.

686
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,060
[Failed to found relevant music. Try with another word]

687
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,560
Did you really write the song you sang yesterday?

688
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,470
Don't think I haven't listened to

689
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,780
old songs before because I'm young.

690
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,300
This is plagiarism, you know?

691
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,590
I didn't plagiarize it.

692
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,320
In this world,

693
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,889
you can live a different life.

694
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,480
You also can try to be outstanding

695
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,989
and win credit for yourself.

696
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,460
But you plagiarized others' work

697
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,409
openly and brazenly.

698
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,460
Don't you feel guilty?

699
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,739
What do you mean by plagiarizing others' work

700
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,699
openly and brazenly?

701
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,900
I was saving someone.

702
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,250
It's a matter of life and death.

703
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:23,870
Don't worry.

704
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,780
From now on,

705
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,300
it belongs to its original owner.

706
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,590
I merely borrowed it.

707
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,739
I, Zhang Ye,

708
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,570
will never plagiarize others' work.

709
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,570
Then conduct yourself well.

710
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,650
I'm going to school.

711
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,620
Go on walking the dog.

712
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,300
Bye.

713
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:43,199
It was such a serious matter.

714
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,780
What about your emergency plan?

715
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,560
If something goes wrong,

716
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,510
can you afford it?

717
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,380
Let alone you,

718
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,730
I can't afford it myself.

719
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,260
I told you

720
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:51,969
during a night show,

721
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,520
you must keep your spirits high.

722
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,520
I guess he's talking about it.

723
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,100
What's wrong?

724
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,300
You scared me.

725
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,110
The leader

726
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,310
is scolding someone inside.

727
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,020
Who is he scolding?

728
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,870
Miss Xiaomei.

729
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,700
Why?

730
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,000
Because of

731
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,980
what happened last night.

732
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,780
We all listened to the show last night.

733
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,230
If it weren't for you,

734
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,770
I don't know

735
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,070
what would have happened to that girl.

736
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,830
From now on,

737
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,540
your Hotline at Night will be suspended for a week.

738
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,660
But my show...

739
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,600
I've told you.

740
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,250
Mind your language. Mind your tone.

741
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,340
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

742
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,910
It was a special situation yesterday.

743
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,870
Special situation?

744
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,360
You're also a senior in the company.

745
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,150
How come Zhang Ye

746
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,130
could control the situation,

747
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,190
but you couldn't?

748
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,150
Tell me.

749
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,740
Come in.

750
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,380
What's the matter?

751
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,890
Didn't you ask me

752
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,030
to come to your office this morning?

753
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,630
Have you forgotten?

754
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,330
Did I?

755
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,380
My poor memory.

756
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,580
I'll get straight to the point.

757
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,690
I know what happened last night.

758
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,220
Thank god for you.

759
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,660
No.

760
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,700
Actually,

761
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,980
thanks to Miss Xiaomei

762
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,050
who cooperated well with me.

763
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,150
Otherwise, something wrong

764
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,940
might have happened.

765
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,570
Cooperated?

766
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,340
The little girl almost died because of

767
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,150
her cooperation.

768
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,350
Are you

769
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,530
criticizing Miss Xiaomei?

770
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,700
You've wronged a good person.

771
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,810
Right?

772
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,130
Have I wronged someone?

773
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,230
Who? Her?

774
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,060
This little girl

775
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,490
had also called us before.

776
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,070
Miss Xiaomei felt something was wrong.

777
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,130
So last night,

778
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,330
when she called,

779
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,000
Miss Xiaomei couldn't find others for help,

780
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,830
so she asked me to cooperate with her.

781
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,390
This little girl

782
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,260
was deeply hurt by love.

783
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,690
It was no use just comforting her.

784
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,850
So for Miss Xiaomei and me,

785
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,790
one of us played the villain and the other played the hero.

786
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,850
This time,

787
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,970
Miss Xiaomei sacrificed a lot.

788
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,460
It seems that

789
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,030
I've wronged Miss Wang Xiaomei.

790
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,410
Mr. Zhao, I...

791
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,620
Alright, stop talking.

792
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,670
Why didn't you

793
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,550
explain it to me clearly?

794
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,280
It's all your fault.

795
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,910
But I still need to commend Zhang Ye.

796
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,960
He's calm

797
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,120
and modest.

798
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,040
We should learn from him.

799
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,370
It's all thanks to Zhang Ye's song.

800
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,810
It's nothing.

801
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,400
I was just lucky.

802
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,800
I feel the same

803
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,710
as that little girl.

804
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,610
Enough.

805
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,310
Just go

806
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,310
and get back to your work.

807
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,050
Thank you for earlier.

808
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,670
You're welcome.

809
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,110
We cooperated perfectly.

810
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,580
Are you washing fruits?

811
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,180
I heard

812
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,850
Mr. Zhao scolded you just now.

813
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,830
Are you okay?

814
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,740
Zhang Ye, are the grapes sour?

815
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,970
Let me try.

816
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,620
Only those who can't eat the grapes

817
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,890
would say the grapes are sour.

818
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,800
So sweet.

819
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,400
Yes, yes.

820
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,020
It's the Qomolangma Internet Radio. Yes.

821
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,940
I'm Zhao Guozhou.

822
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,730
Come in.

823
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,380
It's okay.

824
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,480
Mr. Zhao.

825
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,930
Zhang Ye has been

826
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,430
someone we have put a lot of effort in training.

827
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:02,900
Yes.

828
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,620
You're too polite.

829
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,670
Really?

830
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,570
No need to send the banner.

831
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,810
Thank you.

832
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,410
Thank you. We're all very thankful.

833
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
Yes, I will. I will tell him.

834
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,890
Okay.

835
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,670
Okay, thank you.

836
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,220
Thank you. Okay, bye.

837
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,940
What's the matter?

838
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,320
Mr. Zhao.

839
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,020
Look. My show

840
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,250
is only broadcast

841
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,590
during weekends.

842
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,510
Why did you change the schedule for me?

843
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,660
It's a decision made by

844
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,130
leaders of the company in a meeting.

845
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:34,840
No.

846
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,340
That's so unreasonable.

847
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,300
At least,

848
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,690
I'm a senior in the company.

849
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,920
I've worked here for so long.

850
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,560
Even though I haven't got any achievement, my hard work should be valued.

851
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,220
Tian Bin,

852
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,820
your show has ranked the last for almost half a year.

853
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,640
I...

854
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,980
Listen to my advice.

855
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,700
Set aside the time for shows

856
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,450
with high ratings.

857
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,770
If you really think

858
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,500
you have nothing to do,

859
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,340
you can make an opera show.

860
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,610
It happens that there are no

861
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,650
such shows in our radio station.

862
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,540
No. Wait.

863
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,770
What? Opera? I...

864
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,170
I used to be an anchor

865
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,970
of a popular show.

866
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,060
Do you really want me

867
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,780
to broadcast opera every day?

868
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,700
What do you mean?

869
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,740
What’s wrong with opera? It's a national treasure.

870
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,680
What do you mean?

871
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,860
No, I...

872
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
I mean

873
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,890
there's no much room

874
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,190
for development

875
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,100
for an opera show.

876
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,310
You can't say that.

877
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,060
Look at Zhang Ye.

878
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,740
He's been in the company for such a short time.

879
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,370
and he has increased the ratings so largely.

880
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,540
Why can't you

881
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,890
make the opera show?

882
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,660
On what ground?

883
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,670
Speaking of the Midnight Song,

884
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,370
I think

885
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,720
I also have some credit in it.

886
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,120
If I had not felt unwell

887
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,850
at that time,

888
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,210
and asked him to host the show for me,

889
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,890
Zhang Ye wouldn't have got the such achievements.

890
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,260
Enough.

891
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,300
Tian Bin,

892
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,080
if you were half as diligent as

893
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,000
Zhang Ye,

894
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,350
instead of

895
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,550
complaining here,

896
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,060
you wouldn't

897
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,210
have ended up like this,

898
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,540
being underachieving but unwilling to accept a worse job.

899
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,430
I wasn't like that. I...

900
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,540
Zhao Guozhou from Qomolangma.

901
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,470
Yes, I am.

902
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:09,940
Please wait a moment.

903
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,900
-You just...-If there's nothing else,

904
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,640
go back to work.

905
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,980
I'm sorry. Please go ahead.

906
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,910
The copyright of the song?

907
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,940
I need to discuss it with Zhang Ye.

908
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,830
We've never talked about this.

909
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,120
Okay.

910
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,660
I don't think he noticed it.

911
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,380
Maybe he didn't expect it.

912
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,680
Me, either.

913
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,630
Zhang Yuanqi. Zhang Yuanqi.

914
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,860
Welcome, Ms. Zhang.

915
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,640
Thanks for coming.

916
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,020
This way.

917
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,530
Mr. Zhao.

918
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,890
Why is she here?

919
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,120
So she is Zhang Yuanqi?

920
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,560
Well, I need to find a notebook.

921
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,320
I want her autograph.

922
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,370
Her legs are long and thin.

923
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,580
Zhang Ye?

924
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,940
Someone wants to talk to you.

925
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,840
No, I'm not.

926
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,700
I dare not sing again.

927
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,430
I dare not sing again.

928
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,140
Are you Zhang Ye?

929
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,510
I've heard a lot about you.

930
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,950
Who are you?

931
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,780
What are you doing?

932
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,220
Don't get me wrong.

933
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,670
I listened to your show

934
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,620
I want to collaborate with you.

935
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,550
Collaborate?

936
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,780
For your song

937
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,010
My Future Is Not a Dream.

938
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,900
How much will you sell it to me for?

939
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,740
I can't sell it.

940
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,980
You're not showing me respect?

941
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,090
It's not like that.

942
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,940
I really can't sell it.

943
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,210
If you have any conditions,

944
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,900
just tell me.

945
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,150
As for the conditions,

946
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,780
I need to...

947
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,980
I need to go back and think about it.

948
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,370
Don't worry. There's ample time ahead.

949
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,810
All right, come out.

950
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,570
Hey, you...

951
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,330
How do you think

952
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,070
Mr. Zhao and Zhang Yuanqi

953
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,860
met each other?

954
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,550
They used to be old friends.

955
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,660
He did a show for Zhang Yuanqi.

956
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,990
As Zhang Yuanqi came this time,

957
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,090
will our company

958
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,200
make a new program?

959
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,020
It's possible.

960
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,610
Right?

961
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,340
Yes.

962
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,220
Right. Maybe.

963
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,820
A super star like you came here.

964
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,060
What can I do for you?

965
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,740
What super star?

966
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,990
Don't laugh at me.

967
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,830
I'm here

968
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,650
to ask you about someone.

969
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,620
Who is it?

970
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,760
Do you have a man named Zhang Ye here?

971
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:13,740
I got it.

972
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,080
You came to see him

973
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,020
for what happened last night?

974
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,940
To be exact,

975
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,340
it's about the copyright.

976
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,130
Copyright?

977
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,510
I didn't ask him about it.

978
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,070
But you could have

979
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,780
asked your

980
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,200
assistant to handle this.

981
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,110
To be honest,

982
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:31,690
I sincerely

983
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,680
ask for cooperation.

984
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,410
Okay, wait a minute.

985
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,380
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

986
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,560
Come to my office.

987
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,130
Mr. Zhao asked me to go over.

988
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,000
Mr. Zhao.

989
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,210
Are you looking for me?

990
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,110
The super star, Miss Zhang Yuanqi.

991
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:10,980
No further introduction.

992
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,980
This is Zhang Ye.

993
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,900
Hello.

994
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,180
Zhang,

995
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:14,780
I've asked you here

996
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,180
to discuss something with you.

997
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,750
I want to buy the copyright of your song.
