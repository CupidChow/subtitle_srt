4
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,250
Are you done?

5
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,250
Don't take your work home.

6
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:52,140
If you don't focus,

7
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,050
how can you help me with my homework?

8
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,530
Well,

9
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,170
I help you with your homework.

10
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,740
Can you learn it yourself?

11
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,090
If you can't,

12
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,250
what will you do during the exam?

13
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,290
I can write.

14
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,920
I just don't want to do it.

15
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,700
These homework are so simple.

16
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,060
I can pass even with my eyes closed.

17
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,530
Can you improve?

18
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,419
You have to try to be

19
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,730
top five in the grade at least.

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,090
Don't worry. I know what to do.

21
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,010
Give me your phone.

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,140
Help me write.

23
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,060
I help your work.

24
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,890
What can you do for me?

25
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,220
Just tell me if you want to use your phone.

26
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,940
Gosh.

27
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,090
Finished.

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,370
What?

29
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,860
Didn't you always want Zhang Yuanqi

30
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,980
to be on your show?

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,360
I've invited

32
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,890
Zhang Yuanqi?

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,420
Do you know how expensive to

34
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,530
invite her?

35
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,140
How...

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,650
How can I withdraw it?

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,300
Write it by yourself.

38
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,810
No, you help me.

39
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,010
These are too simple.

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,890
Zhang.

41
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,170
Director Yan.

42
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,420
Have a seat.

43
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,250
You're quite resourceful.

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,170
How did you invite Zhang Yuanqi

45
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,010
as a mentor?

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,530
Zhang Yuanqi will be

47
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,060
a mentor in our show?

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,130
Yes.

49
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,220
She heard

50
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,370
you were the producer of the show,

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,579
and she said he would definitely come.

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,340
You're so proud.

53
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,450
But do we have enough funds?

54
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,340
Current funds

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,120
are already very tight.

56
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,340
Don’t worry.

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,860
With this diva in our show,

58
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,000
will the budget be less?

59
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,010
Look, the program budget

60
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,780
has been changed to SS level.

61
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,730
Do your best from now on.

62
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,500
If the show becomes popular,

63
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,300
you'll become famous.

64
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,579
You mean

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,250
our show

66
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,890
has rich budget and the diva now.

67
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,890
Yes.

68
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,340
Everyone, stop.

69
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,060
Zhang invited the diva to the show.

70
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,060
Everyone

71
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,730
applauses for him

72
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,300
and support his work in the future.

73
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,980
She's coming for you.

74
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,580
You have to deal with her.

75
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,420
Work hard.

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,610
Qi.

77
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,089
You're already a celebrity.

78
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
Just working at here?

79
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,959
Are you just for fund

80
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,790
to be a star?

81
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,700
Selling coffee is your business.

82
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,240
I really

83
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,020
don't know your true colors.

84
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,620
I don't sell coffee.

86
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,420
This is where I worked

87
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,330
before I became famous.

88
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,760
Now that I have money,

89
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,140
I bought it

90
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,760
to commemorate the period that

91
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,870
I found the pleasure

92
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,550
amidst the suffering.

93
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,330
How can you not sell coffee?

94
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,850
What a good business opportunity it is.

95
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,810
Fifty yuan, no, one hundred yuan for one cup.

96
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,860
Your fans must be eager to buy it.

97
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,330
Stop talking nonsense.

98
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,580
I'll show you

99
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,420
my studio

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,090
upstairs.

101
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,980
When you keep climbing up,

102
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,460
you will gradually lose a lot.

103
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,580
Even no one tells you

104
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,520
the true words.

105
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,520
The higher you stand, the lonelier you will be.

106
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,410
The harder it is to open your heart.

107
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,420
Just like the cafe downstairs,

108
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,180
it's hard to open the door

109
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,530
to welcome strangers.

110
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,140
It may be a bit pretentious,

111
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,210
but maybe after you become famous,

112
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,210
you'll understand it.

113
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,810
If you really can join our show

114
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,690
Super Loud,

115
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,490
perhaps you will make our dream come true.

116
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,409
I want to experience

117
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,570
the feeling of loneliness.

118
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,810
I will do

119
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,050
what I promised you.

120
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,580
Really?

121
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,659
Name your conditions.

122
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,740
For these 12 episodes,

123
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,300
I quote three million per episode.

124
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,140
Didn't you say

125
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,210
your cousin Zhang Yusheng

126
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,730
was an excellent singer-songwriter?

127
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,740
He should have many songs

128
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,300
left, right?

129
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,300
He did write a lot of songs.

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,330
But I don't know where the songs are.

131
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,810
No one has heard of them.

132
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,050
But don't worry.

133
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,240
I got the talent

134
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,460
from my cousin.

135
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,250
You can write songs too?

136
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,210
Of course.

137
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,650
I can't say I'm better than my cousin.

138
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,770
But I'm definitely not much worse

139
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,580
than my cousin.

140
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,409
How about this?

141
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,300
You write songs for me,

142
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,570
and I'll make a show for you.

143
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,300
Sure, no problem.

144
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,610
Attention, all departments.

145
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,770
One last check.

146
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:49,900
OK.

147
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,930
I'm fine now.

148
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,620
How is the makeup?

149
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,740
Almost done.

150
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Hurry up.

151
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,720
Take a look at camera number two.

152
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,720
How are the lights?

153
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,560
Get the cameras ready.

154
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,880
Get the lights ready and the flowers.

155
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,000
Hurry up.

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,680
Hurry up.

157
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,780
Keep an eye on the backstage.

158
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,160
Don't let other people in.

159
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,680
Let's begin.

160
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,870
Is the sound okay?

161
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,400
Yes.

162
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,990
I'm counting on you for the next round.

163
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,510
Hello?

164
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,960
What time do you get off work today?

165
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,190
I bought roasted goose.

166
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,550
I can't finish them with Chenchen.

167
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,840
I'll leave some for you.

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,360
I'm recording a show.

169
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,920
In order to catch up

170
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,870
Zhang Yuanqi's schedule,

171
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,280
we have to record two episodes today.

172
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,480
I might be late to go home.

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,360
Don't wait for me.

174
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,100
You guys eat first.

175
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,140
Take your time.

176
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,920
Are all the things ready?

177
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,870
Yes.

178
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,510
Come on.

179
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,600
We're ready.

180
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,630
We're going to record the next episode.

181
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Is there a problem?

182
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,750
Tell me timely.

183
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,190
♫Look at the bright fireworks in the sky♫

184
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,750
♫They are in your eyes♫

185
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,550
♫That's the gentleness hidden in my hands♫

186
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,400
Zhang Ye really invited the goddess

187
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,480
to be on his show.

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,720
He's so lucky.

189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,870
♫Slipping by quietly♫

190
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,360
It's because this show is popular.

191
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,070
♫You are the reason I fall in love♫

192
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,160
♫I want to hold your hand♫

193
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,960
I heard Zhang Yuanqi cheapened her level.

194
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,310
♫The time stops when I'm looking at you♫

195
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,280
She came

196
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,550
to help him with the show.

197
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,840
♫You're enough♫

198
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
You are still not angry?

199
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,870
♫I want to be with you♫

200
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,070
Zhang Ye said that

201
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,480
Zhang Yuanqi

202
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,630
was even prettier than on TV.

203
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,600
♫Collect happy memories♫

204
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,550
♫And fill up all your wishes♫

205
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,350
♫It's the way I love you♫

206
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,510
♫You just lean on my shoulder♫

207
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,800
Maybe it's not natural.

208
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,510
Look at that nose.

209
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,110
♫The night is long♫

210
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,960
Those eyes...

211
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,600
♫You're the warmest light♫

212
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,630
They are too fake.

213
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,040
♫I can't forget♫

214
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,570
Okay.

215
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,280
Success.

216
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,460
I was right about you.

217
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,360
And I didn't expect

218
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,550
you could make this show

219
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,870
today's result.

220
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,390
It's so great.

221
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,070
Work hard.

222
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,960
I was right about you.

223
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,270
Thank you for your encouragement, Director Yang.

224
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,190
Thank you for giving me this chance.

225
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,950
Don't worry.

226
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,280
I will make this show

227
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,330
be a stage that grass roots perform themselves.

228
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,070
I believe it.

229
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,420
I have led so many teams these years.

230
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,230
You're the most reassuring one.

231
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,400
Okay, go back and work hard.

232
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,920
Okay, I'm leaving.

233
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,420
Go.

234
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,600
When I recover,

235
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,430
let's work together.

236
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,670
Mr. Wang,

237
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,670
how can I arrange a player now?

238
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,110
I can't.

239
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,970
How many sponsors

240
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,190
can he bring?

241
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,100
Okay, I'll figure out a way.

242
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,990
How's the song

243
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,920
for Ms Qi?

244
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,910
Don't worry.

245
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,990
I will never forget

246
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,070
what I promised Ms Qi.

247
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,720
I've been recording the show

248
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,040
these days.

249
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,670
I was too busy

250
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,750
to do it.

251
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,280
Just wait for me two more days.

252
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,110
Hurry up.

253
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:40,920
Chenchen.

254
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,180
Have you finished your homework?

255
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,920
Do you need my help?

256
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,470
No.

257
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,480
Well,

258
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,480
I bought many yummy food

259
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,550
for you.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,920
Do you want to go to my place

261
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,870
to pick some?

262
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,240
No need.

263
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,550
There's nothing I don't like.

264
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,470
Just come to my room.

265
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,360
What's fun there?

266
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,530
It's like a pigsty.

267
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:08,870
I

268
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,160
bought you a gift.

269
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:14,920
Let's go.

270
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,910
Do you like them?

271
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,720
Yes.

272
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,550
Zhang Ye,

273
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,090
why did you buy these for me?

274
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,600
You look for me for no good reason.

275
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,070
Tell me.

276
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,420
Do you want me to help you again?

277
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,470
What are you talking about?

278
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,600
What do you mean again?

279
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,160
The song I sang last time

280
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,240
was My Future Is Not A Dream.

281
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,540
Because it was a life-and-death matter.

282
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,310
This song just came

283
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,510
into my mind.

284
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,110
Zhang Yuanqi has been urging me to get songs every day.

285
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,280
She urges me to get songs every day.

286
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,190
We can't

287
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,360
copy the songs

288
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,150
in the real world.

289
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,240
What's the difference

290
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,280
between me and Tian Bin?

291
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
So I think

292
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,870
let's work together.

293
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,210
I write lyrics and you compose songs.

294
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,840
Compose songs?

295
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,360
Do you think it's like doing homework?

296
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,800
Didn't you learn violin?

297
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,770
Music quality is built since you are a child.

298
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,400
Composing a song

299
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
is a piece of cake for you.

300
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,230
Compose the song first.

301
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,020
After I sell it to her,

302
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,530
I will buy you delicious food.

303
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,910
Deal.

304
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,300
Now let's start.

305
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,720
Compose a song first.

306
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,950
I'll hum the melody for you later.

307
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,360
You put my humming melody

308
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,360
on it.

309
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,600
Compose it, okay?

310
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:44,990
Okay.

311
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,870
Let's start.

312
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,990
The inspiration comes at will.

313
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,470
Stop.

314
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,190
Isn't this The Flower Child Lunlun?

315
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,310
It's okay.

316
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,260
There are plenty of songs.

317
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,230
Stop.

318
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,280
This is The hero's song.

319
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,750
The song also exists.

320
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,150
It's hard to compose.

321
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,430
Let's start with the lyrics.

322
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,800
It's very classic.

323
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,480
Remember.

324
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,830
Can I hug you, baby?

325
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,720
I think someone wrote this.

326
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,750
Will you still love me tomorrow?

327
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,730
Is it classic?

328
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,310
Someone wrote this too.

329
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,550
Someone wrote it too?

330
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,270
Can't you change your style

331
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,870
instead of writing so sweet and cloying lyrics,

332
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,190
such as flowers and grasses.

333
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,840
Flowers and grasses. Let me think about it.

334
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,410
Flower and grasses.

335
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,640
The shy rose

336
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,150
opens quietly.

337
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,360
I think someone wrote this before.

338
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,160
Why is it also so hard

339
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
to write lyrics?

340
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,410
Many songs

341
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,070
write lyrics with ancient poems.

342
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,040
How about this?

343
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,030
I'll read you a poem.

344
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,180
You can recite the poem

345
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,760
and compose a song for it.

346
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,550
I'll read it to you now.

347
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,430
Coming.

348
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,810
Pink hands so fine. Gold-branded wine.

349
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,530
Spring paints green willows palace walls cannot confine.

350
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,740
East wind unfair. Happy times rare.

351
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,490
In my heart sad thoughts throng that we've severed for years long.

352
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,280
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

353
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,620
Come on. You compose a song for me.

354
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,570
You're quite lazy.

355
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,190
You can recite ancient poems.

356
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
I don't know ancient songs.

357
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,160
It doesn't matter.

358
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,110
Your music quality

359
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,790
is not bad.

360
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,400
Just do it for me.

361
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,630
Zhang Ye!

362
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,750
Zhang Ye, open the door!

363
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,360
Why are you here?

364
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,630
Qi asked me to visit you

365
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,620
and brought you some fruits.

366
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,400
How's the song

367
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,040
that you promised her?

368
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,000
Well,

369
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,720
what should I call you?

370
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,520
Should I call you Bodyguard

371
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,550
or a bodyguard?

372
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,520
Nan.

373
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,430
Nan.

374
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,520
Nan, look at me.

375
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,599
I have a relapse recently.

376
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,520
Come on, stand up and let me see.

377
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,150
Don't.

378
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm afraid that it's not good for your eyes.

379
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,670
Don't worry.

380
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:23,910
I'll take care of

381
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,030
Qi's matter.

382
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,900
But recently,

383
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,270
I really feel bad.

384
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,790
That's why

385
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm not

386
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,960
doing very well. I'm in such situation this year.

387
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,910
You can't be anxious.

388
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,780
Please give me some time, okay?

389
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,640
In order to compose songs these days,

390
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,670
his eyes are almost dazed.

[Fast Learning of Music Theory]

392
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,110
Okay, you keep composing songs.

393
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,110
I'm leaving.

394
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,910
I won't see you off.

395
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,600
Come here.

396
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,480
Let me show you a magic trick.

397
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:00,990
It's gone.

398
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,190
Is it good?

399
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,910
Yes.

400
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,270
Hello, Nan.

401
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,240
I still have to say sorry.

402
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,430
A few days ago,

403
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,960
I bought a bone

404
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,070
for my dog.

405
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:24,670
Yes.

406
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,430
When it got excited,

407
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,670
it bit my hand.

408
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,600
It... It's the right hand.

409
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,230
Isn't it a coincidence?

410
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Just wait a bit more.

411
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,760
The swelling hasn't gone down yet.

412
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,360
It hurts even when I'm holding the phone.

413
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,670
Okay.

414
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
You're really good at making up stories.

415
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,000
Let's go.

416
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,390
Nan.

417
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,870
My hand is better.

418
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,600
But when I was walking the dog yesterday,

419
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,660
I accidentally hit a tree

420
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,400
and hit my eyes.

421
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,360
I couldn't see anything yesterday.

422
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,190
Fortunately, that dog can recognize my home's door.

423
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,590
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to go home.

424
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,030
Just wait a bit more.

425
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,600
I can't see things clearly.

426
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,240
As I'm outside now,

427
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,120
I don't know where to go.

428
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,780
Just wait.

429
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,000
I’ll call you later.

430
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,960
Hello, Nan.

431
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,880
What eyes?

432
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
My eyes are better.

433
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,790
I heard it wrong.

434
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,640
I thought you said glasses.

435
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,670
If you come to see me now,

436
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,910
I can't see you either.

437
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,390
Downstairs.

438
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,550
Looking for Zhang Ye? You...

439
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,310
Is he here?

440
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,530
No.

441
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,550
Zhang Ye!

442
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,630
Zhang Ye! Come out! Zhang Ye!

443
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,230
Don't shout.

444
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,070
He almost

445
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,230
has dementia, because of your push.

446
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,350
He didn't come back after taking a walk last night.

447
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,270
He went missing?

448
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,870
It's useless for you to come here.

449
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,600
Enough.

450
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,360
Either he comes out from the house

451
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,030
or comes back from outside today.

452
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,780
My job is to stand here anyway.

453
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,600
I'll stay here

454
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,720
until he shows up.

455
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,250
What's wrong with you?

456
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,480
Stand over there.

457
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,520
Stand over there.

458
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,000
My ass, sorry to make you suffer.

459
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,430
Next time I need one more bed sheet.

460
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,520
Enjoy and maximize all the pleasures which life affords!

461
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,630
Beer and skittles without work.

462
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,590
There must be a use for my talent.

463
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,790
It's not too heavy to carry bricks on the construction site.

464
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,000
How many urbanites' voices

465
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,790
are written in these lyrics?

466
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,760
It will definitely strike a big chord.

467
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,590
It's great.

468
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,500
But I think

469
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,310
it doesn't suit me.

470
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,160
[Where are you? Come back quickly.]

471
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,720
I composed some songs

472
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,110
about love.

473
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,610
Really?

474
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,580
Yes.

-Yes, they are also based on your long hair. -Ms Qi.

476
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,970
We have things to do later.

477
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,910
It's almost time.

478
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,390
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,550
I have work to do later.

480
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,640
Wang, come here.

481
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,070
Take Mr. Tian to downstairs.

482
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,430
-I… -Mr. Tian.

483
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,320
This way, please.

484
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,910
Okay.

485
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,120
Okay, Qi.

486
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,190
Please take a good look.

487
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,230
If you need anything,

488
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,840
I will amend them at any time.

489
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,190
Okay.

490
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,550
Okay.

491
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,070
Then...

492
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,410
Let's schedule the meeting again.

493
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:58,800
Okay.

494
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,600
Okay.

495
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,190
Bye, Qi.

496
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,670
This way, please.

497
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,240
Everyone thinks

498
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,270
they can compose songs.

499
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,510
How is Zhang Ye?

500
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,100
He ran away.

501
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,070
I chased him for several blocks.

502
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,780
I saw him

503
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,720
in Room 202

504
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,550
in Good Sleep Tonight Hotel.

505
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,000
I think he's a liar.

506
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,020
Should I teach him a lesson?

507
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,760
Forget it.

508
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,670
Give him some time.

509
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,030
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

510
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,060
I have nothing to do here.

511
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:30,710
Go back now.

512
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,860
There's a live broadcast at 10 p.m.

513
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,760
I'll go with you.

514
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,880
It's okay. I can find someone else.

515
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,910
Go back.

516
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,060
Thank you, Qi.

517
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,080
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

518
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,920
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

519
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,910
I'm starving. When will the dinner be available?

520
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,310
Don't worry. Just wait a moment.

521
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,020
Yes, someone is not here.

522
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,480
Hello, Chenchen.

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,720
I'm composing a song.

525
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,550
What day is it today?

526
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,430
What? What day?

527
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,150
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

528
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,990
Come back for dinner now.

529
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,590
Auntie said

530
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,670
a family

531
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,030
should be reunited.

532
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,760
Did your aunt really say that?

533
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,950
Anyway, I've brought the message.

534
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,140
It's up to you.

535
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,390
Yes.

536
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,670
I'll be right back.

537
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,600
Wait for me.

538
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,400
What are you writing here?

539
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,270
I will do it tomorrow.

540
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,360
There are so many delicious food that

541
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,430
can't stop you from talking.

542
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,850
If you fall in love with her,

543
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,790
you will...

544
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,270
Who are you?

545
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,950
I...

546
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,110
Why are you here?

547
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,800
What's the smell on you?

548
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,150
I smell of the medicine.

549
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,990
Don't you know

550
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,000
why I'm here?

551
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,420
I'm sick.

552
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,710
The doctor told me that I need to rest.

553
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,150
This place is close to the hospital.

554
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,840
So I came here to rest.

555
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,240
Another hemorrhoids.

556
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,120
It's bronchial inflammation caused by hemorrhoids.

557
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,670
Due to the cough, I feel dizzy and

558
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,180
my limbs are numb and cold.

559
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,470
I can't do anything.

560
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,910
Your nonsense

561
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,310
is really something.

562
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,710
I've never heard of

563
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,650
hemorrhoids

564
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,240
can trigger bronchial inflammation.

565
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,400
I don't know.

566
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,820
The doctor said so.

567
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,360
When will you

568
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,150
create a medical miracle for me?

569
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,450
It's all because of you.

570
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,790
I even shiver

571
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,360
when I look at Nan.

572
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,760
You asked him to rush me to submit my manuscript.

573
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,480
I have nightmares every day.

574
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,530
Let alone no inspiration.

575
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,510
Even if I have inspirations, they will disappear because I am shocked by him.

576
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,150
This is our promise.

577
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,270
You compose songs for me and

578
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,280
I'll make a show for you.

579
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,940
You don't have to compose songs.

580
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,120
I won't do the show either.

581
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,720
No, no, no.

582
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,110
Give me some time.

583
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm working on it.

584
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,920
I'll submit the manuscript soon.

585
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,630
She must be here.

586
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,190
I’ll hand it over soon.

587
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,190
This hotel?
Don’t worry.

588
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,150
Yes.

589
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,120
You can't come in.

590
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,310
No! No!

591
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,560
I need to go to the toilet.

592
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,480
You can't go in the hotel for your work.

593
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,270
Hurry up. Let's go.

594
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,630
No, brother.

595
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,520
I can't hold it anymore. Please help me.

596
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,480
I'll call the police if you don't leave.

597
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,390
I'll call the police if you don't leave.

598
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:30,960
It's okay.

599
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,830
I'll call the police.

600
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,520
Let's go.

601
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,210
I'll call the police.

602
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
No, no, no.

603
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,540
Card.

604
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,360
Hello?

605
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,030
The news said

606
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,360
you were blocked in a small hotel.

607
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,230
Were you photographed?

608
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:05,810
I don't know.

609
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,550
I have changed several cars,

610
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,530
but I still got followed.

611
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,360
What should we do now?

612
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,530
The old way. You solve it.

613
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Okay, leave it to me.

614
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,390
You really compose it?

615
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,530
No, it is not mature.

616
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,720
Not mature?

617
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,880
No, this...

618
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,000
This won't do either.

619
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,690
I'll give it to you once I'm done.

620
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't worry, Qi.

621
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,120
You...

622
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,730
Where are you staring at?

623
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:46,720
[Weibo Hot Search]

624
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,040
Who sent the fake news?

625
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,910
It's on the top search of Weibo.

626
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,120
Zhang Yuanqi is playing mahjong.

627
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,880
We waited for nothing.

628
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,030
Yeah, what happened?

629
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,550
Alright.

630
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,270
Let's go.

631
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
The information is not accurate.

632
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:54,910
Let's go.

633
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,430
We waited for nothing.

634
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,590
Where are you going?

635
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,190
Don't go.

636
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,000
What are you doing? Stay here.

637
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,660
I'm sure

638
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
the person inside must be Zhang Yuanqi.

639
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,570
Look.

640
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
I even took the photo of her back.

641
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,300
No, you...

642
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,920
They've already sent it official.

643
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,600
Don't you know

644
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,310
the tricks of a celebrity?

645
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,600
Fine, I trust you.

646
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,150
Brother, what should we do now?

647
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,690
Let's wait here.

648
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,320
I don't believe they won't come out.

649
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,950
Gosh.

650
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,390
Your PR team is good.

651
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,200
When can they leave?

652
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,660
Are you busy?

653
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,230
Isn't today the festival?

654
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,880
You have a date.

655
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,340
Not really.

656
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,840
We're just a family and

657
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,790
we will have dinner together.

658
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,800
Family?

659
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,070
It's been a long time

660
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,420
to have dinner with my family.

661
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,160
Hello?

662
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,250
Most reporters have left.

663
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,400
Two reporters left.

664
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,430
Okay.

665
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,720
Remember to tell me when they leave.

666
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,640
I'll find a way

667
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,550
to distract them.

668
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,610
I'll tell you later.

669
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,290
Bye.

670
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,110
Okay.

671
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,710
Aren't you having dinner with your family?

672
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,790
Go ahead.

673
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,120
No, I...

674
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,980
I want to.

675
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,490
But I didn't know

676
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,970
if the paparazzi caught me.

677
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,480
If they did catch me

678
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,310
and I went down now,

679
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,960
I would let myself be caught.

680
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,600
They are

681
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,320
waiting for us.

682
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,080
Then we can only

683
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,520
go ahead.

684
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,650
How?

685
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,420
Let's wait and see.

686
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,360
I thought you had

687
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
a brilliant way.

688
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,070
We

689
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,370
just meet changes with constancy.

690
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,250
Zhang Ye,

691
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,950
you are

692
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,390
a famous producer.

693
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,840
Even if you try to avoid the rush,

694
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,760
you should find a better place.

695
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,020
You should at least find a hotel

696
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,150
with backdoor

697
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,840
or an underground garage.

698
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,430
Okay.

699
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,240
Okay. How about this?

700
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,680
I'll go down

701
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,390
and explain to those paparazzi.

702
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,130
I will say that

703
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,310
I'm writing a script here

704
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,290
and Qi

705
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,400
is here to urge me to write scripts.

706
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,790
Let's see if they believe it or not.

707
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,290
No way.

708
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,430
With your mouth,

709
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,920
you are always lying.

710
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,840
I was sweating.

711
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,590
Go to take a shower.

712
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,640
Take a shower.

713
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,710
Shower?

714
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,100
This must be the headline.

715
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,150
Trust me. That's right.

716
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,470
I will let you get the big news today.

717
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,780
Writing lyrics. Writing lyrics.

718
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,700
Eyes view the nose, the nose views the mouth

719
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,400
and the mouth views the heart.

720
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,280
I'm not that kind of person.

721
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,560
Calm down.

722
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,270
What?

723
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,510
I'm composing songs.

724
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,030
You write lyrics again.

725
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,830
Why did you take so long?

726
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,730
I need to go to the toilet.

727
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,480
Auntie,

728
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,840
I think it's enough to leave one crag

729
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,200
for Zhang Ye.

730
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,370
Don't leave any for him.

731
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,550
Let him eat the shells.

732
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,210
Come here.

733
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,190
Why are you drinking?

734
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,030
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

735
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,400
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

736
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,330
Zhang Ye.

737
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,730
I found a problem.

738
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,350
You

739
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,199
look ordinary at first view,

740
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,670
but you have a quite good-looking.

741
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,770
I'm a good-looking type.

742
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,220
Look at you.

743
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,800
You look

744
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,260
pretty at first view.

745
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,820
After a long time,

746
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,490
you look better than your look at first sight.

747
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,590
Compared with your girlfriend,

748
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,510
who is prettier?

749
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,480
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

750
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,080
Who are you lying to?

751
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,430
A cultural worker like you

752
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,510
with knowledge in your brain

753
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,830
are all aged boys.

754
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,190
Do you have any misunderstanding

755
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,350
about cultural workers?

756
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,910
A talented

757
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,510
and pretty celebrity

758
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,110
is also single.

759
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,660
I didn't say I was single.

760
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,070
You're not?

761
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,960
It's Mid-Autumn Festival today,

762
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,460
but you come to urge me for the songs on the Mid-Autumn Festival

763
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,970
instead of going on a date?

764
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,810
Who would believe that you're not single?

765
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,870
You're right.

766
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,720
It's true that

767
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,240
I have difficulty to live a normal life.

768
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,260
Take the boyfriend as an example.

769
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,270
The rich people treat you like a vase

770
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,460
and the poor people treat you as a cash cow.

771
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,430
If you are cool,

772
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,430
the audience would say you were unrestrained.

773
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,960
If I'm more introverted,

774
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,210
the media said I was weird.

775
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,550
I act in the play and my life is also acting.

776
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,870
Sometimes,

777
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,910
I don't even know

778
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,000
who I am.

779
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,240
Actually,

780
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,050
I don't think you need to think like that way.

781
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,300
Look.

782
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,940
Your efforts

783
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,190
reward an outcome,

784
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,760
right?

785
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,600
So many people like you.

786
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,840
As the saying goes,

787
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,230
if you want to show off in front of others,

788
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,110
you must suffer behind others.

789
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,600
Besides,

790
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,470
you just feel lonely.

791
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,770
It's nothing, right?

792
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,610
Sometimes I really want to

793
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,770
quit.

794
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,280
Go to a place

795
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,700
where no one knows me

796
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,060
and live a normal life.

797
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
You won't understand.

798
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,680
You won't understand

799
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,670
the difficulties of being an artist.

800
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,180
What did you write

801
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,080
in such a long time?

802
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,030
I wrote...

803
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,350
When will the moon be clear and bright?

804
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,950
With a cup of wine in my hand, I ask the blue sky.

805
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,790
I don’t know what season it would be

806
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,630
in the heavens on this night.

807
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,440
I’d like to ride the wind to fly home.

808
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,610
Yet I fear the crystal and jade mansions

809
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,890
are much too high and cold for me.

810
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,900
Dancing with my moon-lit shadow.

811
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,040
It does not seem like the human world.

812
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,290
The moon rounds the red mansion, stoops to silk-pad doors

813
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,010
and shines upon the sleepless.

814
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,090
Bearing no grudge.

815
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,680
Why does the moon tend to be full when people are apart?

816
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,730
People may have sorrow or joy, be near or far apart,

817
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,700
The moon may be dim or bright, wax or wane.

818
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,070
This has been going on since the beginning of time.

819
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,950
May we all be blessed with longevity.

820
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,470
Though far apart, we are still able to share the beauty of the moon together.

821
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:16,940
You...

822
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,280
Why did you open the curtains?

823
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,470
I just want to see the moon.

824
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,040
Look at the moon.

825
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,040
Can it work?

826
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,590
It's cold in high places.

827
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,230
Isn't that me?

828
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,710
I got on stage when I was seven.

829
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,840
I entered the entertainment industry when I was 13,

830
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,280
and climbed up step by step.

831
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,070
But I lost my freedom.

832
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,470
I really want

833
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,330
a farmland life.

834
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,830
But it's all a dream.

835
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,730
Even the days

836
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,690
that I meet

837
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,160
with friends are not allowed.

838
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,850
The jade tower is beautiful and it's cold in high places.

839
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,120
It looks beautiful.

840
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,800
But now,

841
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,970
I even don't have rights

842
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,720
to see the moon.

843
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,070
Give it to me.

844
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,250
What?

845
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,900
What did you say?

846
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,250
Give it to me.

847
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,460
Auntie, look.

848
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,280
What are you looking at?

849
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,590
There's a scandal about Zhang Yuanqi.

850
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,150
With whom?

851
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,640
I don't know yet.

852
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,850
They got stuck by the reporters

853
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,050
in a small hotel.

854
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:09,730
No.

855
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:10,840
Zhang Ye seems to also be

856
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,140
in this small hotel.

857
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,000
They...

858
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,650
They are shameless.

859
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,690
No, no.

860
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:26,690
No, no.

861
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:27,770
Auntie,

862
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,000
don't you know Zhang Ye?

863
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,210
You're just a kid.

864
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,290
What do you know?

865
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,130
Go to sleep.

866
00:40:59,150 --> 00:40:59,870
Sorry, I...

867
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,930
I really can't give it to you.

868
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,480
Well, I...

869
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,860
Actually,

870
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,970
I have a favorite person in my heart.

871
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,370
What are you thinking?

872
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:08,990
I'm talking about the lyrics.

873
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,410
So, you're saying lyrics.

874
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,000
You scared me.

875
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,720
So you agreed?

876
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,190
No.

877
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,960
I can't give you the lyrics.

878
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:19,940
How about this?

879
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,970
I'll write you

880
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,130
a better song for you.

881
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,170
I want this one.

882
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,890
This song is not mine.

883
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,710
Whose song is it then?

884
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,380
Su Dongpo.

885
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,380
Who is Su Dongpo?

886
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,560
Su Dongpo is

887
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,750
a man surnamed Su.

888
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,680
He is called Su Dongpo.

889
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:39,650
Hello.

890
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,600
Qi, you don't forget

891
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,920
there's a live broadcast at ten o'clock today.

892
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,720
If you don't show up in time,

893
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,390
our lies

894
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,430
can't be hidden.

895
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,250
Okay, I got it.

896
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,210
I have to go.

897
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,510
What about the paparazzi?

898
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,870
If you leave now, you'll be doomed.

899
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,200
I have a live broadcast at 10.

900
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,560
If I don't show up,

901
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,410
I will also be exposed.

902
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,910
Otherwise, why did I take a shower?

903
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,710
Wait, don't worry.

904
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,300
Let me think.

905
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,210
Let me make a call.

906
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,560
Hello, Min.

907
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,250
Can you do me a favor?

908
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:22,860
What is it?

909
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,120
Zhang Yuanqi and I

910
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,840
were blocked in a small hotel.

911
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,590
Zhang Ye, how dare you!

912
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,670
I've been so good to you,

913
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,330
but you went to a room with someone else.

914
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,470
Fine.

915
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,150
You're not even in our family's hotel.

916
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,390
If you have money, you give it to others

917
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,320
instead of me.

918
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,190
Come here.

919
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,300
I'll explain it to you face to face.

920
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,840
To see your ugly faces?

921
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,870
Shameless!

922
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,110
Come here.

923
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,000
It'll be too late,

924
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,070
if anything can't change.

925
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,310
Okay.

926
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,480
I'll go and see

927
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,630
how you cook.

928
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:54,420
Just wait.

929
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,270
Yes.

930
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,090
During the Mid-Autumn Festival,

931
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,560
we are waiting here.

932
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,350
What can you do

933
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,070
as a reporter?

934
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:14,450
Coming.

935
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,260
Come on in.

936
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,170
Hurry up.

937
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,500
Rao Aimin, let me tell you.

938
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,500
What happened?

939
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,410
Nothing happened.

940
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,510
The information on the Internet is fake.

941
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,190
Help me now.

942
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,330
You're Zhang Yuanqi?
