Zhang.

5
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,140
I called you over

6
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,850
to discuss something.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,250
I want to buy the copyright of your song.

8
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,979
I told you.

9
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,860
It's not my call on that song.

10
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,820
Name your price.

11
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,460
Money is not an issue.

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
It's not about money.

13
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,660
I really can't make the decision

14
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,620
about that song.

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,759
Zhang.

16
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,170
Don't be so sure about that.

17
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
Everything can be negotiated.

18
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,000
Miss Zhang.

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,420
I'm not looking for trouble here.

20
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,180
See?

21
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,340
Mr. Zhao has come forward.

22
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,180
Actually, that song

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,100
was composed by a friend of mine.

24
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,180
Your friend?

25
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,140
I'm really sorry.

26
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,660
If there's nothing else,

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,700
I'll leave now.

28
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,810
He's out here.

29
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,590
He's out here.

30
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,329
How is it?

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,220
Did you see the living Zhang Yuanqi?

32
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,490
Yes.

33
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,490
Where's the autograph?

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,500
I forgot about it.

35
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,230
Good job, Zhang.

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,220
Does the superstar Zhang

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,140
want to collaborate with you?

38
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,829
I'm not that talented.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
It's not my turn.

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,700
Can you tell?

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
We didn't mean

42
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,660
to make things difficult for you.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,740
Mr. Zhao.

44
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,060
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,460
I understand

46
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,300
what Zhang Ye said.

47
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,450
It's rare to see someone

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,620
who puts friends on top of personal interests.

49
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,530
Yeah.

50
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,860
He is loyal to friends.

51
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,660
You have so many talents in your company.

52

You have good taste.

53

I'm not as good as you superstar.

54

If you don't mind,

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,340
can I have your autograph?

56
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220

57

Here, pen.

58
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,740

59
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,380

60
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,570

Give it to me.

64

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,370
Why do you come to my office often today?

71
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,220
Mr. Zhao,

72
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
I have something important to report.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,780
Is it about

74
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,660
your show again?

75
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,579
Listen to me.

76
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,140
No, no.

77
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,500
It's about Zhang Ye's song.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,740
That song?

79
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,810
Zhang Yuanqi is a superstar.

80
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,500
Why did she come to our company?

81
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,900
None of your business.

82
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,720
Did she come here for the copyright?

83
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,030

84
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,330

85
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,060
How can he sell my song?

86
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,900
Your song?

87
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,230

when I was free.

89
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,140
Zhang Ye had listened to it a few times.

90
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,579
He took it yesterday

91
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,420
and used it temporarily.

92
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,900
I heard that

93
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,730
it was his friend who wrote it.

94
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,980
Exactly.

95

Don't you think Zhang Ye

is really arrogant?

What I want is long-term cooperation.

To be honest,

129

I wrote that song

131
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,540

133

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,490
He is very honest.

135
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,820
He asked me

136

to contact you right away.

Mr. Zhao, Tian Bin

147
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,060
is shameless,

148
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,460
villainous, and despicable.

149
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,590
If he ever had to have a baby...

150
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,940
Hold on. The baby is innocent.

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,100

155

From the perspective of morality,

156
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm totally on your side.

157
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,210
But from the perspective of the process,

158
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,480
I can't stop him from doing that.

159
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,770
I sang

160
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,890
the song first.

161
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:52,750
I...

162
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,900
I want to sue him.

163
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,210
It's your call.

164
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,700

if you have any new works,

166
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,300

about copyright.

168
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,020
Well, Mr. Zhao,

169
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,460
I sang this song

170
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,580
in an emergency.

171
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,140
Did you mean

172
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,100
I had to tell that girl

173
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,460
"I want to sing a song for you"?

174
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,620
But now, my song

175
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,820
hasn't registered the copyright yet.

176
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,860
Can you wait

177
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,580
until I get the copyright?

178
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,320
Mr. Zhao, do you think this works?

179
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,100
With such a bad guy in our company,

180
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,260
I can't take it anymore.

181
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,030
I quit.

182
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:33,980
Mr. Zhao,

183
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,300
I'm such a promising young man,

184
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,980
won't you try to keep me,

185
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,020
or even just try to be polite?

186
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,260
I was just letting off some steam.

187
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Can't you tell?

188
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,500
So I'm thinking about transferring you

189
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,700
out of the night live show for the time being.

190
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,570
You're transferring me away?

191
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,540
I'm not a troublemaker.

192
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,040
Why do you want to transfer me?

193
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,370
It's obvious that I have some important work

194
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,010
for you.

195
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,740
The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching.

196
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,930
The Mid-Autumn Poetry Conference

197
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,010
will take place next week.

198
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,980
It's our company's turn to organize it.

199
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,100
It'll be broadcast by the TV station

200
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,940
in cooperation with several new media companies.

201
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,060
The board takes it very seriously.

202
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,020
So from tomorrow onwards,

203
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,290
you'll go help the project team

204
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,220
for the Mid-Autumn Poetry Conference.

205
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:09,620
Well...

206
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,900
Well, I...

207
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,980
What about my show?

208
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,740
We'll talk about it after the conference.

209
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,860
This is for you.

210
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,050
Look.

211
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,710
[Nomination Certificate]

212
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,660
The nomination certificate.

213
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,890
Osmanthus Under the Moon, Zhang Ye.

214
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,740
Flowers fall from the sky as if from the moon.

215
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,179
Picking up the fresh flowers in front of the temple.

216
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,620
I still don't know why someone doesn't like the trees.

217
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,179
It must be because Chang'e scattered the flowers to the people.

218
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,059
Isn't this...

219
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,580
Last time,

220
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,260
Mei listened to your program

221
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,100
and took some notes.

222
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,820
What do you call this? Smart hip-hop?

223
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,480
Yes, smart hip-hop.

224
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,460
It's very innovative,

225
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,990
although I'm afraid I don't relate to it.

226
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,820
But there are a few sentences

227
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,820
that are quite interesting.

228
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,290
There is a poem in the lyrics

229
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,150
that suits the Mid-Autumn Festival,

230
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,700
so Mei submitted it on your behalf.

231
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,100
It turned out that you got nominated.

232
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,500
If you

233
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,980
use your talent in creating

234
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,420
instead of criticizing,

235
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,220
your time will come.

236
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,780
I think you just need to practice more.

237
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,420
It's a live show on TV.

238
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,020
Mr. Zhao, it's so considerate of you.

239
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,820
If I get the first place,

240
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,700
then,

241
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
you must return the show

242
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,540
back to me.

243
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,860
Don't be overconfident.

244
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,780
Tian Bin also got nominated.

245
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,700
We don't know who will win.

246
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,940
Besides,

247
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,220
his uncle

248
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,940
is the chairman of the Poetry Association.

249
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,820
I think you'll probably

250
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,180
get in top five.

251
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,060
I'll be happy with that.

252
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,820
Tian Bin also got nominated?

253
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,440
Mr. Zhao, I'm gonna go prepare for it.

254
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,030
Hello, everyone.

255
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,110
This is Late Night DJ.

256
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm the host, Tian Bin.

257
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,090
Thank you for your support.

258
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,570
Late Night DJ

259
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,020
will be back to this time every day.

260
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,220
I'm happy to be here

261
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,860
-What's the crap? -to spend every midnight with you.

262
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,900
-I'd better take a nap. -The next song

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,780
is for you who haven't slept tonight.

264
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,700
Boring.

265
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,140
Let's go.

266
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,980
I don't want to listen anymore.

267
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,100
Let's get back to work.

268
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,500
Let's go.

269
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,660
Let's go.

270
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,460
Boring.

271
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,940
Aunt...

272
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,070
What's wrong?

273
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,940
What are you doing in the midnight?

274
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,690
I thought

275
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,700
there had been a mouse.

276
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,900
Who told you to eat in the middle of the night?

277
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,460
You're a girl.

278
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,330
You should behave yourself.

279
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,260
You don't eat because you're afraid of getting fat.

280
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,700
I'm not afraid. I'm still young.

281
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,780
I'm counting on this meal before sleep

282
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,620
to grow taller.

283
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,050
Look, you're making it all over the bed.

284
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,460
Aren't you afraid

285
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,820
the cockroaches will follow it

286
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,300
to your brain through your ear in the middle of the night?

287
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,660
Let me ask you something.

288
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,300
Isn't Zhang Ye usually

289
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,060
on air at this time?

290
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,140
I've been listening to the radio

291
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,890
but he's not here.

292
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Did he say anything to you?

293
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,060
It's late at night.

294
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,780
Why don't you sleep but listen to the ratio?

295
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,090
You'll age fast if you stay up late.

296
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:34,980
Do you know that?

297
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,610
No.

298
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,820
I'd rather let cockroaches

299
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,220
get inside

300
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:40,980
through my ear

301
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,660
than listen to Zhang Ye's screaming.

302
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,460
Are you still eating?

303
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,970
Get up and brush your teeth.

304
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,620
You're so heavy and so fat.

305
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,060
I'm not fat.

306
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,820
No wonder this guy

307
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,940
is being polite with everyone.

308
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,330
His uncle

309
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,250
is the chairman of the Poetry Association.

310
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,860
Tian Bin.

311
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,540
You're done for.

312
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,740
I could recite all Tang Dynasty poems when I was seven.

313
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,340
I'll show you

314
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,060
what a talented student

315
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,770
of the Broadcasting College looks like.

316
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,420
Hello, boss.

317
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,420
What can I do for you?

318
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,940
You quit as the host?

319
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,180
I haven't heard

320
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,260
your show for days.

321
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,060
Did you do anything bad

322
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,090
so they fired you?

323
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,450
No.

324
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,500
My leader

325
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,860
asked me to be in charge of the Mid-Autumn Poetry Conference.

326
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,420
I'm just a brick.

327
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,860
I go wherever they need me.

328
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,260
No one is as versatile as me.

329
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,500
Well, then the day after tomorrow,

330
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,380
I'll sit in front of the TV

331
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,500
to see which table you moved.

332
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,740
I was just thinking about it.

333
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,940
By that time,

334
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,380
I want to put adverts of our hotel

335
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,420
on every table

336
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,520
to publicize it.

337
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,450
I'll give you a discount for the advertising fee.

338
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,420
Cut the crap.

339
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,020
Come back for dinner tonight.

340
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,940
Don't always order takeout.

341
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,130
Okay.

342
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,340
Hello.

343
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,100
Hello.

344
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,570
Are you checking in or looking for someone?

345
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,100
Does Zhang Ye, Mr. Zhang,

346
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,820
live here?

347
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,260

First of all,

523
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,140
to all the audience

524
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,540
who are watching the online live

525
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,580

528
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,940
The Mid-Autumn Poetry Conference

529

00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,670

00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,940
and the Big Durain Company.

533
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,700
Thank you for the sponsorship

534
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,820
by the Plus Baby Milk Tea.

535
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,380
Right.

536
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,610
First, let's welcome

537
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,140

Meng Dongguo, Mr. Meng.

539
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,110
Welcome.

540
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,370
Let's welcome the famous poet,

541
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,610
Mr. Jiang Dabai.

542
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,430
Let's welcome the famous poet, Mr. Lei.

543
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,100
Welcome.

544
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,580
Let's welcome the famous poet,

545
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,830
Mr. Zheng Anbang.

546
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,860
The poems and works in our competition

547
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,600
have been published

548
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,100
on our official website.

549
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,460
You can log into

550
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,330
our official website

551
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,540
and vote

552
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,260
for your favorite works.

553
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,820
Every one of you have three votes.

554
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,020
The voting result

555
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,420
will be supervised

556
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
by the notaries from the East Notary Office.

557
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,170
The votes will be counted

558
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,760
after all the poems are recited.

559
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,580
Right. At this moment,

560
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,620
the publishing portal

561
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,660
is still open

562
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,340
for those off-site contestants.

563
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,780
All poetry fans

564
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,130
can release their own works

565
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,460
or vote for others.

566
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,020
The voting result

567
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,580
of the works by the off-site contestants

568
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,900
will also be supervised

569
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,900
by the notaries.

570
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,900
So everyone must

571
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,020
cherish the voting right

572
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,380
in your hand.

573
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:03,490
Yes.

574
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,570
The poem competition

575
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,090
now begins.

576
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,220
You don't watch TV,

577
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,010
but stare at the small screen everyday.

578
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,080
Aren't your eyes tired?

579
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,740
You don't understand.

580
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,540
You have to watch this kind of show

581
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,740
together with the comments.

582
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,350
That's way more fun.

583
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,560
Mid-Autumn Festival.

584
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,230
Let me take a look.

585
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,830
Look.

586
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,980
These netizens are so talented.

587
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,660
They posted everything.

588
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,860
Mid-Autumn Festival.

589
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,460
Every family eats mooncakes.

590
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
One

591
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,440
after another.

592
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
Is this a poem?

593
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,360
What's so funny?

594
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,250
Don't you think it's funny?

595
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,180
Please comment on our contestant.

596
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,540
I think you are funny.

597
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,570
This poem

598
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,250
seems simple,

599
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,900
but the real meaning...

600
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,380
Mid-Autumn Festival...There you go.

601
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,050
In my opinion,

602
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,780
it's a good one.

603
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,620
Okay, thank you sir.

604
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,370
Next, let's enjoy

605
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,240
the five-character quatrain,

606
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,710
Go Home,

607
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,570
by Tian Bin

608
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,450
from the new media company, Qomolangma.

609
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,740
This poem

610
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,540
has very good comments

611
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,890
online.

612
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,220
Let's listen to what the writer thinks about it.

613
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,580
What's so unique

614
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,660
about this poem?

615
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,280
Thank you.

616
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,740
It's a poem.

617
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:18,940
It has its artistic conception.

618
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,790
I believe after I recite it,

619
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,420
everyone will have the answer

620
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,340
in their minds.

621
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,140
You look very confident.

622
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,300
Please begin.

623
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,380
Okay.

624
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,770
Go Home.

625
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,880
Go back in a hurry on a festival.

626
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,960
No thoughts; no heavy baggage.

627
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,380
Bright moon reflects in the curtains.

628
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,980
The bad...

629
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,370
Tian Bin read the wrong word.

630
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,820
He said "bad" not "bed".

631
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,020
It's a typical mispronunciation.

632
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,020
Gets into shadows.

633
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,740
This poem is very interesting.

634
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,220
With just four sentences,

635
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,340
it shows the scene

636
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,670
nowadays people work far away from home,

637
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,300
but on holidays,

638
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,400
they come back and unite with their lovers.

639
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,660
They are too hurried on the road

640
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
to appreciate the moon.

641
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,700
It conveys a feeling of

642
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,360
"absence making the heart grow fonder".

643
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,540
It sounds like

644
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,980
it's created by a dink.

645
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,940
Good.

646
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,740
Can I ask you a question?

647
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,860
Let's listen to

648
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,420
what kind of question

649
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,380
he has.

650
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,700
OK.

651
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,260
I have some concerns

652
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,780
with this poem.

653
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,740
Tian Bin, did you write this poem?

654
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,900
Of course.

655
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,740
Since you wrote the poem yourself,

656
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,420
how could you make a mistake?

657
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,860
Nonsense!

658
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,340
What did I do wrong?

659
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,380
You should read the word "bed",

660
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,300
but you said "bad".

661
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,300
Well...

662
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,940
Let me tell you.

663
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,060
It has different pronunciations.

664
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,220
These two words

665
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,900
are different,

666
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,060
although they look a bit alike.

667
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,540
Look.

668
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,140
Your poem on the official website

669
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,780
is written as "bed".

670
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,820
Our contestant

671
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,140
must be really meticulous.

672
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,260
Let me introduce him to our audience.

673
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,060
He is also

674
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,540
a contestant

675
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,170
from the new media company Qomolangma.

676
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,700
They used to be partners

677
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,900
in a same show.

678
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,340
So I'd like to know

679
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,410
if you have planned this

680
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,300
to give us

681
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,530
a cross talk?

682
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,500
Yeah, you're right.

683
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,820
We are...

684
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,930
Yes, we were

685
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,500
colleagues before.

686
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,420
But later,

687
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,060
he drank while doing a live broadcast,

688
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,660
and then registered the copyright

689
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,340
of a song I wrote.

690
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,860
We broke up long ago.

691
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,700
As the saying goes,

692
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,220
those whose courses are different cannot lay plans for one another.

693
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,260
What are you talking about?

694
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,100
You know what? This...

695
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,940
I didn't drink.

696
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,820
Pull him out. Hurry up.

697
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,940
It's live broadcasting.

698
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,100
Cut in with the commercials.

699
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,700
He hit me.

700
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,220
Wait.

701
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,740
Wait. Wait.

702
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,300
Go back.

703
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,590
It's okay.

704
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,670
MC, please continue.

705
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,100
Hi, are you the contestant

706
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,620
Zhang Ye?

707
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,220
Yes, I am.

708
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,700
You did really well just now.

709
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,380
Your criticism was right on point.

710
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,980
But you haven't read your poem yet.

711
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,340
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

712
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,690
What a good timing.

713
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,380
A while later,

714
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,780
we'll listen to your poem.

715
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,290
You're giving me a chance to read my poem?

716
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,770
Of course.

717
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,780
Today is the Mid-Autumn Poetry Conference.

718
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,100
It's a great opportunity.

719
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,640
How can you not show yourself?

720
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,150
You young people are full of hope.

721
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,220
You will definitely bring us

722
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,420
unexpected harvest.

723
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,020
Please.

724
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,100
Let's listen to it later.

725
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,500
Okay.

726
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,260
How come he can recite his poem?

727
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,020
Shut up.

728
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,700
Don't you feel ashamed?

729
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,740
You can't even tell the difference between those two words.

730
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,500
Go back.

731
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,730
I'll help you

732
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,900
get him back.

733
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,420
Uncle.

734
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,860
All departments, get ready.

735
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,820
Camera 1, Camera 2, turn it on.

736
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,330
Copy that.

737
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,700
Quiet!

738
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,820
Get ready.

739
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,580
Three, two, one, go!

740
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,580
Dear audience,

741
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,440
welcome back.

742
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,300
Next, please enjoy

743
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,880
a seven-character quatrain by Zhang Ye.

744
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:06,940
Thank you.

745
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,860
Flowers fall from the sky as if from the moon.

746
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,740
Picking up the fresh flowers in front of the temple.

747
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,470
I still don't know why someone doesn't like the trees.

748
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,620
It must be because Chang'e scattered the flowers to the people.

749
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm done. Please give your comments.

750
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,380
Very good.

751
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,500
This young man is really hopeful.

752
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,420
The poem

753
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,260
is mainly about rhythm and artistic conception.

754
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,970
Your poem

755
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,110
is really awesome

756
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,010
in terms of the wording and sentence structuring.

757
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,140
However,

758
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,970
from the perspective of artistic conception,

759
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,090
it seems

760
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,510
it still lacks something.

761
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,260
So it's not as good as the one

762
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,980
you wrote for your nephew?

763
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,690
The one talks about

764
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,770
going home in a hurry to meet his wife in bed.

765
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,620
No.

766
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,490
Meet his wife in "bad".

767
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,780
Well, the purpose of

768
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,130
the Mid-Autumn Poetry Conference

769
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,220
is to promote traditional culture

770
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,430
and meet friends with poems.

771
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,180
Young man,

772
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,820
please don't corrupt

773
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,420
the purity of poetry, okay?

774
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,340
Purity?

775
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,460
Poems and songs

776
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,080
were created by the ancients

777
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,620
who got inspired and missed someone.

778
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,660
Although it's about rhyme and rhythm,

779
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,620
it should be created

780
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,740
in a natural and harmonious way.

781
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,940
It is definitely not something

782
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,710
sounds like a book.

783
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,020
I'll take this poem as an example.

784
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,850
So bright a gleam on the foot of my bed.

785
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,660
Could there have been a frost already?

786
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,260
Lifting myself to look, I found that it was moonlight.

787
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,500
Sinking back again, I thought suddenly of home.

788
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,180
According to your rules,

789
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,380
the moonlight is mentioned twice,

790
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,100
so it's already a huge flaw.

791
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,100
But in my opinion,

792
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,620
it's just a creative

793
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,050
piece of work by one of the ancients.

794
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,060
As the saying goes,

795
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,460
no one is the best in literature as in martial arts.

796
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,940
Everyone has their own tastes.

797
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,340
You use poems to hold a competition

798
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,340
and classify them into different levels.

799
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,290
Chairman Meng,

800
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,250
is it I or you

801
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,620
who is corrupting the purity of poems?

802
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,700
Well said.

803
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,970
Cut in with the commercials.

804
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,320
Hurry up.

805
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,780
Get the backup broadcast out.

806
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,350
Push it up.

807
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,740
Cut it.

808
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,060
How can we broadcast this?

809
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,620
Mr. Yao, the live show has been suspended.

810
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,700
Many people are recording with their phones.

811
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,340
It must have been trending on the internet.

812
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,810
Stupid commercials.

813
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,780
Why does it

814
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,580
cut in at this time?

815
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,140
Zhang Ye just showed his face,

816
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,810
and the live broadcast stopped.

817
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,900
What the hell?

818
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,900
It's still live streaming here.

819
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,300
He's arguing with the judges.

820
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,170
Let me take a look.

821
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,550
Look.

822
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,960
Do you know what poems and songs are?

823
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,100
Do you know rhyme and rhythm?

824
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,020
In terms of studying these,

825
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,620
I'm indeed not as famous as you.

826
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,450
Why is this different

827
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,420
on TV?

828
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,060
This is recorded by those people on scene.

829
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,980
What do you mean by "a fish rots from the head"?

830
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,050
It's a

831
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,060
personal attack.

832
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,100
Isn't it as obvious as

833
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,060
a bug on a bald head?

834
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,340
Are you here to recite poems

835
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,380
or to pick a fight with me?

836
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,780
Are you here to give comments

837
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,620
or to play favoritism and commit irregularities?

838
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,860
How arrogant you are!

839
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,660
You're slandering me in front of everyone.

840
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,740
How brazen you are!

841
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,170
You are disgracing everyone in public.

842
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,100
You...

843
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,290
Enough.

844
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,940
Let's put aside

845
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,980
personal animosities.

846
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,380
Today, we're meeting each other in literature.

847
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,580
You two are attacking each other here.

848
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,210
It's really a shame.

849
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,780
How about this?

850
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,340
I heard Zhang Ye just recited

851
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,100
"lifting myself to look, I found that it was moonlight."

852
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,860
"Sinking back again, I thought suddenly of home."

853
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,580
Think about it.

854
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,330
It really has some deep meaning.

855
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,930
He's quite talented.

856
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,380
Why doesn't Mr. Meng

857
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,780
compete with him?

858
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,740
I...

859
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,220
This is more innovative

860
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,340
than only reciting poem

861
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,260
one after another.

862
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,120
Young people are talented.

863
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,690
Masters are experienced.

864
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,180
It's a pin against an awn.

865
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,660
It's a rare opportunity.

866
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,420
We can also widen our horizons.

867
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,040
Yes.

868
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,100
Good idea.

869
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,020
This is good.

870
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,170
Young man,

871
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,500
are you sure

872
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
you want to compete with me?

873
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,500
I dare to bury you if you dare to die.

874
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,160
We often say

875
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,950
all people are equal in front of the king of hell.

876
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,860
Alright.

877
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,300
Today we're at the Mid-Autumn Poetry Conference.

878
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,060
Let's stop

879
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,660
you stabbing me and I shooting you

880
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,850
and ruining everyone's mood.

881
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,260
How about that?

882
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,020
Let's take the Mid-Autumn Festival as a topic.

883
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,340
Of course,

884
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,260
we don't have to be limited to it.

885
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,930
Moon is also fine, okay?

886
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,340
Sure.

887
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,530
Well,

888
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,980
does the mooncake count?

889
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,010
Sure. Please.

890
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,270
[Mid-autumn Poetry Conference]

891
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,970
The mirror embraces the moon.

892
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,010
And I am surrounded by branches.

893
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,290
A fragrance comes from the west.

894
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,730
Autumn is all over the room.

895
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,440
Good.

896
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:44,860
Good.

897
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,050
The orchid leaves of spring are flourishing, abundant;

898
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,660
laurels are splendid and autumn is shining bright.

899
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,860
So happy, happy is this life, they feel,

900
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,900
thus themselves becoming a season of delight.

901
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,449
Who knows this? The hermit, the forest dwelling one.

902
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,050
Smelling the wind, sitting and mutually pleased,

903
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,699
the grass and trees have a rooted heart.

904
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,980
Why then seek someone beautiful to pluck them out?

905
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,340
Are you talking about the Mid-Autumn Festival?

906
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,420
Laurels are splendid and autumn is shining bright.

907
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:34,380
If it's not about the Mid-Autumn, is it about Qingming?

908
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,219
But what I wrote

909
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:36,620
is a five-character quatrain.

910
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,250
And I just recited a five-character octave.

911
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,139
Good.

912
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,260
The grass and trees have a rooted heart.

913
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,739
Why then seek someone beautiful to pluck them out?

914
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,820
Wonderful!

915
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,739
Bravo!

916
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,060
Good.

917
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,860
Flowers bloom and wither.

918
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,380
Moon is either full or half.

919
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,140
Every year I hope spring could stay forever.

920
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,090
Every night I say good bye to this beauty.

921
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,940
We love since the blossom.

922
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,060
We leave in the autumn.

923
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,610
I am on my bed alone and hear the thunder.

924
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,380
It reminds me of the old days in the showering night.

925
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,900
Among the blossoms waits a jug of wine.

926
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,260
I pour myself a drink, no loved one near.

927
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,410
Raising my cup, I invite the bright moon

928
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,800
and turn to my shadow. We are now three.

929
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,910
But the moon doesn't understand drinking,

930
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,300
and my shadow follows my body like a slave.

931
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,620
For a time moon and shadow will be my companions,

932
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,220
a passing joy that should last through the spring.

933
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,600
I sing and the moon just wavers in the sky;

934
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,840
I dance and my shadow whips around like mad.

935
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,230
While lucid still, we have such fun together!

936
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,740
But stumbling drunk, each staggers off alone.

937
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,340
Bound forever, relentless we roam:

938
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,190
reunited at last on the distant river of stars.

939
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,100
Well...

940
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,620
Moon...

941
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,900
Moon...

942
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,180
The more anxious you are, the less likely you are to recall anything.

943
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,140
There was a man who created a poem within seven steps.

944
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,580
Today you've been walking

945
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,460
for so long,

946
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,450
yet you have only created two ragged verses.

947
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,580
Hurry up.

948
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,020
Otherwise,

949
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,500
I will say tons of it.

950
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,610
Moon...

951
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,760
The moon comes out and startles the birds on the hill.

952
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,180
They don't stop calling in the spring ravine.

953
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,220
Moon...

954
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,320
When the moon mounted to the tops of the willows,

955
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,390
two lovers kept their tryst after the yellow dusk.

956
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,630
Moon... Moon...

957
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,340
The moon descends, crows caw, frostiness fills the sky.

958
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,690
It looks good for a date in the flower garden when the moon is full and bright this evening.

959
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,160
When the moon gets clear, the wind eases, and the flowers are about to wither.

960
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,220
Moon casts light on city tower and flying crows.

961
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,110
Osmanthus...

962
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,860
Osmanthus flavors pastries with walnuts.

963
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,360
The eyebrows in a osmanthus leave shape haven't been done for a while.

964
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,550
Osmanthus flowers were blown to the ground with the fragrance in the moon night.

965
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,520
The moon appears to the east. The fragrance of osmanthus is full of the air in this autumn.

966
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,360
You...

967
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,220
You take a break.

968
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,320
There was a man who created a poem within seven steps.

969
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,040
Today, I'll let you know what is a poem by a step.

970
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,700
You...

971
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,020
War drums break people's journey drear.

972
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,940
A swan honks on autumn frontier.

973
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,820
Dew turns into frost since tonight.

974
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,570
The moon viewed at home is more bright.

975
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,780
Last year on the 15th of August,

976
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,060
I was at the apricot garden by a lake in Qujiang.

977
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
This year on the 15th of August,

978
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,220
I'm in front of a tea house by a river in Penpu.

979
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,340
I look to the northeast but I can't see my hometown.

980
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,620
I look to the southeast but the moon is hardly full.

981
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,740
When the wind blows, I find no one by my side.

982
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,980
Tonight's moonlight is like the one in the past.

983
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,730
Up the bright moon rises from the sea,

984
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,660
I Share the same moment though far from thee.

985
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,460
I really hate such an unbearable long night

986
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,370
to keep my lover always in my mind.

987
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,140
I blow the candle out and enjoy the moonlight inside,

988
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,900
then dress up and go out to feel the dew outside.

989
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,720
I have no way to present you the bright moon,

990
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,740
thus hurry back to bed to dream of you soon.

991
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,850
Birds stand in the trees. The yard is covered with snow.

992
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,960
The cold dew is quietly wetting the osmanthus flower.

993
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,020
Everyone is looking up at the moon tonight.

994
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,090
I don't know where this missing falls in this autumn.

995
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,410
On a mica screen, a candle casts dark shapes;

996
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,650
the Milky Way slowly descends, the Morning Star is low.

997
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,860
Chang'e must regret stealing the elixir of life;

998
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,060
blue sea and blue sky, night after night in her heart.

999
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,250
Sunset cloud gather far excess clear cold.

1000
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,540
Milky Way silent turn jade plate.

1001
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,860
This life this night not long good.

1002
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,650
Where can I find the bright moon next year?

1003
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,190
Chairman Meng, take a break.

1004
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,540
I'm in a good mood today.

1005
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,580
I'll make a freestyle poem for you.

1006
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,100
Why are you...

1007
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,500
The tides of spring river rushed to link the calm sea;

1008
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,700
the bright moon above the sea horizon appeared along with the tides.

1009
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,690
Shimmering wavers flowed with tides for ten thousands of miles.

1010
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,840
Music, music, hurry up.

1011
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,780
Dance! Go!

1012
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,980
Which part of the spring river did not have the brightness of moon?

1013
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,650
The river turned and wound around the fragrant blooming plain;

1014
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,570
the moon shone on flowery forest and made them look like simmering hails.

1015
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,410
I was not able to sense the flying movement of the flowering frost moonlight in the air;

1016
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,700
the white sand on the water bank was not able to be seen.

1017
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,620
The river and sky are blended into one color, so pure without one single dust;

1018
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,020
in the brilliant clear sky hung the solitary moon.

1019
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,180
When the people by the riverbank first saw the moon?

1020
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,890
When the moon of the river first shined on people?

1021
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,180
The generation of human life is endless;

1022
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,850
year after year, the moon of the river looks alike.

1023
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,940
I didn't know whom the river moon awaited,

1024
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,560
however, I only saw the Yangtze River sending the lowing water away.

1025
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,060
One white cloud leisurely drifted away;

1026
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,930
at green maple riverbank, I could not bear the sorrowfulness.

1027
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,060
Tonight, whose family is having a traveler sailing in the skiff?

1028
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,300
Where is the person pining away in a tower under the bright moon?

1029
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,180
Pitiful moon paced to and fro above the tower;

1030
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,780
it should shine on the dress mirror of the one who was left behind.

1031
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,210
The beautiful jade-like chamber's curtain could not roll away the moonlight;

1032
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,010
on the laundry anvil, the moonlight got wiped away, but it came right back.

1033
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,460
At this moment, we each both looked at the bright moon, however we were not able to hear each other.

1034
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,220
I was I could flow with the moonbeam to shine on you.

1035
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,780
Swan geese can fly for long distance, however, they cant' reach to the other side of the moonlight.

1036
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Ichthyosaurs are able to jump deeply into the water, yet, they are not able to swim to you, but to sir up some ripples.

1037
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,910
Last night I dreamed of flowers falling down on the quiet deep pool.

1038
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,260
It is so pitiful that now half spring has passed while I still haven't returned home.

1039
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,940
The river flows spring away; the season almost ends.

1040
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,220
The setting moon of the river pool again slants toward the west.

1041
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,620
The descending moon deeply hid in the ocean mist.

1042
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,820
Between brown stones and flowers, the distance of road is infinite.

1043
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,450
I don't know how many people returned home by riding the moon;

1044
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,140
all I saw is the setting moon shook the trees by the river bank with immense emotion.

1045
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,180
Good.

1046
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,340
Good.

1047
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,300
This poem, A Flowery Moonlight Night by the Spring River,

1048
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,660
is known as the best in Tang Dynasty.

1049
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,340
I believe I'll shock everyone with that.

1050
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,260
Who does Zhang Ye think he is?

1051
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,020
He messed up

1052
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,980
such an important competition.

1053
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,260
How are we supposed to hold it anymore?

1054
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,080
As a leader,

1055
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,060
you should take responsibility for that.

1056
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,020
Also,

1057
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,260
Tian Bin

1058
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,980
thinks his uncle

1059
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,370
is the chairman of the Poetry Association,

1060
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,940
so he dared to cheat.

1061
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,340
He can't stay

1062
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,190
in the media work.

1063
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,740
Yes.

1064
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,300
It's my fault.

1065
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,210
Zhang Ye

1066
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,340
sent a message.

1067
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,440
He has resigned.

1068
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,770
Don't worry.

1069
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,300
I'll do my best

1070
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,440
to make up for the loss of this live stream.

1071
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,420
I won't tolerate

1072
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,220
Tian Bin either.

1073
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,460
Don't worry.

1074
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:57,620
I...

1075
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,330
Hello.

1076
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,860
Mr. Zhao.

1077
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,100
Are you using Zhang Ye

1078
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,860
to punish Tian Bin?

1079
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,060
Did you deliberately get Zhang Ye

1080
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,940
nominated for the Poetry Event?

1081
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,490
Tian Bin and Meng Dongguo are relatives.

1082
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,260
There are only a few leaders

1083
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,420
in the company

1084
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,460
know about that.

1085
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,100
This guy

1086
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,490
relies on this relationship,

1087
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,600
and has been overweening in the company these years.

1088
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,460
You don't want to offend anyone,

1089
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,560
so you let Zhang Ye

1090
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,550
teach them a lesson in his own way.

1091
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,410
You just stand by

1092
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
and do nothing about it.

1093
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,060
It's not good for you to do that.

1094
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,020
Why?

1095
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,540
You ruined Zhang Ye's career

1096
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,100
in the media industry.

1097
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,780
He's too rash.

1098
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,100
No matter how talented he is,

1099
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,700
no one dares to use him in the future.

1100
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,220
He is smart and capable.

1101
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:56,980
He's a versatile talent.

1102
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,180
It's a waste of talent

1103
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,140
to keep him here.

1104
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,860
It's better to send him to a bigger world.

1105
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,100
With his talent,

1106
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,900
we can't hold him here

1107
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,860
for too long.

1108
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,980
What we should worry about is

1109
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,420
the internet media is developing rapidly,

1110
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,300
but we are still

1111
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,340
standing still and sticking with the old rules.

1112
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,820
Plus,

1113
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,180
there are too many complicated relationships.

1114
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,980
I had no choice.

1115
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,260
I feel sorry for losing a talent.

1116
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,140
But using him

1117
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,440
to get rid of Tian Bin,

1118
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,410
even if we both lose,

1119
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,370
I can only accept it.

1120
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,340
What about Zhang Ye?

1121
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,820
With his talent,

1122
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,540
no matter where he goes,

1123
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,080
he will have his opportunity.

1124
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,020
What happened after that?

1125
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,960
I didn't see you at the announcement.

1126
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,260
Forget about it.

1127
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,170
He messed up other people's place.

1128
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,760
He must have been kicked out.

1129
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,820
Who was kicked out?

1130
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,580
I walked

1131
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,220
out of there.

1132
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,860
You really showed yourself

1133
00:42:58,890 --> 00:42:59,780
today.

1134
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,340
But when you go back to work tomorrow,

1135
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,220
you still have to

1136
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:02,900
apologize

1137
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,100
and write a self-criticism essay.

1138
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,260
What self-criticism?

1139
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,900
I quit.

1140
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,270
-What?
-What?

1141
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,660
Hey.

1142
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,330
Even if they want to fire you,

1143
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,960
you have to look for jobs while maintaining the current one.

1144
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,290
You...

1145
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,790
You resigned too emotionally.

1146
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,860
Can you make a living by reciting poems?

1147
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,340
Who said I didn't find another job?

1148
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,340
I found

1149
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,740
a good job.

1150
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,510
[Yao Jianguo]

1151
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,420
Here's the thing.

1152
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,490
Who are you?

1153
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,230
I'm Yao Jianguo,

1154
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,890
the senior vice president of the Big Durian Company.

1155
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,100
Are you interested

1156
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,410
in joining our company?

1157
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,940
I need to think about it.

1158
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:52,340
Do you have

1159
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,280
to think about it?

1160
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,170
After reciting the poems,

1161
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,770
can you go back to Qomolangma?

1162
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,460
Young man, wait for my call.

1163
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,180
That's what happened.

1164
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,300
Say it all at once.

1165
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,610
My heart

1166
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,420
beat so fast.

1167
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,210
Come on, let's dig in.

1168
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,220
Who knows?

1169
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,290
I spent the whole night

1170
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,160
going

1171
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,220
up and down.

1172
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:21,920
Right?

1173
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,500
Eat more.

1174
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,440
Here.

1175
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,140
I'm good.

1176
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,340
Have some more.

1177
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,580
Eat more. Look at the fish.

1178
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:29,740
Just give it to me.

1179
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,320
Just give it to me.

1180
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:31,780
Well.

1181
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,540
You're suddenly so nice to me.

1182
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,980
I'm not used to it.

1183
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,130
You've had a long day.

1184
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:37,880
Rest early.

1185
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,040
Isn't this what I should do?

1186
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:39,910
Come on.

1187
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,930
I'm really tired today.

1188
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,490
I'll go back and rest.

1189
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,380
Good night.

1190
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,050
Good night.

1191
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,690
Aunt.

1192
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,370
I'm too full.

1193
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,680
I'm going out for a walk.

1194
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,430
Go ahead.

1195
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,150
Okay.

1196
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,210
