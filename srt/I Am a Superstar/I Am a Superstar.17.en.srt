[I Am A Super Star]

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,120
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,440
Now,

5
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,930
I'd like to

6
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,460
take this opportunity

7
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,550
to announce an important thing.

8
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,289
Zhang Ye has assigned

9
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,280
the copyright on all his works

10
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,759
to me.

11
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:50,800
Auntie.

12
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,170
That is to say, from now on...

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,850
Tian Bin

14
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,900
is so bad.

15
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,460
He stole the copyright

16
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,250
on Zhang Ye's works.

17
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,590
Turn off the TV.

18
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,860
It sounds annoying.

19
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,180
Auntie,

20
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,620
why are you so heartless?

21
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,860
Have you finished your homework?

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,770
If you keep talking nonsense,

23
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,820
I'll confiscate your phone.

24
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,620
Give me Confidence Potion.

25
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,870
Give me Confidence Potion.

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,090
I want Confidence Potion.

27
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,090
I want Confidence Potion.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,980
Give me Confidence Potion.

29
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,110
Don't worry. Relax.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,410
I'll give you an injection.

31
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,490
Relax.

32
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,540
Give me Confidence...

33
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,430
Give me Confidence Potion.

34
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,110
Give me Confidence Potion.

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,790
Give me Confidence Potion.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,590
Give me Confidence Potion.

37
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,510
Give me Confidence Potion.

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,300
I want Confidence Potion.

39
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,460
I want Confidence Potion.

40
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,780
Come out.

41
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,150
Come out!

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,030
You finished your Confidence Potion?

43
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,010
Can you find a way

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,090
to get me out of here?

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,570
I can do nothing about it.

46
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,550
You have to save yourself.

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,390
This is the rule of the game.

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,350
I'm unarmed now.

49
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,430
What can I do?

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,080
Give me some Confidence Potion.

51
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,520
Zhang Ye,

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,680
you don't have much Fame Value.

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,000
If you buy Confidence Potion,

54
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,230
there will be no Fame Value left.

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,960
If you don't buy it,

56
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,160
you'll have two more days.

57
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,530
Can you stop hectoring me?

58
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,820
We've known each other for so long.

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,910
Make an exception!

60
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,620
It's too late for you to regret what you've done.

61
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,840
When will you learn

62
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,370
to pay for your greed?

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,610
You set me up.

64
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,540
All aliens

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,900
are bad.

66
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,420
Zhang Ye.

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,980
Your Fame Value dropped again.

68
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,800
It seems that

69
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,230
the game

70
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,460
will soon be over.

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,660
Whatever.

72
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,450
Give me Confidence Potion.

73
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,840
I've had enough.

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,810
Zhang Ye

75
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,490
asked me to a hotel

76
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,670
and pawed me.

77
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,300
Which Zhang Ye?

78
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,950
The so-called

79
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,500
famous producer,

80
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,140
Zhang Ye.

81
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,570
Is it the Zhang Ye who is related to

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,650
box-office flops?

83
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,780
Yes, it is.

84
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,860
Old man.

85
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,940
Look.

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
Is this the Zhang Ye

87
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,780
that we know?

88
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,780
How many people in this world named Zhang Ye?

89
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,340
He's really excellent.

90
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,480
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,760
Casting couch.

92
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,450
How could a neat young man

93
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,730
do such a thing?

94
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,630
What do you think?

95
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,720
I had a dream of being an actress at an early age.

96
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,500
I didn't expect this to happen

97
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,050
after I entered the entertainment industry.

98
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,290
I hope

99
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,740
everyone can help me

100
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,110
and condemn

101
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,800
such unethical behavior.

102
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,460
At the same time,

103
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,920
I hope such unethical behavior

104
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,140
of the entertainment industry can be purged.

105
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,020
Zhang Hua,

106
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,710
don't play with him anymore.

107
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,710
Zhang Hua,

108
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,700
can you hear me?

109
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,980
Don't play with him anymore.

110
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,100
I'll turn up the TV for you.

111
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,270
Mom.

112
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,220
Zhang Hua.

113
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,180
You always leave your things lying around.

114
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,380
What is it?

115
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,460
Do you still want it?

116
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,870
I don't want it.

117
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,980
Throw it away.

118
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,060
Whatever.

119
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,720
Brother.

120
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,820
Don't worry.

121
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,190
I've investigated it.

122
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,090
Except the three of us,

123
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,160
no one else knows it.

124
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,410
Then why did he say

125
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,490
he had evidence?

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,570
No.

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Can we believe what a psycho

128
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,430
said?

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,530
Is he bluffing?

130
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,780
Go and arrange for someone

131
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,220
to keep an eye on him.

132
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,700
He is not allowed

133
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,770
to contact anyone.

134
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,340
Don't worry.

135
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,190
By the way, look at this.

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,050
Here.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,980
How is it?

138
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,870
Not bad.

139
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,260
Zhang Ye,

140
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,860
good luck to you.

141
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,940
So good-looking.

142
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,810
What are you looking at?

143
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,970
Haven't you seen any super stars?

144
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,380
Yes, I have.

145
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,940
But I've never seen a living star.

146
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,490
You know me?

147
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,910
Of course.

148
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:04,860
I really like

149
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,910
listening to your songs.

150
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,060
And Zhang Yusheng.

151
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,400
You know Zhang Yusheng?

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,750
Yes.

153
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,380
Every time you dream,

154
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,830
you call his name.

155
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,630
Is Zhang Yusheng your brother?

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,980
Enough.

157
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,770
Stop looking.

158
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,610
Go back.

159
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,820
I'm not like you.

160
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,910
I'm a normal person.

161
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,730
What?

162
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,810
You're a normal person?

163
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,260
Me too.

164
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,510
We are the same.

165
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,990
You were also set up?

166
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,100
What are you talking about?

167
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,150
Set up?

168
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,560
Let me tell you.

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,950
Everyone here

170
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,390
is normal.

171
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,510
Also,

172
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,970
the whole world

173
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,490
has been occupied

174
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,659
by aliens.

175
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,340
Only this place

176
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,710
is the safest.

177
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,780
It's time to take your medicine.

178
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,140
Take the medicine.

179
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,810
Zhang Ye, get up and take the medicine.

180
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,260
Am I really sick?

181
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,260
What do you think?

182
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,410
You've made a scene eight times.

183
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,570
I'm sorry to have incommoded you.

184
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,980
Take your medicine and rest well.

185
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,190
You will recover.

186
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,210
Get up and take the medicine.

187
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,180
You have one, I have one.

188
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,680
Wait for me.

189
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,190
No one wants me anymore.

190
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,700
I don't have much Fame Value.

191
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,270
There's no reason for me to stay here.

192
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,620
End it.

193
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,900
Are you sure?

194
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,870
Actually,

195
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,010
receiving treatment patiently in hospital

196
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,100
and getting along well with everyone

197
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,470
can also help you gain Fame Value.

198
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,270
Forget it.

199
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,330
How many

200
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,600
normal people are there?

201
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,010
Instead of doing as you said,

202
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,410
I would rather end it quickly.

203
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,430
Okay then.

204
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,200
Chenchen!

205
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,830
Mr. Yu, I

206
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,570
have something private

207
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,650
to tell you.

208
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,150
Can you let them...

209
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,750
I understand.

210
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,630
They're on our side, right?

211
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,700
I'll say it then.

212
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,640
Mr. Yu.

213
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,950
I think

214
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,070
I can't

215
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,160
waste my time here.

216
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,620
I have to tell you

217
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,420
the whole truth,

218
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,500
completely

219
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,630
and honestly.

220
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,850
I know

221
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,960
what I'm about to say

222
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,350
might be

223
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,350
incredible for you.

224
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,590
It might also

225
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,660
stun you.

226
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,820
But I swear

227
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,660
what I'm about to say is true.

228
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,890
I

229
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,790
don't belong to this world.

230
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,270
This is a game world.

231
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,220
Although this world

232
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,330
is similar to

233
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,410
my world,

234
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,750
they're not exactly the same.

235
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,350
Right.

236
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,500
Look at your watch.

237
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,900
Colex.

238
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,940
In my world,

239
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,020
it's called Rolex.

240
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,020
And this.

241
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,100
Human Acupuncture Points Chart.

242
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,580
In my world,

243
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,950
the heart is on the left side,

244
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,020
not the right side.

245
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,140
All of these

246
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,270
are caused

247
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,340
by two aliens.

248
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,460
Aliens.

249
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,220
In case you can't understand,

250
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,400
I drew a picture for you.

251
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,400
Have a look.

252
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,390
I don't know

253
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
why they

254
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,940
chose me.

255
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,230
Maybe it was a coincidence.

256
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,820
And I don't know

257
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,890
when it started.

258
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,710
The only thing I'm sure of is that

259
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,350
I have to follow their rules

260
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,140
to play the game

261
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,870
so that I can return to the original world.

262
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,260
Besides,

263
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,560
this matter doesn't only

264
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,090
concern me.

265
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,740
There is a girl whose name is Chenchen.

266
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,620
Her fate

267
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,700
is tied to mine.

268
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,430
I have to go out now

269
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,010
and earn Fame Value.

270
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,080
Only in this way can I return to...

271
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,920
Can you understand

272
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,300
what I said?

273
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,830
Yes, I can.

274
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,270
Of course I can understand.

275
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,220
I knew...

276
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,970
The reason why I told you this

277
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,030
is that I thought you would...

278
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,450
The director already understood.

279
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,860
Why are you holding me?

280
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,220
Mr. Yu.

281
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,270
I understand.

282
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,140
I should increase the dosage.

283
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,060
Did you get in touch?

284
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,650
I asked them.

285
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,220
They said Zhang Ye was critically ill.

286
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,220
Without Tian Bin's permission,

287
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,290
no one can visit him.

288
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,540
Tian Bin.

289
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,450
Call him.

290
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,090
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

291
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,120
Here.

292
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,470
Tian Bin, I want to see Zhang Ye.

293
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,450
I'm afraid you can't see him.

294
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,940
Zhang Ye is now seriously ill.

295
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,170
What's wrong with him?

296
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,130
Why do I need your permission

297
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,100
to see him?

298
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,180
Are you his relative?

299
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,770
Zhang Ye has fully entrusted me

300
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,640
to take charge of the affairs

301
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,580
which are related to him.

302
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,490
You might know

303
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,460
this, right?

304
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,540
I know.

305
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,230
I heard you stole

306
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,300
the copyright on his works.

307
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,420
It's not easy.

308
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,770
You can't say things like that.

309
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,910
I was entrusted at a critical moment.

310
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,130
I had no choice.

311
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,630
Stop talking nonsense.

312
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,940
I just want to know if I can

313
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,820
see Zhang Ye.

314
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,790
No, you can't.

315
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,230
Tian Bin, don't go too far.

316
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,000
Ms. Zhang, don't be angry.

317
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,350
After all, I am the copyright owner

318
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,820
of Romeo and Juliet.

319
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,050
We'll have many opportunities

320
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,200
to cooperate in the future.

321
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,060
I'm looking forward to working with you.

322
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,260
Qi,

323
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,650
what should we do next?

324
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,650
Ungrateful.

325
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,220
Have you found the evidence Zhang Ye mentioned?

326
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,170
Brother.

327
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,750
All the Zhang Ye's personal belongings

328
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,820
are here.

329
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,950
I don't know if the evidence is here.

330
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,580
But we don't know

331
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,740
what the evidence exactly is.

332
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,900
Where should we start?

333
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,690
Zhang Yuanqi

334
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,350
has suspected me.

335
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,860
We must find the evidence as soon as possible.

336
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,620
I have a small gift for you.

337
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,520
What is it?

338
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,760
A voice recorder.

339
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,030
I know what the evidence is.

340
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,290
You're washing your hands?

341
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,950
Why are you ignoring me?

342
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,270
Ignore me?

343
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,700
No, you...

344
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,180
Are you crazy?

345
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,500
This can increase my Fame Value?

346
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,329
Zhang Ye.

347
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,609
How do you feel today?

348
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,859
Is there any discomfort?

349
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,849
Nope.

350
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,520
Zhang Ye,

351
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,020
I heard you and Zhang Yuanqi were very close.

352
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,000
Can you get an photographed photo

353
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,050
of her for me?

354
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,180
I get an autographed photo for you?

355
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,270
I'm a psycho.

356
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,750
How can you believe my words?

357
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,660
After all, you are Zhang Ye.

358
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,740
Everyone knows you.

359
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,700
How about this?

360
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,790
Lend me your phone.

361
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,980
I'll call her

362
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,260
and let her

363
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,340
come over

364
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,460
with an autographed photo.

365
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,010
But we're not allowed to

366
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,540
let patients use phones.

367
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,470
Then I can't do anything about it.

368
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,000
Originally,

369
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,910
I intended to let her

370
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,520
write your name or take a photo with you.

371
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,900
But

372
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,740
if you use my phone when I

373
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,810
leave my phone here,

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,460
it will have nothing to do with me.

375
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,810
The password is 666666.

376
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,190
Hello?

377
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,540
Hello. This is Zhang Ye.

378
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,370
Did you listen to the audio

379
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,550
on the voice recorder I gave you?

380
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,380
There is evidence

381
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,450
that Tian Bin slandered me.

382
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,060
Listen to it. Help me.

383
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,900
Hello? Hello?

384
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,690
You idiot.

385
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,100
Coming.

386
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,420
Who's there?

387
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,210
Hello.

388
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,950
I'm Tian Bin.

389
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,020
I'm Zhang Hua's friend.

390
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,100
I'm here to visit him.

391
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,710
Who are you?

392
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,830
Did I let you in?

393
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,130
-Look at you. -Wait. Wait. Wait.

394
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,710
Look.

395
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,790
We know each other.

396
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,560
If you're here for the sake of Zhang Ye,

397
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,980
you can go back now.

398
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,180
It was

399
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,380
Zhang Ye's fault.

400
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,660
On behalf of him,

401
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,750
I apologize to you.

402
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,930
There's no need.

403
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,620
Do you have anything else to say?

404
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,090
Here's the thing.

405
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,860
I have a question.

406
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,480
Before Zhang Ye went mad,

407
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,210
did he give you any

408
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,510
small thing

409
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,470
like a voice recorder?

410
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,300
I don't know.

411
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,330
I don't know.

412
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,550
-Really? -He doesn't know.

413
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,550
Don't you understand Chinese?

414
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,090
Okay.

415
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,110
Get out.

416
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,940
He told you he didn't know.

417
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,020
I hope what you said is true.

418
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,700
Who is he?

419
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,720
Take this voice recorder back and listen to the audio.

420
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,200
What is it?

421
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,310
You must listen to it.

422
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,390
The things in it

423
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,020
are related to

424
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,810
the happiness of you and Shishi.

425
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,930
Mom,

426
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,760
did you see my voice recorder?

427
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,040
You're my brother's girlfriend.

428
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,200
I didn't think it was appropriate

429
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,610
for you to ask me to come.

430
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,100
What era are we in?

431
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,230
I think it's appropriate.

432
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,040
If you don't like him,

433
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,120
you should tell him.

434
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,050
If he was not stupid,

435
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,130
he would know it.

436
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,340
Let's not talk about him.

437
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,740
Let's talk about us.

438
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,820
You really like me?

439
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,290
Let me tell you.

440
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,090
I don't like to be responsible.

441
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,490
I chose you of my own accord.

442
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,580
I don't need you to be responsible.

443
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,990
I just like you.

444
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,620
Go and take a shower.

445
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,870
I've already washed myself.

446
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,150
Wash yourself again.

447
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,060
Okay.

448
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,390
Wait for me.

449
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,530
Zhang Hua.

450
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,470
You heard everything Shishi said, right?

451
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,990
I didn't want to hurt you,

452
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,290
but I have to tell you

453
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,730
the girl you like

454
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,490
is not a good girl.

455
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,350
Zhang Ye was indeed set up.

456
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,250
He's really innocent.

457
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,300
It serves him right.

458
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,280
If he hadn't entered that woman's room,

459
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,500
she couldn't have set him up.

460
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,720
My brother did it for me.

461
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,190
If my brother hadn't gone there,

462
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,980
I wouldn't know what kind of person

463
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,020
Wang Shishi is.

464
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,550
Now I know

465
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,670
his good intentions.

466
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,140
He beat around the bush,

467
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,900
trying to tell me

468
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,210
Wang Shishi is not good.

469
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,900
But I was stubborn.

470
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,090
I couldn't understand what he said.

471
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,050
I even scolded him

472
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,110
and kicked him out.

473
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,200
Now I feel

474
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,510
I'm a fool.

475
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,270
No.

476
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,790
Now is not the time to blame yourself.

477
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,460
Think about this...

478
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,340
this...

479
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,100
Wang Shishi.

480
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,350
Why did she slander Zhang Ye?

481
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,280
What was she thinking?

482
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,540
I know nothing

483
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,540
about Wang Shishi now.

484
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,870
I don't know what she was thinking.

485
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,630
Didn't she do this

486
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,990
for fame and fortune?

487
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,740
Wang Shishi said

488
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,820
she wanted to enter the entertainment industry.

489
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,230
Then it was a publicity stunt.

490
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,090
Leave it to me.

491
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,570
I have many ways

492
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,700
to deal with people who will do anything

493
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,770
to be famous.

494
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,770
I'll take this voice recorder.

495
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,210
Back up it.

496
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,080
Wait for the good news at home.

497
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,180
Stop bluffing.

498
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,260
I don't believe

499
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,330
you have the recording.

500
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,510
You're my brother's girlfriend.

501
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,850
I didn't think it was appropriate

502
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,140
for you to ask me to come.

503
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,440
If you don't tell the truth,

504
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,630
I'll give the recording to the media.

505
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,140
Send it now.

506
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,660
I'm worried that the clout is dropping.

507
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,130
If you send it,

508
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,060
you can help me be noticed again.

509
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,670
I'll tell them

510
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,470
you created

511
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,760
this fake recording on purpose because of

512
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,830
your love-hate relationship.

513
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,720
An incest drama about

514
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,070
a woman and Tweezers Brothers.

515
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,500
Isn't it eye-catching?

516
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,890
I didn't expect

517
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,870
you could do anything

518
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,400
to be famous.

519
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,930
You're already famous.

520
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,570
It's easy for you to say.

521
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,140
You don't know

522
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,860
how miserable an actor with no hope

523
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,790
of being famous

524
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,260
is.

525
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,770
I heard you was going to release an album.

526
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,200
So what?

527
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,060
I have some connections in this industry.

528
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,250
I understand that you want to be famous.

529
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,850
But what you did

530
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,930
was not wise.

531
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,220
I didn't stage a publicity stunt.

532
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,100
You can stage a publicity stunt,

533
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,870
but you can't hurt others.

534
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,200
Zhang Ye is my friend.

535
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,470
I must help him.

536
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,540
It's wrong to stage a publicity stunt,

537
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,320
let alone hurt others.

538
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,490
Auntie, what time is it?

539
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,320
I haven't eaten

540
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,400
and drunk.

541
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,240
I keep looking at the phone,

542
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,310
and now I see double.

543
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,460
Auntie,

544
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,420
why don't we take the initiative

545
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,420
and call them?

546
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,090
I should have gone with them.

547
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,420
She's just a little girl.

548
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,810
We can frighten her into telling the truth.

549
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,180
Why does it take so long?

550
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,110
I'll cook you a meal first.

551
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,110
Auntie, you have a message on WeChat.

552
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,460
Hello everyone, I'm Wang Shishi.

553
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,030
Here,

554
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,540
I'd like to sincerely apologize to Zhang Ye

555
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,610
and all those who are

556
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,750
concerned about this matter.

557
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,080
The whole thing about

558
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,290
the casting couch

559
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,910
is not true.

560
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,010
It was

561
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,320
engineered by his manager, Tian Bin.

562
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,670
Tian Bin said he could help me

563
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,070
enter the entertainment industry

564
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,460
as long as I did what he asked me to do.

565
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,510
-We really wronged Zhang Ye. -Help me release an album.

566
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,540
Hello,

567
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,450
kids.

568
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,620
Good.

569
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,690
Good.

570
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,330
All Stars Concert

571
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,400
will begin soon.

572
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,700
Good.

573
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,480
Why is this kid

574
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,290
squatting here instead of

575
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,420
sitting on the bench?

576
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,300
So it is sitting on the bench.

577
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,930
Then you can squat here.

578
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,300
Which superstar

579
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,980
do you want to see next?

580
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,660
Zhang Yuanqi.

581
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,960
There's no hurry.

582
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,820
You will see all of them.

583
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,070
Okay.

584
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,780
Braised pork belly?

585
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,620
Yes.

586
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,380
I want to give something to Zhang Ye.

587
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,200
Do you have

588
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,930
doctors' permission?

589
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,220
Why do I need permission

590
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,290
to visit patients?

591
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,590
The people who live here

592
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,670
are insane.

593
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,180
Some have a propensity for violence.

594
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,380
Some try to commit suicide every day.

595
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,370
If something happens here

596
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,140
because I let you in,

597
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,020
I can't take responsibility.

598
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,270
How about this?

599
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,140
You give this to Zhang Ye.

600
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,970
My mother made it by herself.

601
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,050
My brother likes this.

602
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,250
It's my mother's good intention.

603
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,080
All right.

604
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,750
Thank you.

605
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,620
Please be quick,

606
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,860
otherwise it'll get cold.

607
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,020
Thank you.

608
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,450
Good.

609
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,580
Good job!

610
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,420
One more.

611
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,430
Good job!

612
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,570
Which superstar

613
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,080
do you want to see next?

614
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,460
I... I... I... I want to hear

615
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,420
Tweezers Brothers singing.

616
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,950
You know Tweezers Brothers?

617
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,380
Tweezers Brothers has disbanded.

618
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,110
However,

619
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,120
I can still sing a signature song

620
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,780
of Tweezers Brothers

621
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,580
to you.

622
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,550
Good.

623
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,370
Good.

624
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,450
Good.

625
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,330
Zhang Ye.

626
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,220
Here.

627
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,060
This is for you.

628
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,430
Who sent this?

629
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,180
Your brother.

630
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,610
My brother?

631
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,370
It smells good.

632
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,570
It smells good.

633
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,890
It smells good.

634
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,970
What is this?

635
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,140
Let me take a bite.

636
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,040
Let me taste it.

637
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,000
Let me taste it.

638
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,100
No.

639
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,460
My mom made this for me.

640
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,010
It's delicious.

641
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,620
Make yourself at home.

642
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,030
Just take this place

643
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,300
as your home.

644
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,580
Try it.

645
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,810
This is it.

646
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,990
Isn't it delicious?

647
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,050
It's delicious.

648
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,090
I didn't expect

649
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,910
humans had much delicious food.

650
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,560
Human emotions

651
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,960
are so complicated.

652
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,010
They can even be linked

653
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,080
to food.

654
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,250
Interesting.

655
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,340
Zhang Ye can be discharged from the hospital.

656
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,940
I'm his wife.

657
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
I'm here to pick him up.

658
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,050
Are you sure you are his wife?

659
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,700
This can't be wrong.

660
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,860
You are his lawful wife?

661
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,540
Lawful.

662
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,050
OK. Come with me.

663
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,110
Let me introduce

664
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,180
someone to you.

665
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,030
After you.

666
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,880
What a coincidence!

667
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,260
Let me introduce this person.

668
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,110
She also said

669
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,620
she was Zhang Ye's wife.

670
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,300
You're here too.

671
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,800
Zhang Ye's guardian

672
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,750
knew

673
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,080
you would do this.

674
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,300
He said Zhang Ye

675
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,800
was in dispute with many women over love.

676
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,100
He also said those women

677
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,990
would pretend to be his wife to help him be discharged.

678
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,870
He told me not to be fooled.

679
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,540
Tian Bin is really a bastard.

680
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,100
I don't know if he's a bastard.

681
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,810
But the documents in his hands

682
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,910
are legitimate.

683
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,540
And he pays

684
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,610
the hospital bills.

685
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,510
We have to be responsible for him.

686
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,540
He told me that

687
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,470
Zhang Ye didn't have parents,

688
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,780
wife, and children.

689
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,500
He's the only

690
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,230
guardian.

691
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,860
You want to pretend to be his family

692
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:06,950
and get him out?

693
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,220
No way.

694
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,490
Making fake licenses is illegal.

695
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,380
Far from rescuing my brother,

696
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,660
you two were educated by the police all afternoon.

697
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,460
You two are really something.

698
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,790
You two are really something.

699
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,170
Even if you act alone,

700
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,860
you should tell each other in advance.

701
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,540
Now what?

702
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,990
We alerted the enemy.

703
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,830
I almost got him out.

704
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,540
But then you came

705
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,180
and ruined the plan.

706
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,400
If you hadn't come,

707
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,560
I could have got him out.

708
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,870
What were you thinking?

709
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,740
Why did you

710
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,010
pretend to be Zhang Ye's wife?

711
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,980
You did that too.

712
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,590
That's because

713
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,430
I'm his girlfriend.

714
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,290
It's reasonable for me to do it.

715
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,360
Why did you do that?

716
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,230
What do you mean?

717
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,330
He's still on your mind?

718
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,140
Don't think like that.

719
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,410
Stop arguing.

720
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,610
The purpose is to rescue my brother.

721
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,870
We should think about

722
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:58,620
whether there is any other way

723
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,690
to get him out.

724
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,660
What can we do?

725
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,030
Our intention was already exposed.

726
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,950
I'm afraid we can't even enter the ward.

727
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,230
The hospital is tightly guarded.

728
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,130
If we can't

729
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,250
get custody,

730
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,280
we can't do anything.

731
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,140
How do you know so well?

732
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,380
I've sent someone in.

733
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,550
You really care about him.

734
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,390
I care about him

735
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,510
because I cherish talents.

736
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,300
He's a genius.

737
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,380
I don't want to see him

738
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,470
be ruined like this.

739
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,770
Stop talking nonsense.

740
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,540
In my opinion,

741
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,630
we can use force.

742
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,350
Let's burst into the hospital and carry him out.

743
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,580
Right.

744
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,110
What about the other patients?

745
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,740
What if the patients get stimulated?

746
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,780
What if the staff call the police?

747
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,630
What do you think we should do?

748
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,210
We have to get him out

749
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,470
without alarming others.

750
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,990
What should we do?

751
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,410
Do we have to steal him from the hospital?

752
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,140
It's not impossible.

753
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,180
But the way you spoke was unpleasant.

754
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,890
Come on.

755
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,540
Say something.

756
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,840
Say something pleasant.

757
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,870
Fine. Let's steal him.

758
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,180
Let's steal him.

759
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,750
It's not easy to

760
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,730
earn Fame Value.

761
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,830
When can I

762
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,550
stop living like this?

763
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,550
From tomorrow on,

764
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,690
I'll be a happy man,

765
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,350
feeding horses, chopping wood,

766
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,050
and traveling around the world.

767
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,900
Traveling around the world?

768
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,889
Nan?

769
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,130
You mean

770
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,580
you've already sent someone

771
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,400
to psychiatric hospital?

772
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,719
Based on my understanding of Zhang Ye,

773
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,469
he won't betray himself

774
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,860
for money.

775
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,860
Unless

776
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,860
he was blinded by love

777
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,420
because he met

778
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,179
a venal woman.

779
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,139
I know you're criticizing me implicitly.

780
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,090
I don't love money.

781
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,020
I can see that.

782
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,530
Then it must be engineered

783
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,610
by Tian Bin.

784
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,050
You didn't cooperate with Zhang Ye,

785
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,160
because you were afraid Tian Bin

786
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,230
would take advantage of you.

787
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,340
When my brother was wronged,

788
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,540
why didn't you

789
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,620
protect him?

790
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,990
Tian Bin was so close to him.

791
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,060
I was afraid he would retaliate.

792
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,580
So you sent someone

793
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,660
to keep an eye on him in the hospital.

794
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,830
No.

795
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,020
I'm protecting him.

796
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,840
Okay, what's next?

797
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,960
What should we do next?

798
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,270
I have a very good idea.

799
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,810
We can organize

800
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,940
a consolation show.

801
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,490
[Welcome the Members of the Charity Show to Our Hospital]

802
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,230
We can use this consolation show

803
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,440
to secretly put my brother

804
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,770
in a cardboard box.

805
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,170
Then you can push him out.

806
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,420
What do you think?

807
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,340
No.

808
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,710
No, no, no.

809
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,790
Rao Aimin and I

810
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,550
just pretended to be Zhang Ye's wife.

811
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,900
Won't they be vigilant?

812
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,700
Right.

813
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,170
That place is tightly guarded.

814
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,300
Only papers can help us get in and out.

815
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,500
Get a living person

816
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,780
out of there secretly?

817
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,310
Do you think it's possible?

818
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,410
If wisdom doesn't work,

819
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,830
why don't we use force?

820
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,370
I have an idea.

821
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,840
In the hospital, we have a person who is one of us,

822
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,440
right?

823
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,540
When they are sleeping,

824
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,620
let one of them set fire.

825
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,540
Fire! Hurry up!

826
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,070
Hurry up! This way.

827
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,510
Hurry up!

828
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,430
Hurry up! Run! Come out!

829
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,510
Come out!

830
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,380
This way. Hurry up!

831
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,590
Fire!

832
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,070
This way. Hurry up!

833
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,140
This way.

834
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,660
Anyone else? Hurry up!

835
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,690
Leave here.

836
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,990
Hurry up!

837
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,860
Get in the car.

838
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,430
We can then rescue Zhang Ye in chaos,

839
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:28,980
right?

840
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,070
Sit down.

841
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,570
Did you learn it from movies?

842
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,650
Set fire?

843
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,090
What if others are hurt?

844
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,170
There are so many people inside.

845
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,350
It's too dangerous.

846
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,140
Arson is a serious crime.

847
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,650
Zhang Ye's mental issues

848
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,730
haven't been clarified.

849
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,270
If he was charged with arson,

850
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,710
his name couldn't

851
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,900
be cleared.

852
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,470
What should we do?

853
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,310
Or I can fight it out with Tian Bin.

854
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,750
Even if I held a knife against him,

855
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,610
I would let him release my brother

856
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,690
from the hospital.

857
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,270
Calm down.

858
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,040
And set fire.

859
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,860
And set fire.

860
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,420
Don't make trouble.

861
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,380
I asked my friends to investigate these.

862
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:04,840
Zhang Ye has funded many

863
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,040
hope primary schools over the years.

864
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,640
He even funded

865
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,820
some schools abroad.

866
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,270
I've contacted the media.

867
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,960
People all over the world

868
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,180
can know it through the Internet.

869
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,820
But how can we get Zhang Ye

870
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,960
out of there?

871
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,780
I know!

872
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,220
What do you know?

873
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,300
You startled me.

874
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,070
I know you have a way.

875
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,380
Of course.

876
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,350
All right.

877
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,840
Let's try our best.

878
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,870
Spread the news first.

879
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,510
Zhang Ye's reputation is important.

880
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,090
Aren't you rich?

881
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,460
Spend some money.

882
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,870
Go and get a knife.

883
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,670
And a lighter.

884
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,750
Produce a flame.

885
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,990
Get a big lighter.

886
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,180
Hello, what do you want today?

887
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:02,950
A lucky draw?

888
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,030
Cut the crap.

889
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,660
With my current Fame Value,

890
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,130
I should be able to draw a prize.

891
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,900
I don't want anything else.

892
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,670
I just want Lucky Sticker.

893
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,860
With your current Fame Value,

894
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,030
you can draw Confidence Potion twice today.

895
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,020
And I'll give you a tenfold profit today.

896
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,110
I don't want it.

897
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,440
I just want Lucky Sticker.

898
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,230
Come on.

899
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,050
Okay.

900
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,290
What?

901
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,480
Did you bring your phone?

902
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,410
Yes.

903
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:43,980
That's why

904
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,050
I'm here.

905
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,700
Can you get a car?

906
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,330
Of course.

907
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,040
It's all done.

908
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,550
Let's go.

909
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,930
You go ahead.

910
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,560
Someone's there. Wait.

911
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,690
It's locked.

912
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,750
What a lucky day!

913
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,550
You just ran out like this?

914
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:49,700
Yes.

915
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,830
No one stopped you?

916
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,690
No.

917
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,110
You just waltzed out of

918
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,490
a tightly guarded ward

919
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,560
in this uniform

920
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,130
and then waltzed out

921
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,990
the front door?

922
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,230
Maybe because we were lucky.

923
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,380
We were so lucky.

924
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,280
Thank you.

925
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,140
Thank you.

926
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:13,920
Don't move.

927
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Chenchen.

928
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,230
Do you miss me?

929
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,570
Do you want to ask me

930
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,980
or my aunt?

931
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,320
Why does he ask me?

932
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,180
I don't miss him.

933
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,650
Even if he died there,

934
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,740
I wouldn't care.

935
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,180
You don't miss me?

936
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,650
If you don't miss me,

937
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,700
I...

938
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,750
I'd better go back.

939
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,020
OK.

940
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,330
I'm kidding.

941
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,810
You believe everything.

942
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,380
I thought you wouldn't stop me.

943
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,620
I'm sorry for

944
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,030
worrying you

945
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,770
these days.

946
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,420
And Qi

947
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,310
sent Nan to protect me.

948
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,800
Thank you.

949
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:08,930
By the way,

950
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,030
lend me your phone.

951
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,110
I have something to do.

952
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:34,900
Hello?

953
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,450
Hello, Tian Bin.

954
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,790
This is Zhang Ye.

955
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,070
I'm out now.

956
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:42,780
You can escape now.

957
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,590
Hello?

958
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,890
Hello?

959
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,510
Is this the hospital?

960
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,330
I'd like to ask

961
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,650
how Zhang Ye is doing these days.

962
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,590
He ran away?

963
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,580
When did that happen?

964
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,570
Is this Zhao Si?

965
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,640
Zhang Ye ran away.

966
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:25,780
We are

967
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,100
in the same boat.

968
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,850
If this matter

969
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,150
can't be handled properly,

970
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,430
it'll be bad for both of us.
