4
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,100
How are you feeling recently?

5
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,060
These are side effects

6
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,890
of the medicine.

7
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,730
It should be fine.

8
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,600
Did you see

9
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,590
hallucinations again?

10
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,610
What kind of dream did you have?

11
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,620
Do you think

12
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,980
you are a normal person?

13
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,450
So

14
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,460
you acknowledge that

15
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,240
you are mentally abnormal.

16
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,020
Right?

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,190
during these few months?

20
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,260
I think you're doing very well.

21
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,780
You've basically met the criteria of discharge.

22

Besides,

23
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
I think

24
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,220
you have mild depression.

25
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,600
You still need to take medicine in the future

26
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,290
and cooperate with our treatment.

27
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,860
Do you need me to contact your family

28
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,610
to pick you up?

29
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,300
Okay.

30
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,660
Just stay patient,

31

I have something to do.

Take your parents to see it.

45

I'm not going.

46

I want to congratulate you in person.

Then may be next time.

48

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,659
I can count on myself and

live the life I want.

54
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,960
Why are you doing this to me?

58
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,330
pass this experiment.

59
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,100
I'm not sure.

60
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,100
The system will scan his weakness

61
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
and increase the difficulty automatically.

Zhang Ye, you idiot!

79
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,340
You don't take any money

80
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,310
for such a good stage play.

81
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,300
Tell me, did Zhang Yuanqi

82
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
played a trick on you?

83

Hello.

Please enjoy.

86
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,050
Excuse me.

87
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,890
-Excuse me. -I want to place an order.

88
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,540
Okay.

89
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,830
Hello, sir.

90
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,470
We have

91
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,919
a special price for lamb.

92
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,780
Would you like one?

93
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,070
Is there anything

94
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,039
without a special price in your restaurant?

95
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,740
I want to order one today.

96
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:39,700
Or

97
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,020
please take a look at our menu.

98
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,820
If you need anything

99
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
just call me.

100
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,539
Okay.

101
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,070
Excuse me.

102
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:06,820
Tian Bin.

103
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,940
I sent you the hotel address

104
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,580
for the celebration banquet.

105
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,930
I'll go first.

106
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,820
Don't be late.

107
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,610
Where did he go?

108
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,440
What's wrong?

109
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,420
Did something happen?

110
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:33,940
Sister.

111
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,100
I have a good news

112
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,110
and a bad news.

113
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,420
Which one do you want to hear first?

114
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,690
Is there something wrong with

115
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,500
Zhang Ye?

116
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,520
No.

117
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,900
The good news is

118
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,900
our performance became a hit.

119
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:45,890
Besides,

120
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,220
the tickets for pre-sale

121
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,600
are all sold out.

122
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,410
Many film and television investment companies

123
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,020
come to talk about copyright cooperation.

124
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,020
The price they offer is quite high.

125
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,340
What about the bad news?

126
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,540
We have predicted

127
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,430
the cost of the performance earlier.

128
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,350
And plan to reduce the ticket price

129
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,460
after earning the cost back according to your intention.

130
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,380
But the ticket company

131
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,020
called

132
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,300
saying it's not realistic at all.

133
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,140
Even if we sell it at a low price,

134
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,820
the scalpers will drive up

135
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,780
the price.

136
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,900
Now on the Internet,

137
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,100
it is already sold at 800 per ticket.

138
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,980
If we do this,

139
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,980
we'll

140
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,010
give our profit to those ticket scalpers.

141
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,500
What do you think?

142
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,260
I think we should return to the original price.

143
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,570
I'll talk to

144
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,540
the ticket company.

145
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,060
We still need to combat those ticket scalpers.

146
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,960
Without price as the threshold,

147
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,530
our performance

148
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,540
will be in big trouble.

149
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,230
Okay, I'll do as you say.

150
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,420
I'll explain

151
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,380
to Zhang Ye.

152
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,880
Okay, I'll get it done.

153
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,620
I think

154
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,080
our performance is so successful today.

155
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,540
We're having hot pot after work.

156
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:01,940
What do you think?

157
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,420
Okay.

158
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:02,820
My treat.

159
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,460
Your treat?

160
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:03,980
My treat.

161
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,700
Sure.

162
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,890
Pack up.

163
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,130
Here's to you.

164
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,140
First, to celebrate

165
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,820
the success to your great performance.

166
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,010
And moreover, I should apologize to you.

167
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,060
I apologize for everything

168
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,220
I've done to you.

169
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,060
I'll finish it first.

170
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,820
Tian Bin,

171
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,500
When were you

172
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,260
discharged from the hospital?

173
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,260
I've been out for a while.

174
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
Now you...

175
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,340
My wife ran away.

176
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,410
I lost my job.

177
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,900
I also owe a lot of debts.

178
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,430
Now, I just...

179
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,980
I don't even dare to go home.

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,960
Tian Bin, actually, I...

181
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,550
No, it's not your fault.

182
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,490
Actually, I've been reflecting on myself.

183
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,750
I am

184
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,910
lazy

185
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,750
and have no ambition.

186
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,500
I used to

187
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,820
count on the small achievement I made

188
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,060
in the company

189
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,100
and bully others.

190
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,740
That I become what I am now

191
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,100
is all my fault.

192
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,020
Tian Bin,

193
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,620
what you did,

194
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,880
those tricks,

195
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,890
they really caused me a lot of trouble.

196
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,540
But

197
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,180
we are not natural enemies.

198
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,300
Why are we always

199
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,380
competing with each other?

200
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,220
Right?

201
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,580
And, to be honest,

202
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,340
when I saw you today.

203
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,980
Seeing you like this.

204
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,660
I feel really bad.

205
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,180
- I want to... -No.

206
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,260
Actually,

207
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,960
when I first came to the company.

208
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,930
I asked many people,

209
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,000
sent a lot of gifts,

210
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,380
and spent a lot of money

211
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,690
to get the chance

212
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,060
to be a host.

213
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,340
But you don't know.

214
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,900
Many people in the company

215
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,770
are waiting for

216
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,660
this position.

217
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,980
Unlike you,

218
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,900
I have a family and a wife.

219
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,710
I have children and loans.

220
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,620
I'm not as talented as you.

221
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,220
That's why I made mistakes

222
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,470
and became someone else's stepping stone.

223
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,260
Let's not talk about this.

224
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,260
It's mainly my fault.

225
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,980
I am not that capable.

226
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,220
Forget it.

227
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,060
Let's forget about it.

228
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,260
You mean

229
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,500
you can forgive me?

230
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,860
As long as you can fix your problem.

231
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,980
Having one more friend,

232
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,020
is better to have one more enemy.

233
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,450
Cheers.

234
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,140
Enjoy. I'll pay.

235
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,010
Then I...

236
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,110
Thank you.

237
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,740
Help yourself.

238
00:13:59,070 --> 00:13:59,860
Order more if it's not enough.

239
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,260
Okay.

240
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,220
Major media

241
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,560
have made substantial reports

242
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,020
on the musical Romeo and Juliet,

243
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,780
and have given high praise,

244
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,480
saying that this is the highest level musical

245
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,950
in 50 years.

246
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,140
And the news

247
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,420
[we just received news that]

248
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,620
the musical starred by Zhang Yuanqi

249
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,700
and directed

250
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,900
and composed by Zhang Ye

251
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,260
has been highly praised.

252
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,140
So far, ten extra performances have been performed,

253
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,060
and it is hard to get a ticket.

254
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,700
Three million.

255
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,420
Qi.

256
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
I thought we have made an agreement.

257
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,270
I'll charge you one yuan symbolically.

258
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,530
What do you mean by transferring me

259
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,320
three million yuan?

260
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,460
I've registered

261
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,940
the copyright of Romeo and Juliet.

262
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
You are the original author.

263
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,910
You deserve it.

264
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,770
I have told you.

265
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,920
I won't sign it.

266
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,090
You forgot about

267
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,180
Tian Bin stealing your song?

268
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't want

269
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,580
this to happen again.

270
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,020
It's your choice to not go after money or fame.

271
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,220
But as long as you don't register,

272
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,380
one day,

273
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,540
you will face copyright dispute.

274
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,220
I don't want this musical

275
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,190
on the hot search

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,980
because of

277
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,780
endless contract lawsuit.

278
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,980
Then why can't we lower the ticket price?

279
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,980
Do you know

280
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,780
how many art-lover

281
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,780
can't watch the performance

282
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,740
because the tickets are too high?

283
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,850
Lower the votes

284
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,290
will disturb the market.

285
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,300
You will only benefit those ticket scalpers.

286
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,420
You know art, but you don't know the market.

287
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,560
It's true that I don't know the market.

288
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,780
But I was once poor.

289
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,180
I know how it feels when you have to

290
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,500
starve for a month just to watch a performance.

291
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,300
This money

292
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,829
is the bonus of your musical.

293
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,900
I don't want to give you more.

294
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,420
Our contract goes first.

295
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,829
This is your reward.

296
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,210
Bonus?

297
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,180
Yes.

298
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm doing this...

299
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,860
Am I doing this for money?

300
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,000
It's all for art.

301
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,290
Your tea is getting cold.

302
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,210
Let me get you something warm.

303
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,260
You...

304
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,420
My works,

305
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
you give price

306
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,300
to them.

307
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,300
People will think

308
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,260
I'm arrogant.

309
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,340
I didn't expect that.

310
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,220
I underestimated you.

311
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,570
I am

312
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,380
used to being aloof.

313
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,140
Let's just do it this time.

314
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,420
But be careful next time.

315
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,930
Zhang Ye.

316
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,820
Brother,

317
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,290
can you lend me some money?

318
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,180
What happened?

319
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,460
Lend me 100000 yuan.

320
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,860
I'll pay you back next month.

321
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,020
What's the rush?

322
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,410
Did something happen?

323
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,380
No.

324
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,980
Our parents are getting old.

325
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,260
It's inconvenient for them to walk.

326
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,740
I've always wanted to buy a car

327
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,690
to pick them up.

328
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,820
We have to buy them.

329
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,980
I have money here.

330
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,180
I'll transfer it to you later.

331
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:30,860
Okay.

332
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:35,980
Qi.

333
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,660
Zhang Ye.

334
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,700
I've thought about it.

335
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,950
The money

336
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,910
is a disgrace to your talent.

337
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,540
I've decided to donate it.

338
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,300
Don't, Qi.

339
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,580
I've thought about it as well.

340
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,570
I still have to accept the money.

341
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,850
Only in this way, can I show

342
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,820
my respect to the audience.

343
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,170
I'm leaving if there is nothing else.

344
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,060
See you later.

345
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,230
You took the subway again?

346
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,620
I suggest you use the money

347
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,380
to buy a car

348
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,420
and hire a driver.

349
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,380
You should spend your time on creating

350
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,660
instead of wasting your time on the road.

351
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,980
Why should I buy a car?

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,180
It's good to take the subway.

353
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,680
You don't have to find a place to park.

354
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,340
It saves money and is environmental friendly.

355
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,860
I have a car here.

356
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,780
I don't usually need it.

357
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,900
Take it.

358
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,300
Qi.

359
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,340
You give me money

360
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,260
and a car.

361
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,380
You...

362
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,940
What are you thinking?

363
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,020
The fare is deducted from your bonus.

364
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,720
I can get so many bonus.

365
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,970
Thank you, Qi.

366
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,620
Hello, sir.

367
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,780
What would you like?

368
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,700
I want to buy a lipstick.

369
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,660
Okay, sir.

370
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,540
What color

371
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,580
do you want?

372
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,740
Aren't all lipsticks red?

373
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,960
We have

374
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,310
bright red, Che Li Zi red,

375
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,540
Ying Tao red, Biao Tao red.

376
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,810
rose red, orange red.

377
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,310
Barbie red.

378
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,310
And also brick red.

379
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,860
What color

380
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,700
do you want?

381
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,070
Is there any difference?

382
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,900
There is a difference.

383
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,620
For example, this limited edition

384
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,360
Che Li Zi Red

385
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,450
and this Ying Tao Red

386
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,460
are not picky at all.

387
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,270
It suits

388
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,620
for most Asian.

389
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,700
If your girlfriend

390
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,190
likes light makeup,

391
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,420
you can try this

392
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,180
Rose red.

393
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,320
It is also very beautiful

394
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,060
and friendly

395
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,880
to yellow skin.

396
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,320
No, no.

397
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,020
Or,

398
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,710
I think this red one is good.

399
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,370
I'll take this one.

400
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,780
Excuse me, sir.

401
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,260
This is not just red.

402
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,000
This is...

403
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,960
bright red, Ying Tao red, Biao Tao red,

404
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,100
Le Tao red, rose red.

405
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,010
And European cherry red.

406
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,250
Orange red, vintage red,

407
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:03,740
barbie red.

408
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,620
And this orange red.

409
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,300
I don't care.

410
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,780
I just want this red one.

411
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,220
Sorry, sir.

412
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,820
This is not just a red one.

413
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,540
It's bright red, rose red,

414
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,600
peach red, cherry red,

415
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,630
European cherry red, orange red,

416
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,620
Barbie red, vintage red,

417
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,260
red bean red, wine red, plum red,

418
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,660
brick red.

419
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,650
Which color do you want?

420
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:18,700
Sir.

421
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,130
Sir!

422
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,240
Please don't leave.

423
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,980
What are you doing?

424
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm buying you a gift.

425
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,980
Zhang Ye, you're so nice.

426
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,860
Just nice?

427
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,250
What if

428
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,450
I buy you a house of gifts?

429
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,140
A house? Really?

430
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,390
Then for me, you are

431
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,530
the most handsome,

432
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,830
the best man!

433
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,370
I'm going to open one every day.

434
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,380
Hello, what would you like?

435
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,690
Excuse me.

436
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,110
What books do we have here?

437
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,220
From the first grade of elementary school

438
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,280
to the third year of high school,

439
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,200
we have tutoring books

440
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,820
of all kinds.

441
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,570
What do you need?

442
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,160
I want one for each kind.

443
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:51,810
Okay.

444
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,860
That red car.

445
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,370
Why did you press the horn? Are you crazy?

446
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,380
No parking here.

447
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,180
Drive it away.

448
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,590
I'm talking to you. Drive the car away.

449
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,860
Zhang Ye!

450
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,180
You stole the car?

451
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,470
Come down.

452
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,540
♫Look at the bright fireworks in the sky♫

453
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,950
♫They are in your eyes♫

454
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,860
♫That's the gentleness hidden in my hands♫

455
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,570
♫Slipping by quietly♫

456
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,300
♫You are the reason I fall in love♫

457
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,810
♫I want to hold your hand♫

458
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,500
♫The time stops when I'm looking at you♫

459
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,590
♫You're enough♫

460
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,570
♫I want to be with you♫

461
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,850
♫Collect happy memories♫

462
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,030
♫And fill up all your wishes♫

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,540
♫It's the way I love you♫

464
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,520
♫You just lean on my shoulder♫

465
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,050
♫The night is long♫

466
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,150
♫You're the warmest light♫

467
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,120
♫I can't forget♫

468
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,200
What do you think of this car?

469
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,480
What a stupid car! It doesn't even have a top.

470
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,110
My face was blown out of shape.

471
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,540
Where did you get the car?

472
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,460
I bought it.

473
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,580
You made a fortune?

474
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,620
How much did you pay for it?

475
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,140
Actually, this car

476
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,830
was given to me by Zhang Yuanqi.

477
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,530
You sold yourself to her?

478
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,060
She gave you so much...

479
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,050
Why did she give you the car?

480
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,170
What is she up to?

481
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,680
I sold myself to her?

482
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,900
This

483
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,690
is the bonus of my stage play.

484
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,980
You don't want cash?

485
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,380
Why did you ask for a car?

486
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,850
It's useless.

487
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,160
Besides, this is not a new car, right?

488
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,870
It must be second-hand.

489
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,800
Zhang Yuanqi tricked you.

490
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,140
Don't worry.

491
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,060
When the time comes, you, me, Chenchen,

492
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,900
and Chi'ou

493
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,510
will live in a big house,

494
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,780
facing the sea and watching the tide rise and fall.

495
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,700
Face the sea

496
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,520
and watch the tide rise and fall?

497
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:07,980
Look.

498
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,570
Is it beautiful?

499
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,630
Is it a free gift?

500
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:16,940
Sitting in the car

501
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,440
is different from sitting in the courtyard.

502
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,500
In the past,

503
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,070
I was like a frog in a well.

504
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,340
I could only see

505
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,660
the sky above the well.

506
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,990
But it's different now.

507
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,160
Boundless is the sea for fish to dive at will.

508
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,480
Unlimited is the sky for me to fly at ease.

509
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,690
You look

510
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,730
like a toad now.

511
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,020
If I were a toad,

512
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,180
you would be a swan.

513
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,660
And I would hold you in my mouth.

514
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,430
Now that you like cars so much,

515
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,610
you can stay in the car

516
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,730
and enjoy the sky tonight.

517
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,070
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

518
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,460
There are mosquitoes here!

519
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,170
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

520
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,110
You...

521
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,910
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

522
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,100
[Romeo and Juliet]

523
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,420
Zhang Ye.

524
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,500
What are you going to say

525
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,460
in the interview?

526
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,260
What do you mean?

527
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,110
Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?

528
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,540
Do you really think

529
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,650
you wrote it by yourself?

530
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,420
No, I don't.

531
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,870
I haven't decided yet.

532
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,930
You become bad now.

533
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,340
You used to feel guilty

534
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,270
when you plagiarized other people's works.

535
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,860
Now you have no qualms.

536
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,530
Who don't have qualms?

537
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,340
I want to sign their names.

538
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,200
But in this world,

539
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,600
they don't exist.

540
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,140
Who will believe me if I sign their names?

541
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,210
No one knows them, right?

542
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,990
Anyway, it's not right to do this.

543
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,470
Think about

544
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,600
your own experiences.

545
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,850
Think about how you felt

546
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,470
when others plagiarized your work

547
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,550
in the original world.

548
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,870
Think it over.

549
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,580
Where's Chenchen?

550
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,130
She's gone to the restroom.

551
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,490
Don't be nervous.

552
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,970
Aimin.

553
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,290
Actually...

554
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,020
Romeo and Juliet...

555
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,860
I know. It's very good.

556
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,480
Come on. You can do it.

557
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,460
Don't be nervous.

558
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,350
I need to go to the restroom.

559
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,660
What are you worried about?

560
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,740
I've been staring at you.

561
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,920
What are you worried about?

562
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,240
Nothing.

563
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,510
Is it because of other people's words?

564
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,930
Besides,

565
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,380
that's not plagiarism.

566
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,420
At best,

567
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,250
you are a mover in the world of art and literature.

568
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,140
I think

569
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,180
Chenchen is right.

570
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,440
You just

571
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,850
brought the excellent works

572
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,040
from the original world

573
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,850
to this world.

574
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,620
You benefited the people here.

575
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,740
You gave everyone

576
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,190
unprecedented artistic experience.

577
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,850
You're doing good deeds.

578
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,440
I don't understand

579
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,510
what you are anxious about.

580
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,370
But if you let me say

581
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,260
I wrote Romeo and Juliet,

582
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,820
I can't do it.

583
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,130
Why don't you drink this?

584
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,470
What is this?

585
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,670
Confidence Potion.

586
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,930
It can

587
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,870
make it easier for you

588
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,030
to make decisions at a critical moment.

589
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,940
It can also improve your memory

590
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,090
and make you more confident

591
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,500
in order to gain more Fame Value.

592
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,740
Again?

593
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,210
This game

594
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,570
is all about gaining Fame Value, drawing props,

595
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,260
and gaining more Fame Value

596
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
to draw more expensive props.

597
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,280
What's the point of living like this?

598
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,100
Of course it's meaningful.

599
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,140
Don't you want to

600
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,010
live a bright life?

601
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,470
Don't you want to

602
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,580
go back to the original world

603
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,910
and live with your parents?

604
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,510
If you don't want to,

605
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,790
think about Chenchen.

606
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,120
Do you want her to be trapped

607
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,870
in this place forever?

608
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,050
It's a tester. It's for free.

609
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,460
Have a try. Trust me.

610
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,540
Because our lead

611
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,650
Ms. Zhang Yuanqi

612
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,970
is preparing

613
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,940
for her tour of Europe,

614
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,610
it's a pity she is absent

615
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,800
from the press conference.

616
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,330
Today,

617
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,760
Mr. Zhang Ye,

618
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,840
the musical director of the play,

619
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,540
will speak on behalf of Ms. Zhang Yuanqi

620
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,610
and the members of the creative team.

621
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,390
Let's talk about

622
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,700
this high-profile new stage play.

623
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,750
[Romeo and Juliet Press Conference]

624
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,360
Mr. Zhang Ye.

625
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,260
Mr. Zhang Ye.

626
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,890
Let's talk about

627
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,970
this high-profile new stage play.

628
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,010
Dear

629
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,520
ladies and gentlemen,

630
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,150
I'm Zhang Ye, the author

631
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,700
of this play.

632
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,220
Actually, this play

633
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,320
is the tip of the iceberg

634
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,260
of my masterpieces.

635
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,030
All the artists in this world

636
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,620
are not as talented as me.

637
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,270
I can write

638
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,660
plays like this one

639
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,950
easily.

640
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,800
Thank you very much

641
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,290
for coming

642
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
to talk with me today

643
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,300
about the creation of this play.

644
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,860
I hope

645
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,030
you can pay more attention

646
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,700
to my works in the future.

647
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,940
It's okay if you don't pay attention.

648
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
That will be your loss.

649
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,740
Why did you

650
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,930
give him this prop?

651
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,330
This is not the prop

652
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,150
used for the Earth project.

653
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,870
We've been

654
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,230
to eight planets.

655
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,400
None of these planets have been bombed yet.

656
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,310
Don't forget.

657
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,820
We are under the pressure of KPI.

658
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,220
The potion I let him drink

659
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,740
can soon reveal the nature of

660
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,430
those ugly earthmen.

661
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,460
Auntie, let's go.

662
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,560
Let's go.

663
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,380
Rao Aimin. Chenchen.

664
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:29,840
Rao Aimin.

665
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,900
Where are you going?

666
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,070
What's more important

667
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,400
than my performance?

668
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,550
No, I...

669
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,090
I can't stand it anymore.

670
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,950
I think you're too arrogant now.

671
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,660
All the artists in this world

672
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,020
are not as good as you?

673
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,640
So many people were listening.

674
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,950
You're too arrogant.

675
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,220
Right.

676
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,110
I'm not arrogant.

677
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,660
This is who I am.

678
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,100
I don't blame you.

679
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,250
If you were cultured,

680
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,740
you would find

681
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,750
I'm really different from those people.

682
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,100
Fine.

683
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,220
Only you are cultured.

684
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,860
Keep boasting.

685
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,700
I...

686
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:18,830
Rao Aimin.

687
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,600
Rao Aimin!

688
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,030
No one understands me.

689
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,660
It seems that artists

690
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,150
are destined to be lonely.

691
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,450
Well said.

692
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,950
Real artists

693
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,940
are destined to be lonely forever.

694
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,620
Tian Bin, why are you here?

695
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm here to congratulate you.

696
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,560
Zhang Ye,

697
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:53,870
you are

698
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,100
at the forefront of the times.

699
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,660
Because no one can surpass you,

700
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,690
you're destined to go alone.

701
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,330
What do you do?

702
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,250
I just

703
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,950
tried to make a living.

704
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,700
I'm not afraid of being laughed at.

705
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,800
The bottles and cans

706
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,660
within 10 kilometers around

707
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,030
have been collected by me.

708
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,820
You don't have to collect them anymore.

709
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,630
Work for me.

710
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,870
I happen to need an assistant and a driver.

711
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,540
I don't deserve it.

712
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,100
Now you deserve it.

713
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,230
Come with me.

714
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,730
The headline of Jinghua Daily.

715
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,320
The musical wizard Zhang Ye's works

716
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,440
Wedding March

717
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,550
and Funeral March

718
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,060
rank first and second

719
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,030
in the music charts

720
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,430
on TV screens.

721
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,400
In the past,

722
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,150
people randomly selected music

723
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,110
for weddings and funerals.

724
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,680
The lyrics failed to convey the idea

725
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,950
and made stupid mistakes.

726
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,060
But when Zhang Ye's works were released,

727
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,140
they undoubtedly became a benchmark for

728
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,080
the music used in ceremonies.

729
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,220
Funeral March is solemn.

730
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,890
Wedding March is atmospheric.

731
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,550
They are sweeping the country.

732
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,370
Zhang Ye said that

733
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,160
he would release

734
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,310
more works.

735
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,930
Let's wait and see.

736
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,380
Please open the door.

737
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,440
Please come in.

738
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,350
Welcome.

739
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,620
Welcome.

740
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,770
This is the dining room.

741
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,090
The kitchen is here.

742
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,370
This is our big living room.

743
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,570
Look at the loft

744
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,100
and the light.

745
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,450
I asked you to find me an apartment.

746
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,840
This one is too big.

747
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,680
The apartment is not good.

748
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,860
The apartment is not a home.

749
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,580
A home

750
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,670
should look like a home.

751
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,620
You're a super star now.

752
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,480
You're more than enough

753
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,240
to live here.

754
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,090
It's a waste to live in such a big house.

755
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,570
With your talent, living here

756
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,910
is already

757
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,710
shabbily treated.

758
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,480
I used to live at Rao Aimin's home.

759
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,870
I think it's good.

760
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,940
You don't just

761
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,260
belong to her now.

762
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,630
You belong to the whole world.

763
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,130
Don't move.

764
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,420
Interesting.

765
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,580
Ye, I... I... I...

766
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,530
I think...

767
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,740
Rao Aimin

768
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,310
is a little scheming.

769
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,490
Look, you're a super star now.

770
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,550
Many people like you and admire you.

771
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,540
But she

772
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,390
wants you to only belong to her.

773
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,020
We can't let her succeed,

774
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,680
right?

775
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,920
You have a bright future.

776
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,490
If... if... if

777
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,310
you're under the control

778
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,690
of a housewife,

779
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,840
then

780
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,200
you'll be embarrassed,

781
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:37,900
right?

782
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,700
By the way,

783
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,980
the owner of this villa

784
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,660
is also your fan.

785
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,720
He said your coming to work here

786
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,630
added value

787
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,260
to the whole villa district.

788
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,700
He also said

789
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,630
we didn't ask them for endorsement fees,

790
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,510
so they already took advantage of us.

791
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,900
Your main office is here.

792
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,190
This place is private.

793
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,540
And

794
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,380
they have security guards outside 24 hours a day.

795
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,350
No one will disturb you.

796
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,700
Tian Bin.

797
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,150
Why is this house so empty?

798
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,780
Is there a lack of furniture?

799
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,260
I'll solve this problem right away.

800
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,340
Hello.

801
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,210
Get some furniture tomorrow.

802
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,900
Calculate how much it will cost.

803
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,310
We can issue an invoice for 80,000 yuan.

804
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,900
Then issue an invoice for 300,000 yuan.

805
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:02,930
By the way,

806
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,190
how's the preparation

807
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:04,980
for the contracts?

808
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,830
Don't worry.

809
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,320
I got them from the best lawyer.

810
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,280
Even if Zhang Ye

811
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,150
reads them word for word,

812
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,080
he won't find the problems.

813
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,200
As for the account,

814
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,950
take care of it as well.

815
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,500
I want it to be watertight.

816
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,710
There is no risk, I can assure you.

817
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,100
I'll count on you

818
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,100
for the rest of my life.

819
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,050
Both of us have to count on Zhang Ye.

820
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,320
That's it. That's it.

821
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,190
Be more sorrowful.

822
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,970
Be more sorrowful.

823
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,320
Be more sorrowful!

824
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,920
Rhythm. Watch the rhythm!

825
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,350
Rhythm.

826
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,380
Excellent.

827
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,080
It's definitely a masterpiece.

828
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,890
You're already

829
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,200
the best in the industry.

830
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,820
But there's

831
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,860
a shortcoming.

832
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,860
As a superstar,

833
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,120
you should also make donations to charity.

834
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,310
It's time to contribute to the society.

835
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:46,330
You

836
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,320
were too focused on writing,

837
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,550
so I selected

838
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,530
some projects for you.

839
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,300
They're aimed at hope primary schools.

840
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,140
The most crucial thing about charity

841
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,130
is to implement it.

842
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,700
So I decided to implement it

843
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,500
in the front line.

844
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,340
I won't waste the money.

845
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,500
I've examined

846
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,680
the budget.

847
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,390
Just sign it.

848
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,560
You want to meet Zhang Ye, right?

849
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,980
He's very busy these days.

850
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,860
Put 100,000 yuan

851
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,040
in my personal account?

852
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,020
I can arrange it.

853
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,570
But the time is uncertain.

854
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,300
500,000 yuan for writing a song with Zhang Ye?

855
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,020
It's a little difficult.

856
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,090
We can talk about it if you give me one million yuan.

857
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,900
Thank you, Zhang Ye.

858
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:34,700
Thank you, Zhang Ye.

859
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,540
Because of Zhang Ye.

860
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,180
Because of Zhang Ye.

861
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,070
We can study.

862
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,060
We can study.

863
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,690
Because of Zhang Ye.

864
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,380
Because of Zhang Ye.

865
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,190
We have enough food.

866
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,130
We have enough food.

867
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,780
Because of Zhang Ye.

868
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,410
Because of Zhang Ye.

869
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,630
We can reborn.

870
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,930
We can reborn.

871
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:45,890
Thank you, Zhang Ye.

872
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,890
Thank you, Zhang Ye.

873
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,420
What's this?

874
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,900
What's this?

875
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,620
Our charity work

876
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,480
has not only spread throughout the country,

877
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,180
but also

878
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,220
reached the poor counties of the world.

879
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,300
If you

880
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,580
keep

881
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
writing songs,

882
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,510
in less than six months,

883
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,020
these kids who are starving

884
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,450
will be able to eat steamed buns.

885
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,220
I have a great responsibility.

886
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,660
I have to keep writing.
