[I Am A Super Star]

3
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,130
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,780
If you

5
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,100
continue to compose

6
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,250
some more songs,

7
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,100
in less than half a year,

8
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,610
those starving children

9
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,979
will be able to eat steamed buns.

10
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,700
I have a great responsibility.

11
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,190
Keep writing.

12
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,520
I won't give up.

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,810
These contracts

14
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,700
are to enable

15
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,210
children in poor areas

16
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,010
to eat candy

17
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,020
and use toilet paper as soon as possible.

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,419
They don't even have toilet papers?

19
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,990
You can't just have them eat candy.

20
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,650
-The nutrition should be balanced.
-Exactly.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,420
Yes.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,400
It's a huge responsibility.

23
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,370
Later,

24
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,240
let's meet some clients.

25
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,700
They can

26
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,300
directly make profits for us.

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,220
Here.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,650
Okay, let me do it.

29
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,230
Leave it to me.

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,980
What are we shooting?

31
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,579
This is...

32
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,880
A high-tech product

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,730
of a listed company.

34
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,420
Those advertising fees

35
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,340
and sponsorship fees

36
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,810
are donated to the poor kids.

37
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,079
Come on.

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,040
Done.

39
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,079
Okay.

40
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,650
Hurry. This way.

41
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:53,940
Wait.

42
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,810
Who is this foreigner?

43
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,370
Thank you.

44
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,860
Who is he?

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,300
This is a director of a school

46
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,150
who built an international school.

47
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,330
He said if your photos

48
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,890
could be placed in their music academy,

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,810
which would make them glorious.

50
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,450
Then we should film it.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,530
This one.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,530
How many pictures do I need to take?

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,240
Diving frogs.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,710
It will be soon.

55
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,430
Catch it.

56
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,640
Come on.

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,610
What's this again?

58
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:27,890
Hurry.

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,780
Great.

60
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,340
Good.

61
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,300
Come on.

62
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,140
Let's take a break.

63
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,340
Here.

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,500
That's too much.

65
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,140
Have some water.

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,140
Here she comes.

67
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,650
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang.

68
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:41,940
This is...

69
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,530
Let's take a photo.

70
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:42,930
This way.

71
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,510
Look here.

72
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,340
Yes. Come on. Hurry.

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,570
Come on.

74
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,810
She's shooting.

75
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,170
This...

76
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,450
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

77
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,500
OK.

78
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,370
What does she endorse?

79
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,980
She endorses herself.

80
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,500
But all the money she gets

81
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,730
goes to

82
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,340
help children

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,580
in poor areas who have no sugar to eat.

84
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,500
By the way,

85
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,730
you have to

86
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,080
find some toothpaste endorsements for me.

87
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,500
Otherwise, the kids will get cavities

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,650
if they eat too much sugar.

89
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,580
Yes.

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,890
But the most important thing now

91
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,220
is to find you

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,700
a suitable brokerage team.

93
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,899
Aren't you perfect for that?

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,640
Well. I will

95
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,910
do my best.

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,420
Auntie,

97
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,050
how about

98
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,420
I give Zhang Ye a call?

99
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,180
No.

100
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,420
Whatever.

101
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,380
He hasn't come back for so long.

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,860
Did something happen to him?

103
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,490
I won't call him either.

104
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,860
I don't care.

105
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,690
Well. Anyway,

106
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,460
I'll go to sleep.

107
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,250
Put your hands here.

108
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,020
Come on.

109
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,500
The subscriber you dialed

110
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,250
has opened the call reminder service.

111
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,420
The subscriber you dialed

112
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,050
has opened the call reminder service.

113
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,930
It's me, Rao Aimin.

114
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,760
Is Zhang Ye with you?

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,370
Rao Aimin.

116
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,650
Zhang Ye isn't here.

117
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,740
I haven't been able to contact him

118
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,530
for days.

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,050
You...

120
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,190
Here's a small gift for you.

121
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,730
What is this?

122
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,740
A recorder.

123
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,530
You used to record songs

124
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,980
by sending them to me through your phone.

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,610
If these are sent elsewhere,

126
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,160
we'll lose a lot.

127
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,140
I don't like it.

128
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,180
Oh, no.

129
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,860
If you have any inspiration at any time,

130
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,610
record it.

131
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,080
I'll ask a professional

132
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,020
to sort it out for you.

133
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,700
I promise

134
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,050
I won't let one of your notes get out.

135
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,300
Tian,

136
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,100
do you think

137
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,750
I am

138
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,490
suitable for composing music?

139
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,770
Why am I a little

140
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,620
less confident lately?

141
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,220
No way.

142
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,460
You are

143
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,770
more than a genius.

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,740
In the future, if someone wants to praise anyone for being great,

145
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,250
he will have to say

146
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,980
that you are really awesome like Zhang Ye.

147
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,170
Like a perfect Zhang Ye.

148
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,860
Really?

149
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,840
Of course.

150
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,160
I think

151
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,900
with your talent,

152
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,370
it's a waste

153
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,980
to keep hiding behind the scenes.

154
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,240
It's time to consider moving to the front of the stage.

155
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:17,740
Let's go.

156
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,220
Let's go eat something.

157
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,700
No, wait.

158
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,140
What do you want to eat?

159
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,530
I'll ask someone to cook it for you.

160
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,140
Where do you want the food?

161
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,420
I'll have someone to buy it for you.

162
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,420
How can I bother you

163
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
to eat it yourself?

164
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,490
If you waste some time,

165
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,740
many kids in poor areas

166
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,650
will have to suffer from hunger.

167
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,370
You're right.

168
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,970
I'll go write it.

169
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,450
No, wait.

170
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,810
There's a recorder here.

171
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,580
Bin.

172
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,050
No, no, no.

173
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,420
Come on.

174
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,700
Bin.

175
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,620
Let's get high.

176
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,580
Come on.

177
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,370
Let's drink.

178
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,300
Zhao Si,

179
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,490
do you have any surprises

180
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,200
for me?

181
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,940
Nope.

182
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,580
Happiness is the most important.

183
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,620
I'm leaving.

184
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,370
No, wait.

185
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,810
Come on. Take care of Bin.

186
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,370
Come on.

187
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,920
Come on.

188
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,460
Let's get high.

189
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,830
Cheers.

190
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,260
Sorry,

191
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,620
the subscriber you dialed

192
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,690
is unavailable.

193
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,180
Please try again later.

194
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,940
Zhang Ye, where are you?

195
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,270
Call me when you're free.

196
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:53,620
It's adorable, isn't it?

197
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,520
By the way,

198
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,620
where's Zhang Yuanqi?

199
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,570
She attended an event,

200
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,500
so she didn't come.

201
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,220
We've been walking around.

202
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,280
Didn't you tell me

203
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,030
to move to the front of the stage?

204
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,510
I think

205
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,500
it's good to learn the violin.

206
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,060
It's not good.

207
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,140
Too petty.

208
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,650
What about the cello?

209
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,820
Will it look more calm?

210
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,820
It may look big,

211
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,210
but it's just a supporting role.

212
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,180
Well. Then I will learn to play the flute. Okay?

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,690
The voice is too low. It doesn't stand out.

214
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,570
If you want a loud one,

215
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,980
then I should learn the percussion,

216
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,770
it'll be fine.

217
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,300
But the position is too backward.

218
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,450
It doesn't match your identity.

219
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,420
No, no.

220
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,820
Nothing works.

221
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,080
So tell me what I should learn.

222
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,530
You...

223
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,270
A conductor?

224
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,010
The conductor

225
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,500
is the soul of a band.

226
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,650
He's the biggest one in the music hall.

227
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,490
And the temperament

228
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,750
is just right for you.

229
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,610
Okay.

230
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,450
It's just swinging a stick.

231
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,110
Please wait a moment.

232
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,890
I will get that for you.

233
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,500
Go.

234
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,450
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

235
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,010
Do you have any questions about

236
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,820
Mr. Zhang Ye's accomplishments

237
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,010
in music?

238
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,770
I don't doubt

239
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,860
his talent in writing.

240
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,330
But it's the first time

241
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,180
I've heard such a ridiculous idea

242
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,980
of having him as the conductor.

243
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,010
It's not a thought. It's a decision.

244
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,770
I just came to inform you.

245
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,980
You're being unreasonable.

246
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,150
No, no...

247
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,240
Calm down.

248
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,390
Other than conducting,

249
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,230
you can choose at will

250
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,140
any other position.

251
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,630
What?

252
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,420
I quit.

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,570
I want to talk to Zhang Ye.

254
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,740
Well, that will have to be another day.

255
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,820
He has been in seclusion recently

256
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,620
and is unwilling to see anyone.

257
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,260
Mainly because he is afraid

258
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,300
that his inspiration will be broken.

259
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,420
Why are you staring at me?

260
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,090
Get me a cup of coffee.

261
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,690
Can you tell Zhang Ye

262
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,890
he's not suitable to be the conductor?

263
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,770
Really?

264
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,570
We all know

265
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,450
Zhang Ye's creative talent.

266
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,760
I admit that.

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,060
But conducting is a new art,

268
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,770
he has no experience at all.

269
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm afraid something bad might happen.

270
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,060
I've talked to him

271
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,180
about this.

272
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,380
But Zhang Ye...

273
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,250
still decided to give it a try.

274
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,060
It's not appropriate.

275
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,740
There's nothing wrong with it.

276
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,820
This film is all Zhang Ye's.

277
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,210
No matter what he asks,

278
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
let's do it.

279
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,530
What do you think?

280
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,000
By the way,

281
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,380
he has composed

282
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,130
some new songs recently.

283
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,330
They are all on my phone.

284
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,740
Holding the hand...

285
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,740
You know my heart...

286
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,980
In the future...

287
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,040
Zhang Ye said,

288
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,260
if you want,

289
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,140
you can have them all.

290
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,300
No way.

291
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,620
Zhang Yuanqi

292
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,300
is really short-sighted.

293
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,260
Sir,

294
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,860
let's get out of this business.

295
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,380
You are a genius.

296
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,500
I think you should consider transformation.

297
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,330
Instead of writing songs

298
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,380
to create favorable conditions for others,

299
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,650
it's better to get the benefits yourself.

300
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,880
You should move to the stage.

301
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,690
I think

302
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,740
you have the potential to be an actor.

303
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,260
Your expressiveness and aura

304
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,030
are strong.

305
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,750
Besides,

306
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,990
you have the sense of deja vu of a superstar.

307
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,730
Be an actor, can I?

308
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,560
Sure.

309
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,300
I know people well.

310
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,530
Let's make a drama ourselves.

311
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,820
You can totally

312
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,650
be self-written, self-directed, and self-performed.

313
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
As long as

314
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,880
you keep

315
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,260
the crazy creative passion going,

316
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,160
you will make it.

317
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
I can try it.

318
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,740
The script should be good,

319
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,420
I'll take care of the rest.

320
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,180
The wine is beautiful.

321
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,530
Exactly.

322
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,210
Have you read the script?

323
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,260
Yes.

324
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,050
How is it?

325
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,770
The first half is not bad.

326
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,810
What do you mean?

327
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,540
I mean

328
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,690
it's only half a masterpiece.

329
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,540
Half a masterpiece?

330
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,960
The first half.

331
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,360
The language is smooth and the character images are full.

332
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,500
The plot is interesting.

333
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,430
It's a rare masterpiece.

334
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,730
But the second half

335
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,500
has completely changed.

336
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,840
The logic is confused, and the words are weak.

337
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,950
Especially the ending.

338
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,020
Everyone gets a happy ending

339
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,740
for no reason.

340
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,590
The whole story doesn't go around the theme at all.

341
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,540
This is because Mr. Zhang Ye

342
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,110
doesn't want to repeat himself.

343
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,110
But you can't ignore

344
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,540
the logic of character and plot

345
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,380
to make it.

346
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,060
You mean

347
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,820
you're not interested in the leading actress?

348
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:08,980
Who is the leading actor?

349
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:09,990
It has not been decided yet.

350
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,300
But Mr. Zhang Ye is willing

351
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,110
to act personally.

352
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,590
His talent fits in behind the scenes.

353
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,900
Why did he

354

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,420
How dare she

365
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,470

366
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,420
She said the happy ending

367
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,300
was so vulgar.

368
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,950

She knows nothing at all.

371
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,630

You can leave.

704
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,420
Okay, I'll do it right away.

705
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,880
Welcome.

706
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,340
How many Fame Values do I have?

707
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,610
When you see the numbers,

708
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,290
you will be surprised.

709
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,660
Is the game over?

710
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,380
How come there are so many?

711
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,050
My reputation is stinking now.

712
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,420
Our Fame Value

713
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,880
has no property.

714
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,390
Whether it's a good reputation

715
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,430
or a bad reputation,

716
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,210
it will accumulate your Fame Value.

717
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,990
As long as someone misses you,

718
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,870
even if they scold you,

719
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,170
your Fame Value

720
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,250
will rise.

721
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,130
In reality, I have become a poor man

722
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,810
but I am rich with Fame Values.

723
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,420
So?

724
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,180
Do you want

725
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,870
a crazy shopping party?

726
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,780
Give me 100 bottles of Confidence Potion.

727
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,620
I have

728
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,050
a few words

729
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,429
that I don't know if I should tell you.

730
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,500
Speak it out.

731
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,989
You're talented,

732
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,130
but your career is rough.

733
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,570
Why?

734
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,330
So why?

735
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,580
Because

736
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,820
you value your feathers too much.

737
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,340
You define yourself

738
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,840
as an artist.

739
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,270
You want to be famous

740
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,600
and also want to make art.

741
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,530
This whole thing started wrong.

742
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,219
Is it wrong to make art

743
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,639
or to be famous?

744
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,370
These two things are wrong

745
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,060
if you do them together.

746
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,470
Let's talk about what happened recently.

747
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,720
You've become famous.

748
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,520
Many people dream of it.

749
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,850
But you are struggling with that,

750
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,300
you think

751
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,530
it's not a good reputation, right?

752
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,790
You feel ashamed.

753
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,030
Can I still

754
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,050
feel proud?

755
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,510
We have to

756
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,780
change our minds

757
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,950
to think about it.

758
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,170
Since the audiences think

759
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,220
you are a clown,

760
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,580
it's useless to explain.

761
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,550
Why don't we just keep it that way

762
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,650
and show them?

763
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,860
If you can't make a good reputation,

764
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,510
a stinky reputation

765
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,270
is also quite exciting.

766
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,070
It's a happy life.

767
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,340
I know a big boss

768
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,270
who is very rich.

769
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,270
He admires you

770
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,370
and wants to visit you.

771
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,590
Okay.

772
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,170
As long as the price is right,

773
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,170
I can sell anything.

774
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
That's right.

775
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,140
What a rare guest.

776
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,610
Let's talk about Zhang Ye.

777
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,940
About Zhang Ye?

778
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,900
You can't talk to me about that,

779
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,750
he moved out.

780
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,590
Take a look at this.

781
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,710
So?

782
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,750
Let me help you appreciate it?

783
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:36,890
Look carefully.

784
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,110
He started digging coal when he was three.

785
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,350
The poem was written by a coal boss?

786
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,450
Not him.

787
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,230
So who wrote it?

788
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,470
It's Zhang Ye.

789
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,890
Zhang Ye wrote it? No way.

790
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,360
Tian Bin came to me before.

791
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,380
He wanted to sell the poem book to me.

792
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,100
But he offered a high price,

793
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,750
so I rejected him.

794
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,620
And then he sold it

795
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,030
to the coal owner.

796
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,140
It's really written by Zhang Ye.

797
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,340
This poem

798
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,820
was given to me by him.

799
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,380
Face the sea and watch the tides.

800
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,980
You just said

801
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,180
he sold the poem.

802
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,180
Should we just

803
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,990
watch Zhang Ye

804
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,860
abuse his talent?

805
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,930
Take me to him.

806
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,470
Okay.

807
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,320
He is here.

808
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,900
He is here.

809
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,680
Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang.

810
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,820
Mr. Zhang.

811
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,950
Hello.

812
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,980
You're a celebrity

813
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,710
in the cultural world.

814
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,470
I've heard a lot about you.

815
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,650
Come on. Let's take a photo.

816
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,280
Alright.

817
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:53,930
Okay.

818
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:54,990
Come on.

819
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,380
Come on.

820
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,130
Get ready.

821
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,790
Three, two, one. Okay.

822
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,860
One more shot.

823
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,260
One more.

824
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:01,860
One more.

825
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:02,510
Well,

826
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,170
it looks friendly.

827
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,400
One more picture.

828
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,470
Mr. Wang, you're quite photogenic.

829
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,620
Okay.

830
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,090
Don't forget to send them to me.

831
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,060
I'll send them to you later.

832
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,790
Mr. Zhang, have one.

833
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:15,790
No, thanks.

834
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,950
I'll put it here.

835
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,060
I won't smoke then.

836
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:28,910
Mr. Zhang,

837
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,900
you have no idea.

838
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,700
I used to be a poor kid.

839
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,140
I was poor when I was young,

840
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,990
so I was always looked down upon.

841
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,450
At that time, I swore

842
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,470
I must get rich.

843
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,230
I can't let them despise me anymore.

844
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:46,820
Yup.

845
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:47,260
So,

846
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,380
I worked hard to dig coal

847
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,820
and make money.

848
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,600
Now,

849
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,610
I have everything.

850
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,160
I'm rich.

851
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,270
Indeed.

852
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,180
But I find that

853
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,310
although I'm rich,

854
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,470
some people still despise me.

855
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,030
He dislikes me for lacking culture.

856
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,030
Isn't that irritating?

857
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,050
Yeah.

858
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,270
Mr Zhang,

859
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,510
you are a great writer.

860
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,300
You are the culture itself.

861
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,660
So,

862
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,460
I'm here

863
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,030
to ask you to help me

864
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,990
improve my culture,

865
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,300
reinvent me

866
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,710
and turn me into a cultured person.

867
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,130
Well, this is

868
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,410
another price.

869
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,190
Money is not a problem.

870
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,730
It's easy to

871
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,540
get into the culture world.

872
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,640
You need to have works.

873
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,600
Works? What works?

874
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,610
Everything can be a work,

875
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,180
such as a poem, a novel, or a script.

876
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,620
I have not graduated

877
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,370
from the third grade yet.

878
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,650
How would I have my work?

879
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,860
You're making things difficult for me.

880
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,330
Isn't it?

881
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,510
Well.

882
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,090
Mr. Zhang

883
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,750
happens to have a poem book

884
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,870
that hasn't been published yet.

885
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,900
How about let's bear the pain and sell it to him?

886
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,950
I'll listen to you.

887
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:07,990
Really?

888
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,820
That's great.

889
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,310
But

890
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,650
the master, he

891
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,920
still cares about the money...

892
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,660
Money is not a problem.

893
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,260
I have money.

894
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,780
Okay, it's a deal.

895
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,610
Yes.

896
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,300
It's settled.

897
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:26,580
It's fate.

898
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
It's destiny.

899
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,540
Is it here?

900
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,550
Who are you? You can't go in here.

901
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,650
I'm looking for someone.

902
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,060
Without Mr. Tian's order,

903
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,260
no one is allowed to enter.

904
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,470
If you don't move away,

905
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,320
don't blame me for being rude.

906
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,240
Will you?

907
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,780
If you don't leave, I'll be rude.

908
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,500
You can't go in either.

909
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,860
Wow, Rao Aimin is awesome.

910
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,070
Zhang Ye.

911
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,820
Why are you here?

912
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:14,790
Look

913
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,620
what you've become!

914
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,230
Zhang Ye,

915
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,070
why did you

916
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,260
sell the poem you wrote for me?

917
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,910
Why not?

918
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,010
They offered a good price.

919
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,970
But it's your hard work.

920
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:30,820
So,

921
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,850
we need to bid the price high.

922
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,420
Don't make a fuss.

923
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,710
In this world,

924
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,380
there is nothing

925
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,340
that can't be measured by money.

926
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,730
Do you want a drink?

927
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,140
Wake up.

928
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,500
I know you're not that kind of person.

929
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,990
In your condition now,

930
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,600
no one will look up to you.
