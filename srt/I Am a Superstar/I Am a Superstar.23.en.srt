5
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,020
Can you stop playing the game?

6
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,060
Let's get down to business.

7
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,140
Wait a minute.

8
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,250
I'm increasing the power

9
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,140
of my Best Snail.

10
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,140
These two days

11
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,250
are the most critical moments.

12
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,140
You've been here

13
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,100
all day.

14
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,570
What are you thinking?

15
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,530
Isn't it comfortable

16
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,660
to stay here?

17
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,530
What? Don't you welcome me?

18
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,290
Cut the crap.

19
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,170
Be serious. What's your plan?

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,170
Just let me stay here for a while.

21
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,650
I'm in debt.

22
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,000
If I go back, I'll get Rao Aimin into trouble.

23
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,810
Don't worry about her.

24
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,250
She's good at fighting.

25
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,890
Nothing will happen to her.

26
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,650
But you...

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,110
Do you really want the legal battle to start?

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,610
Think carefully.

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,810
This is not a trivial matter.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,890
I've thought it through.

31
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,100
Just let it start.

32
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,680
The more fierce, the better.

33
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,470
I really don't know what you're thinking.

34
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,010
You'll go bankrupt.

35
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,370
What's my greatest asset?

36
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,450
What?

37
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,060
It's my

38
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,700
brain.

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,640
My intelligence.

40
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,520
Even if they sue me,

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,650
they won't

42
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,170
claim my brain.

43
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,890
As long as they don't own it,

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,650
my wisdom

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,920
will help me

46
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,630
make a comeback easily.

47
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,300
Then why do you have to

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,940
let them sue you?

49
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,730
The company which will sue you

50
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,110
just want your works.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,140
Write something for them

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,980
to pay off the debt.

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,170
If it doesn't work,

54
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,860
I can vouch for you.

55
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,580
If they don't sue me,

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,730
it will be good for Tian Bin.

57
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,079
You forced them to sue you

58
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,140
because you want to use them to punish Tian Bin?

59
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,810
We are

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,250
in the same boat.

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,810
None of us can escape.

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,730
Tian Bin has embezzled so much money.

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,579
Once the legal battle starts,

64
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,090
he will be involved.

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,440
I think he is now

66
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,220
looking for Zhao Si all over the world.

67
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,530
Zhao Si?

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,500
Bin, why are you here?

69
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,420
This car is really nice.

70
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,700
A new car?

71
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,310
Yes, it is.

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,250
It's not as good as yours.

73
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,250
You've worked with me for years.

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,050
You really made a fortune.

75
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,460
You have meat to eat.

76
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,020
I only have bones to suck.

77
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,620
Look at your car.

78
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,770
You even sucked

79
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,620
my bone marrow.

80
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,420
You must be kidding.

81
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,490
Four.

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,909
We both know that

83
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,380
without me,

84
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,710
you wouldn't be where you are today.

85
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,900
My bank account has been frozen.

86
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,810
I also sold my house.

87
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,400
If I hadn't prepared some cash,

88
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,370
I would have been starved to death.

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,780
Brother, we both know that

90
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,810
I worked for you

91
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,020
faithfully and conscientiously.

92
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,650
I did all the work

93
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,290
that were dirty

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,200
or shady.

95
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,620
I worked hard even without credit.

96
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,140
As for

97
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,180
how you slandered Zhang Ye,

98
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,460
it has nothing to do with me.

99
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,250
No.

100
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,090
Don't worry.

101
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,000
If the police arrested me,

102
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,860
I wouldn't say anything bad

103
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,740
about you.

104
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,370
How can you threaten me?

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,490
You threaten me with the police?

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,650
How dare I?

107
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,980
I said it just in case.

108
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,580
You did wicked...

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,980
things.

110
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,620
Sentencing you to eight or ten years in prison

111
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,330
is not much.

112
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,010
Stop talking about these.

113
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,490
Give me two million yuan first.

114
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,960
It's better to be cash.

115
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
Two million yuan?

116
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,180
Where can I get so much money?

117
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,530
Your car costed more than one million yuan.

118
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,900
Almost.

119
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes, it's a new car.

120
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,790
I also bought a house.

121
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,380
But they're loans.

122
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,580
Besides,

123
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,460
my wife just gave birth.

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,050
Her younger brother is getting married.

125
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,330
My mother-in-law

126
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:18,930
is in poor health.

127
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,640
She lies in a hospital bed every day.

128
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,380
When I wake up every morning,

129
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,640
I have to spend money.

130
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,290
I thought the money I earned

131
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,010
from you

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,550
would be enough if I saved it.

133
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,810
But I didn't expect

134
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,600
the stock market crashed two days ago.

135
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,790
I put all my spare money in it.

136
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,659
I think

137
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,090
maybe I should sell

138
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,700
this new car

139
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,090
-to fill the hole. -Okay. Stop.

140
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,210
How much money can you give me?

141
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,350
Brother, take them.

142
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,980
Don't think it's too much.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,890
It's a token of my regard.

144
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,140
Do you regard me as a beggar?

145
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,920
Your situation is worse than beggars' now.

146
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,490
Beggars don't have to

147
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,420
hide themselves.

148
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,020
It's my new car.

149
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,360
He might bring me bad luck.

150
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,700
Tian Bin should be brought to justice.

151
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,300
That's what people want to see.

152
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,530
Do you know what 'killing people's soul' is?

153
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,360
I called Tian Bin immediately

154
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,260
after I got out of the psychiatric hospital.

155
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,970
He must think

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,650
I would fight back against him.

157
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,070
So he was extremely frightened.

158
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,540
When he ran away,

159
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,190
he must not have made thorough preparation.

160
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,740
The contracts

161
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,800
I signed with Tian Bin

162
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,250
include force majeure clauses.

163
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,290
Disease is one of them.

164
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,820
When I was forced to be treated

165
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
in hospital,

166
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,620
Tian Bin

167
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,690
didn't have to take any consequences.

168
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,490
But after I was discharged,

169
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,860
you asked me out for a shoot.

170
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,970
I also found the terra-cotta warriors.

171
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,490
It rekindled

172
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,090
the hope of the creditors

173
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,740
who had already given up.

174
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,420
They must think

175
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,020
I was malingering,

176
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,740
so they're trying to gather evidence

177
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,770
and sue me, right?

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,510
And then,

179
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,540
if I pretend to go abroad,

180
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,870
they can't find me.

181
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,080
Then they will find Tian Bin,

182
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,470
freeze his property,

183
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,580
and close his accounts.

184
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,410
These people are ruthless.

185
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,180
I'm poor.

186
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,460
A beggar can never be bankrupt.

187
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,880
But Tian Bin is different.

188
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Are you still the flamboyant

189
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,179
Zhang Ye that I know?

190
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,760
You're willy now.

191
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,220
Your words make my back numb.

192
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:38,890
Who are you looking for?

193
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,690
I'm here for Ye. I'm Zhao Si.

194
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,429
Qi, there's a man named Zhao Si.

195
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,230
He wants to see Zhang Ye.

196
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,750
Nan, let him in.

197
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,110
Brother. Sister.

198
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,890
Brother, I've done

199
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,680
what you asked me to do.

200
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,940
Tian Bin just came to me.

201
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,090
He was

202
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,740
cornered.

203
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,690
Did you give him money?

204
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,700
I gave him 200 yuan as you asked.

205
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,010
He took it?

206
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,810
Yes.

207
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,080
It seems that Tian Bin

208
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,620
was really cornered.

209
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,620
Okay. You can leave now.

210
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,740
The things I did...

211
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,450
I'm glad that

212
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,500
you've pulled back before it's too late

213
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,290
and chosen a right way.

214
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,270
And you also gave me

215
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,150
the account book which can prove that

216
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,670
Tian Bin embezzled my money in the name of donation.

217
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,650
You worked hard even without credit.

218
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,980
I won't punish you.

219
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,990
Brother, you're really broad-minded.

220
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,060
Thank you.

221
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,130
Zhao Si, but I still need to

222
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,080
remind you.

223
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,140
You should look before you leap.

224
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,940
One mistake leads to another.

225
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,280
Right.

226
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,390
Don't end up

227
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,210
like Tian Bin.

228
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,690
I understand.

229
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,360
You can leave now.

230
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

231
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,930
Why are you looking at me?

232
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,770
The Farmer and the Snake

233
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,650
was told by you.

234
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,890
Yes.

235
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,500
But

236
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,390
Zhao Si

237
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,170
is different from Tian Bin.

238
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,490
Zhao Si

239
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,680
is just a green snake.

240
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,230
Hello, sister-in-law.

241
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,340
Zhang Ye!

242
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,120
Zhang Ye!

243
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,380
He's not here. Stop shouting.

244
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,210
Zhang Ye!

245
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,850
Stop shouting.

246
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,850
-Zhang Ye! -He's not here.

247
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,680
Zhang Ye!

248
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,300
Zhang Ye!

249
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,350
Why are you shouting?

250
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,500
Where is Zhang Ye?

251
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,650
How would I know?

252
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,190
He's your fiance.

253
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,990
Why do you come here?

254
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,840
Zhang Ye hasn't been home for days.

255
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,720
He has nowhere else to go

256
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,260
but your place.

257
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,030
Don't say that.

258
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,530
You're not afraid of being misunderstood,

259
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,810
but I'm afraid of scandal.

260
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,650
He's really not here?

261
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,370
He's not here.

262
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,860
If you don't come out,

263
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,740
I'll pluck all

264
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,760
her hair out.

265
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,930
Rao Aimin.

266
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,330
Look at you.

267
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,450
Stop being violent.

268
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,890
You're not a tigress.

269
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,130
Why are you avoiding me these days?

270
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,860
I didn't avoid you.

271
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,570
I just wanted to find a place

272
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,450
to write a script.

273
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,620
You can't write it at home?

274
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,240
You talk about marriage every day.

275
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,680
How can I write it in peace?

276
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,510
It was you who you proposed to me.

277
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,090
You ran away after the proposal.

278
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,060
What do you mean?

279
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,670
I proposed to you.

280
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,500
But I'm in debt now.

281
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,300
I don't want to drag you down.

282
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,620
Just because of this?

283
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,990
It's not because of anything else?

284
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,690
What do you mean?

285
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,290
Don't talk nonsense.

286
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,890
Then pay off the debts.

287
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,010
I can sell the hotel

288
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,770
to help you pay off them.

289
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,450
Are you stupid?

290
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,450
They're your life savings.

291
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,300
If

292
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,570
something happens to me,

293
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,530
how will you live in the future?

294
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,180
Besides, if the creditors

295
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,530
come to our wedding,

296
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,690
do you think it's appropriate?

297
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,040
Rao Aimin.

298
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,020
Don't worry.

299
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,370
A watched pot never boils.

300
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,060
I can't wait.

301
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
We don't have to get married now.

302
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,210
But we have to do what should have been done first

303
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,500
in case something bad happens.

304
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,720
What...

305
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,650
Qi.

306
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,330
I look forward to hearing the patter of tiny feet.

307
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,260
Where are we going?

308
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,080
Zhang Ye,

309
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,460
I know you like Rao Aimin.

310
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,320
When you proposed

311
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,530
to her in the hotel,

312
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,450
I was touched.

313
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,010
I also hope you can be happy.

314
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,260
But have you ever thought that

315
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,570
we will leave here eventually?

316
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,190
If we leave,

317
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,450
what can they do?

318
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,010
You can't let my aunt

319
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,260
be a widow for the rest of her life.

320
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,980
If you stay here,

321
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,910
you should consider me too.

322
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,690
That means we'll be stuck here

323
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,450
forever

324
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,730
and never have a chance

325
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,580
to see our parents again.

326
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,260
Don't worry.

327
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,860
I'll be responsible for you.

328
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,090
Keep still.

329
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,940
Why do you look tired?

330
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,570
Studying human reproduction

331
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,260
and monitoring your physical indicators

332
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,620
are also our jobs.

333
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,620
Freak.

334
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,300
By the way,

335
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,010
your identity as a player has been upgraded.

336
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,380
Do you want a lucky draw?

337
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,180
No.

338
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,890
I want to ask

339
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,940
if I can go back.

340
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,960
I also want to ask.

341
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,380
This is decided by the system.

342
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,380
I'm worried too.

343
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,440
If I go back,

344
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,380
what will happen

345
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,420
to the people in this world?

346
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,330
This world will continue.

347
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,010
The world you are in

348
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,330
is a self-learning world.

349
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,740
You are just one of the elements

350
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,110
of this world.

351
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,540
So you can also be considered

352
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,720
as the creator of this world.

353
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,880
In that case,

354
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,530
after I disappear,

355
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,570
those who love me

356
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,440
will be so sad.

357
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,290
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,740
Whether in this world

359
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,770
or your original world,

360
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,820
you have to suffer

361
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,530
this kind of pain

362
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,060
actively

363
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,300
or passively.

364
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,060
Can I stay in this world

365
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,630
forever?

366
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,890
You are not the first player

367
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,890
to have this idea.

368
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,260
All the players before you

369
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,570
were killed by the system.

370
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,570
So,

371
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,980
either win the game

372
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,860
or be killed by the system.

373
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,180
After the player's identity was upgraded,

374
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,570
the prizes has also been updated.

375
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,530
You really don't want a lucky draw?

376
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,420
No.

377
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,620
You're awake.

378
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,820
I couldn't sleep.

379
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,690
Where did you go?

380
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,089
I...

381
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,440
went to the bathroom.

382
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,319
Come here.

383
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,410
Let me ask you.

384
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,860
Will you leave me?

385
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,690
Will you break my heart,

386
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,570
abandon me, and love another woman

387
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,500
after you get me?

388
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,290
If you dare,

389
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,810
I'll break your legs.

390
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,970
I can take care of you forever.

391
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,290
Oh, wait.

392
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,780
What's wrong?

393
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,780
This is for you.

394
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,140
This...

395
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,090
This is for you.

396
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,090
Why do you have it?

397
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,450
This is my family heirloom.

398
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,690
Family heirloom?

399
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,810
This is the love token

400
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,980
my father gave to my mom.

401
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,380
After my mom passed away,

402
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,380
it was given to me.

403
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,050
You know what?

404
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,620
This thing is very effective.

405
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,410
If you make a wish on it,

406
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,250
your dream will come true.

407
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,140
Did you make a wish on it?

408
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,850
So you I met you.

409
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,140
Well...

410
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,690
Let me help you put it on.

411
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,320
Once you wear it,

412
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,380
you'll be mine from now on.

413
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,860
If anyone dares bully you,

414
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,020
tell them my name.

415
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,920
I'll punish them for you.

416
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,260
What are you thinking?

417
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,010
Once upon a time there was a true love

418
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,620
in front of me,

419
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,090
but I didn't cherish it.

420
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,210
I didn't realize it

421
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,860
until it was gone.

422
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,290
If God gives me

423
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,540
another time to start again,

424
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,540
I will tell her,

425
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,450
"I love you."

426
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,690
If there is an expiration date

427
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,900
on this love,

428
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,500
I hope it will be

429
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,620
in 10,000 years.

430
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,850
Once upon a time? Who is she?

431
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,410
No.

432
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,620
There is no one else.

433
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,980
These are lines.

434
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,210
These are the lines from a movie.

435
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,260
What you said before sounded like lines.

436
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,330
They reminded me of these lines.

437
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,530
So romantic.

438
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,660
Can you tell me one more line?

439
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,690
I want to hear more.

440
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:38,850
Come here.

441
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,620
Come here.

442
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,450
Zhang Ye, you know what?

443
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,410
There are so many

444
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:47,450
♫It's deep night♫

445
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,500
strange things in your mind.

446
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,330
I like to hear them.

447
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,780
Tell them only to me from now on.

448
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,880
♫There are a few stars beside you♫

449
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,330
Tell me everything, okay?

450
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,250
If you like,

451
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,750
♫I'm rushing to you♫

452
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,860
I can tell you

453
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,190
everything I know.

454
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:09,640
♫You disappear in every morning♫

455
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,780
Say it.

456
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,910
♫I understand♫

457
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,380
Look at my

458
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,340
♫Our distance is like the galaxy♫

459
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,250
love line, life line and career line.

460
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,600
They're all formed by your name.

461
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,540
I'm not toadying. It's love.

462
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,570
♫But your trace♫

463
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,500
So romantic.

464
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,710
♫Reflects deeply in my eyes♫

465
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,810
One more.

466
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,620
♫When stars fall in front of you♫

467
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,290
Wait a minute.

468
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,740
Let me tell you an original story.

469
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,050
It's a story about love and being beaten.

470
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,000
♫Maybe you are also looking at me♫

471
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,280
It was inspired by you.

472
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,860
The story would not exist without you.

473
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,210
I'll write it down and make it into a movie.

474
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,400
♫The small me♫

475
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,210
I'm sure many people will be moved.

476
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,850
I gave it a name.

477
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,930
It's called The Second Generation Master.

478
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,100
Hello, Four. It's me.

479
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,020
My property was almost

480
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,890
confiscated by the police.

481
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,700
Can you

482
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,210
lend me some money?

483
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,980
Bin, I don't have much money.

484
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,780
Fine.

485
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,570
Tell me where you are.

486
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,810
I'll bring a thousand yuan for you.

487
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,860
Wait for me.

488
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,170
Hello, Ye.

489
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,850
This is Zhao Si.

490
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,810
Guess what?

491
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,050
Tian Bin's property

492
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:42,930
was confiscated by the police again.

493
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,500
He's borrowing money from me.

494
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,930
Just do as I told you.

495
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,780
Give him money if he borrow it.

496
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,020
Report him when he

497
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,540
settles down.

498
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,330
I just want Tian Bin

499
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,620
to enjoy the hiding.

500
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,780
By the way,

501
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,660
he'll get more and more nervous.

502
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,200
Don't irritate him.

503
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,020
Don't push him too far.

504
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,690
Don't worry.

505
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:00,860
Be careful.

506
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,660
Okay, brother.

507
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,860
Why is this here?

508
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,810
This...

509
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,050
This is a love gift I gave to

510
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,620
Wang Sisi in the real world.

511
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,140
Why is it here?

512
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,740
Congratulations.

513
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,890
Congratulations?

514
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,260
You can go back

515
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,860
to the original world.

516
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,260
Go back to the original world?

517
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,660
You mean

518
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,860
I wined the game?

519
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,810
You can understand it like this.

520
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,740
In this world,

521
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,170
you've wined fame, career,

522
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,170
friendship,

523
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,330
love

524
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,170
and family.

525
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,380
You've not only suffered hardship,

526
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,450
but also given others your love.

527
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,810
So you won the game.

528
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,090
What does it have to do with this pendant?

529
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,780
The two worlds cross.

530
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,210
This crystal pendant

531
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,450
is the key to these two worlds.

532
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,170
The system

533
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
set a surprise

534
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,260
when the game started,

535
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,570
hiding the key beside you.

536
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,510
Only when you experienced all the stages

537
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,340
in this game,

538
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:16,660
would you get the key

539
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,450
to the original world.

540
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,860
When will I

541
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,610
disappear in this world?

542
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,500
It's up to you.

543
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,320
Many people chose to

544
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,190
stay in this world.

545
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,440
After all, here,

546
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,670
you've got everything.

547
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,690
In your words,

548
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,450
this place is a happy place.

549
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,170
When you want to come back,

550
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,260
you just need to see the light in the crystal pendant

551
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,320
and think about the world

552
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,540
you want to go back to.

553
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,090
It's simple, isn't it?

554
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,720
The system will automatically discern it.

555
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,040
What do you think?

556
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,620
Do you want to go back now?

557
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,910
No, just wait.

558
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,130
So far,

559
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,740
you really don't want a draw?

560
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,540
With your current Fame Value,

561
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,570
you can arm yourself

562
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,050
with the prizes as a superman.

563
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,650
Is there anything that

564
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,930
can enhance my memories of that world?

565
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,330
What kind of memories?

566
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,380
The knowledge I've learned,

567
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,570
the movies I've watched,

568
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,140
and the music I've listened to.

569
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,290
That's easy.

570
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,250
Don't draw it.

571
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,900
Just buy it with your Fame Value.

572
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,040
You have plenty of Fame Value.

573
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,450
Okay. I'll buy it.

574
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,330
I knew it.

575
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,160
Even if Zhang Ye got

576
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,140
the key to the original world,

577
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,380
he would choose to stay here.

578
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,540
Is it because he has everything

579
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,500
he's dreamed about in this world?

580
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,860
This is human nature.

581
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,300
But the system

582
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,470
will kick him out.

583
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,950
No one can stay here.

584
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,060
This test is too cruel

585
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,090
to Zhang Ye.

586
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,740
Zhang Ye,

587
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,140
you haven't been home for days.

588
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,290
Why did you

589
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,330
gather us here?

590
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,420
Hold it a second.

591
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,490
Some people haven't arrived yet.

592
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,560
Zhang Ye asked us to come here.

593
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,590
He must have his reasons.

594
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,040
You know again?

595
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,150
How do you know so much?

596
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,200
-This way, please. -They're here.

597
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,450
Zhang Ye.

598
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,370
Help yourself.

599
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,290
Mr. Zhao. Miss Xiaomei.

600
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,710
Let me introduce them to you.

601
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,380
This is

602
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,820
Mr. Zhao from Qomolangma.

603
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,740
This is Miss Xiaomei. She's an anchor.

604
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,120
Have a seat.

605
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,440
Have a seat.

606
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,150
Okay.

607
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,380
Another woman.

608
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:32,660
What?

609
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,740
Do you want us to compete for you?

610
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,460
It's a serious matter.

611
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,050
So many people

612
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,260
gather here.

613
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,780
Zhang Ye, what are you doing?

614
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,380
We have to rush back.

615
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,540
There will be a show later.

616
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,700
Actually,

617
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,110
I invited you here today

618
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,870
because I have some things to give you.

619
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,570
Now that everyone is here,

620
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,090
let's start.

621
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,450
One by one.

622
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,970
Let's start from Mr. Zhao and

623
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,340
Miss Xiaomei.

624
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,410
These...

625
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,990
All of these are for you.

626
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,340
[Where Is Dad]

627
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,790
This is a program proposal?

628
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,240
Yes.

629
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,790
I have many ideas these days.

630
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,540
I've written many proposals at home.

631
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,210
I can't implement them all by myself.

632
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,810
I think I should give them to you.

633
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:25,880
As long as you implement them

634
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,740
according to my proposals,

635
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,140
I promise each program

636
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,050
will set a trend.

637
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:29,980
Look here.

638
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Youth With You.

639
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,540
You Are A Singer.

640
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,620
Where Is Dad.

641
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,780
Super Girls.

642
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,570
Singing shows, variety shows

643
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,120
and lectures are all included.

644
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,060
Put them into practice.

645
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,430
You'll have many kinds of programs.

646
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,900
Oh my God.

647
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,780
These are all your ideas?

648
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,410
Of course.

649
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,410
Ms. Wu.

650
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,210
These are for you.

651
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,170
World Cultural History.

652
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,140
Chinese Cultural History.

653
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,660
I've arranged them for you

654
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,340
in chronological order.

655
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,290
Art, poems and novels

656
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,170
are all included.

657
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,750
The Three Hundred Tang Poems.

658
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,140
The Three Hundred Song Ci Poems.

659
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,220
But the total number of Tang poems and Song Ci poems

660
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,290
which have been passed down

661
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,720
is just over 300.

662
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,260
I've added all the missing poems.

663
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,680
And I also wrote down

664
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,880
their provenance and allusion.

665
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,010
Take your time and study them.

666
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,460
I've collected all

667
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,580
that I can collect for you.

668
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,290
Zhang Ye, you haven't been home for days.

669
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,580
These are the reasons, right?

670
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,810
Zhang Hua also helped me a lot.

671
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,020
Rao Aimin, these are for you.

672
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,770
I have gifts too?

673
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,980
Of course.

674
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,270
From Tai Chi to Eight-diagram Palm,

675
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,960
these are secret martial arts books.

676
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,370
Here are also some martial arts from the south.

677
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,240
You're good at martial arts.

678
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,730
You must develop and spread

679
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,740
our Chinese martial arts.

680
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,740
It's too stressful.

681
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,430
Zhang Ye.

682
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,380
I believe you know poems and songs.

683
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,760
Why do you know how to reorganize martial arts?

684
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,870
Were you kicked by a donkey

685
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,050
and then enlightened?

686
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,340
My brain wasn't kicked

687
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,130
by a donkey.

688
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,500
My brain

689
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,530
was kissed by an angel.

690
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,330
Let me guess.

691
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,810
The last one should be me.

692
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,450
They're scripts.

693
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,620
Right.

694
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,290
Over there.

695
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,660
These are all yours.

696
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,930
Farewell Conqueror.

697
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,660
The Sun Also Sets.

698
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,290
The Diversity of Life.

699
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,450
The Killer Is Not Cold

700
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,500
They are all classics.

701
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,770
Why do you give me

702
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,320
all the movie scripts?

703
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,450
Because you have rich resources

704
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,070
in this field.

705
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,740
And I believe with your character,

706
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,490
you can definitely make these movies

707
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,310
and do a good job.

708
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,500
My fiancee

709
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,570
likes listening to stories.

710
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,290
I'm afraid she can't understand written versions.

711
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,780
If I could adapt them for movies,

712
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,090
she would understand them.

713
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,410
I've promised you

714
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,210
I would tell you every story

715
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,290
I know.

716
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,080
Zhang Ye,

717
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,330
did something happen to you?

718
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,570
It's like you don't have

719
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,570
much time left to live.

720
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
What are you talking about?

721
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,210
Zhang Hua.

722
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,240
How are the songs

723
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,010
I asked you to organize?

724
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,900
I'm still organizing them.

725
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,280
There are too many songs.

726
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,830
Don't sing all of them.

727
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,000
Leave some chances to other singers.

728
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:15,900
OK.

729
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,150
Other information

730
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,730
is kept in this computer.

731
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,320
If you need it,

732
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,380
ask Zhang Hua to give it to you.

733
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,780
Zhang Ye,

734
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,770
many production companies have tightened their investment.

735
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,560
It's hard to make these

736
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,660
movies.

737
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,760
Don't worry. I know how to solve it.

738
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,810
I suggest you read the script of

739
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,100
The Popular Earth again.

740
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,670
Although it needs much investment,

741
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,650
a box office success can be guaranteed.

742
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,770
I've read it.

743
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,980
The production costs are too high.

744
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,060
Besides, no one dares

745
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,490
to invest money now.

746
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,720
Only Hollywood is good at

747
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,040
making science fiction movies.

748
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,190
What do we care about?

749
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,970
Good profits with low costs.

750
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,910
Investment requires

751
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,320
the lowest risk

752
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,330
and the highest profit.

753
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,640
This is a fantasy story.

754
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,450
How many leading actresses

755
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,480
are there in the movie?

756
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,620
I don't have leading actresses.

757
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,220
Who else is on the boat?

758
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,410
He and a Siberian tiger

759
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,070
was on a lifesaving boat.

760
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,490
They drifted for more than 200 days.

761
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,410
Change it then.

762
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,140
Change the man to a beauty.

763
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,410
Have you heard

764
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,620
the 3B principle in the advertising industry?

765
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,260
Beautiful, baby, and beast.

766
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,940
I'm afraid...

767
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,520
it's a little difficult.

768
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,820
It's not difficult.

769
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,540
No wonder you are poor.

770
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,720
You're too stubborn.

771
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,290
We got the evaluation.

772
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,000
59 points.

773
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,390
And the public feedback is not good.

774
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:51,930
Most importantly,

775
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,150
The Diversity of Life

776
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,510
doesn't have a potential for success.

777
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,330
You have to change the script.

778
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,270
The company thinks we can

779
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,640
make an online movie with low costs.

780
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,810
We can offer you 3,000 yuan.

781
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,760
Will you sell the script?

782
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,410
Stop writing.

783
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,450
Take a break.

784
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,500
I miss you.

785
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,560
I miss you too.

786
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,090
I'm still a minor.

787
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:12,980
Close your ears.

788
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:16,450
Honey,

789
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,590
say something nice.

790
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,420
I don't want to be apart from you for a moment.

791
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,330
I won't wind upon you like a trumpet creeper.

792
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,180
You're so romantic.

793
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,980
One more.

794
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,620
One more.

795
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,620
Good boy.

796
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,980
I'm going to walk the dog.

797
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,570
Don't write for too long. Take a break.

798
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,140
Aimin, I miss you again.

799
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:49,980
Me too.

800
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,810
Are you going to stay here?

801
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,500
I'm saying goodbye.

802
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,540
She likes listening to my stories.

803
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,330
I want to leave all the stories I know

804
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,780
to her.

805
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,740
When others say goodbye,

806
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,590
they flick their sleeves

807
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,590
and don't bring away a wisp of cloud.

808
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,570
Look at you.

809
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,780
Not only did you not bring it away,

810
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,030
but also left

811
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,810
all your possessions.

812
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,230
You're so kind.

813
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,930
This is the only thing I can do.

814
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,090
I don't know when will

815
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,330
the game come to an end.

816
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,540
If I didn't go back,

817
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
I couldn't remember what my mother

818
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,960
looks like.

819
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,300
How about I ask Sanzhi?

820
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,820
Even people are sentenced to life imprisonment

821
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,280
will tell their family in advance.

822
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,690
Don't come to them.

823
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,180
They are bad.

824
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,480
If it weren't for them,

825
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,220
we would have gone back.

826
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,260
Hello?

827
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,900
Hello?

828
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,330
Come to me now.

829
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,640
Liang Xiansheng

830
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,590
is very interested in your script of

831
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,430
The Second Generation Master.

832
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,520
Which Liang Xiansheng?

833
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,850
That Liang Xiansheng.

834
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,950
It's really that Liang Xiansheng?

835
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,680
Come here.

836
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,790
I think the problem of investment

837
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:58,340
can be solved.

838
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,810
Okay.

839
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,640
Liang Xiansheng is interested

840
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,210
in my script.

841
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,330
Mr. Liang.

842
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,570
Hello, Angie.

843
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,740
This is Zhang Ye.

844
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,600
Mr. Liang.

845
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,409
Have a seat.

846
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,340
Angie mentioned you to me many times.

847
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,840
You wrote 'My Future is not a Dream',

848
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,600
right?

849
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,500
Yes.

850
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,230
It's amazing.

851
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,900
I've read the script of

852
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:24,850
The Second Generation Master.

853
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,710
I can star in it.

854
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,429
But there's a question

855
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,750
I want to ask you in person.

856
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,170
Why is it The Second Generation Master

857
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,989
instead of The First Generation Master?

858
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,719
This is a good question.

859
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,610
Why is it the second?

860
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,690
Because it is

861
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,120
a special design.

862
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,210
'Second'

863
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,739
is a connecting link between the preceding and the following.

864
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,850
The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two.

865
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,300
Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things.

866
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,570
All things have their backs to the female and stand facing the male.

867
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,820
When male and female combine, all things achieve harmony.

868
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,060
It seems very profound.

869
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,170
Let me put it simply.

870
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,340
Out of nothing, One is born.

871
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,690
Two connects the preceding and the following.

872
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,890
As a human,

873
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,580
we should be 'two'.

874
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,020
Making movies also needs

875
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,020
'two'.

876
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,490
After we finish it,

877
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,750
we can make the third, fourth, and fifth seasons.

878
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,010
If it becomes popular,

879
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,960
we can also

880
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,100
make a prequel.

881
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,780
I think I understand.

882
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,340
Well,

883
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,930
Mr. Liang,

884
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,500
are you willing to

885
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,300
star in this movie?

886
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,070
I can play

887
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,850
Ye Da.

888
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,860
Angie and I are thinking about

889
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,530
starring in a movie together.

890
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,330
How about she

891
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,070
plays Gong Yi this time?

892
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,880
What do you think?

893
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,210
I...

894
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,410
No problem.

895
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,290
But

896
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,890
I haven't tried fight scenes before.

897
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,130
Me neither.

898
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,890
I used to star in romantic movies.

899
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,580
If I star in this movie,

900
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,130
I also have to learn it.

901
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,060
I can teach you.

902
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,660
Maybe I can

903
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,050
offer some help

904
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,230
in martial arts.

905
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,700
You'll be the director of your movie.

906
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,840
As for the problem of investment,

907
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,980
I'll solve it.

908
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,380
I believe we can

909
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,600
make a touching and classic

910
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,950
martial arts movie which is rich in cultural elements.

911
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,930
If we add patriotism

912
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,020
to it,

913
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,730
will it be more exciting?

914
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,450
Right.

915
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,780
In that case,

916
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,210
after this movie,

917
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,180
I'll make a movie named

918
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,450
A Fei Is Turning In The Opposite Direction

919
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,930
for Mr. Liang.

920
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,390
What do you think?

921
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,910
This name

922
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,730
is very exciting.

923
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,870
I'm looking forward to working with you.

924
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,510
I'm looking forward to working with you.

925
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,280
Director, I have a question.

926
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,010
What is the relationship

927
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,360
between Gong Yi and Mr. Ye

928
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,010
in the end?

929
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,330
Is it love

930
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,500
or what?

931
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,020
Actually, Gong Yi has always been

932
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,020
very concerned about Ye Da.

933
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,230
It's quite complicated.

934
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,010
I think it includes love, friendship

935
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,060
land kinship.

936
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,330
'Include' is not 'only'.

937
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,080
It's like there's

938
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,430
a piece of paper between them.

939
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,170
The didn't pierce it.

940
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,540
And they didn't confess their love.

941
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,260
Are you ready?

942
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,090
Okay. Have a try.

943
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:12,950
Here we go.

944
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,930
Ready.

945
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,450
Ready.

946
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,580
One, two, three.

947
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:20,880
No, no.

948
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,450
Cut. Cut.

949
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,060
Cut.

950
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,850
Look.

951
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,390
Yes, adjust your hair.

952
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:56,670
Yes.

953
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,720
-Come on. Adjust your hair. -There is a wisp on the left.

954
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,370
Make up.

955
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,080
Come on.

956
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,420
Hurry up.

957
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,450
We can start now.

958
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,880
Action.

959
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,410
Ready.

960
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,790
Three, two, one, go.

961
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,100
No one can stop time.

962
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,180
Some people are running before time

963
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,280
and are being chased by time.

964
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,240
Some people are left behind by time

965
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,960
and chase after time.

966
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,700
I want to stop here secretly,

967
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,750
waiting for time to pass

968
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,680
and go far.

969
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,600
If it doesn't find out,

970
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,830
I can choose

971
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,900
whether to let time chase me

972
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,280
or I chase after time.

973
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,180
Good! Great!

974
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,580
Now I announce that

975
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,930
The Second Generation Master

976
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,290
is a wrap.
