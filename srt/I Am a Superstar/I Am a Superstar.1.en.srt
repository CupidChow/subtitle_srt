[Episode 1]

4
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,930
Like blue flames,

5
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,310
flocks of clouds

6
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,060
blaze up above the sea's abyss.

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,820
The sea catches bolts of lightning

8
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,350
and snuffs them

9
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,750
in her depths.

10
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,140
Like flaming serpents,

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,740
the lightning

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,530
weaves in the sea

13
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,790
and then disappears in a blink of an eye.

14
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,650
The courageous Stormy Petrel

15
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,530
proudly soars in the lightning

16
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,510
above the roaring sea.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,900
Like a prophet of victory,

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,880
he screams,

19
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,340
"Let the storm

20
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,450
strike all its fury!"

21
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,590
Open your eyes.

22
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,610
Zhang Ye.

23
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,579
I work harder than everyone else.

24
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I'm more diligent than everyone else.

25
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,910
I'm better than everyone else.

26
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,050
I want to live there.

27
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,020
I want to live the life I want

28
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,410
with my capability.

29
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,440
Why are you doing this to me?

30
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,510
You let others treat me with disdain,

31
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,650
laugh at me,

32
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,710
and take away

33
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,010
my life.

34
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,380
I know.

35
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,260
You want me

36
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,990
to be stuck here

37
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,390
for the rest of my life

38
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,470
as a nobody

39
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,850
and work hard for life every day,

40
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:52,940
right?

41
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,150
I refuse.

42
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,130
Billions of years ago,

43
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,390
aliens sowed the seeds of life

44
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,020
on the Earth.

45
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,530
Now they cross the firmament

46
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,820
and return to this blue planet

47
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,740
to test whether humans are qualified

48
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,520
to inherit the civilization of the universe.

49
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,550
The target planet

50
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,350
is located in the Orion Arm

51
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,580
of the Milky Way galaxy.

52
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,980
It is 150 million kilometers away from the stars.

53
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,750
The number of the civilization of the universe: 3.1415.

54
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,030
The origin of life:

55
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,670
4.6 billion years ago.

56
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,390
The method of testing:

57
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,710
randomly select a high-level species

58
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,390
of the planet.

59
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,870
The purpose of testing:

60
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,100
to evaluate whether the civilization of the planet

61
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,060
should be destroyed and reshaped.

62
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,110
The solar system must be around here.

63
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,230
Nonsense!

64
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,740
This is Orion.

65
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,350
Are you out of your mind?

66
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,340
You are out of your mind!

67
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,950
Your whole family are out of your minds!

68
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,390
Your whole family are out of your minds!

69
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,540
You hit me?

70
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,550
So what?

71
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,390
Your whole family are out of your minds!

72
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,870
Are you crazy?

73
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,260
I won.

74
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,490
Fly this way. Don't be dishonest.

75
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,080
Fresh sugar-coated haws.

76
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,710
Hello.

77
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,070
Hello, is this Zhang Ye?

78
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,750
I don't want any packages.

79
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,590
I don't have bank cards.

80
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,570
I don't borrow money.

81
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,030
Why did you hang up on me?

82
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,590
Is this Zhang Ye's phone number?

83
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,110
Now, I'm Zhang Ye.

84
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,990
But I don't know whether

85
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,580
I'll still be him later.

86
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,310
Are you crazy?

87
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,350
I was just ready

88
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,510
and made my decision.

89
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,940
This is the HR Department of Qomolangma.

90
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,180
Let me ask you again.

91
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,280
Are you Zhang Ye?

92
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,110
Qomolangma?

93
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,130
I... I... I... I'm Zhang Ye.

94
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,020
What's wrong?

95
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,860
You passed

96
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,299
the written exam for the recruitment

97
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,179
in the radio station of

98
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:39,870
the Qomolangma Network Entertainment.

99
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,809
Please come to the company

100
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,020
at 2 p.m. tomorrow for an interview.

101
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,750
Please bring your resume and ID card

102
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,900
and register at the reception office

103
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,590
in the new media building.

104
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,520
Then go to the meeting room on the 15th floor.

105
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,310
I... I...

106
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,110
Sir, I'm sorry.

107
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,550
I... I thought it was...

108
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,030
I passed the exam.

109
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,730
Look at you.

110
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,670
Did you hear

111
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,750
what I said?

112
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,210
You realized them quickly.

113
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,190
Alright, let's stop arguing.

114
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,460
Let's make up.

115
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,540
Come on.

116
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,190
No. I have to thank you.

117
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,110
I have to thank you.

118
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,140
One, two, three, four, five, six.

119
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,730
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

120
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,420
Boss, I want this one.

121
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,110
This one?

122
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,950
Yes. This one is big.

123
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,540
Okay, no problem.

124
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,660
The crystalline silicon

125
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,350
interfered with the transmitter.

126
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,030
The transmitter is burnt.

127
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,090
We can only grab small things.

128
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,030
If you hadn't

129
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,290
grabbed the sugar-coated haws,

130
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
there wouldn't be such a big accident.

131
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,970
Forget it.

132
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:47,910
Don't mention in the report that

133
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,420
the equipment is burnt.

134
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,270
It's hard to explain when we go back.

135
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,750
What about them?

136
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,630
There's something wrong.

137
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,710
Why can't we transfer data?

138
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,090
The code is messy.

139
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,350
The data seems to be badly corrupted.

140
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,350
The virtual world is different.

141
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,470
That's enough. It's fine.

142
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,910
At worst, something in this world

143
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,780
doesn't exist there

144
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,670
or has a different name.

145
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,320
It is also part of the experiment

146
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,380
to test whether Zhang Ye

147
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,710
will become greedy

148
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,150
and go against his bottom line

149
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,910
after using information gaps

150
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,660
to be successful.

151
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,740
Anyway, if the Earthman can't overcome his weaknesses,

152
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,700
it means the experiment has failed.

153
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,670
We will then bomb the Earth

154
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,120
and rush to fly to the next galaxy.

155
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,390
Xiaoniao Beer.

156
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,390
Where are my shoes?

157
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,630
Get me some water.

158
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,610
Young man,

159
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,080
why are you eating here after you opened the door?

160
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,580
Who are you?

161
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,630
Stop joking.

162
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,550
I'm your son.

163
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,950
How did you get drunk without drinking, dad?

164
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:03,980
Say it again.

165
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,590
What did you call me?

166
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,210
Dad.

167
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,150
What did you call me?

168
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,790
Dad.

169
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,580
Who are you?

170
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,910
What did you call him?

171
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,120
Mom, don't you know me?

172
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,970
What's wrong with you two?

173
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,060
He is your father?

174
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,860
Make it clear to me.

175
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,430
What happened?

176
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,710
Who is this young man?

177
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,710
I... I... I... I...

178
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,620
I heard him call you mom.

179
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,110
Who are you?

180
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,990
What happened?

181
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,230
What did he call you?

182
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,670
Who are you?

183
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,390
I'm asking you.

184
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,190
Who are you?

185
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,630
Who are you?

186
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,780
Why are you at my house?

187
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,310
But...

188
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,680
He called you mom, right?

189
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,990
I heard it clearly.

190
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,290
Who is he?

191
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm curious, too.

192
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,620
I'm curious, too.

193
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,630
He called you mom.

194
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,590
What happened?

195
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,180
Make it clear to me.

196
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,310
Stop arguing.

197
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,550
Who gave birth to him?

198
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,150
Stop arguing.

199
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,540
I'm now...

200
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:48,940
Stop arguing.

201
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,430
No, he...

202
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,220
I'm now... I'm now...

203
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,750
Listen to me.

204
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,110
I'm now...

205
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,360
I'll get him out of here. I'll get him out of here.

206
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,140
Don't go.

207
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,640
Don't you know me?

208
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,400
No, you...

209
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,160
-Don't go. -Tell me the truth.

210
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:56,730
-You two... -Don't go.

211
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,320
-Mom. Mom.  -You two...

212
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,110
This is my friend.

213
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,910
Don't go, young man.

214
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,750
You...

215
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,590
Why are you pulling me?

216
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,580
Is it...

217
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,410
I'll check for you,

218
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,750
OK?

219
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,230
Get out!

220
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,340
When you were teaching as a volunteer in Yunnan,

221
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,590
you and that PE teacher...

222
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,460
Tell me the truth.

223
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,010
I've suspected you all these years.

224
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,150
What happened?

225
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,870
Why... why are you...

226
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,550
Go away.

227
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,350
Name? Age?

228
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,340
Blood type? Birth date?

229
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,740
And where have you been

230
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,770
suffering all these years?

231
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,600
What do you mean?

232
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,740
You lost your clothes.

233
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,230
You asked me? I want to ask you.

234
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,350
Who are you?

235
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,470
My name is Zhang Hua.

236
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,510
I've lived here

237
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,350
since I was born.

238
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,320
We look a little alike.

239
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,020
But I'm fatter than you.

240
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,090
Are we really

241
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,110
half-brothers?

242
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,300
Oh my goodness. My dad is so…

243
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,700
Zhang Hua?

244
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,310
Who is your half-brother?

245
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,390
What are you talking about?

246
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,490
But you called him dad when you entered the room.

247
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,830
He is my father.

248
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,350
Don't come here these days anyway.

249
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,750
My parents are arguing.

250
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,820
Don't add fuel to the fire.

251
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,270
Brother.

252
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,580
What are you doing?

253
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,860
Put it on.

254
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,870
What's your shoe size?

255
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,150
42.

256
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,310
Almost.

257
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,790
A little bit small.

258
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,270
My feet are small.

259
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,610
Why do you give these to me?

260
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,840
Put them on.

261
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,150
Do... do you have money?

262
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,610
Check the pockets.

263
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,280
My money is in the pockets.

264
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,200
You're poorer than me?

265
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,130
I bought books.

266
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,790
Fine. You can go back.

267
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:01,990
So,

268
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,060
where will you live today?

269
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,520
It's none of your business. Go back.

270
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,819
I'm leaving.

271
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,990
Zhang Hua?

272
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,510
Why is he so foolish?

273
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,590
My parents don't know me anymore.

274
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,750
What's going on?

275
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,620
I can't stand it anymore!

276
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,520
Neither do I.

277
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,130
I can't stand it either!

278
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,340
Make it clear to me.

279
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,390
You have to explain it to me.

280
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,570
KD Chicken Fried Steak?

281
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,760
KDP?

282
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,120
McDonald's Roujiamo?

283
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,500
Where am I?

284
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,040
Colex?

285
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,410
Isn't it Rolex?

286
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,250
What the hell is going on?

287
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,660
I had a similar dream before.

288
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,470
But I woke up soon.

289
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,910
What happened today?

290
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,270
Sir,

291
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,390
can you lend me

292
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,140
your phone?

293
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,870
I...

294
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,820
I... I can give you money.

295
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,750
Here, take it.

296
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,900
Thank you.

297
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,180
Hello,

298
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,750
the number you dialed does not exist.

299
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,690
The number you dialed does not exist.

300
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,580
Why don't they exist?

301
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,310
Sir, where are we?

302
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,540
Shiyi.

303
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,870
What?

304
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,980
The capital of Shengyi province,

305
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,290
Shiyi.

306
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,020
Are you crazy?

307
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,030
You're crazy!

308
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,760
Give me my phone.

309
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,800
Go away.

310
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,720
It must be a dream.

311
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,470
I'm in a dream.

312
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,400
You're in a dream, too.

313
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,910
Wake up!

314
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,630
I'll call the police. Go away.

315
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,630
Psychopath.

316
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,700
[Souhu Newspaper, July 10, 2019]

317
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,390
Tick Brand?

318
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,220
What's going on?

319
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,510
Did I really

320
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,390
travel through spacetime?

321
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,350
I don't want to.

322
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,920
I have to go back.

323
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,030
How can I go back?

324
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,100
Why is it useless?

325
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,530
Who... who can help me?

326
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,510
Who can help me?

327
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,750
Put me down!

328
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,380
It's dangerous to stand by the lake?

329
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,630
I'm back!

330
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,320
If the subject

331
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,850
quits,

332
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,630
what we're doing will be in vain.

333
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,050
I'm still here?

334
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,260
I was here after I

335
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,230
had an accident on the roof.

336
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,830
I might have to jump off a building.

337
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,740
Why are you

338
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,610
leaning on my lap?

339
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,650
You haven't eaten for a long time?

340
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,190
Neither have I.

341
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,290
We have the same misfortune.

342
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,510
No, you...

343
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,240
Let's share it.

344
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,230
It's a deal, okay?

345
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,980
Let's share it.

346
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,090
This half is for you.

347
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,780
I'm hungry.

348
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,430
I'm really hungry.

349
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,110
No.

350
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,290

00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,310
By the way,

526
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,200
when you come back,

527
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,270
don't forget to wash its feet.

528
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,230
Then you can go to the kitchen

529
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,490
and see whether there's something

530
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,830
left for you to eat.

531
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,690
Come to the laundry room in the morning

532
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,950
to clean and disinfect

533
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,020
all the sheets and towels that have been changed.

534
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,290
In the afternoon,

535
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,090
clean up all the rooms

536
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,210
that the guests have checked out of.

537
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,510
And in the evening,

538
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,760
come to this yard.

539
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,030
You see...

540
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,670
Why do you follow me blankly?

541
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,390
Did you hear

542
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,150
what I just said?

543
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,070
Yes.

544
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,550
Savior,

545
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,340
am I the only person

546
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,660
who works for you?

547
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:23,900
You applied

548
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,140
for this job.

549
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,020
I didn't force you.

550
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,950
You can quit if you don't want this job.

551
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,030
You can leave now.

552
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,190
I want this job.

553
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,210
But Savior,

554
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
there is so much work

555
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,270
for me to do.

556
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,570
I'm paid 4,000 yuan a month.

557
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:39,950
Isn't my salary

558
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,800
a little bit low?

559
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,430
There is a place

560
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,670
where you can live

561
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,580
and eat for free.

562
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,820
Where is it?

563
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:56,930
The police station.

564
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,850
I'll tell the police

565
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,240
you wanted to steal my dog.

566
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,400
After I found out,

567
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,150
you followed me to this hotel.

568
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,680
And then you wanted to...

569
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,340
Nowadays,

570
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,020
cardboard boxes are not free.

571
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,830
I don't have the right

572
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:11,920
to be picky.

573
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,900
Four thousand. Just four thousand.

574
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,430
Don't raise my salary.

575
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,230
If you think I'm not doing a good job,

576
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,690
it's okay if you reduce

577
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,340
my salary.

578
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,870
I'm going to clean.

579
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,470
You can live here.

580
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,100
Isn't it a bit...

581
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,530
Here are the clothes

582
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,090
that the guests don't want.

583
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,470
You can change your clothes

584
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,570
if you can wear them.

585
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,450
I think

586
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,570
you are young

587
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,750
and weak.

588
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,930
You don't look like a bad guy.

589
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,500
I do need someone to work for me,

590
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,650
That's why I took you in.

591
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,360
But let me make it clear.

592
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,909
If you work here,

593
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,469
you should behave yourself.

594
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,630
If I find

595
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,909
there's something wrong with you,

596
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,949
you know what will happen to you.

597
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,990
Zhang Ye.

598
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,710
Don't you want to know

599
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,820
how you came here?

600
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,340
You know my name is Zhang Ye?

601
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,350
Who are you?

602
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,860

Congratulations.

609
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,100
You got 50,000 Fame Value.

610
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,510
Fame Value?

611
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,570
In this game,

612
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,420
Fame Value can be traded for everything.

613
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,080
Everything is for Fame Value.

614
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,170
It is more important than money.

615
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,020
In this survival game,

616
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,230
either become famous or die.

617
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,180

618
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,270
Adult game?

619
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,670
What are you thinking about?

620
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,260
Look at your head.

621
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,790
That's your Fame Value.

622
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,870
Your task

623
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,630
is to get attention

624
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,950
and accumulate Fame Value.

625
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,650
I can't play this game.

626
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,770
You might not know me well.

627
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,420
I keep a low profile.

628
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,860
I walk along the side of roads.

629
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,230
I can't do this kind of

630
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,820
eye-catching thing.

631
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:39,510
Really.

632
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,950
Let me go back.

633
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,780
What kind of life

634
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,710
I've been living

635
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,910
these days?

636
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,910
I'm in a game.

637
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,570
Sorry.

638
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,610
The game has started.

639
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,840
You can't archive it.

640
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,840
You can't pause.

641
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,830
You can't quit.

642
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,100
Why?

643
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,300
I didn't say I wanted to play.

644
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,440
Who brought me in?

645
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,630
Let me quit!

646
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,410
Since reality ended,

647
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,550
the game

648
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,930
has started.

649
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,750
End?

650
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,430
So,

651
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,210
I have to play this game?

652
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,140
You have no choice.

653
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,750
Once you run out of your Fame Value,

654
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,390
you lose the game.

655
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,140
How long do I have to play?

656
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,840
The testing target is...

657
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,460
Oh, no. I forgot to set it.

658
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,890
In the automatic mode,

659
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,150
the value cannot be changed.

660
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,580
The bug is still there.

661
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,200
We must complain about the technical team when we return.

662
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,430
Then we have to change it to the manual mode.

663
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,570
Then we have to keep an eye on him all the way.

664
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,340
My head is going to become green.

665
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,990
It depends...

666
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,430
depends on moods.

667
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,870
Moods? Whose moods?

668
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,670
Don't ask so much.

669
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,910
Your task

670
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,350
is to accumulate Fame Value.

671
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,670
You still have a long way to go.

672
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,200
How can I accumulate Fame Value?

673
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,110
How can I buy it?

674
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,350
Open the treasure box! It will give you hope

675
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,940
and allow you to have a successful life.

676
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,490
A variety of props can assist you

Join the draw as a newcomer

679

and you'll get the reward tripled.

680
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,690
Yes. You heard right.

681
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,210

Alright, stop it.

685
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,350
I'll join.

Why did my Fame Value decrease

689
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,070
after I joined the draw?

690
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,790
I told you

everything in this game

692
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,650
has something to do with Fame Value.

693
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,250
You have to buy a rope

699
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,590
They're the same principles.

700
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:47,540
Anyway,

701
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,440
you need to consume moderately

702
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,250
and invest rationally.

703
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,310
No pain, no gain.

704
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,190
How do I use the Return Sugar?

705
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,430
More game skills

706
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,420
are waiting to be unlocked

707
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,150
while you're playing.

708
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,390
I won't disturb you today.

709
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,140
See you later.

710
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,310
Wait, don't go.

711
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,520
How... how can I see you again?

712
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,110
How can I see you again?

713
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,950
Game world?
