[Episode 21]

4
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,670
I think Dream of the Red Chamber

5
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,570
has many illogical

6
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,660
and contradictory points

7
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,420
because

8
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,660
the last 40 chapters of it

9
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,060
were not written by Cao Xueqin.

10
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,210
If Cao Xueqin didn't write it,

11
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,680
who did?

12
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,670
How could he say that?

13
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,110
No one has ever

14
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,350
proposed this theory before.

15
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,970
Where did you get the evidence?

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,470
Yes, what's the evidence?

17
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,320
You should have realized

18
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,230
the first 80 chapters

19
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,120
and the last 40 chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber

20
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,590
are seriously inconsistent

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,560
in terms of artistry and ideology.

22
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,150
To be frank,

23
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,610
the last 40 chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber

24
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,079
are roughly written,

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,540
and the plot is a mess.

26
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,510
It can only get 50 points at most.

27
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,260
Even if Cao Xueqin had been seriously ill at a late age,

28
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,060
he wouldn't have such a huge change

29
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,250
in his literary style.

30
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,940
So I'm sure

31
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,530
Dream of the Red Chamber was written by someone else.

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,170
The most likely one is Gao E.

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,070
That's an interesting point.

34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,940
In fact, Dream of the Red Chamber

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,920
is a signed book.

36
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,450
On each page of the Jiaxu Version,

37
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,770
The Story of the Stone was signed

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,310
with the name Zhiyanzhai.

39
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,940
It re-evaluated the ancient version of The Story of the Stone,

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,960
which was the most suitable for Cao Xueqin's thoughts.

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,350
And he only commented 80 chapters.

42
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,730
Besides,

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,620
in Zhang Wentao's poem

44
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,700
To Gao Lanshu (Gao E) of the Same Year,

45
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,390
he mentioned that

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
after 80 chapters

47
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,800
of the legendary Dream of the Red Chamber

48
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,420
were "recovered" by Lanshu.

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,650
Lanshu

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,930
was the art name of Gao E.

51
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,500
Guys,

52
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,890
think about it.

53
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,420
If Cao Xueqin hadn't written

54
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,190
the last 40 chapters of Dream of the Red Chamber,

55
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,300
what new situation would we face

56
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,530
when studying Dream of the Red Chamber?

57
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,060
So, all the major flaws and logical problems

58
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,250
that we could not understand and explain

59
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,780
in the past are solved,

60
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,060
right?

61
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,440
Yes.

62
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,140
Yes.

63
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,860
That makes sense.

64
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,730
Excuse me,

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,160
are you a student of our school?

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,579
This is the famous host,

67
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,250
planner, composer,

68
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,730
arranger, scriptwriter,

69
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,180
and the discoverer of the Terracotta Army,

70
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,530
Zhang Ye.

71
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,500
Clap up, guys.

72
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,260
Everyone, actually

73
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,140
I have a lecture

74
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,420
next door.

75
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,860
It's about the discovery process of the Terracotta Army

76
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,050
and the achievements of Qin Shi Huang Ying Zheng

77
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,420
in unifying the six states.

78
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,170
If you are interested,

79
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,450
come to my place

80
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,860
after class.

81
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,940
Sorry, Ms.

82
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
Sorry to interrupt.

83
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,610
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,170
Sorry.

85
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,170
Why does he have so many titles?

86
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,930
Go over there after class.

87
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,019
I'm quite interested.

88
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,760
Let's go together.

89
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,030
Where are my two ancient books?

90
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,030
Why can't I find them?

91
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,370
Are you sure they're there?

92
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,740
Yes.

93
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,370
I know all the books here.

94
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,770
Where are they?

95
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,980
I remember they were here.

96
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,700
How come it's

97
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,740
One Hundred Thousand Whys?

98
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,490
I'll take a call.

99
00:04:59,490 --> 00:04:59,700
Okay.

100
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,300
Hello?

101
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,860
Hello.

102
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,330
Are you coming back today?

103
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,060
No.

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,930
I'll stay here

105
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,530
to talk with my dad.

106
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,890
OK.

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,180
I'm just curious.

108
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,250
All right.

109
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,630
No. I suppose it's more than that.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,570
You must care about me.

111
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,050
Fine.

112
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,770
In the future,

113
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,490
I'll report to you

114
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,970
if there is anything.

115
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,860
Whatever.

116
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,320
My eyes are messed up.

117
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,770
Help me look for them.

118
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,020
Dad, they must be here.

119
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,530
Hello.

120
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,980
Are you Zhang Ye?

121
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,170
I'm Wu Zeqing.

122
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,780
Can we meet?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,020
I want to ask you some questions in person.

124
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,420
You want to meet me?

125
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,370
Yes.

126
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,530
Okay.

127
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,530
Alright.

128
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,940
I'll send you the address later.

129
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,520
Okay.

130
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,020
What now?

131
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,420
I'm going out

132
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,650
later

133
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,930
with a professor from D University.

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
She wants to ask me

135
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
some literary questions.

136
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,650
A professor from D University wants to ask for your help?

137
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,730
Yes.

138
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,180
I went to

139
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,330
their academic exchange today,

140
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,540
and I gave them some advice.

141
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,330
It won't take long.

142
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,420
I'll be back soon.

143
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,910
Okay.

144
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,000
You don't have to report to me.

145
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,490
I have to tell you,

146
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,800
because the professor

147
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,850
is a woman.

148
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,250
A woman? Is she pretty?

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,930
Think about it.

150
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,170
She's at the professor level,

151
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,770
right?

152
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,730
So she must be 40 or 50 years old.

153
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,180
Besides, she is a researcher,

154
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,930
so her looks

155
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,230
can only be described as not scary.

156
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,100
Come on.

157
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,370
You're exaggerating.

158
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,080
Okay, go ahead.

159
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,810
Rest early.

160
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,580
-Thank you.
-Mr. Zhang.

161
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,770
Mr. Wu has become a professor

162
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,700
at such a young age.

163
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,140
You must be

164
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,860
extraordinary.

165
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,100
Mr. Zhang, you are young and promising too

166
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,700
and have done

167
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,680
so many amazing things.

168
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,980
I checked,

169
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,520
your literary achievements

170
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,490
are quite extraordinary.

171
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,520
I'd like to ride the wind to fly home.

172
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,020
Yet I fear the crystal and jade mansions

173
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
are much too high and cold for me.

174
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,780
What wonderful sentences.

175
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,690
And those fables.

176
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,750
They are clever and simple.

177
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,059
At first, I thought

178
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,860
they're bedtime stories for children.

179
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,130
But thinking deeply, I found it had an extremely profound meaning.

180
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,180
I didn't write

181
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,690
those fables.

182
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,060
According to legends,

183
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,920
it should be a collection of fables

184
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,260
written by Aesop,

185
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,980
released in the ancient Greece

186
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,380
in the sixth century B.C.

187
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,500
I just

188
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,140
collected and sorted them out.

189
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,640
I've heard of Aesop's Fables,

190
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,450
but it's not as much as you said.

191
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,010
The original name should be called

192
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,320
Collection of Aesop's Fables.

193
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,900
There are over 300 stories.

194
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,410
The time span of the story is very long.

195
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,130
And what each story wants to express

196
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,380
is completely different.

197
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,690
It can be concluded that

198
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,130
it's not written by one person.

199
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,420
How should I put it?

200
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,510
It should be considered

201
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,740
a group creation of the ancient Greeks

202
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,500
for a long time.

203
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
Although human civilization is great,

204
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,000
compared

205
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,590
with the river of time,

206
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,740
it's like a drop in the ocean.

207
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,880
It's easy to be buried.

208
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,360
What an eye-opener.

209
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,250
By the way, Mr. Zhang,

210
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,940
the two ancient books you talked about

211
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,310
in the public class last time.

212
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,560
I went to the library

213
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,660
and went through all the catalogs,

214
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,450
but I still couldn't find them.

215
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,130
Can you tell me

216
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,820
where you saw them?

217
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,130
Is that important?

218
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,200
Of course.

219
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,130
This will overthrow all our research

220
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,690
on Dream of the Red Chamber.

221
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,820
I...

222
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,930
I need to go to the bathroom.

223
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,610
Come out.

224
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,570
Welcome, premium gamers.

225
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,340
It's on sale today. Draw three get one free.

226
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,540
Come and try your luck.

227
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,780
Don't make me draw a lottery.

228
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,740
Those drawings before

229
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,330
were useless.

230
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,770
Let me ask you.

231
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,980
Are there any items

232
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,990
that can bring something from the real world

233
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,630
into the game world?

234
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,840
This is not easy to handle.

235
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,710
How can things

236
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,130
in the gaming world be connected

237
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,650
with things in reality?

238
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,330
You're right.

239
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,510
If I could bring them all,

240
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,570
those treasure chests I found

241
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,010
would be meaningless.

242
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,300
Let me ask you something.

243
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,650
Help me think of a way.

244
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,940
I once read

245
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,380
two books in the real world.

246
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,180
Two very important books.

247
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,670
How can I

248
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,480
find them

249
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,690
in this game world?

250
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,380
Well,

251
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,090
actually, props can realize it.

252
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,770
3D Idea Printer.

253
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,330
Idea printing?

254
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,690
Just focus on the object

255
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,890
in your mind

256
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,740
and then use the printer,

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,250
so you can print it out.

258
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,010
But living things can't be printed.

259
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,550
Okay.

260
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,490
Wonderful. Just what I want.

261
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,200
But let me remind you.

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Using this prop

263
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,420
will greatly consume

264
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,550
your brain and stamina.

265
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,940
You may not be able to

266
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,500
hold up in the process.

267
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,450
So I suggest you

268
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,330
use the Confidence Potion together.

269
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,500
Stop lying to me.

270
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,670
I trust my own brain more.

271
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,980
So expensive.

272
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,040
No bargaining is allowed for the specified prop.

273
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,260
Okay, I'll buy it.

274
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,890
By the way,

275
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,260
a prop

276
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,300
can only print one item.

277
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,860
If it's two books,

278
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,300
you'll need two props.

279
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,120
You're so crafty.

280
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,590
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

281
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,540
I'll buy two.

282
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,150
What are you doing?

283
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,530
Leave me alone.

284
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,450
You are

285
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,690
intervening in the experimental process.

286
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,760
If not,

287
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,360
the experiment will continue

288
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,050
endlessly.

289
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,690
Don't you want to go home early?

290
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,830
Stand still. Watch me.

291
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,900
Professor Wu.

292
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,200
These are the ancient books you want.

293
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,100
Mr. Zhang, what's wrong with you?

294
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,060
Mr. Zhang.

295
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,120
Come here.

296
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,820
You asked me to come.

297
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,210
Here I come.

298
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,300
Why does my face hurt so much?

299
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,340
Is it an allergy?

300
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,040
[The Story of the Stone]

301
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,760
[To Gao Lanshu (Gao E) of the Same Year]

302
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,060
Song of the Burial of Flowers.

303
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,130
You look pale

304
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,340
and you are black and blue.

305
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,920
Are you allergic to something you ate?

306
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,410
You should know

307
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,960
if I want to kill you,

308
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,370
it's easier

309
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,030
than killing an ant.

310
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,890
Cut the crap.

311
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,290
If it were so simple,

312
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:06,740
you wouldn't have to

313
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,089
set me up at every turn.

314
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,810
Let me ask you.

315
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,540
Why did I come

316
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,260
to the game world?

317
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,569
What is your purpose?

318
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,020
None of your business.

319
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,619
What is the victory fruit

320
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,740
of this game?

321
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,300
Is it just fame?

322
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,900
Why is everything

323
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,040
linked to fame?

324
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,740
Why did you give me

325
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,140
the Confidence Potion?

326
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,320
That's obviously

327
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,120
a mental drug.

328
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,430
I got it.

329
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,540
You want me

330
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,450
to mess up in the game,

331
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,900
right?

332
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,660
No comment.

333
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,090
Fine. You won't tell me, will you?

334
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,370
Okay.

335
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,940
I'll go

336
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,070
to end this game.

337
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,490
Okay, let me tell you.

338
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,090
I've told you

339
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,970
the result of the game.

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,970
Think about it.

341
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,370
My game is over.

342
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,510
Do I need to care about the consequences?

343
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,660
Come back.

344
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,780
Calm down.

345
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,090
Calm down.

346
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,090
What?

347
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,500
Are you scared?

348
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,980
You don't want me to die.

349
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,020
That's why I'm curious.

350
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,960
If this is really a game,

351
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,930
there should be all sorts

352
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,040
of organs and traps

353
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
that can kill me,

354
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,140
but I can't see any of them.

355
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,170
And you don't want me

356
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,210
to end

357
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,860
this game.

358
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,600
You seem to be waiting for something,

359
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,720
and you've been observing me.

360
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,380
Today,

361
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,780
you must tell me the truth.

362
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,420
Fine. You won't tell me, right?

363
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,540
I'll find a high place

364
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,310
and jump down.

365
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,020
Okay. Okay.

366
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,140
What I'm going to say next

367
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,090
may be beyond

368
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,140
human understanding.

369
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,350
In fact, we are

370
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,000
the creators of humanity.

371
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,800
You guys...

372
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,860
made humans.

373
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,170
It may be more suitable

374
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,500
to say that we are the dispersers of life.

375
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,140
We travel through

376
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,100
the vastness of the universe.

377
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,860
Let them grow freely

378
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,210
and grow into various intelligent creatures.

379
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,380
We'll choose the best one

380
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,800
to inherit our planet's

381
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,900
most advanced

382
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,620
and mysterious civilization.

383
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,140
The same goes for your earth.

384
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,620
As a patrol,

385
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm traveling around planets

386
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,540
to collect data

387
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,470
and ensure the evolution goes smoothly.

388
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,170
So,

389
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,370
I'm your test subject.

390
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,050
Do you have any other

391
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,730
test subjects?

392
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,500
Our experimental equipment

393
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,330
malfunctioned beyond repair,

394
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,970
so...

395
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,690
You are our only

396
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,260
test subject.

397
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,020
If you choose to commit suicide,

398
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,050
the game will start again.

399
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,210
There is no end to it.

400
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,090
When the experiment begins,

401
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,500
our spaceship

402
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,620
has automatically locked

403
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,410
the coordinates of the earth.

404
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,620
If the test doesn't end

405
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,160
as programmed,

406
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,810
we'll be trapped here too.

407
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,260
So...

408
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,930
Forget it.

409
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,290
When the game starts,

410
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,500
everything can only be done

411
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,650
according to the set procedures.

412
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,050
What about the test result?

413
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,620
What if the result is bad?

414
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,860
If that's the case,

415
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,900
you'll lose the inheritance.

416
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,020
It won't affect you personally.

417
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,740
But if it's good,

418
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,690
you will be rewarded.

419
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:21,780
A kind of superpower.

420
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,330
In human history,

421
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,330
many people

422
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,140
have had great knowledge and achievements.

423
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,340
They were all people

424
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,640
whose brains had been kissed by us.

425
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,810
Then I will

426
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,260
become a great person?

427
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,380
Think about it.

428
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,500
Whether you want to go on

429
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,620
this game or not?

430
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,210
This game

431
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,380
can go on as well.

432
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,330
But

433
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,660
as the only test object

434
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,860
for this game,

435
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,300
I'm warning you.

436
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,550
I have to make three rules with you.

437
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,250
You can't tempt me anymore.

438
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,930
And this is my game,

439
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,900
so I am the boss.

440
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,780
Okay.

441
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,210
Good luck.

442
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,690
How much is

443
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,860
the most expensive ring in your shop?

444
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,450
If it's three carats, it's over one million.

445
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,140
Well, it doesn't have to be that expensive

446
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,290
It's the thought that counts.

447
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,470
Thank you.

448
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,640
Hello.

449
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,350
Move these to our room.

450
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,040
Let me do it.

451
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,120
Dad, we're here.

452
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,450
This way.

453
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:51,710
Okay.

454
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,260
Let's go.

455
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,790
It's huge.

456
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:07,900
How are you?

457
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,620
I'm fine.

458
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,330
Thank you.

459
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,050
And you?

460
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,840
I'm good.

461
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,480
This way, please.

462
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,980
Okay.

463
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,900
Let's go.

464
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,860
Let's go.

465
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,740
Why are they laughing at us?

466
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,560
Maybe our clothes

467
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,660
are too casual.

468
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,570
Be confident.

469
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,410
Auntie, hurry up.

470
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,660
I'm starving.

471
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,720
It's almost done.

472
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,930
Zhang Ye.

473
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,710
What a stupid hotel

474
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,700
you chose.

475
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,000
Didn't we agree

476
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,000
to a warm sunny beach?

477
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,030
You know nothing.

478
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,760
Look how well it's decorated.

479
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,680
Do you know how expensive this hotel is?

480
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,650
Without some connections,

481
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,690
you can hardly book it.

482
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,670
No matter how delicious the food is, I'm not used to it.

483
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,210
Zhang Ye,

484
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,350
where did you get so much spare money

485
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,690
to waste?

486
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,690
It's the royalty of Aesop's Fables.

487
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,020
You copied it again?

488
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,090
No.

489
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,010
I just compiled them.

490
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,320
The title page says it clearly.

491
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,200
Let me tell you something serious.

492
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,110
Today, I plan to

493
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,050
propose to your Auntie.

494
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,630
Proposal?

495
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,210
Keep your voice down.

496
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,500
Honey,

497
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,970
how to arrange the rooms tonight?

498
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,270
Nice legs.

499
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,620
Am I in the same room with Chenchen?

500
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,170
Don't worry about that.

501
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,910
The pretty lady,

502
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,600
can I invite you to go down

503
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,930
for a walk?

504
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,900
Sir, could you please

505
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,810
get changed first?

506
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,830
You're so old-fashioned,

507
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,530
you don't deserve me.

508
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,860
What did you say?

509
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,960
What did you guys say about me?

510
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,980
I don't know.

511
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,540
It costs so much money.

512
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,500
Why do they want to see the sea here?

513
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,050
This is no different from the sea

514
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,490
in front of our community?

515
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,490
Of course, it's different.

516
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,240
It's seen from the window.

517
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,380
And the window is a French window.

518
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,930
It's suffocating.

519
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,990
It's killing me.

520
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,610
There's blood. How can I eat it?

521
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:06,970
It's delicious.

522
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,710
I want lamb skewers.

523
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,340
Have skewers?

524
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,780
Is it edible?

525
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:27,780
Yes.

526
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,540
I'm suffocating. Let's go.

527
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,070
Look, someone is here.

528
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,860
What are they doing?

529
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,740
What are they doing?

530
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,050
Let me see. Hurry up.

531
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,860
So many people are playing mahjong.

532
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,550
Hello, madam.

533
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,500
Do you want to join

534
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,400
our Mahjong Tournament?

535
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,570
Mahjong Tournament?

536
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,200
Yes.

537
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,280
Our prize is a jade ring.

538
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,620
Is that the reward?

539
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes.

540
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,130
Old man,

541
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,460
you can go back now.

542
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,650
How can I get in?

543
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,620
Follow me.

544
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,860
Okay.

545
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,690
I...

546
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,140
Go back.

547
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,350
I can't find the way back by myself.

548
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,090
Dad.

549
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,020
I finally found you.

550
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,780
I finally found you.

551
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,190
What are you doing here?

552
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,770
You're sneaky, like digging a mine.

553
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,750
This hotel is like a maze.

554
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,510
I've been wandering around here

555
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,900
for half an hour.

556
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,610
Where is mom?

557
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,460
She went to play mahjong.

558
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
Go check on her later.

559
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,140
Hurry up and get me back

560
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,120
to my room now.

561
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,330
I need to get changed.

562
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,740
You don't need to change. Hurry up.

563
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,340
Walk straight.

564
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,480
Turn right

565
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,740
at the window in front of you

566
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,090

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,690

Maybe the next champion

589
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,980
will be you.

590
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,890
It will be you.

591
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,630
Self-drawn. Mahjong again.

592
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,270
All in One Suit!

593
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,140
Mahjong! I made it!

594
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,850
I'm advancing to the next round.

595
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,150
Referee! Referee! Look!

596
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,090
Mom!

597
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,400
Son, I've made it.

598
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,090
All in One Suit.

599
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,170
I won't talk to you,

600
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,170
I'll continue.

601
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,930
I have to go.

602
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,620
Do your best, mom.

603
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,210
I'm leaving with him.

604
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,380
Let's get right into it.

605
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,490
Nice to meet you.

606
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,170
Nice to meet you.

607
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,160
Lady first.

608
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,260
Three of Bamboos.

609
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:47,780
Pong.

610
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,450
Discard.

611
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,740
Three of Circles.

612
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,410
Pong.

613
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,900
How come you got Pong again?

614
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,420
Sorry, I'm lucky.

615
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,520
Mahjong!

616
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,010
♫Look at the bright fireworks in the sky♫

617

Bro.

647
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:20,810
Bro.

648
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,410
What are you doing?

649
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,480
I'm working out.

650
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,740
Stop.

651
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Mom got bullied.

652
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,630
She got bullied.

653
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,250
Let's go.

654
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,210
Wait for me in the room.

655
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,210
The ring.

656
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,090
Mom has been losing

657
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,870
since she sat there.

658
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,930
Three of Circles.

659
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:53,990
Chow.

660
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,540
Something's wrong.

661
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,510
Look.

662
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,350
I know the three of them

663
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,250
are in cahoots.

664
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,260
Look at that guy.

665
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,950
He touches his forehead which means he needs Circles.

666
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,090
Touching the nose means he wants Bamboos.

667
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,680
Little Chick.

668
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,090
Pong!

669
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,860
Touching the bottom of his mouth means

670
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,510
he wants Characters.

671
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,070
Five of Characters.

672
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,560
Pong!

673
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,570
Look.

674
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,760
He can get whatever he wants.

675
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,790
He touched his head.

676
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,020
Touching the back of the head

677
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,410
may mean he wants Honors.

678
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,780
Hurry up.

679
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,860
North Wind.

680
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,330
Pong!

681
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,000
How come you can always get Pong?

682
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,130
I'm sorry. I'm lucky.

683
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,240
Bro, they're cheating.

684
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,520
He may win by Two of Circles.

685
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,600
Two of Circles.

686
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,130
Mahjong!

687
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,370
Mahjong?

688
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,720
Mahjong.

689
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,060
Let me see. Show your tiles.

690
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,290
See!

691
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,280
Old madam, this kind of game

692
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,100
is not suitable for the elderly at all.

693
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,060
What if

694
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,810
you get a heart attack?

695
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,780
Who's the old lady?

696
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,420
Don't be angry.

697
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,400
There are guards and referees here.

698
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,110
No one is in charge of it?

699
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,320
Shut up.

700
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,740
Sir.

701
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,820
What did you do?

702
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,200
You touched the beard and the nose.

703
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,740
Who are you?

704
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,010
You want to beat me after losing?

705
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
So you can't afford to lose?

706
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,130
Of course not.

707
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,580
But you colluded to cheat.

708
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,010
You're cheating!

709
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:32,580
What?

710
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,150
Cheating?

711
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,320
Don't talk nonsense.

712
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,720
Mom, let's go. Let's stop playing.

713
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,700
You look like a bad guy.

714
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,610
Look at you.

715
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,210
You cheated, such a bad guy.

716
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,810
Nonsense.

717
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,520
You're not good at Mahjong.

718
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,520
I won in the beginning.

719
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,590
I was lucky.

720
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,590
But I don't know

721
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,610
why I can't win later.

722
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,360
Listen.

723
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,170
This...

724
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,620
Table 34 cheated.

725
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,910
I want to file a complaint.

726
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,280
Complaints?

727
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,110
Fine.

728
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,290
I won't waste time with you.

729
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,980
They are from the organizing committee.

730
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,430
You can complain to them.

731
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,890
I did find out

732
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,590
you three

733
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,030
can't afford to lose.

734
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:05,890
Let's go.

735
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,810
That's bull.

736
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,680
Come back!

737
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,080
This...

738
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,500
That's going too far.

739
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,340
Fine.

740
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,120
Don't be angry.

741
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:20,960
This is the prize, right?

742
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,659
I entered the competition

743
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,960
for that.

744
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,030
It looks valuable.

745
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,850
You said I couldn't afford to lose.

746
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,020
Fine.

747
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,010
Chenchen.

748
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,820
Why are you eating instant noodles?

749
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,050
It's not easy for us to have a trip.

750
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,050
Have some salad and bread.

751
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,090
Come on. Let me try this.

752
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,940
Don't take my noodles.

753
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,070
Don't you have food?

754
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,100
Eat your own food.

755
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,910
Try the baguette.

756
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,290
It's delicious when you chewed it.

757
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,680
It's crunchy.

758
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,890
Only here. Please.

759
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,200
It is too hard.

760
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,100
You're so forgetful.

761
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,620
Can you compete just because you can play mahjong?

762
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,690
Have you forgotten about Chandler?

763
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,690
Didn't we win that time?

764
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,350
Shut up.

765
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,480
It was lucky last time.

766
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,120
Don't worry.

767
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,980
I know what to do.

768
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,020
It's okay.

769
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:35,880
Son,

770
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,160
I'll teach you how to play mahjong.

771
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,530
Forget it.

772
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,680
You've caused them a lot of trouble.

773
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,280
What are you doing? Why are you laughing?

774
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,820
Those three who played mahjong with me

775
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,360
were foreigners.

776
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,250
Maybe they cheated.

777
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,130
There must be something wrong with them.

778
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
Otherwise, I could definitely win.

779
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,160
Come on. I could win.

780
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,810
He deserves to get his teeth kicked in.

781
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,780
He's just looking for trouble.

782
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,170
What?

783
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,610
If it weren't for...

784
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,100
What?

785
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,210
Well...

786
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,750
Zhang Ye,

787
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,940
are you thinking about

788
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,480
the jade ring?

789
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,340
The fish basin

790
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,310
is the treasure of our country.

791
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,130
Stop eating noodles.

792
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,030
Give it to me. Have some soup.

793
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,540
Have some soup.

794
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,590
Have some soup.

795
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,980
What does that mean?

796
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,660
-No.
-What do you mean?

797
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,410
You can't buy ten.

798
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,150
How about five?

799
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,410
No way.

800
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,680
I'll buy one, okay?

801
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,300
The Lucky Sticker

802
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,250
can only be bought one at a time.

803
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,740
Who changed the rule?

804
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,850
Did you change it?

805
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,780
Are you playing with me on purpose?

806
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,020
[Lucky Sticker]

807
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,950
I'll draw the Lucky Sticker this time.

808
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,400
What is he doing?

809
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,760
I don't know.

810
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,610
I've never seen him do that before.

811
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,870
A Lucky Sticker! A Lucky Sticker!

812
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,450
Great!

813
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,130
Again.

814
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,020
Is that appropriate?

815
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,350
I don't know.

816
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,050
I've never met before.

817
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,500
You are a little young to play

818
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,020
with Earthlings.

819
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,020
Come on.

820
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,210
Seven of Circles.

821
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,700
Mahjong!

822
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,140
West Wind.

823
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,740
Mahjong.

824
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,330
Why did you win again?

825
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,070
Mahjong.

826
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,210
Two of Bamboos.

827
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:10,740
Mahjong!

828
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,250
Six of Bamboos.

829
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:23,920
Chow.

830
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,210
One of Circle.

831
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,190
Nine of Circles.

832
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,700
Pong. Two of Characters.

833
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:29,950
Four of Characters.

834
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,490
Mahjong.

835
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:31,860
He won again.

836
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,550
Referee.

837
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,420
Table 8. Zhang Ye advances to the next round.

838
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,780
I'm advancing to the next round.

839
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,530
I won!

840
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,290
I won!

841
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,210
Wait, please.

842
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,330
Only contestants can enter,

843
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,630
no one else is allowed to get in.

844
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,710
What should we do?

845
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,010
Do your best.

846
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:39,570
Come on.

847
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,100
Come on.

848
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,700
One, two...

849
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,800
Please be quiet.

850
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:44,780
Go for it!

851
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,560
Go! Go! Go!

852
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,590
Mr. Zhang, who arrived late,

853
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,940
is really amazing.

854
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,350
He went through several rounds

855
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,710
and finally reached the semifinal.

856
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,080
The winner of this round

857
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,720
will compete with

858
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,890
the winners of the other three rounds

859
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,580
for the champion.

860
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,210
Yes.

861
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,350
Of course,

862
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,250
the next

863
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,090
competition

864
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,640
will get tougher and tougher.

865
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,590
If we find

866
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,120
any cheating behavior,

867
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,830
we will punish him severely.

868
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,100
It's strict.

869
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,840
Yes.

870
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,950
So, in the next

871
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,750
competition,

872
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,920
I hope you

873
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,010
show your best performance.

874
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,120
