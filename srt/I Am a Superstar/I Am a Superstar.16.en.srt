[Episode 16]

4
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,539
Zhang Yuanqi.

5
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,110
Why do you look down on me?

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,870
You always say

7
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,910
you understand me, but do you?

8
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:52,080
You're pretending it.

9
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,000
If I hadn't written those songs for you,

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,320
would you be so popular now?

11
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,759
To be frank,

12
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,190
we're just using each other.

13
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,400
Selling the song to you

14
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,750
is no different

15
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,590
from selling poems to a coal boss.

16
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,580
Zhang Ye,

17
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,830
do you know what you're talking about?

18
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,480
At this point,

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,760
can't you tell

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,920
who is good and who is bad to you?

21
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,790
Who's good to me?

22
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:16,950
You?

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,480
Are you good to me?

24
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,480
Have you ever been good to me?

25
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,550
Have you ever thought highly of me?

26
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,200
I can't stand

27
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,070
being despised

28
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,990
and slighted.

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,920
I've ended up where I am now.

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,060
Why can't you

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,070
be a bit gentle to me?

32
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,190
Why can't you praise me?

33
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,960
Why can't you

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,150
show some respect to me?

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,750
So you asked Tian Bin

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,400
to sell the poem that was written to me?

37
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,400
He begged me.

38
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,350
He bowed to me and called me Mr. Zhang Ye.

39
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,350
I knew Tian Bin was trying to rip me off.

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,450
But I don't care.

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,480
With my ability,

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,430
I can make as much money as I want.

43
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,480
Zhang Ye.

44
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,430
When you regret later...

45
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,350
Do you know

46
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,510
what my life was like before?

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,280
Let me tell you.

48
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,170
I don't regret.

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,670
Go.

50
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,440
Go.

51
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,830
Life

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,630
can't be as good

53
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,140
as you imagine,

54
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,420
but also not as bad

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,060
as you imagine.

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,400
Sometimes,

57
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,700
a fragile word

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,310
can make you cry.

59
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,220
Sometimes I find

60
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,400
I've been striving to move forward for a long time.

61
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,280
This is a brave petrel

62
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,120
proudly flying

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,230
over the ocean

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,470
in the middle of lightning.

65
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,400
This is a successful prophet

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,280
shouting

67
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,020
"let it

68
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,960
break in all its fury"!

69
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,400
Bro.

70
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,160
I feel like

71
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,070
you've changed a bit lately.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,510
Why?

73
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,950
Even you started disliking me?

74
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,500
I... I'm just curious.

75
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,070
Why you stopped writing songs?

76
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,440
My songs are a dime a dozen now.

77
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,070
Who would listen to my songs?

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,020
Me.

79
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,230
Even if the whole world is against you,

80
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll still be on your side, bro.

81
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,350
Good brother.

82
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,840
Good brother.

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,630
Okay.

84
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,830
What makes you so happy?

85
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,720
Shishi texted me.

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
The girl you had dinner with last time?

87
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,340
Yes.

88
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,960
The girl I had dinner with last time.

89
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,470
I forget what she likes to eat.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,870
Do you think we should go for spicy numbing stir-fry pot

91
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,790
or hot pot?

92
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,780
If she doesn't like spicy food,

93
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,270
is it okay

94
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,340
if I order something slightly spicy?

95
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,250
Stop.

96
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,230
Are you going to treat her to this?

97
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,409
It's a date with a person,

98
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,600
not food.

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,070
It's your first time taking a girl out for dinner.

100
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
At least you should find a place

101
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,790
with good vibes.

102
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,470
Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald.

103
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,100
What do you think?

104
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,520
Can it be more classier?

105
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,190
I've only tried these two restaurants.

106
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,630
I don't know about other places.

107
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,310
Okay, leave it to me.

108
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,280
I'll book it for you.

109
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,220
I don't want to bother you, bro.

110
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,500
Why?

111
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,590
You call me brother.

112
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,910
I'll be your brother forever.

113
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,130
It's done.

114
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,310
Hello, sir. Please come in.

115
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,190
Take it.

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,350
Take it.

117
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:03,670
Bro.

118
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,230
Your eyes.

119
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,530
Look at me.

120
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,550
This is for you.

121
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,540
LX's limited edition bag.

122
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,060
It must be expensive, bro.

123
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,850
I can't take it.

124
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
They asked me to endorse them.

125
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,660
It's free.

126
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,600
It's a gift.

127
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,280
Girls

128
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,600
like this.

129
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,150
Well, I should thank you on behalf of Shishi.

130
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,630
Take it.

131
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,470
Can you be more confident?

132
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,070
And the wine.

133
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,720
It's also endorsed by me.

134
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,040
Drink as much as you want.

135
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,630
All of them?

136
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,910
Be debonair.

137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,670
Not this one.

138
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,280
This makes you look like a pupil.

139
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,840
This way, please.

140
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,400
Thank you.

141
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,870
By the way,

142
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,210
this is a gift for you.

143
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,840
It's a limited edition.

144
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,160
My brother helped me choose this one.

145
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,990
He said you would like it.

146
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,550
Thank you.

147
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,550
Your brother has good taste.

148
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,910
You must have waited for a long time.

149
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,030
I came here yesterday.

150
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,550
It's my first time dining at a western restaurant.

151
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,860
I didn't want to embarrass myself,

152
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,840
so I came here for a rehearsal.

153
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,390
But it seems

154
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm still not used to it.

155
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,190
You should have told me earlier.

156
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,310
If you're not used to it,

157
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,330
we could go to another one.

158
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,300
I'm familiar

159
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,080
with it now.

160
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,280
And my brother said

161
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,630
it's the first time I invited you out,

162
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,480
it shows I'm taking it seriously

163
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,980
to choose a western restaurant.

164
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,360
Sir, would you like to try the wine?

165
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:05,960
Sure.

166
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,480
Thank you.

167
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,990
Your brother is quite popular now.

168
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,480
Of course.

169
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,280
Everyone knows him.

170
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,280
Thank you.

171
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,060
My brother endorses this wine.

172
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,070
Drink as much as you want.

173
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,280
OK. To your brother.

174
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,800
Mom, your braised pork is delicious.

175
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,800
It's fat but not greasy.

176
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,280
When will you teach me

177
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,030
how to cook?

178
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,630
My skills

179
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,020
can only be passed on to my daughter-in-law.

180
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,280
That's ridiculous.

181
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,430
Do you singers

182
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,830
make a lot of money?

183
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,800
No, I think this industry is too complicated.

184
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,400
I can't do it.

185
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,110
I plan to work behind the scenes.

186
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,040
Did your brother

187
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,720
arrange all these tonight?

188
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,240
Yes, he has arranged everything.

189
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,830
I wanna have some sunflower kernels.

190
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,960
Try some popcorn.

191
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,450
What time is it?

192
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,990
It's so late.

193
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,700
Shouldn't you go home?

194
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:00,960
Let me send you home.

195
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:03,960
Go home?

196
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,350
See, it's a waste here.

197
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm gonna take a shower before going back.

198
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,150
Go ahead.

199
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,620
My brother has already paid for it.

200
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,600
Lock the door after you finish.

201
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,870
Tell me your brother's phone number.

202
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,910
I want to thank him personally.

203
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,960
Why stand on ceremony?

204
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,630
Okay, I'll send you his number

205
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,670
on WeChat.

206
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,070
I have to go.

207
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,280
What is Zhang Hua doing?

208
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,860
He hasn't come home yet.

209
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:39,870
It'll be good

210
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,670
if he doesn't come back the whole night.

211
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
Something happened to him?

212
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,340
He's an adult.

213
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,500
What could happen to him?

214
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,870
If he can become famous overnight,

215
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,940
he can also become an adult overnight.

216
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,720
I was just thinking about having something to eat.

217
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,710
I'm starving.

218
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,360
Why are you back?

219
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,370
Why are you back so early?

220
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,720
Didn't you understand

221
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,960
why I sent you to a hotel?

222
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,860
I knew.

223
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,960
You wanted us to be on a same bed.

224
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,610
We did it.

225
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,770
You did?

226
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,070
The room is really big.

227
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,060
The bed is also very great.

228
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,430
We chatted on bed,

229
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,670
eating sunflower kernels.

230
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,100
The TV is also very big.

231
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,480
We watched

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,800
a very funny comedy.

233
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,160
I also think I did a great job today.

234
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,580
Before I went out for the date today,

235
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,360
I was very nervous.

236
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,550
I hoped nothing would happen.

237
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,310
It turned out

238
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,110
nothing happened.

239
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,740
I'm really confident

240
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,190
in myself now.

241
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,670
Very confident, bro.

242
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,040
You're really good.

243
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,990
I think so too, bro.

244
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,480
Go get some food.

245
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,190
I'm downstairs.

246
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,690
Is the car here?

247
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,430
Okay.

248
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,590
Who do you want to speak to?

249
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:30,920
Hello?

250
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,240
I...

251
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,710
Who is calling?

252
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,100
I'm Shishi.

253
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,300
How did you get my phone number?

254
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,600
What's wrong?

255
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,030
Thank you for your arrangement today.

256
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,800
I want to thank you in person.

257
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,900
No worries.

258
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,720
I really appreciate it.

259
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,540
I'm at Fuhua Hotel.

260
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,960
Come over.

261
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,600
Okay.

262
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,150
You came so fast.

263
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,000
Aren't you going to tell me something?

264
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,520
Go ahead.

265
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,240
Take a seat.

266
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,790
Zhang Hua

267
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,030
kept talking about you

268
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,990
this afternoon.

269
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,550
He's good in every aspect,

270
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,430
but just too naive.

271
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,550
That's why

272
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,350
he gets easily deceived.

273
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,000
So his songs

274
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,670
are very straightforward.

275
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,190
But your songs

276
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,110
are totally different.

277
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,590
What's different?

278
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,000
Your songs are full of vicissitudes of life.

279
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,480
There are plenty of stories.

280
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,360
I do have plenty of stories.

281
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,150
When will you tell me about those stories?

282
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,520
When you want to hear them.

283
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,480
I think

284
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,190
I admire his brother's talent

285
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,750
and charm much more

286
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,760
than his innocence.

287
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,960
What talent and charm?

288
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,060
My reputation is so bad now.

289
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:50,990
Don't you mind?

290
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,600
I don't mind.

291
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,240
I think it's your ability

292
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,910
to make yourself well known.

293
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,910
You're my brother's girlfriend.

294
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,860
To be honest,

295
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,720
I didn't think

296
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,230
it was appropriate

297
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,670
for you to ask me over today.

298
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,420
It's even worse

299
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,270
for you to do this now.

300
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,390
It's a new time.

301
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,070
What's wrong with that?

302
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,000
If you don't like him,

303
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you should tell him.

304
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,270
If he's not stupid,

305
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,480
he can tell himself.

306
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,310
Alright.

307
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,390
Let's not talk about him.

308
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,480
Let's talk about us.

309
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,640
You really like me?

310
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,120
Let me tell you.

311
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,910
I don't like

312
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,910
taking responsibility.

313
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,480
I'm asking for it.

314
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,520
I don't need you to take responsibility.

315
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,720
I just like you.

316
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,960
Go take a shower.

317
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,350
I've already taken one.

318
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,390
Just do it again.

319
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,640
OK. Wait for me.

320
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,000
Zhang Hua.

321
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,150
You heard everything Shishi said, right?

322
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,790
I don't want to hurt you,

323
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,020
but I have to tell you

324
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,640
this girl

325
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,120
is not a good girl.

326
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,390
Where is he?

327
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,790
Hello?

328
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,990
I'm Zhang Ye's manager.

329
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,150
What can I do for you?

330
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,680
Do you want to be famous?

331
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,240
How was your talk with Shishi yesterday?

332
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,030
We had a good chat.

333
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,880
She even texted me

334
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,790
this morning.

335
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,760
She said good morning.

336
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
Are you really going to marry her?

337
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,480
Of course, bro.

338
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
She's always been my dream

339
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,480
since childhood.

340
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,630
Do you think you two are right for each other?

341
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,870
Aren't we?

342
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,760
I think Shishi

343
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,830
is quite simple.

344
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,980
Same with me.

345
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,300
We were born for each other.

346
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,000
I think

347
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,990
this girl

348
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,150
is not as simple as you think.

349
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,550
We've known each other

350
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,240
for more than 20 years.

351
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,720
I know what kind of person she is.

352
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,730
I know her too well.

353
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,070
What's wrong, bro?

354
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:31,520
Nothing.

355
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,140
I have a good friend.

356
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,600
His girlfriend cheated on him.

357
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm wondering

358
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,760
whether I should tell him.

359
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,910
Are you sure about it?

360
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,550
She really cheated on him?

361
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,760
Of course.

362
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

363
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,670
You have to tell him, bro.

364
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,800
You have to tell him.

365
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,150
But I'm afraid he can't accept it.

366
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,030
He has been secretly in love

367
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,310
with this girl for more than 20 years.

368
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,840
They finally

369
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,880
got together recently.

370
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,270
Then, give him a hint.

371
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,030
How?

372
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,880
You can text him the lyrics.

373
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,550
-Text him the lyrics?
-Yeah.

374
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,240
What lyrics?

375
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,170
For example.

376
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,750
I gave you a kiss,

377
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,600
but you gave it to others.

378
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,590
I'm still waiting here fondly,

379
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,390
waiting for the one

380
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,420
who doesn't deserve my love.

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,470
What do you think?

382
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,430
Is this it?

383
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:25,860
Yes.

384
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,270
Why did you text it to me?

385
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:37,840
I...

386
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,030
I think you will need it someday.

387
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,120
Shishi and I

388
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,520
will never betray each other.

389
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,830
Fine.

390
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,030
Hua.

391
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,150
Take this voice recorder back and listen to it.

392
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:53,500
What is this?

393
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,590
I've recorded something for you.

394
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,810
What is it?

395
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,100
You must listen to it.

396
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,370
The things in it

397
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,000
matter to the happiness

398
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,760
of you and Shishi.

399
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,480
My car is coming.

400
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,160
Go back.

401
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,000
Okay, thanks bro.

402
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,780
Remember to listen.

403
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:06,990
Okay.

404
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,100
I was so straight and you still didn't get it.

405
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,990
I'm glad I've recorded it.

406
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,870
He took me to the hotel

407
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,750
and groped me.

408
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,250
Which Zhang Ye?

409
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,970
The so-called

410
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,440
famous producer,

411
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,910
Zhang Ye.

412
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,690
Is he the box-office flop

413
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,390
Zhang Ye?

414
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,430
It's him.

415
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,120
Ye.

416
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,380
What took you so long?

417
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,550
There are many cars on the way.

418
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,270
Get in the car.

419
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,360
Hello.

420
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,960
Zhang Ye, are you a man?

421
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,310
How could you do this?

422
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,030
Did what?

423
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,640
Didn't you see the news?

424
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,720
What news?

425
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,430
I'm asking you.

426
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,910
Were you with Shishi last night?

427
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,780
Did you

428
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,940
harass her?

429
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,540
I harassed her?

430
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,160
Listen to what I gave you,

431
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,030
then you'll understand.

432
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,430
Anyway, from now on,

433
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,480
we are not friends anymore.

434
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,790
What's wrong? Did you have a fight?

435
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,230
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

436
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,480
Even if the whole world

437
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,030
betrays you,

438
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,390
I will be with you

439
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,120
forever

440
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:54,910
and ever.

441
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,190
I heard there are rumors about me online.

442
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,790
Fix it.

443
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,210
Really?

444
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,720
Keep it up.

445
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,150
Holy crap! What's wrong with Zhang Ye?

446
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,480
Auntie, come and take a look.

447
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,150
Can you not make a fuss about everything?

448
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,740
Zhang Ye got into trouble.

449
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,710
The famous former broadcaster,

450
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,670
music producer,

451
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,260
and program planner Zhang Ye

452
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,090
sexually assaulted an actress.

453
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,200
This news is currently

454
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,310
trending online.

455
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
Netizens are criticizing

456
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
this immoral behavior.

457
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,210
Next, let's check out the latest breaking news.

458
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,640
Auntie, calm down.

459
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,440
Calm down.

460
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,900
Answer it?

461
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,170
[Zhang Ye]

462
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,910
No.

463
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,360
Go do your homework.

464
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,270
Put away your phone.

465
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,150
Hi,

466
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,090
the subscriber you dialed is power off.

467
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,360
Why is Rao Aimin's phone

468
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,270
turned off?

469
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,390
I need to go out.

470
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,120
No, no, no.

471
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,670
It's a special time.

472
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,380
How can you still go out?

473
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,760
If you go out now,

474
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,030
you'll get attacked.

475
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,210
What should I do?

476
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,150
I...

477
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,470
Qi, Zhang Ye is calling.

478
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,230
Zhang Ye.

479
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,240
Put Zhang Yuanqi on the phone.

480
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,760
She's busy now.

481
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,530
Tell her

482
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,070
the trending topic

483
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:00,760
is fake.

484
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,310
Ask her to hold a press conference

485
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,270
to make a clarification for me.

486
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,840
Who do you think she is?

487
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,580
You ask her come and go as you wish?

488
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,790
Do you think it's easier

489
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,310
to clarify your crap?

490
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,070
Can you find your own level?

491
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,710
Put Zhang Yuanqi on the phone.

492
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,990
My hands are tied.

493
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,000
I don't have time to talk to you.

494
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,300
Alright.

495
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,550
They're all

496
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,910
turn against me.

497
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:28,990
Tian Bin.

498
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,840
How did you do your job?

499
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,790
How did you handle public relations?

500
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:34,840
Well.

501
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,310
It happened out of the blue.

502
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,540
Think about it.

503
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,310
Have you offended anyone?

504
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,590
Who could I offend?

505
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,840
I stay with you everyday.

506
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,640
Who can I offend?

507
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,630
Yeah.

508
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,240
Well.

509
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,310
Stop reading

510
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,540
those bullshits online.

511
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,390
It will only affect your work.

512
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,640
Isn't this

513
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,270
just what they want?

514
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,870
Give me some time.

515
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,990
I'll handle this.

516
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,120
Let take care of it, okay?

517
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,880
Trust me.

518
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,720
I'll be right back.

519
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,000
Are we really not going to help Zhang Ye?

520
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,760
My PR company

521
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,720
is quite capable.

522
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,350
They can fix it easily.

523
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,430
I told him before

524
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,840
that there's not only

525
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,640
glamours appearance about being famous

526
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,510
but also hard work behind the scenes,

527
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,880
persistence,

528
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,150
and even betrayal.

529
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,360
This is something

530
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,260
he needs to experience

531
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,260
sooner or later.

532
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,760
Luckily,

533
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,180
this thing

534
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,310
is not irreversible.

535
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,670
It may not a bad thing for him.

536
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,270
I just hope that, after this,

537
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,640
he can think about

538
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,350
how to map out

539
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,670
his own path.

540
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,590
The trending posts are shadowbanned.

541
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,900
The endorsement has been withdrawn.

542
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,580
Internet trolls

543
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,000
are criticizing me to death.

544
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,030
Mr. Zhang,

545
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,960
don't worry about it.

546
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,830
Then what else can I do?

547
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,420
I have nothing to do.

548
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,120
How long has it been since I last left home?

549
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,760
Just wait.

550
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,760
When the heat dies down,

551
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,150
everyone will forget it

552
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,880
right away.

553
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,800
I was framed.

554
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,930
I know.

555
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,910
But if you stand up now,

556
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,760
you'll only get scolded.

557
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,000
It's better

558
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,180
to stay at home

559
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,880
and collect some evidence, right?

560
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:05,580
Evidence?

561
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,160
Zhang Hua.

562
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm gonna call Zhang Hua.

563
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,550
Don't.

564
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,420
It's late at night.

565
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,760
Why are you still calling him?

566
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,080
Isn't he sleeping?

567
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Come and have a seat.

568
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:19,960
Have a seat.

569
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,710
Let's drink first.

570
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,480
Just rest assured.

571
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,730
When you're awake tomorrow,

572
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,270
let's talk about it then.

573
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,870
Come on, bro.

574
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,310
What did you call me?

575
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:31,640
I...

576
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,430
I...

577
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,030
Can I...

578
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,550
Call you brother?

579
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,660
You're older than me.

580
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,880
Do you care about one's age

581
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:44,880
when you admire someone?

582
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,790
Anyway, I've always seen you

583
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,910
as my elder brother.

584
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,420
I've ended up like this,

585
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,430
yet you are still by my side

586
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,860
and give me advice.

587
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,980
To you.

588
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,240
Don't.

589
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,600
I...

590
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
It's my responsibility

591
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,520
as your brother.

592
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,910
Bottoms up.

593
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,960
What's wrong?

594
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,030
I'm just a little touched.

595
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,550
I think

596
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,360
someone like me

597
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,150
who is

598
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:38,960
incompetent

599
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,070
but can stay with you

600
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,420
and work for you...

601
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,840
I feel like...

602
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,590
I...

603
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm so lucky.

604
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,380
Who said you're incompetent?

605
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,240
Aren't you in charge of

606
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,550
all the business in the company?

607
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,480
I'm just running errands.

608
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,720
From now on,

609
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,880
you'll be in full charge of my business.

610
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,480
Here.

611
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:06,840
I...

612
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,350
There you go.

613
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,840
Bro.

614
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,550
By the way,

615
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,600
I...

616
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,910
I have some documents here

617
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,070
that need your review.

618
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,720
I've checked it.

619
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,880
It's all about the procedure.

620
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,470
Forget it.

621
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,200
Pour the wine.

622
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:31,640
Pour the wine.

623
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,020
Don't you want to review it?

624
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,560
Here.

625
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,600
There you go.

626
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,460
Let's tie one on.

627
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,070
Bro.

628
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,150
Four.

629
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,650
You can come over.

630
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,720
Who are you?

631
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,320
Where am I?

632
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,660
Shiyi Psychiatric Hospital.

633
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,150
Why am I here?

634
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,390
Do you remember what happened?

635
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,150
What did I do?

636
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:36,590
Who is he?

637
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,560
Why is he naked?

638
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,800
It's you.

639
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,310
Me?

640
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,390
You must be mistaken.

641
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,670
I'm sure.

642
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,470
This is definitely not me.

643
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,390
Listen to me, you guys.

644
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:58,800
Let go of me.

645
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,750
Let go of me.

646
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,030
Don't worry.

647
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,560
Let go of me.

648
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,080
Don't worry.

649
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,840
Don't worry.

650
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,660
Take this injection.

651
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,660
-You'll get better soon.
-I don't.

652
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,110
-Take an injection and you'll be fine.
-No.

653
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:14,870
Nurse.

654
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,300
Where are you taking me?

655
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
Your friend is here to see you.

656
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,110
Is she Rao Aimin?

657
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,320
This...

658
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,390
Tian Bin.

659
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,280
What took you so long?

660
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,830
It's been days.

661
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,470
Get me out of here right away.

662
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,040
What?

663
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,250
What's going on?

664
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,720
We should take things as they come.

665
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,690
What do you mean?

666
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,580
My fans are waiting for me.

667
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,660
I have to write songs.

668
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,910
Don't worry.

669
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,270
I've arranged everything for you.

670
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,480
What have you arranged?

671
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,280
Look.

672
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,770
I prepared this place for you.

673
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,050
You have food here

674
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,320
and you can rest anytime.

675
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,560
Haven't you been having bad sleep?

676
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,670
Just take this chance to take a break.

677
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,580
No, I don't want to rest here.

678
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,750
Get me out of here right away,

679
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:17,900
or I'll...

680
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,050
What?

681
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,830
You can do nothing

682
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,030
here.

683
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,240
You...

684
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,480
What do you mean?

685
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,360
What do I mean?

686
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,800
I just want you to feel

687
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,620
how I felt

688
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,030
when I had a vacation here.

689
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,470
You want to imprison me?

690
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,630
Imprison?

691
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,720
Why don't you say I'm hiding a mistress secretly?

692
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,620
Are you crazy?

693
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,670
You're the crazy one.

694
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,310
You're already here.

695
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,290
Aren't you a psycho?

696
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,100
Tian Bin.

697
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,580
Listen.

698
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,080
I've got

699
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,190
all the copyrights.

700
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,590
You can't do anything without me.

701
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,370
Set me free now.

702
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,040
I forgot to report to you

703
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,070
all of the copyrights

704
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,590
of your works

705
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,980
had already belonged to me.

706
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,750
This is the copyright transfer agreement

707
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,390
you signed.

708
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,710
[Copyright Transfer Agreement]

709
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,190
Take a closer look.

710
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,350
Isn't it?

711
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,590
It's all here.

712
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,200
You mean you will forgive me?

713
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,000
As long as you change,

714
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,350
it's better to have a friend

715
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
than to have an enemy.

716
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,960
To you.

717
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,720
No, no, no.

718
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:57,840
What are you doing?

719
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,740
Do you want to tear it up?

720
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,480
Well,

721
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,320
how can you tear it up when you're tied?

722
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,390
Let me help you.

723
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,180
What should we do?

724
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,760
How about I tear it up for you?

725
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,280
Should I?

726
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,520
I...

727
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,070
Why did I tear it up?

728
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,760
What am I doing?

729
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,390
I'm tearing it up.

730
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,120
It doesn't count now.

731
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,660
Come on.

732
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,930
It's torn up.

733
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,000
Look. Are you happy with that?

734
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,960
Why do I still have it?

735
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,290
Stay here and have fun.

736
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,910
Tian Bin.

737
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,280
You're so despicable.

738
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm despicable?

739
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,910
I'm not despicable.

740
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,560
How dare I to play tricks in front of you?

741
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,020
If it weren't you

742
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,010
who made me lose my job

743
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,830
and my wife,

744
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,410
would I come this far?

745
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,390
Tian Bin.

746
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,320
Don't go, Tian Bin!

747
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,800
Let me out.

748
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,350
You can do whatever you want.

749
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,920
Well,

750
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,440
you shouldn't

751
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,870
have tested your brother's girlfriend.

752
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,710
Aren't you stupid?

753
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,240
Did you do this?

754
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,390
I really don't know.

755
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,270
Listen, Tian Bin.

756
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,950
You can't defeat me.

757
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,040
I have evidence.

758
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,580
I'm waiting for your evidence.

759
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,190
I really have evidence, Tian Bin.

760
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,240
Tian Bin.

761
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,520
Tian Bin.

762
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,390
Bro.

763
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,630
Nice move!

764
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,670
I didn't expect

765
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,110
you would strip him and throw him onto the street.

766
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,710
Let me tell you.

767
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,870
This is not over yet.

768
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,060
Zhang Ye said he has evidence.

769
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,240
You must

770
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,120
find the evidence as soon as possible.

771
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,430
Otherwise,

772
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,110
it'll always be a threat to us.

773
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,670
Don't worry. No problem.

774
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:28,720
Hello.

775
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,080
Can I ask a question about Zhang Ye?

776
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,040
Sorry. Sorry.

777
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,030
Mr. Tian Bin is...

778
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,590
Sorry to keep you waiting.

779
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,280
It's okay.

780
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,430
Come here.

781
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,320
Do you have any questions?

782
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,280
Mr. Tian, does Zhang Ye

783
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,910
really have mental disorder?

784
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,680
Actually,

785
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,080
I still can't

786
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,210
accept it now.

787
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,030
Why did Zhang Ye

788
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,260
suddenly appear on the street?

789
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:54,840
Who contacted

790
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,110
the psychiatric hospital?

791
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,240
Did he know

792
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,590
that Zhang Ye was sick?

793
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,170
This nameless hero

794
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,670
is also very important

795
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,800
to me.

796
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,740
Because without his

797
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,100
timely help,

798
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,380
for an adult psycho

799
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,410
who was naked

800
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,980
wandering around,

801
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,810
the consequences

802
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,850
would be unimaginable.

803
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,910
Can Zhang Ye still create and write

804
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,050
in current situation?

805
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,190
Don't worry

806
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,510
about the works.

807
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,340
To be honest,

808
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,480
I've participated in

809
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,130
many of Zhang Ye's works.

810
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,350
Most of his inspirations

811
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,900
also came from me.

812
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,360
So, I'll take this chance

813
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,950
to announce

814
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,470
something important

815
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:41,520
here today.

816
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,380
Zhang Ye has transferred

817
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,250
all the copyrights of his works

818
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,760
to me.

819
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,070
Auntie.

820
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,800
In other words...

821
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,810
Why is Tian Bin so bad?

822
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,260
He even stole Zhang Ye's copyrights.
