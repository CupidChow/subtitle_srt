[Episode 9]

4
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,140
Help me now.

5
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,210
Are you Zhang Yuanqi?

6
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,060
Hello.

7
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,770
Nice to meet you.

8
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,380
Superstar.

9
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,660
You are even prettier in real life than on TV.

10
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,850
Your legs are really long.

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,340
You're welcome.

12
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,240
Sit down and let's talk.

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,490
Sit down. What are you waiting for?

14
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,180
Sit.

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,780
This is quite romantic.

16
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,090
You didn't even open the curtains.

17
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,300
Why?

18
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,580
Are you going to make it public?

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,060
No. What do you mean?

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,500
Qi is here to for the script.

21
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,890
She even came to the hotel for it.

22
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,980
It doesn't sound trustworthy.

23
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,340
No, stop talking about this.

24
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,579
I'll explain to you later.

25
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,010
What you need to do now

26
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,060
is to get out

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,140
to distract those paparazzi.

28
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:28,579
No.

29
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,980
She's a celebrity.

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,250
It's not my duty to help her.

31
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,450
How can I help her?

32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,340
Consider it helping me.

33
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,570
Help you?

34
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,010
What's your relationship with her?

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,530
I have nothing to do with her.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
We are clear.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,370
Even if there is something between us,

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,010
there is no need to tell you.

39
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,990
Qi, you...

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,290
Okay, you two go ahead.

41
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,850
Qi.

42
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,500
I won't bother you.

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,650
No, no, no.

44
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,340
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

45
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,220
What are you doing?

46
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,610
I swear.

47
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,300
I... I have nothing to do

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,370
with Zhang Yuanqi.

49
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,650
If there is

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,530
any abnormal relationship between us,

51
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,450
I will be struck by lightning.

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,580
See? You deserve it.

53
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,350
No.

54
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,980
I didn't get hit.

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,810
Really, Rao Aimin.

56
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,060
Only you can help me with this.

57
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,250
She's here to urge me to write,

58
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:12,610
right?

59
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,520
If it weren't for me, she...

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,890
Listen.

61
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,980
I really can't help you.

62
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,450
I just run a hotel.

63
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,300
I'm not that capable.

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,930
I can't help you.

65
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,980
You can, you can.

66
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,810
I can't.

67
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,420
Can you...

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,010
Don't beg me.

69
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,520
Please.

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,140
Don't beg me.

71
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,300
Rao Aimin, I'm begging you.

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,060
Enough.

73
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,250
Stop arguing.

74
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,300
Zhang Ye.

75
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,010
Stop being so inferior.

76
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,220
I might just go down now

77
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,500
and let the paparazzi take photos.

78
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,300
Let's make it public.

79
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,940
I'm a superstar.

80
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,530
I deserve a talented man like you.

81
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,340
That's good.

82
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,500
No, no.

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,940
Wait.

84
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,500
I'll help you.

85
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,500
Help. How? Tell me.

86
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,220
She's out.

87
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,330
She's out.

88
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,140
Let’s go.

89
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,700
Superstar, say something.

90
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,860
Say something, superstar.

91
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,370
Are you here to see a friend?

92
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,340
Who are you here to see?

93
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,820
Look at me and say something.

94
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,140
Are you here to see a friend,

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,650
partner or lover?

96
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,460
As a superstar,

97
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,210
shouldn’t you say something

98
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:05,860
to everyone?

99
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,410
What's going on?

100
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,270
Shoot it.

101
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,580
Who are you? Where is the superstar?

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,080
How would I know?

103
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,490
Will you shoot it or not?

104
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:19,980
No.

105
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,900
Hurry up and delete it.

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
Don't invade my privacy.

107
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,700
Are you safe?

108
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,409
Yes, thanks to you today.

109
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,330
I'm glad you're fine.

110
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,020
You should thank Rao Aimin.

111
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,409
Why didn't you help me?

112
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,250
Explain it.

113
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm afraid that the more I explain, the more confused she is.

114
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,810
Good luck to you. Bye.

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,210
Rao Aemin.

116
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,740
Let me explain.

117
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,490
Let me explain.

118
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:54,920
Explain what?

119
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,490
I really...

120
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,860
I really have nothing to do with her.

121
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,490
Don't follow me.

122
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,330
Let me help you.

123
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,770
Let me help you.

124
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,650
Aren't you hurt?

125
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,210
Let me help you.

126
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:02,930
It's okay.

127
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,050
Don't touch me.

128
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,980
Go away.

129
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,370
Let me help you.

130
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,180
You can't walk on your own.

131
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,740
Get lost!

132
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,810
Where should I go?

133
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,860
If I go anywhere, it is your place.

134
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,460
Rao Aimin!

135
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,980
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

136
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,900
Aunt, you're back.

137
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,140
Let me explain.

138
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,860
Explain what?

139
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,900
Can you explain clearly?

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,020
Rao Aimin, listen to me.

141
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,930
We really did nothing.

142
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,460
The hotel room was that small.

143
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,650
I was sitting on the sofa.

144
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,860
She was sitting on the bed.

145
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,730
Then the TV station asked her to go.

146
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,860
So she took a bath and had makeup

147
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,650
in the hotel.

148
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,210
There are no curtains in the bathroom.

149
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,020
The glass is rubbed.

150
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,140
I can't see anything.

151
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,300
Just make it up.

152
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,180
Just make it up.

153
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,980
With my moral quality,

154
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,090
don't you trust me?

155
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,740
I'm a good young man.

156
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,330
Do you have moral?

157
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,380
I don't believe it.

158
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,090
Get lost.

159
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,700
Where are you going?

160
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,700
Sit down.

161
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,090
What's wrong with you two?

162
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,490
Don't ask about adults' stuff.

163
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,810
Are you jealous?

164
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,370
I'm jealous?

165
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm jealous because of him?

166
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,980
Rao Aimin.

167
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,930
Does he deserve it?

168
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,460
Rao Aimin.

169
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,210
Pack your things

170
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:26,980
and leave tomorrow.

171
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,330
Rao Aimin.

172
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,350
Let me explain.

173
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,090
Tell me the truth.

174
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,300
What did you do wrong

175
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,450
to my aunt?

176
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,420
I only have your aunt in my heart.

177
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,420
How could I

178
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,460
do anything wrong to her?

179
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,700
Why didn't you tell her yourself?

180
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,620
Did she listen to me?

181
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,320
She didn't listen.

182
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,330
Look how fierce she is.

183
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,140
Good night.

184
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:57,980
No, no, no.

185
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,300
You have to help me.

186
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,650
Whoever started the trouble should end it.

187
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,090
What do you mean?

188
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,330
As long as you still have connection

189
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,530
with that celebrity,

190
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,620
My aunt

191
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,650
won't let you go.

192
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,420
We have nothing to do with each other.

193
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:14,980
Why...

194
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,370
should I have to cut ties with her?

195
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,090
Is that what you mean?

196
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,370
Think it on your own.

197
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,020
From now on,

198
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:31,930
I promise

199
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,500
except for work,

200
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,130
I won't have any private touch

201
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,299
with Zhang Yuanqi.

202
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,500
Even if it's about work,

203
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,260
there will be someone else there.

204
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,350
Is that okay?

205
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,470
Get lost.

206
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,180
Look.

207
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,060
This doesn't work either.

208
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,860
I'm still angry.

209
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,940
Have a marshmallow.

210
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,130
Who ate the crab?

211
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,880
There is nothing left.

212
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,740
So stingy.

213
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,940
Ms. Zhang is here.

214
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,770
Welcome.

215
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,090
Hello.

216
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,940
Have a seat.

217
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,380
Have a seat, everyone.

218
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,450
I'm here to have a simple meeting with you today.

219
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,760
There is only one purpose.

220
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,820
We chose

221
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,570
a batch of

222
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,890
excellent seed players.

223
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,420
We would like you to

224
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,420
have a look.

225
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,380
Let's show

226
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,330
Ms. Zhang.

227
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:28,700
OK.

228
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,130
Here, Ms. Zhang,

229
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,180
I’ll recommend you a good player.

230
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,560
He’s both good at singing and composing.

231
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,420
He's a potential.

232
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,290
What do you think?

233
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,620
He must be gifted in acting.

234
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,740
Look, a superstar is a superstar.

235
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,030
You have sharp eyes.

236
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,810
It's not that I have sharp eyes.

237
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,730
I saw him in

238
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,200
other talent shows before.

239
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,500
He's probably

240
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,130
a professional candidate.

241
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,940
An experienced person like him

242
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,420
is not suitable for our show.

243
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,450
Well,

244
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,690
look at this one.

245
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,380
He has a good education background,

246
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,740
graduating from

247
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,690
the music academy

248
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,860
and is good at singing.

249
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,870
How is he?

250
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,260
I remember I saw him

251
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,330
at the preliminary round.

252
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,740
He did sing well.

253
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,090
But I don’t feel anything.

254
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,820
Ms. Zhang, take a look.

255
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,770
I have

256
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,530
a good candidate.

257
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,890
There's no highlight in her.

258
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:37,980
She...

259
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,160
Here's the thing.

260
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,220
She had a rough life.

261
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,260
Her dad, mom

262
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,940
grandma and grandpa

263
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,140
all have cancer.

264
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,200
It's not easy that she has

265
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,180
a healthy brother.

266
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,560
But he died in a car accident three years ago.

267
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,010
The key is that the child

268
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,010
found herself

269
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,380
have thyroid cancer

270
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,210
some time ago.

271
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,380
Look, how pitiful.

272
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,740
I believe

273
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,850
once such a story

274
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,380
is revealed,

275
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,120
billions of viewers will be moved instantly.

276
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:09,820
Right?

277
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,570
It'll definitely work.

278
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,790
Yes, really.

279
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,840
She can't sing well.

280
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,390
Bus she is good at acting miserably.

281
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,130
No, no, no.

282
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,890
Ms. Zhang.

283
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,330
She is not pretending to be miserable.

284
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,790
Because she...

285
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,090
It really happened to her,

286
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:22,690
right?

287
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,750
I agree with Ms. Zhang.

288
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,180
I think all the contestants today

289
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,210
are not qualified.

290
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,940
Since we're doing

291
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,380
a grass-root talent show,

292
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,060
we should leave the opportunity

293
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,090
to those

294
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,820
most talented grass-root players.

295
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,770
We don’t hype or gimmick.

296
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,130
We only do the purest music.

297
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,250
We won't do those

298
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,500
pretending stuff.

299
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,970
Well, show Ms. Zhang

300
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,010
the rest files.

301
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,210
There are more.

302
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,060
Choose again.

303
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,130
Zhang Ye.

304
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,090
Your phone seems to be vibrated.

305
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,330
This one is good, too.

306
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,090
OK.

307
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,890
Since I'm the planner of this show,

308
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,530
from now on,

309
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,330
I'll set a rule.

310
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,990
If anyone is found to take the back door,

311
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,220
no matter who it is,

312
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,710
and no matter what kind of background one has

313
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,140
the one will be eliminated once found out.

314
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,420
Including me.

315
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,100
OK.

316
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,130
Well, I think we...

317
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,890
Let's not talk about this.

318
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,210
Let's go back to the show itself.

319
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,610
OK?

320
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,010
One way is not okay.

321
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,180
The other won't do either.

322
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,450
What should we do?

323
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,640
The show is about to go on.

324
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,260
It's just looking for grass-root player.

325
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,420
Yes, go ahead.

326
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,820
I have an idea.

327
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,250
Hello, Shuang.

328
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,650
What's up?

329
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,250
I remember

330
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,450
when we were recording Midnight Song,

331
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,820
many listeners

332
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,940
are good at singing.

333
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,650
Can you give me

334
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,280
their contact information?

335
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,260
No problem.

336
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:19,690
Thank you.

337
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,420
Found it.

338
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,450
Very good.

339
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,380
OK.

340
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,210
That's all for today.

341
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,260
Thank you.

342
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,570
I was worried

343
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,450
about this show.

344
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,610
Now I find

345
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,860
worrying is unnecessary.

346
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,530
So many people are watching.

347
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,210
I don't want them to say any bad words

348
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,110
behind my back.

349
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't expect that you're not only talented,

350
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,220
but also upright.

351
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,570
This is not upright.

352
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,010
I just thought

353
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,890
from the grass-roots perspective

354
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,890
to endorse them.

355
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,940
Are you free tonight?

356
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,180
Let's have dinner together.

357
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,260
No.

358
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,990
You've been avoiding me lately.

359
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,510
Why would I?

360
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,550
Then you must come.

361
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,090
I'm going to introduce

362
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,060
an important producer

363
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,690
for you.

364
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,690
It will be helpful for the show.

365
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,010
Qi.

366
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,180
Brother.

367
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,420
Why are you here?

368
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,130
I heard that you are preparing

369
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,940
a talent show.

370
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,300
A grass-root talent show. What's wrong?

371
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,450
Can I participate?

372
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,690
Of course you can, but

373
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,860
you have to rely on yourself.

374
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,570
I won't

375
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,690
turn on any green light for you.

376
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,260
That's why I'm here.

377
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,620
Brother.

378
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,380
Just treat me

379
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,620
as an ordinary player.

380
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,090
Singing well is singing well.

381
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,590
If the singing is bad, it is bad.

382
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,890
If you turn on the green light,

383
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,090
I will not participate.

384
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,820
You have to work hard.

385
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,330
What are you singing?

386
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,370
Let me listen.

387
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,370
I'll give you some advice.

388
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,740
Here I go.

389
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,980
Listen to me

390
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,260
sing for you.

391
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Cut the crap.

392
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,420
Break your eardrums.

393
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
Tianjin kuaiban.

394
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,090
Nan, let me do it.

395
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,260
Why are you here?

396
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,740
I have an appointment with Ms. Zhang.

397
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,450
Call her.

398
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,530
Please leave.

399
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,130
I wrote a new song for her.

400
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,650
If you don't go out,

401
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,680
I will not treat you well.

402
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,650
No, no, no.

403
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,930
I... Don't.

404
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,650
What's wrong?

405
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,180
It is not reliable to wait for you.

406
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,450
Ms. Zhang,

407
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,300
I wrote a new song for you.

408
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,300
Ms. Zhang,

409
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,560
this is the latest one I made for you.

410
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,020
Take your time.

411
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,920
Take a look at mine first.

412
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,450
Okay, please read it too.

413
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,070
When will the moon come?

414
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,720
Let's drink to the sky.

415
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,530
I wonder if the heaven is in the palace.

416
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,090
This... this word is que, right?

417
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,609
This is similar to what I wrote.

418
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,329
Good.

419
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,230
I'll take it back and study it carefully

420
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,290
and compose a song for it.

421
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,170
Go back to study it

422
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,280
or register copyright?

423
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,410
Register copyright? No.

424
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,280
I just want to

425
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,069
take it back and study it.

426
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,750
Which master wrote this?

427
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,619
I also think it's well written.

428
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,380
This is one

429
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,540
that can be compared with

430
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,500
My future Is Not A Dream.

431
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,500
Zhang Ye just gave it to me.

432
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,810
Tian Bin.

433
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,090
Do you know

434
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,140
why you can't write good works?

435
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,260
No.

436
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,140
Actually, ours are almost the same.

437
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,280
You haven't thought through about it.

438
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,410
You're still playing tricks.

439
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,210
All you think about is playing tricks.

440
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,800
All you think about is these.

441
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,410
Tian Bin.

442
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,930
I can let go of

443
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,210
what happened before.

444
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,280
I don't want to deal with the past.

445
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,410
But behave yourself.

446
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,730
If this happens again,

447
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,980
in this industry,

448
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,470
you will disappear.

449
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,360
Don't, Qi.

450
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,660
I...

451
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,900
I just need one more chance.

452
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,450
Please give me a few more chances.

453
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:06,930
Right?

454
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,810
-Sometimes... -See the guest out.

455
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,740
Let's go.

456
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,740
No, no, no.

457
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,780
Sometimes the inspiration...

458
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,690
No, Nan.

459
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,850
I haven't taken my calligraphy.

460
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,570
No, no, no, Qi.

461
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,500
We're not done yet.

462
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,370
Let's give each other a chance.

463
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,410
No, we...

464
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,290
You... I...

465
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,440
What are you doing?

466
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,940
No, I...

467
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,410
What's the big deal?

468
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,130
Don't blame me for not giving you a chance.

469
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,980
What do you mean

470
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,670
by the recruitment ad?

471
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,260
What what do I mean?

472
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,860
I pasted it. I'm hiring.

473
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,170
I've packed your luggage.

474
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,210
Immediately

475
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,810
move.

476
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,090
Last night, I...

477
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,970
You don't have to explain to me.

478
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,650
I

479
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,450
thought about it carefully.

480
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,870
You're a celebrity now.

481
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,050
You're not suitable to

482
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,450
live in a shabby old hotel like mine.

483
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,860
Go find

484
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,810
somewhere suitable.

485
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,450
If I don't live here,

486
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,540
where can I live?

487
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,780
Zhang Yuanqi's big villa

488
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,660
suits you well.

489
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,050
Nothing happened between us.

490
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,970
Last night, I really...

491
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,740
Why did you...

492
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,020
You don't have to explain to me.

493
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,970
From now on,

494
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,050
we have nothing to do with each other.

495
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,620
No.

496
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,090
We do have nothing

497
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,170
with each other.

498
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,320
Hello, I'm here to see the recruitment.

499
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,570
I heard a room is included.

500
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,860
Hold on.

501
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,140
The key.

502
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:52,780
What?

503
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,200
The key.

504
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,090
Leave now.

505
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,690
Don't delay my recruitment.

506
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,810
Fine.

507
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,200
You kicked me out.

508
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:14,900
Bro.

509
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,330
I don't want to cheat you.

510
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,500
This is a gangster shop.

511
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,100
I think

512
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,480
it is quite clean.

513
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,500
That's not what I meant.

514
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,230
Look.

515
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,450
Two days off every month.

516
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,810
Just two days a month.

517
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,290
The beach annual leave

518
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,170
is to help her walk the dog.

519
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,060
You can't make much money a month.

520
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,410
You might have to pay for it.

521
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,740
Really?

522
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,140
Leave quickly. It's a gangster shop.

523
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:36,980
Zhang Ye,

524
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
what nonsense are you talking about?

525
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,900
Who is talking nonsense?

526
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,930
That's you, evil profiteer.

527
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,290
Do you want to die?

528
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,690
Stop!

529
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,060
Get lost.

530
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,930
♫Not overlook the azure of tomorrow♫

531
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,520
♫The empty room♫

532
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,210

Show me the audience's reaction.

Shoot the audience.

543
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,550
Shoot the audience.

544
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,610
What is the song?

545
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,330
It's awful.

546
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,170
It's not in tune.

547
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,780
♫The uncontrollable missing♫

548
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,050
♫The uncontrollable missing♫

♫The yesterday that cannot go back♫

550
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,290
How did such people get in?

551
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,020
I'm curious.

552
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,500
♫The five am in reality♫

♫The uncontrollable past♫

556
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,710
Thank you.

557
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Do you want me to say it or you say it?

558
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,020
I want to ask you.

559
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,050
When you were singing,

560
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,170
sometimes you were not in the tune.

561
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,740
I want to ask you.

562
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,170
Can't you hear it yourself?

563
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,380
Or is there something wrong

564
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,180
with our speaker?

565
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,020
Really?

566
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,090
I think I sing very well.

567
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,290
When you were singing,

568
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,980
you stole glances at your hand many times.

569
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,500
Did you write the lyrics

570
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,380
on your hands?

571
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,020
This is not professional.

572
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,930
I was afraid I would forget the lyrics,

573
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,050
so I wrote it on my hand.

574
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,810
Well...

575
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,560
Director, let's take a break.

576
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,240
Ms. Zhang,

577
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,480
if this show continues,

578
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
it won't end well.

579
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,080
Look at them today.

580
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,710
None of them is in tune.

581
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,050
Yeah.

582
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,450
I remember during the audition,

583
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,870
there are many good candidates.

584
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,620
Why is the quality

585
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,210
so bad today?

586
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,250
How would I know?

587
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,690
Ms. Zhang,

588
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,810
we came here

589
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,900
for your sake.

590
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,780
You don't look like

591
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,130
who would take on such bad shows.

592
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,980
Mr. and Ms., here's the thing.

593
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,160
I don't know

594
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,090
about the details.

595
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,090
I'll go back and check

596
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,020
and tell you right away.

597
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,290
Thank you, everyone.

598
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,330
I saw it.

599
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,990
The effect is really good.

600
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,410
Here.

601
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,020
Director Yang.

602
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,860
No need for coffee.

603
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,540
The show cannot continue.

604
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,690
This is you.

605
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,810
If it were me,

606
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,050
I wouldn't have recorded it.

607
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,780
The problem is with you.

608
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,620
Your schedule is

609
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,810
too tight.

610
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,290
Your recording is important,

611
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,280
but you have to let the mentors

612
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,090
rest.

613
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,980
Adjust it.

614
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,670
-Let the mentors... -That’s not the problem.

615
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,540
Then what's the problem?

616
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,360
The quality of players is too bad.

617
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,180
Yes, I know.

618
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,170
But there is nothing we can do

619
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,660
from the company's side.

620
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,600
They are all from sponsors.

621
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,450
Tell me.

622
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,420
Who should I take care of and who shouldn't?

623
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,650
There's no way.

624
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,250
But let me make a statement first.

625
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,930
I hate this kind of thing the most.

626
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,920
Let’s wait until the top 10.

627
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,780
Eliminate them all.

628
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,570
All of them!

629
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,460
Top 10?

630
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,860
Top 10?

631
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,270
Top 10.

632
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,660
Director Yang.

633
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,620
I don't care whose people they belong to.

634
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,670
We only care about capability.

635
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,400
If you don't let

636
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,070
those capable players in,

637
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,510
it is against our original intention.

638
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,910
It doesn't matter if we don't record the show.

639
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:06,980
How about this?

640
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,910
I think in this occasion

641
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:10,900
and timing,

642
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,260
it's not good for us

643
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,500
to debate, right?

644
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,400
How about this?

645
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,540
Let's record the show first.

646
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,500
After that,

647
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,440
we can talk about

648
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,140
this.

649
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,160
I just want to say one thing.

650
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,170
We are on the same boat.

651
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,020
We'll share weal and woe.

652
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,860
This is a good friend of mine.

653
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,050
This is his first time in charge of

654
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,500
such a big show.

655
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,380
He's under a lot of pressure.

656
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,380
I hope everyone can help him.

657
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,930
Besides, we've known each other

658
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,380
for a long time.

659
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:37,810
Right?

660
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,440
You work together

661
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,050
for my sake.

662
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,090
OK?

663
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,620
Mentors,

664
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,690
let's finish the show first.

665
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,010
If there's anything else,

666
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,140
after the recording,

667
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,050
we can talk about it.

668
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,980
OK?

669
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,170
Since we've signed the contract,

670
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,330
we will definitely record the show.

671
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,430
But if it's still like today,

672
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,780
even if we record ten episodes,

673
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,970
we won't let anybody

674
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,290
pass.

675
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,500
Mentors,

676
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,230
there are some candidates afterwards

677
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,710
that are quite good.

678
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,050
I've evaluated them before.

679
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,660
I'll let them on first.

680
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,780
Please take a look.

681
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,110
If it still doesn't work,

682
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,230
we won't continue

683
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,470
this episode.

684
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,940
Whenever it's ready,

685
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,500
we will start it again.

686
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,410
How about this?

687
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:23,810
OK.

688
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,290
I'll give you face.

689
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,930
Let's record the rest.

690
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,140
Let's go.

691
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,460
Thank you.

692
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:29,810
Coffee.

693
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,610
Coffee.

694
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,260
Hello, I’m Zhang Hua.

695
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,450
I didn’t prepare the accompaniment today.

696
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,940
I'd like to ask the audience

697
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,030
to play the rhythm for me.

698
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,210
Standing on this stage today,

699
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,620
I'm trying rap.

700
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,560
But no one cares about

701
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,000
antithesis in the content and lines.

702
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,540
In the era of mobile devices,

703
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,180
users all have portraits.

704
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,580
The figure behind the light

705
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,900
is like the Hengha Erjiang.

706
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,740
The fish in the relentless river...

707
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,890
Is there any way

708
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,210
to improve music quality rapidly?

709
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,350
Music is a way

710
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,230
to cultivate temperament.

711
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,320
Fast done. No.

712
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,410
Bye.

713
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,680
Don't go.

714
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,930
[Beatbox Book]

715
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,770
Beatbox.

716
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,790
There was one who is good at beatbox in the capital.

717
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,630
He held a banquet

718
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,030
in the northeast corner of the hall.

719
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,260
This might work.

720
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,380
I think it's novel.

721
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,980
The lyrics are good and exciting.

722
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,160
Your lyrics are sharp.

723
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,950
Young people have your attitude.

724
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,990
But you only have lyrics but not songs.

725
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,450
Young man,

726
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,570
we all

727
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,020
acknowledge your ability.

728
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,050
But can this song

729
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,900
without background music

730
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,990
be called singing?

731
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,090
It's indeed unprecedented.

732
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,170
If you have a song,

733
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,820
I will definitely let you pass.

734
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,260
But

735
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,660
you can go back

736
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,500
and write a song.

737
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,280
I'll turn on the light for you when I'm back.

738
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,660
Okay?

739
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,090
Thank you.

740
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,970
Did you play the music?

741
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,490
No.

742
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,860
Who played the music?

743
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,980
Boss went up.

744
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,070
He went up?

745
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,410
Yes.

746
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,980
Light, shine.

747
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,500
Music.

Brother,

853
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,500
we don't have to be so ostentatious, do we?

854

What does rap mean?

855
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,380
Have you studied

856
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,020
why the listeners like rap?

857
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,500
If you can't float,

858
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,170
how can the audience fly with you?

859
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,170
You need to know how to set a new standard.

860
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,510
How about this?

861
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,730
I'll take you to spend some money.

862

Brother, let's have barbecue.

863
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,780

864
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,410
which is very delicious.

865
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,190
All you care about is eating.

866
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,410
Your parents fed you

867
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,240
and raised you.

868
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,050
For what?

869
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,730
You should work hard

870
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,720
and make efforts

871
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,030
and be filial to them.

872
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,380
Brother, I actually plan to move out.

873
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,050
Why?

874
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,620
Did you argue with your parents?

875
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,020
No.

876
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,920
To be honest,

877
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,050
since I was young,

878
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,380
my mother has been controlling every corner of me.

879
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,260
I have no personal freedom at all.

880
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,210
Besides,

881
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,010
no matter what I do,

882
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,270
they don't support me.

883
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,740
Just because my dream

884
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,540
is different from what they think.

885
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,500
They always force me to do

886
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,900
that I don't like at all.

887
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,820
My dad has been teaching all his life.

888
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,620
He knows nothing.

889
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,560
He only knows

890
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,450
reading poems

891
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,550
that can't be published.

892
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,930
Actually,

893
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,610
I think you should think in a different position.

894
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,140
Who else's father

895
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,980
can write poems?

896
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,540
Your dad can write poems.

897
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,450
You should be proud.

898
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,040
I don't think

899
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,130
it is something that I can be proud of.

900
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,140
My dad is such a coward.

901
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,410
He has no braveness at all.

902
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,210
He's so disciplined by my mother.

903
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,210
My mom also,

904
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,980
has no mercy at all in words.

905
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,690
She scolded me and my dad

906
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,330
like nothing at home.

907
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,140
My mom is petty and snobbish.

908
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,380
They just want me

909
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,440
to make money and make money

910
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,170
as they wish.

911
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:21,980
They never

912
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,090
considered my feelings.

913
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,900
I just think it would be better

914
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,930
if they never gave birth to me.

915
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,490
I don't want to

916
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,390
stay in this house anymore.

917
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,490
What are you talking about?

918
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,300
You don't cherish it.

919
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,060
Others want it but don't have it.

920
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,400
No.

921
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,580
I shouldn't have hit you just now.

922
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,980
I was wrong.

923
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,140
Here's the thing.

924
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,710
You're so popular now.

925
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,930
You can't

926
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,410
talk nonsense.

927
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,440
Luckily, there are only the two of us in the car.

928
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,700
What if others

929
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,980
hear you and make it public?

930
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,889
Let me sing you a song.

931
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,130
Sure.

932
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,739
Three-section cudgel.

933
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,170
Three-section cudgel.

934
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,100
Three-section cudgel left.

935
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,449
Three-section cudgel right.

936
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,050
Three-section cudgel left.

937
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,270
Three-section cudgel right.

938
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
You're lying, brother.

939
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,780
It’s like rap.

940
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,190
This is not a song.

941
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,500
Yes, it is a song.

942
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,190
It's a song.

943
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,290
Come on. Try it.

944
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,540
Three-section cudgel left.

945
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,850
Three-section cudgel right.

946
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,780
Three-section cudgel left.

947
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,880
Three-section cudgel right.

948
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:45,889
Great.

949
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,380
Mom

950
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,370
Coming.

951
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,370
Hurry up.

952
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,020
Don't you know to bring a key?

953
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,130
No, you...

954
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,500
Are you moving?

955
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:04,870
Brother.

956
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,270
Zhang Ye is here too.

957
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,170
Zhang Hua bought too many things.

958
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,810
He couldn’t carry them,

959
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,210
so I was here to help.

960
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,060
And I came to see you by the way.

961
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,420
What did you buy?

962
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,130
These are

963
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,260
pure mechanical

964
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,410
tourbillons.

965
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,300
Look at this.

966
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,210
What are you doing?

967
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,890
99K, pure gold.

968
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,690
I...

969
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,220
Is it heavy?

970
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:28,740
I...

971
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,850
Is it heavy?

972
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,170
I'll wear this.

973
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,540
And...

974
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,650
Auntie.

975
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,580
This, this.

976
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,310
This is a full-automatic

977
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,020
foot wash basin specially for you by Zhang Hua.

978
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,170
It also has steam function.

979
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,000
It's very comfortable.

980
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,410
Why did you buy

981
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,530
so expensive things?

982
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,300
He bought it. He bought it.

983
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,650
No.

984
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,860
I really like it.

985
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,480
I like it.

986
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,370
What is this?

987
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,330
What do you think it is?

988
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,630
What is this?

989
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,740
This is money. What is this?

990
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,850
This is my salary this time

991
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,850
and my future salary

992
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,060
will be transferred to this card.

993
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,480
I have to leave it to me

994
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,270
to take care of it.

995
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,260
My son is the best.

996
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,650
Look at this.

997
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,700
Zhang Ye!

998
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,370
Without you,

999
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,580
there is no today's Zhang Hua.

1000
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,780
Let’s go out and eat something extravagant.

1001
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,160
No, no, no.

1002
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,180
I’ve heard from Zhang Hua

1003
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,650
that the braised pork you make

1004
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,250
is delicious.

1005
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,340
I'm finally here today.

1006
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,770
I just want to taste your braised pork.

1007
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,780
Let's not go out.

1008
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,170
You should have told me earlier.

1009
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,170
You will have enough braised pork.

1010
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,690
Okay.

1011
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,210
Coming.

1012
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,850
Delicious braised pork is here.

1013
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,670
Come on.

1014
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,960
Cheers.

1015
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,220
No, uncle.

1016
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:13,740
Here.

1017
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,540
Don't toast with me.

1018
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:14,740
No.

1019
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,610
It's true. Don't toast with me.

1020
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,610
Here's the thing.

1021
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,890
The last time I came here,

1022
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,060
I got drunk.

1023
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,500
When I went to your house to make trouble,

1024
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,690
I haven't had the chance

1025
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,740
to apologize.

1026
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,500
Today, I officially apologize to you,

1027
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,130
uncle and aunt.

1028
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,490
I'll drink as punishment.

1029
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,210
I'll drink as punishment.

1030
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,260
Slow down.

1031
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,610
Look at you.

1032
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,100
Come on.

1033
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,930
Child, don't be shy.

1034
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,720
You

1035
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,510
take this place as your home.

1036
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:39,970
Try it.

1037
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,970
I'll try it.

1038
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,500
That's it.

1039
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,580
Is it good?

1040
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,690
Yes.

1041
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,780
I really like the atmosphere here.

1042
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,670
Zhang Hua always bragged to me

1043
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,250
how good your were

1044
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,980
to him.

1045
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,100
I really envy him.

1046
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:05,980
How about this?

1047
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,410
Can I take you

1048
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,780
as godparents?

1049
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,060
Sure.

1050
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,300
Hua, do you mind?

1051
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,690
No.

1052
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:19,650
Here.

1053
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,410
Godfather, Godmother.

1054
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,750
Here.

1055
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,610
A toast to you.

1056
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,020
Let's enjoy ourselves.

1057
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,260
This...

1058
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,500
All you care about is eating.

1059
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,450
I don't know what's the use of raising you.

1060
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,980
You don't even help me.

1061
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,250
Aunt,

1062
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,950
what are you doing?

1063
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,650
I'll clean

1064
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,690
this house up

1065
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,060
and rent it at a high price.

1066
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,820
You don't have to

1067
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,540
work so hard.

1068
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,210
This cabinet, this one,

1069
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,610
and the floor

1070
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,840
have been wiped out by you.

1071
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,260
I just want to upgrade it

1072
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,690
to be the presidential suite.

1073
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,090
I can rent it to a celebrity.

1074
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,050
Rent it to a celebrity? Which celebrity?

1075
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,100
Zhang Ye?

1076
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,580
Aren't you going to

1077
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,520
kick him out?

1078
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,340
I just wanted to remind him.

1079
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,650
Don't lose himself

1080
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,820
just because he is famous.

1081
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,820
Besides, if I rent it to him,

1082
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,130
I'll have to double my rent.

1083
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,260
Aunt, you really worry much.

1084
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,980
Do you really

1085
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,290
like Zhang Ye?

1086
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,980
If you keep talking nonsense,

1087
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,890
I'll beat you up.

1088
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,420
It seems so.

1089
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,220
You are not a relative to him.

1090
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,650
But you can’t stop worrying about him.

1091
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,360
I just want to add some fame

1092
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,340
for our hotel by him.

1093
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,140
If he dies,

1094
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,490
I'll change it to a famous old house.

1095
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,280
I can earn money

1096
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,160
by charging tickets.

1097
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,060
What's wrong with Zhang Ye?

1098
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,510
He's talented and famous.

1099
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,530
He cares about you too.

1100
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:30,690
Besides,

1101
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,950
It hurts.

1102
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,810
Let go. It hurts.

1103
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,330
Go back.

1104
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,210
Don't let your fans catch you.

1105
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,520
It's okay.

1106
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,130
Brother, I don't want to be a star anymore.

1107
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,170
Don't be silly.

1108
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,420
I think the present

1109
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,660
is very unreal now.

1110
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,130
Everything you got today

1111
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,930
is based on your own ability.

1112
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,740
If I had such talent,

1113
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,820
I wish I could

1114
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,970
be successful on my own.

1115
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,960
Brother, do you still think

1116
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,460
you are not talented enough?

1117
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,650
I'm not as good as you,

1118
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,280
and have no right to teach you.

1119
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,570
Brother, if you hadn't

1120
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,800
hit me today,

1121
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,640
I was still being stupid.

1122
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,530
Thank you, brother.

1123
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,100
Alright, go back.

1124
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,720
Okay, I'm leaving.

1125
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,890
Take care.

1126
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:44,800
Hello.

1127
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,510
Zhang Ye, I'm hungry.

1128
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,330
What's wrong?

1129
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,160
Crayfish can't even

1130
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,950
make you happy?

1131
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,280
It's late.

1132
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,880
Can't you

1133
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,660
take me to a restaurant?

1134
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,930
Do you really think

1135
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,840
your fans will follow you everywhere?

1136
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,240
Who am I now?

1137
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,530
You didn't see it.

1138
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,790
Today, I went to Zhang Hua's house,

1139
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,380
that crowd.

1140
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,000
They are all his fans.

1141
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,380
Why are you hiding?

1142
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:07,890
Zhang Ye.

1143
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,570
You have no idea

1144
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,360
how hard I've been these days.

1145
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,540
What's wrong with you?

1146
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,170
You're not here.

1147
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,710
My aunt always orders me around.

1148
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,540
Look at my limbs.

1149
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,210
I can't stand

1150
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,740
working hard every day.

1151
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,650
That's why.

1152
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,890
I saw you lose so much weight lately.

1153
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,890
Go eat crayfish.

1154
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,890
You've lost so much weight.

1155
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,110
Well, you can't shoot well.

1156
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,780
Zhang Ye!

1157
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,650
Come here.

1158
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,650
Zhang Ye, let me tell you something.

1159
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,410
What is it?

1160
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,650
This is very important.

1161
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,480
I have to tell you.

1162
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,820
My aunt prepared on purpose

1163
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,020
a presidential suite.

1164
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,100
She kept saying that

1165
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,300
Zhang Ye's identity is different now.

1166
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
He needs to live in a luxurious house.

1167
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:51,880
I hear

1168
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,070
it so many times these days.

1169
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,060
Really?

1170
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,370
Didn't she kick me out?

1171
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,650
Are you bluffing?

1172
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,490
I don't want to bother.

1173
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,940
I can only say women's heart

1174
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,900
is like keedle in a deep ocean.

1175
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,110
That's called needle under the sea.

1176
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,070
Think about it.

1177
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,990
Why my aunt

1178
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,880
kicked you out?

1179
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,580
How would I know?

1180
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,650
She must be jealous about

1181
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,370
you and Zhang Yuanqi.

1182
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,080
I've explained it to her.

1183
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,260
Zhang Yuanqi and I...

1184
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,650
are just partners.

1185
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,260
She doesn't believe me. She's petty.

1186
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,300
Fine.

1187
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,740
How dare you call my aunt petty?

1188
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,260
What? I just said it.

1189
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,030
Go tell her.

1190
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,090
Wait to be beaten, Zhang Ye.

1191
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,300
Is she really going to make me a presidential suite?

1192
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,540
Of course.

1193
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,650
Aren't you going to sit down and eat?

1194
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,840
I don't want to eat. You just eat.

1195
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,780
I'll take you home after that.

1196
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,260
Eat well.

1197
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,260
Aunt, Zhang Ye has a crush on you.

1198
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,610
You can see it, right?

1199
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,630
Yes, I did.

1200
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,800
It's really obvious.

1201
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,530
I knew it.

1202
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,370
It's not his fault.

1203
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,200
Look at Zhang Ye.

1204
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,580
He is heartless and brainless.

1205
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,060
He even knows a crush?

1206
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,540
Good taste.

1207
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,100
Can you eat properly?

1208
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,300
Aunt, I really can't eat it.

1209
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,060
Your cooking

1210
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,930
doesn't look delicious.

1211
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,610
You deserve it.

1212
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,150
Who lets you always eat street food with Zhang Ye?
