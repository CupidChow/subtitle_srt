4
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,170
Is it tricking me?

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,410
A game and a dream.

6
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,950
Fine, I'll put up with it.

7
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,150
He asked you to sit here

8
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,039
and you really sit here?

9
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,550
Come here.

10
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,710
There's an empty seat here. Sit here.

11
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,110
Have a seat.

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,830
Later,

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,479
I'll apply for a computer for you.

14
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,740
Thank you.

15
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,000
You're welcome. My name is Shuang.

16
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,829
He's just like that.

17
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,040
Don't take it to heart.

18
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,500
She's the anchor in Daily Mood,

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,040
Wang Xiaomei.

20
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,240
She's the top here,

21
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,590
the real one. I need to tell you

22
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,829
Tian Bin doesn't even deserve to hold her shoes.

23
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,030
Xiaomei,

24
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,460
you look so beautiful today.

25
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,910
This hairstyle

26
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,720
matches this outfit well.

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,540
Really.

28
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,910
Newbie.

29
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,940
Hello, Xiaomei. I'm Zhang Ye.

30
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,800
You are Zhang Ye?

31
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,150
I've heard about you.

32
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,660
You had lots of difficulties.

33
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,100
If you need anything,

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,829
just come to me.

35
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,870
Top is top.

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
She treats as a newbie like me so well.

37
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,950
Look at her temperament.

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,050
It's incomparable.

39
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,190
Have a seat.

40
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,730
Your handwriting...

41
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,870
Look.

42
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:15,930
Bin.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,150
How did he get the job?

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,579
Who knows?

45
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Not to mention the others,

46
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,230
his look is not good enough.

47
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,690
And he wants to be famous?

48
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,860
Not to mention being popular,

49
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,400
we'll see if he can get programs.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,250
It needs time.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
Mr. Zhao asked me to guide him.

52
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,730
I think it's hard.

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
I don't have the time.

54
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,020
Yes, Bin, you...

55
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,680
Go, squat at the wall.

56
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,720
Why?

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
Asking why?

58
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,090
Reflect on your mistakes.

59
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,370
Think about what you did wrong.

60
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,930
I didn't do anything wrong.

61
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,520
You did nothing wrong?

62
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,100
Those boys

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,410
were beaten up by you.

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,970
If it weren't for me

65
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,940
to beg the ones in charge.

66
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,010
You don't have to go to school tomorrow.

67
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,209
They bullied me first.

68
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,060
You have to learn to stop.

69
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,420
You can't hit them hard.

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,790
I didn't.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,200
I... I haven't used

72
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,690
my greatest "cutting throat" yet.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
I taught you these

74
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,120
to prevent bad guys,

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,640
not to beat your classmates.

76
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,740
They are bad guys.

77
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,650
They bully the new.

78
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
They think I'm new there

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,650
so they always pick on me.

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
When I get a cup of water,

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,800
they spilled it.

82
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,800
My new pencil

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,210
was broken by them.

84
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,520
And they

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,940
badmouthed me behind my back.

86
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,060
What?

87
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,010
So annoying, they deserve a beating.

88
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,890
It's none of your business.

89
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,200
Chenchen, you still don't know your mistake?

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,730
It's wrong to hit someone.

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,080
It's even further to hit the face.

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,000
Right.

93
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,240
Look how nice your aunt is.

94
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,200
She never hits my face.

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,890
She just dislocates my arms.

96
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,250
It's good to dislocate arms.

98
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,580
Teach me how to.

99
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,110
Don't listen to his nonsense.

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,440
Face the wall and reflect on your wrongs.

101
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
-Calm... -You also face the wall

102
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,310
and cook after that.

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,920
Have a seat.

104
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,540
You upheld justice just now.

105
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,940
To be honest,

106
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,970
I understand

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,620
what happened to you.

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,270
What? You were also bullied?

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
One of my colleagues

110
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,530
always troubles me，

111
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,450
using me like a dog.

112
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,790
So you endured it?

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,950
Or what?

114
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,020
Hit him.

115
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,290
You are a kid,

116
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,450
and it's okay for you to hit them.

117
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,600
How can I be the same?

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm an adult.

119
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,830
I have to take legal responsibility

120
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,310
for my punches.

121
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,290
Can you grow up?

122
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,540
We are

123
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,010
in the game.

124
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,120
Lower your voice.

125
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,920
In our game,

126
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,490
can we be bullied by

127
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,200
other NPCs?

128
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,040
If we are beaten to death,

129
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,270
we can resurrect on the spot.

130
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,520
And we can still be heroes.

131
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,160
What if we can't be revived?

132
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,470
That's better than enduring.

133
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,960
You don't even have the courage

134
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,890
to try?

135
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,960
Who doesn't have the courage to try?

136
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,090
From now on,

137
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,480
wherever I fall,

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,930
I will make it flat.

139
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,200
From now on,

140
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,330
I'll deal with my colleague.

141
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,370
You deal with your classmates.

142
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,850
Okay, it's a deal.

143
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,530
Deal.

144
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,530
It's still not right.

145
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,150
Higher on the left.

146
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,159
Are you feeling better now?

147
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,770
The right side is lower.

148
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:51,600
No.

149
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,570
It looks right.

150
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,090
I don't think so.

151
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,290
Your brain...

152
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,280
Zhang, come here.

153
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,700
Xiaomei, what's wrong?

154
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,690
A live stream invited a guest.

155
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,420
Now,

156
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,590
we need a host

157
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,370
to be the assistant to adjust the atmosphere.

158
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,360
You are the only substitute host here.

159
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,100
I wonder...

160
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,570
I'm good at adjusting the atmosphere.

161
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,270
I can.

162
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,770
Mr. Tian,

163
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,680
Zhang is guided by you.

164
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,630
What do you think?

165
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Zhang just joined the company.

166
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,080
I think he's lacking

167
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,840
experience.

168
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,160
Let's forget it this time.

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,810
Why?

170
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,600
I majored in broadcasting.

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,280
I have used

172
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,720
all these equipment in practical classes.

173
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,460
I know all of them.

174
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,400
What's your attitude?

175
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,680
What psychological quality?

176
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,060
Just explosive after some words.

177
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
What if you argue with the audience

178
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,040
in the live stream?

179
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,010
It's not going to end well.

180
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,520
Okay, I'll look for someone else.

181
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,790
Goodbye, Xiaomei.

182
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,920
The leader will be here soon.

183
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,159
Hurry up.

184
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,400
I was just

185
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,159
protecting you.

186
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,080
Live streaming is not a trivial matter.

187
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,920
If anything goes wrong,

188
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,490
you won't be able to go on progrmas anymore.

189
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,480
Everything starts with something small.

190
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,560
You have to start with this small thing.

191
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,730
Look at you.

192
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,010
It's very balanced now.

193
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,340
Perfect.

194
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,550
You deserve praise.

195
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,620
What are you doing?

196
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
Did you do it on purpose?

197
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,090
No, no, no.

198
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,480
Well...

199
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,770
I don't know what happened.

200
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,480
I just

201
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,650
put my left foot on my right foot.

202
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,090
No.

203
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,120
The leader will be here soon.

204
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,380
How can I see him?

205
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,920
Well...

206
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,250
Take off yours.

207
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,090
I will put on it.

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,530
Bro.

209
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,770
My clothes

210
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,270
doesn't match your temperament.

211
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,180
Yes, then...

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,920
I have an idea.

213
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,680
Give me one minute.

214
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,660
Give me one minute.

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,960
What?

216
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,360
What do you mean?

217
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,770
Give me one minute.

218
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,670
Trust me.

219
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,960
Are you kidding me?

220
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
My shirt is quite expensive.

221
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,890
What do you mean?

222
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,090
It's an emergency.

223
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,220
The leader will be here soon.

224
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,020
Try it on.

225
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,570
No.

226
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,120
Put this on first.

227
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Leader...

228
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
Will this work?

229
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,320
Yes.

230
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,680
Look,

231
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,640
I kept sleeves for you.

232
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,240
You're right.

233
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,000
Isn't it comfortable

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
and you can enjoy the air now?

235
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,600
It's cooler than before.

236
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,480
Put on your suit later.

237
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,560
I promise it won't be noticed.

238
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,640
Fine.

239
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,880
Let's try. Let me do it.

240
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,680
You...

241
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,280
This button,

242
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,970
button it yourself.

243
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,600
I... the button on the top.

244
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,520
Here, your coat.

245
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,160
Will it work?

246
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,520
This...

247
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,450
It's out, this.

248
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,640
Right?

249
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,140
There are sleeves.

250
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,910
No, this...

251
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,060
Hold on. After these two are buttoned,

252
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,260
This...

253
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,090
you cannot notice it, right?

254
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,760
Does it work?

255
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,320
Don't move.

256
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,240
There are wrinkles on the back.

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,030
Let me help you.

258
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,670
Okay, you do it first.

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,800
Yes.

260
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,550
OK?

261
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,280
I'm fine.

262
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,360
Wait a minute. Don't move.

263
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,450
Almost.

264
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,540
The suit

265
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,880
might be a little wrinkled.

266
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,920
Why are there so many wrinkles?

267
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,450
Is it done?

268
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,260
Yes.

269
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,850
Okay.

270
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,670
You look so good.

271
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,200
Really?

272
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,720
Go.

273
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,730
You're more confident than before, right?

274
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,610
Then I'll...

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:46,930
Okay.

276
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,580
Go to the meeting.

277
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,490
Good luck.

278
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,370
As we can see,

279
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,040
the number of users on the phone

280
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,010
is rising steadily.

281
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
And the paid users

282
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,240
also show the tendency of increasing.

283
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,690
Okay, thank you.

284
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Tian Bin.

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,390
Next, you will report on the stage.

286
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,080
OK.

287
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,030
I'm not qualified

288
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,220
regarding results or experience.

289
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,050
Please invite Xiaomei

290
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
to represent us first.

291
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,080
You're quite modest.

292
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,970
What I want to say now

293
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
is the publicity environment

294
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,570
of our company, Qomolangma.

295
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,880
Tian Bin

296
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,470
is quite cunning.

297
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,600
There are a bunch of good listeners.

298
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,040
It mainly

299
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,420
to ensure advertising and effective transmission.

300
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,160
I hope our Qomolangma

301
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,360
can create another glory.

302
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,250
Thank you.

303
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,730
That's all for today.

304
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,560
Thank you.

305
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,130
Thank you.

306
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,850
Thank you.

307
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,480
Tian Bin, right?

308
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,520
Aren't you going to

309
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,400
show me around

310
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,320
your crew?

311
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,380
I'm not qualified

312
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,310
regarding results or experience.

313
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,900
You'd better visit

314
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
Xiaomei's crew first.

315
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,820
Is this the one you lead?

316
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,880
How arrogant.

317
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,190
What's wrong with you?

318
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,210
Bin.

319
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,280
You're being too modest.

320
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:19,880
Bin.

321
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,950
What's wrong with you?

322
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,690
Yes.

323
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,320
Is it done?

324
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,860
It's okay. Wait a minute.

325
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,170
Bin.

326
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,040
Why are you still here?

327
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,100
They all left.

328
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,040
You did it, didn't you?

329
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,700
What do you mean?

330
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,450
Are... are you

331
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,370
tied up?

332
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,360
No, you...

333
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,240
It's really not you?

334
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,480
You...

335
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,010
No.

336
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,560
Come here.

337
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,040
Great! Great!

338
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,270
I've never felt so good in my life.

339
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,750
Chenchen, you're right.

340
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,450
In our own game,

341
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,610
we have to follow

342
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,950
our own rules.

343
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,000
In the future, I won't care about the others too much.

344
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,930
What is the thing that you dare not do

345
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,760
but want to do most

346
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,060
in this world?

347
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,760
Of course it is...

348
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,090
Chenchen, I'm going to walk the dog.

349
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,800
Stay at home nicely.

350
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,890
Okay.

351
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,460
What are you looking at?

352
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,600
Angels fly out of your arse.

353
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,360
You know nothing.

354
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,210
Then, what do you want to do most?

355
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,450
As long as I can survive,

356
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,520
I'll eat as much as I can.

357
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
There was once a sincere feeling

358
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,890
in front of me.

359
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,730
But I didn't cherish it.

360
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,320
I regret it when I lose it.

361
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,280
The biggest regret in life

362
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,030
is that.

363
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,120
God gave me another chance

364
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,280
to start over again.

365
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,010
This time,

366
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,360
I cannot miss it.

367
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,240
I want to tell her

368
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,560
the three words.

369
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,330
Which three words?

370
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,780
Tell me.

371
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,840
I...

372
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,000
was wrong.

373
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,020
Untie me now.

374
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,050
This time I'm giving you a lesson.

375
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,010
After two hours,

376
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,790
it will be untied.

377
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,630
Rao Aimin!

378
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,370
Rao Aimin!

379
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,160
Rao Aimin!

380
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,970
Rao Aimin!

381
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,400
You really can't move?

382
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,770
How about this?

383
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,500
It's useless.

384
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,260
There's still half an hour left.

385
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,450
Standing here is better than getting beaten.

386
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,740
Chenchen.

387
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,460
What are you doing, Chenchen?

388
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,300
Chenchen.

389
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,310
You...

390
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,830
Are you hungry?

391
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,290
I'll give you a bite later.

392
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,120
You...

393
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,510
I'm not hungry. I want to go to the toilet.

394
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,830
Is Rao Aimin

395
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,770
mentally distorted?

396
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,620
If I treat her well, she will target me.

397
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,840
You, help me find out

398
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,440
if she is interested in

399
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,660
me.

400
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,490
You really want to pursue her?

401
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,690
Didn't you tell me?

402
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,080
The world of gaming is open to play.

403
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,420
I want to make up for

404
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,070
the regret of that world.

405
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,480
I think

406
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,920
you should start from

407
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,380
improving yourself.

408
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,430
You mean I don't deserve her?

409
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,170
Didn't you want to go to the toilet?

410
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,730
You'll know when you take a look in your waste.

411
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,210
I'm going to do my homework.

412
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,579
Take your time.

413
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,040
Zhang.

414
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:27,930
Come.

415
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:28,890
Hurry.

416
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,200
What's wrong?

417
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,800
This?

418
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,570
This is Bin's playlist tonight.

419
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
Listen to the music style

420
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,230
and write some lines.

421
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,140
Hand it in tonight.

422
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
Why didn't he write it himself?

423
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,010
It's the chance Bin gave you.

424
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,540
You have to seize it.

425
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,420
He values you, okay?

426
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,440
Hurry up.

427
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,490
Now you know to give me work.

428
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,370
Fine.

429
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,610
I'll

430
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,650
show you

431
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,080
my solid literature skills.

432
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,080
Linking my days with yours.

433
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,570
Writing lines?

434
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,690
Although it is bad to say negative words

435
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,320
behind people,

436
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,920
I have to say

437
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,290
Mr. Tian

438
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,470
has a bad relationship

439
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,780
with the previous assistants.

440
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,720
Why?

441
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,910
His assistant wrote the manuscripts.

442
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,280
If the ratings were good,

443
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,340
Mr. Tian would say it’s his.

444
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,150
If it was not good,

445
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,060
he woudl scold his assistant when he came back.

446
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,190
He also published a book.

447
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,570
It was all written by assistants.

448
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,730
So, his former assistants

449
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,810
just let him be?

450
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,560
What can they do?

451
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,020
He's a senior.

452
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,330
Everyone dares to be angry but dare not say anything.

453
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,800
But no one wants to work with him.

454
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,450
Let me tell you.

455
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,340
Zhao Si was avoiding it

456
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,950
and left this mess to you.

457
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,600
Be careful.

458
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,320
Well,

459
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,230
should I

460
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,900
write well for him

461
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,500
or fool him?

462
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,200
You won't get good result in either way.

463
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,210
It's hard.

464
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,400
I like

465
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,570
to face difficulties.

466
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,720
Don't tell anyone I said it.

467
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,830
Don't worry.

468
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,440
Linking my days with yours.

469
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,380
Okay.

470
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,780
Dear listeners,

471
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,700
good evening.

472
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,830
This is Late Night DJ.

473
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,150
I'm the host, Tian Bin.

474
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,880
When I was at the studio,

475
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,370
I thought we travelled

476
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,700
through the half city

477
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,250
with the help of radio wave and were connected together.

478
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,200
I was quite touched.

479
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,980
I just gave a poem

480
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,820
to my friends.

481
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,390
We travel across half of the city

482
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,940
to get together.

483
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,770
Half of the city,

484
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,790
everything is happening.

485
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,160
Crazy drunk gets laughed at and scolded.

486
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,160
Wild motorbikes

487
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,110
run fast in the night.

488
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,910
The breakfast stands are getting ready.

489
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,930
The night-switch taxi drivers

490
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,170
are fighting hard with their sleepiness.

491
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,990
We travel across half of the city

492
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,080
to get together.

493
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,200
We're like old friends

494
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,840
and have each other.

495
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,480
Tian Bin.

496
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
You're shameless.

497
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,730
I wrote the manuscript.

498
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,020
How can you say it's yours?

499
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,040
Your manuscript

500
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,170
can't be used at all.

501
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,840
I polished it on the scene.

502
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,650
What did you polish?

503
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,480
Do you dare to say it?

504
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,410
This show is mine.

505
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,050
I can decide everything.

506
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,080
Thief!

507
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,340
Who are you talking about?

508
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,490
I'm talking about you.

509
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,950
You stole other people's works.

510
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,710
And I cannot tell you thief?

511
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,640
And you're a habitual offender.

512
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,770
Don't think others don't know

513
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,860
why your assistants left.

514
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,380
You have to have proof.

515
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,840
Don't touch me.

516
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,930
Or I'll sue you for defamation.

517
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,750
What are you arguing about?

518
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,390
Mr. Zhao.

519
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,840
He...

520
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,290
Come to my office, both of you.

521
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,350
You made my show of creativity

522
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,180
be the top of click-through rate.

523
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,250
Good and evil will pay.

524
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,380
It's not that it won't come. It's not the time yet.

525
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,400
Take care of yourself.

526
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,280
Thank you.

527
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,340
What happened?

528
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
Mr. Zhao, I don't know.

529
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,540
When he came,

530
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,460
he'd pick a fight with me.

531
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,720
He insisted that he wrote

532
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,360
the manuscript last night.

533
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,980
Unbelievable.

534
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,120
Zhang,

535
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,040
I was the one

536
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,820
to write it.

537
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,800
It's almost the same.

538
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,330
Where is the evidence?

539
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,290
Did you send me an email

540
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,400
or WeChat?

541
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,160
Show me the evidence.

542
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,640
I gave you the manuscript.

543
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,740
Where can I find evidence?

544
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,410
Right.

545
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,960
It's me who recited it

546
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,530
and asked him to write it down.

547
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,720
I wrote it.

548
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,480
What if I have evidence?

549
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,040
If you have evidence,

550
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,860
I'll apologize to you in public.

551
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,230
Deal.

552
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,780
Deal.

553
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,310
Mr. Zhao.

554
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,200
This poem at the beginning

555
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,900
is actually acrostic.

556
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,650
It's a work of Zhang Ye.

557
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,480
He's making up.

558
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,290
Nonsense. This is a coincidence.

559
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,560
It's just a coincidence.

560
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,450
What coincidence? Apologize.

561
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,940
You're being unreasonable.

562
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,460
Enough.

563
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,460
That's all for now.

564
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,920
You two

565
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,960
write

566
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,760
statements of self-criticism.

567
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,120
Give it to me before you go to work tomorrow.

568
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,670
Also,

569
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,620
the bonus for this month

570
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,400
will be deducted by half, both of you.

571
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,240
Let's see if you

572
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,320
can remember it.

573
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,770
No.

574
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,880
Why?

575
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,120
My bonus is much more than his.

576
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,800
It's not appropriate.

577
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,840
You have to make it clear.

578
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,300
Right?

579
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,970
Fine, I accept the punishment.

580
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,970
It's just taking financial losses to avoid calamity.

581
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,240
Mr. Zhao.

582
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,480
Stop it.

583
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,790
I know it.

584
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,110
Zhang, you are talented.

585
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,660
This is the reason

586
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,800
I recruited you here regardless of other's opinions.

587
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,990
But I hope you can apply your talents

588
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,220
to the right place

589
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,970
instead of

590
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,450
against your colleagues.

591
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,610
The petrel you talked about that day was great.

592
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,830
Let the storm

593
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,180
be more fierce.

594
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,270
Are you going to

595
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,890
face a storm like this?

596
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,470
I'm sorry, Mr Zhao.

597
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,650
I was impulsive.

598
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,200
It's work.

599
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,960
There are such things of treating people in terms of

600
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,120
qualification and seniority everywhere.

601
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,200
But as long as you are a piece of gold,

602
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,840
you'll shine sooner or later.

603
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,360
Let me remind you.

604
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,240
You're still in probation.

605
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay.

606
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,640
Go to work.

607
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,760
It's a work of Zhang Ye.

608
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,860
Don't miss it.

609
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,770
I don't want 3 or 4 thousand.

610
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Not even 1 or 2 thousand.

611
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,490
Only 998.

612
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,440
998, and you can

613
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,740
take good memory home.

614
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,440
With a good memory,

615
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,280
you won't worry about the exam

616
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,360
or the speech.

617
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,540
Stop. Stop.

618
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,760
I'm not interested in these.

619
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,280
What do you want to buy?

620
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,710
Do you have Geshandaniu?

621
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,710
What do you mean?

622
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,950
It's a kind of kungfu.

623
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,200
With it, I can hit others

624
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,130
in a distance

625
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,580
and don't let them find out.

626
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,550
What is kungfu?

627
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,910
Forget it.

628
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,880
I'd better draw a lucky draw.

629
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,860
Bad luck stickers. It works after applying.

630
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,810
Bad luck to people.

631
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,820
What bad luck?

632
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,080
No.

633
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,350
Tian Bin, what are you doing?

634
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,330
You can be fired

635
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,080
it you beat official employees when you are on a trial.

636
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,280
I've been writing this script all afternoon.

637
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,120
The live stream

638
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
will start in half an hour.

639
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,690
It'll be a huge mistake

640
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,970
if you cannot hand it in.

641
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,960
As an intern,

642
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,320
you can be expelled straight.

643
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,340
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

644
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,120
I think so.

645
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,320
This is the script.

646
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,650
What is this?

647
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,570
Go away.

648
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,380
Look.

649
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,890
You didn't even finish reading it.

650
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
What kind of writing is this?

651
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,220
I can't see it clearly.

652
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,840
Luckily I have a backup.

653
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,610
Go. Get out.

654
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,560
Close the door.

655
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,330
He's just like that.

656
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,370
Don't take it to heart.

657
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,920
He didn't even finish reading

658
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,300
before he tore it.

659
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,080
I'm your old friend,

660
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,060
Tian Bin.

661
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,160
He treats everyone like that.

662
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,040
Make your heart stay here.

663
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,570
Give us your ears.

664
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,920
Follow our steps

665
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,700
to start the journey tonight.

666
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,730
It's not easy for people working outside.

667
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,050
Tonight belongs to

668
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,410
hardworking poeple

669
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,710
and romance.

670
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,070
Didn't I put my phone here?

671
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,010
Your phone?

672
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,120
It's not in this room.

673
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,970
I didn't put it here?

674
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,720
I didn't see it.

675
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,160
I'll give you a piece of music.

676
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
Call it.

677
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,250
OMG.

678
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,920
Your phone is in there.

679
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,790
Mr. Tian. Mr. Tian.

680
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,560
Mr. Tian.

681
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,990
Mr. Tian. Mr. Tian.

682
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,400
Zhang Ye’s phone is inside.

683
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,680
I...

684
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:09,480
No.

685
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
Put the music up.

686
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,710
The music.

687
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,760
Whose phone is it?

688
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,040
Who left it in the live stream room?

689
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,960
Oh no.

690
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,600
This is

691
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,720
a major broadcast accident.

692
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,320
Mr. Zhao,

693
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,880
please deal with it.

694
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,920
Mr. Zhao, I watched the replay.

695
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,800
The interruption only lasted five seconds.

696
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,380
Less than eight seconds.

697
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,550
It's not considered an accident.

698
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,650
Why are you involved again?

699
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,800
If it wasn't an accident,

700
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,240
it was a major mistake.

701
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,230
Zhang Ye, explain it.

702
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,860
Explain?

703
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,500
This...

704
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,690
This phone is mine.

705
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,200
But I didn't know

706
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,160
why I left it there.

707
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,120
Wait, wait.

708
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,700
You didn't know?

709
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,090
Or you are playing dumb?

710
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:48,960
Yes.

711
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,090
We did have a little conflict.

712
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,960
But you don't have to

713
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,880
harm me like this.

714
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,840
It doesn't matter if you harm me,

715
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,250
but you can't do this to the show.

716
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,050
Who did this to the show and you?

717
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,850
If I intended to do so,

718
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,310
how would I need to

719
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,460
use my phone?

720
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,970
Such crazy people like dogs

721
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,770
can do anything.

722
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,640
Who are you calling a dog?

723
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,200
Why? You want to hit me?

724
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,520
Tell me.

725
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,160
Enough.

726
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,240
Who are you calling a dog?

727
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,790
I didn't move, did I?

728
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,290
Stop!

729
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,700
Zhang Ye!

730
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,030
You want to fight here in front of me?

731
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Go out and reflect on yourself.

732
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,450
OK, Mr. Zhao.

733
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,440
We will go out and reflect on ourselves.

734
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,410
All right.

735
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,680
No.

736
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:27,960
Don't be angry.

737
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,240
He...

738
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,070
Enough.

739
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,920
Don't be angry.

740
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,670
Calm down. Sit down.

741
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,480
Don't be angry.

742
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,320
Don't take it to heart.

743
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,560
Just admit that

744
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,840
we're unlucky to meet such people.

745
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,370
Unlucky?

746
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,840
Bin,

747
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,360
you're really good at scheming.

748
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,360
How did you

749
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,240
get his phone?

750
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,840
He came in to deliver the lines

751
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
and left his phone on the table.

752
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,640
Avoiding his notice,

753
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,440
I pulled it

754
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,720
into the trash can.

755
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:10,730
Nice.

756
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,340
Yes.

757
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,690
[Bad luck sticker]

758
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,560
You... bad luck sticker.

759
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,650
What are you looking at?

760
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:29,760
Nothing.

761
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,210
My eyes are dry.

762
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,400
Calm down.

763
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,450
Calm down, okay?

764
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm not angry.

765
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,560
Yes.

766
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,960
What's the effect

767
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,220
of this bad luck sticker?

768
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,230
Let me try.

769
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,870
No.

770
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,200
What are you doing?

771
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
You scared me.

772
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,700
Bin, I'm sorry.

773
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,010
I didn't do well before.

774
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,810
Please forgive me.

775
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,400
Well...

776
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,650
You... leave.

777
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,530
Leave.

778
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:32,840
Leave.

779
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,320
Sorry.

780
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,650
What are you doing?

781
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,080
Sorry.

782
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,170
Blow it up!

783
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,270
Hot his mouth!

784
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,120
Hot his mouth.

785
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,480
Why isn't this bad luck sticker working?

786
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:41,810
Slide him.

787
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,920
Bin.

788
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,230
Bin.

789
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,280
Bro, this...

790
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,530
Why isn't this

791
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,719
working?

792
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,179
What are you murmuring about?

793
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,760
Nothing.

794
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,010
Why are you...

795
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,810
Why are you following me?

796
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,679
I'm your assistant.

797
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,810
I have to do everything for you.

798
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,159
Shuang,

799
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,730
isn't Xiaomei coming to the live stream today?

800
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,870
She's on leave.

801
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:31,820
It's recording and broadcasting today.

802
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,030
This, this.

803
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,120
The leader hasn't

804
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,980
assigned shows for you?

805
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,440
No.

806
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,530
You can play the harmonica?

807
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,140
I can't.

808
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,640
This is a prize

809
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,530
for the audience from Xiaomei's show,

810
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,370
and she gave me one.

811
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,290
You can play it?

812
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,720
A little.

813
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,040
Harmonica is cheap.

814
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,810
Among all the instruments,

815
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,000
I can only afford this.

816
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,960
What's going on?

817
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,680
Why is it...

818
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,890
Oh no, I'll go check it out.

819
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,000
Shuang.

820
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,120
Hurry up.

821
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,740
Mr. Tian.

822
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,550
What happened?

823
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,100
The power suddenly went out.

824
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,550
Done.

825
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,670
The power is back on.

826
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,490
No, why is the power out?

827
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,270
The power went out just now.

828
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,310
Are you okay here?

829
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,570
Fine.

830
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,860
It's okay.

831
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,350
What should we do if the work station is not bright?

832
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,010
Keep an eye on it.

833
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,790
I'll check the mechanical room.

834
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,380
Okay.

835
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,840
Okay.

836
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,600
Mr. Tian,

837
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,520
how can we play the song

838
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,360
if the work station is not bright?

839
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,240
It's almost time to live.

840
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,200
Why should we play songs?

841
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,320
I can chat with the audience.

842
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,800
Isn't that good?

843
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,550
No problem.

844
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,410
Well, later...

845
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,630
What’s wrong, Mr. Tian?

846
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,210
Mr. Tian, what’s wrong?

847
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,570
Are you alright?

848
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,710
Mr. Tian.

849
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,440
Shuang.

850
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,680
I can't take it anymore.

851
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,860
Help me find a song to hold on.

852
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,800
No, Mr. Tian.

853
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,560
I can’t play songs.

854
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,530
Where can I find a song for you?

855
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,270
I... No, my salary will be deducted.

856
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,890
What should I do?

857
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,550
Why don't you do it?

858
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,130
Me?

859
00:36:59,170 --> 00:36:59,960
You do it. Yes.

860
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,540
You do it.

861
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,520
Hurry up.

862
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,570
Sit down.

863
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,820
Let me adjust it for you.

864
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,640
Good night, everyone.

865
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,910
At midnight,

866
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,950
This is Late Night DJ.

867
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,840
I'm the substitute host, Zhang Ye.

868
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,310
When the show begins,

869
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,060
I have bad news for you.

870
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,430
Because of the device malfunction,

871
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,600
there's no music for today's show.

872
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,670
We can't order songs.

873
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,250
We are still waiting

874
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,460
for technicians to repair it.

875
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,010
Think about it.

876
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,870
How happy people are now.

877
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,840
When they have insomnia,

878
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,760
there are short videos that will never be finished with mobile phones.

879
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,080
There are endless dramas on the computer.

880
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,040
There are

881
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,710
24-hour convenience stores downstairs.

882
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,870
Even without

883
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,850
our program,

884
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,180
you can

885
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,480
have 100 ways

886
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,810
to kill time.

887
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,810
I can't help thinking

888
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,930
how people used to spend night

889
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,840
in the past?

890
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,560
Can they only lie in bed

891
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,260
and think about the lullaby

892
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,090
when they are young?

893
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,010
Do you remember

894
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,400
the melody you mom hummed

895
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,910
when you were little?

896
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,760
Please dial

897
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,750
our online hotline.

898
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,560
Let's recall

899
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,620
those songs that accompanied us to sleep.

900
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,180
Mr. Zhao.

901
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,060
I'll be right there.

902
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,750
No need.

903
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,800
He performed well.

904
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,210
We should give young people

905
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,630
to show themselves.

906
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,200
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

907
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,300
Yes, I...

908
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,990
Go back and rest.

909
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:22,770
Go.

910
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,260
Rest.

911
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,640
Okay.

912
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,190
OK.

913
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,380
You're great, really.

914
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,520
Keep hosting.

915
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,520
I'll get the hotline for you.

916
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,350
Come on.

917
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,480
Go! Go! Go!

918
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,160
Sir, shall we go?

919
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,970
Let's go.

920
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,270
All tricks.

921
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,450
Let's go.

922
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,570
Sir, this is...

923
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,680
Qomolangma Internet Radio？

924
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,940
Yes, I love it.

925
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,020
Have you listened to Late Night DJ before?

926
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,010
Yes.

927
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,300
The show is great.

928
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,800
I almost fell asleep

929
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,430
with the lullaby just now.

930
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,040
I've been listening to the show for so many years.

931
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,490
It's the first time I feel that

932
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm not sitting in this steel shell,

933
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,360
but like

934
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,440
lying in my mom's arms.

935
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,290
This show is awesome.

936
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,660
And the

937
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,960
song of woman

938
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,620
not being with her husband

939
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,960
made me cry.

940
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,200
It's not easy.

941
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,970
It's late at night.

942
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,740
If it weren't for the livelihood,

943
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,440
who would have run around?

944
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,060
Everyone wants

945
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,320
to enjoy the life with their wife and children.

946
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:23,840
Right?

947
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,490
Yes.

948
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,300
So,

949
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,490
we should have

950
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,750
more shows like this

951
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,400
so that everyone can feel care.

952
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,170
Right?

953
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,200
You're the host, right?

954
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,600
You can tell?

955
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,170
You're awesome.

956
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,530
Okay, I'm happy today.

957
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,490
I'll give you a free ride.

958
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,200
Not calculating the price.

959
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,340
Thank you.

960
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,550
Please listen to our show more often.

961
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,300
Of course.

962
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,660
This show is great.

963
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,960
Zhang Ye!

964
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,080
Come and have breakfast.

965
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Aunt is waiting for you.

966
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,850
Why did I fall asleep?

967
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,440
Did you listen to my show

968
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,310
last night?

969
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,780
Am I talented?

970
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,210
What show?

971
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,680
No.

972
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,960
You must did.

973
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,200
Otherwise,

974
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,230
why are you prettier today?
