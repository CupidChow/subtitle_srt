[Episode 20]

4
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,140
Come in.

5
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,930
I didn't see you

6
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,020
during dinner.

7
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,539
I was worried about you,

8
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,650
so I came to see you.

9
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,420
What's wrong? Are you scared?

10
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,200
It's fine now, isn't it?

11
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,980
The bad guy has been caught.

12
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,370
What awaits him

13
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,780
is the punishment of law.

14
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,650
Besides, the spirit of the whole crew

15
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,730
is very high now.

16
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,100
They're so eager to do it.

17
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,370
How they wish they could

18
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,420
find a lawbreaker on the spot

19
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,300
and punish him.

20
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,300
Besides,

21
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,530
Nan is guarding you

22
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,860
at the door like a wolfhound.

23
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,000
Your room

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
is safer than the police station.

25
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,240
Don't think too much.

26
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,960
Just eat and drink as you should.

27
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,690
Okay, Qi?

28
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,420
Zhang Ye.

29
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,180
I don't want to be a star anymore.

30
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,210
If you don't want to be a star,

31
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,140
what do you want to do?

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,090
Be an ordinary person.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,420
Just an unknown passer-by.

34
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,980
It's fine for me.

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,090
Live freely.

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,870
Do whatever I want,

37
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,880
and eat whatever I want.

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,140
No need to worry about getting fat.

39
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,760
No need to be afraid of being photographed secretly.

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,370
No need to be scared of scandals.

41
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,450
I have too many things

42
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,730
that I want to do but I haven't done yet.

43
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,420
If I had really been killed

44
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,780
by that bad guy today,

45
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,940
I would have lived

46
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,090
my life in vain, wouldn't I?

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,920
I support you.

48
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,090
I think you're right.

49
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,930
But Qi,

50
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,550
have you

51
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,170
thought about those fans

52
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,530
who like you?

53
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,390
If you quit singing and dancing,

54
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,060
and stop shooting movies and TV dramas,

55
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,420
what can they do?

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,210
No.

57
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,110
This is a great loss

58
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,950
to China and even the world.

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,340
With your acting skills,

60
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,890
I would feel sorry for you

61
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,980
if you don't get a Lifetime Achievement Award.

62
00:03:59,610 --> 00:03:59,980
You...

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,550
Zhang Ye,

64
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,400
You're so eloquent.

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,519
I really envy you.

66
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,649
You live as you wish.

67
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,990
I am kind of

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,340
a talented man.

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,370
But

70
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,460
I don't love my dream

71
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,330
that much actually.

72
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,140
I just want to be famous

73
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,560
and make more money

74
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,770
so that those

75
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,630
who looked down on me

76
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,600
can respect me.

77
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,850
That's why

78
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,290
my original intention

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,680
has changed and isn't that pure now.

80
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,670
But you're different.

81
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,330
How am I different?

82
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,580
Do you remember

83
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,980
what your original dream was?

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,020
My dad once told me,

85
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,210
in poverty, one should still hold himself to a high standard,

86
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,140
and when prosperous, one should contribute to the well-being of all.

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,340
I remember you've also told me

88
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,720
you're famous now,

89
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,510
and you have to bear more responsibility.

90
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,260
While sticking to your dream,

91
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,020
you have to make better works

92
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,190
so as to encourage

93
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,460
your fans

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
to be themselves,

95
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,760
find their dreams,

96
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,820
and work harder

97
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,880
on the path of pursuing their dreams.

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,140
Do you remember

99
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,210
these words?

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,760
Alright.

101
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,650
That's all I want to tell you today.

102
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,260
If you have any questions,

103
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,930
you can ask me again.

104
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,360
Zhang Ye.

105
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,980
Thank you.

106
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,300
Why are you thanking me?

107
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,370
I merely

108
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,700
reviewed it for you.

109
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,460
By the way,

110
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,270
take a good rest.

111
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,550
Don't let the director

112
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,900
scold your makeup artist again,

113
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,540
and ask her to cover your dark circles.

114
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:57,770
Bye.

115
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:14,900
Nan.

116
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,590
Qi doesn't blame you at all.

117
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,770
Don't be sad.

118
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,960
I need to go to the toilet.

119
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,950
Those unknown men want to get famous.

120
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,670
Those who are famous want to

121
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,860
be ordinary people.

122
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,170
It's hard.

123
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,080
A terra-cotta warrior?

124
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,620
Well, this...

125
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,260
Sir,

126
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,120
there's a terracotta figurine in the latrine.

127
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,650
You mean this object?

128
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,580
It has been discarded there for many years.

129
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,330
Why did you throw it there?

130
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,210
While the people of my grandpa's generation

131
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,900
were opening up wasteland,

132
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,370
they found this object.

133
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
They brought it back,

134
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,700
and it looked creepy,

135
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,370
so they threw it into the latrine.

136
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,310
What on earth is this?

137
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,040
You don't know it?

138
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,370
No.

139
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,220
Doesn't it look familiar?

140
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,880
This is a terra-cotta warrior.

141
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,030
What warrior?

142
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,290
Terra-cotta warrior.

143
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
There are many moths at the back of the mountain.

144
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,990
But I wonder

145
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,330
if there is the pupa you want.

146
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,770
Sir, is it

147
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,810
not far from here to Mount Li?

148
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,250
I heard that the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor

149
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,300
near Mount Li.

150
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,100
Mount Li?

151
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,390
It's over there.

152
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,680
The mausoleum you mentioned

153
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,570
is just a pile of soil.

154
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,090
There's nothing inside.

155
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,770
That's right.

156
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,200
Yes.

157
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,760
Sir, I just

158
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,650
like to collect

159
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,050
weird things.

160
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,400
I think this is good.

161
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,370
How about

162
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,010
selling it to me?

163
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,650
Sell it to him?

164
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,140
This

165
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,020
is not something valuable.

166
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,180
It's dirty and stinky.

167
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,820
Take it if you don't mind.

168
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,300
I don't mind.

169
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,980
Thank you.

170
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,530
Tell me.

171
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,210
It's not something good.

172
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:27,930
Right?

173
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,980
Is it valuable?

174
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,980
What on earth is this?

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,440
Right.

176

Why did you send messages about

Of course.

If it's not a terra-cotta warrior,

186
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,250
would it be Tang tri-colored pottery?

They're historical relics.

00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,380
discover the tomb of the First Qin Emperor,

350
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,890
but also find the terra-cotta warriors

351
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,660
and show them to the experts.

352
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,810
I'm telling the truth.

353
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,450
But you can't use...

354
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,500
My curtain rods are wasted.

355
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,440
So you're going to dig with this thing?

356
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,340
Look.

357
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,290
I ordered this online.

358
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,500
Though this Luoyang shovel

359
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,610
isn't that perfect,

360
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,990
the principle is right.

361
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,740
You think you're Lu Ban?

362
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,040
When I find the terra-cotta warriors,

363
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,490
it's not only about money.

364
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,020
That's the eighth wonder of the world.

365
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,520
Then I'll...

366
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,680
Anyway, to me,

367
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,350
you look like worker who handles feces.

368
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:16,980
Bye.

369
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,690
It's a remote place.

370
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,860
You should be careful.

371
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,330
Run if you can't handle it.

372
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,410
Don't worry.

373
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,320
I've contacted the village director.

374
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,330
He will help me.

375
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,140
Take this.

376
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,500
I've heard tomb raiders all need this.

377
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,340
Why do tomb raiders need this?

378
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,860
It's a lamb hoof.

379
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,020
I bought it for you specially.

380
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,430
First of all, I'm not going to rob a tomb.

381
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,690
Second,

382
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,140
even if I would rob a tomb,

383
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,860
what I need is a raw hoof of a dark donkey.

384
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,970
It's useless to bring cooked food.

385
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,590
Just take it.

386
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,470
If you don't need it,

387
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,160
you can eat it as a snack on the way.

388
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,910
There are many more here.

389
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,450
I've prepared them all for you.

390
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
These are my favorite foods.

391
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,620
They're very delicious.

392
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,020
Here you are.

393
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,170
Take them all. Eat them.

394
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,500
You're so sweet.

395
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,690
Why did you bring so many

396
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,740
snacks to school?

397
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,150
He's leaving.

398
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,830
I have to bring him some snacks.

399
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
Be a good girl.

400
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,220
I'm leaving. Bye.

401
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,930
Come here. I want to talk to you.

402
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,240
Are you here

403
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,660
to dig the figurines out?

404
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,140
Are they valuable?

405
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,090
Director, it's not about money.

406
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,680
If it's not about money,

407
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,260
why are you doing this?

408
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,170
Let me put it this way.

409
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,550
Those things are historical relics.

410
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,260
They need to be handed over to the government.

411
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,780
I just want to pass the test.

412
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,370
Let me put it this way.

413
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,430
I have a small goal.

414
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,680
I want to find the tomb of the First Qin Emperor,

415
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,520
and fill in the gap

416
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,410
of history of the Qin dynasty.

417
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,650
What gap is it to make you

418
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,150
come to an underdeveloped place like ours

419
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,750
to fill it up?

420
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,420
We have nothing here.

421
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,210
Director, trust me.

422
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,320
This place will be one of the most famous

423
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,020
tourist attractions in the world.

424
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,720
All tourists in the world

425
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,780
will line up to visit this place.

426
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,290
You'll be busy in the future.

427
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,020
Really?

428
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,950
That's great.

429
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,550
I'll find you a good master in our village.

430
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,510
He's good at building houses

431
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,250
and farming.

432
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,450
Let him follow you.

433
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,260
Dig those figurines out

434
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:52,780
as soon as possible.

435
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,250
Cheers.

436
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:53,740
Cheers.

437
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,170
Folks,

438
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,090
I know

439
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,900
after you hear

440
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,410
what I'm going to say next,

441
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,020
you might feel it's unbelievable.

442
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,000
But the truth will prove

443
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,000
what I said is true.

444
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,910
The land under our feet

445
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,530
looks ordinary,

446
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,730
but it contains the secret

447
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,890
that has lasted for over 2,000 years,

448
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,080
that is, the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor,

449
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,220
the Terra-cotta Warriors.

450
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,220
The Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor?

451
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,960
You may think

452
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,620
I was exaggerating.

453
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,930
So today,

454
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,220
we need to learn how to dig them out

455
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,760
and discover this secret.

456
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,950
What tools do we need

457
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,140
to find them?

458
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,090
Luoyang shovels.

459
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,660
It features a shape

460
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,820
which is half round.

461
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,460
First, let's learn

462
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,510
the use of a Luoyang shovel.

463
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,260
Stand in the shape of Ding.

464
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,040
This shovel should be

465
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,870
placed in front of our chest

466
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,910
with two fists' distance.

467
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,930
Hold the shovel with your right hand.

468
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,560
Use your left hand to

469
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,950
control the direction of the shovel.

470
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,620
First of all,

471
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,360
don't let our shovels

472
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,220
move out of this circle.

473
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,000
Now let's shove it into the soil.

474
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,670
Lift it up, and the soil will come out.

475
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,740
When we have reached

476
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
about two meters,

477
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,980
we have to observe

478
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,450
whether the texture of the soil has changed,

479
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,360
and whether there's obvious layering.

480
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,750
If there is a change,

481
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,070
it means we might have found

482
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,120
the tomb we're looking for.

483
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,350
Only by practicing hard today

484
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,450
can we find the real

485
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,230
tomb of the First Qin Emperor tomorrow.

486
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,980
Come here! Come here!

487
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,160
I found it. I found it.

488
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,880
Hurry up! I found it!

489
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,150
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

490
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,710
Where is it?

491
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,200
What is it?

492
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,360
Look! Look! Look!

493
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,840
Look.

494
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,620
This one.

495
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,040
Right?

496
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,070
Is this it?

497
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,780
Look.

498
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,210
Really.

499
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,690
How is it?

500
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,530
Impressive.

501
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,660
It's worth it.

502
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,780
Yes, it's worth it.

503
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,370
Mr. Zhang,

504
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,580
I didn't expect what you said is true.

505
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,820
I'd like to thank you

506
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,850
on behalf of the whole village. Thank you!

507
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,620
Really?

508
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,900
You don't have to thank me.

509
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:58,980
The one whom you should

510
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,560
thank is the First Qin Emperor.

511
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,930
It's finely made.

512
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,490
Let me remind you.

513
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,730
The Terra-cotta Warriors

514
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,710
are world-class

515
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,820
historical and cultural heritage.

516
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,660
Before the experts arrive,

517
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,010
you must

518
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,430
keep a close watch over them.

519
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,320
Don't reveal it to anyone else.

520
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,810
If the tomb raiders find out,

521
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,980
it'll ruin everything.

522
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,070
Yes.

523
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,030
We will keep an eye on them.

524
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,520
Let me take a photo for you.

525
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,730
Okay.

526
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,380
Come on.

527
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,520
Alright. Come here. Come on.

528
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,110
Here.

529
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,620
Right here.

530
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,610
Crouch.

531
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,230
Come on. OK.

532
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,330
Come on.

533
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,360
Three, two, one.

534
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,730
Hello.

535
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,620
Professor Qin, the great expert,

536
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,200
have you seen the parcel

537
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,570
I sent you?

538
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,590
Yes.

539
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,340
I'll report to the superiors immediately,

540
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
and organize a team to go there.

541
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,740
Alright.

542
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,050
Let me tell you.

543
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,770
The conditions here are tough.

544
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,960
You have to prepare your own food.

545
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,740
No problem. It can be solved.

546
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,980
Wait there.

547
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:19,610
Okay.

548
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,110
How dare you not believe me?

549
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,840
Wang, inform the Technical Group A

550
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,050
to take the equipment,

551
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,810
book train tickets and leave right away.

552
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,640
Look.

553
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,310
We found these.

554
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,280
Yes. Look.

555
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,210
All of them.

556
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,970
Did you discover all these things?

557
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,170
Of course.

558
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,430
Oh my god.

559
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,000
Where is Mr. Zhang?

560
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,420
I'll take you to him. Let's go.

561
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,200
Hurry up. Let's go.

562
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,010
Hurry up.

563
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,540
Come on.

564
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:52,970
Why are you here?

565
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,570
I want to see you.

566
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,620
I had nothing to do at home,

567
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,370
so I've come to see

568
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,720
how it is going with your digging

569
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,900
of the tomb.

570
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,130
That's not digging the tomb.

571
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,350
I'm promoting our national culture.

572
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,580
As you can see,

573
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,280
the conditions here are tough.

574
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,820
You should go back tomorrow.

575
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,230
That's impossible. I've just arrived here.

576
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,450
My lady.

577
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:19,860
I'm not going back.

578
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,250
If I'm here,

579
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,490
I can help you.

580
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,080
It's such a bleak place.

581
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,650
You even have to do horse stance in the toilet.

582
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,360
By the time you can't

583
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,150
endure this, just don't...

584
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,960
I can do the horse stance.

585
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,740
Well,

586
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,570
where am I staying tonight?

587
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,300
Right. Where do you live?

588
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,370
The living conditions

589
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,090
of this village are bad.

590
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,780
The room they've given to me

591
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,870
is the best one.

592
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,580
Why don't you stay here?

593
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,620
What about you?

594
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,990
I work so hard every day.

595
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,140
I can't sleep on the floor.

596
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,660
Let's sleep together.

597
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,380
No way.

598
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,020
I'm

599
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,240
conservative.

600
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,490
Body contact is improper between unmarried men and women.

601
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,000
What do you mean

602
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,810
by saying that?

603
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,450
Don't you know

604
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,260
my character?

605
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,090
I'm an honest man.

606
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,110
Honest?

607
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,610
And inarticulate, right?

608
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,740
I promise after I go to bed,

609
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,820
I'll remain still like

610
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,590
a terra-cotta warrior.

611
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,220
No, no, no.

612
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:22,950
Think of another solution.

613
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,580
You should go somewhere else.

614
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,900
No other places.

615
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,430
I didn't get other answers.

616
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,230
I...

617
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,950
No, you should ask again.

618
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,740
Who else should I ask?

619
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,290
Mr. Zhang.

620
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,330
Who is it?

621
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,980
Are you asleep? The men from the city have arrived.

622
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:42,780
Open the door!

623
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,350
I'm sleeping.

624
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,620
Mr. Zhang.

625
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,450
Hello.

626
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,520
After receiving your call,

627
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,860
I organized an excellent team

628
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,290
and rushed here without stopping.

629
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,570
Yes.

630
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,580
Professor, you must be tired

631
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,230
after traveling all the way here.

632
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,350
Have a good rest today.

633
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,960
Take a good rest first.

634
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,180
I'm not tired.

635
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:04,970
Not at all.

636
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,860
It's such an important thing.

637
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,300
The relics of thousands of years have been discovered.

638
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,460
They are waiting at the scene.

639
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,520
It's so important.

640
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,360
We can't wait.

641
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,810
Mr. Zhang, let's go.

642
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,380
Well, my hand. You...

643
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,900
Mr. Zhang.

644
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,290
My hand...

645
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:14,780
Miss,

646
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,710
our conditions here are not good.

647
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,000
I've asked my daughter

648
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,250
to move out of her room.

649
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,790
You can live there. The room is clean.

650
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,660
Thank you so much.

651
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,210
How annoying.

652
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,100
Pay attention.

653
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,160
Look at the large piece of soil when you pull the shovel out.

654
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,810
Give it to me.

655
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,130
Let me do it.

656
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,830
Just stand by my side.

657
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,410
Let me do it.

658
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,830
You don't have enough strength.

659
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,500
Get up.

660
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,640
I have big strength.

661
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,950
This is what men do.

662
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,220
You're not a man.

663
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,270
-Let me do it. -Mr. Zhang.

664
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,260
Who isn't a man?

665
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,790
Mr. Zhang, look.

666
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,040
We've been digging here

667
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,130
for several days.

668
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,780
Is there anything

669
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,440
under the land here?

670
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,890
I think it should be here.

671
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,540
Director, don't worry.

672
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,970
Give me some time.

673
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,150
Go on exploring this land carefully.

674
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,730
Why is there something hard here?

675
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,470
Let me do it.

676
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,780
See?

677
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,720
What?

678
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,980
Professor Qin!

679
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,570
Professor Qin, come here!

680
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,570
Look at this.

681
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,500
Isn't this a stone?

682
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,170
No.

683
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,300
That's it.

684
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,860
Let me see.

685
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,090
Yes.

686
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,030
Is that it?

687
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,550
The original accessories of the Bronze Chariot and Horse.

688
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,410
Accessories?

689
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,550
I found it! I found it!

690
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,080
This is... There's really something.

691
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,090
The accessories of the Bronze Chariot and Horse.

692
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,610
That's right.

693
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,170
There's probably a Bronze Chariot and Horse sculpture underneath.

694
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,820
The Bronze Chariot and Horse should be

695
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,730
right below.

696
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,780
If we find a Bronze Chariot and Horse sculpture,

697
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,610
it will shock the world.

698
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,340
All of you have made a contribution to it.

699
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,000
She found it.

700
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,570
Good for you.

701
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,540
You...

702
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,910
Attention, everyone.

703
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,940
Be careful

704
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,200
when you dig into the soil.

705
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,050
Professor, let me remind you.

706
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,390
The Bronze Chariot and Horse

707
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,810
has been buried underground for over 2,000 years.

708
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,330
That's right.

709
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,050
It might have been

710
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,770
crushed by the soil.

711
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,170
So, if we continue to use

712
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,450
our previous way of excavation,

713
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,840
I think there will be severe damages.

714
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,780
I suggest

715
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,580
using the way of overall extraction

716
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,190
to take the whole Bronze Chariot and Horse out.

717
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,670
Then send it to a safe lab as soon as possible.

718
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,420
That's right. Come here.

719
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,860
Come on. Come down.

720
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,550
Come here.

721
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,250
Great!

722
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,690
Come down.

723
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,680
I found it.

724
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,560
Recently, a group of archaeologists

725
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,850
have found a large number of suspected historical relics

726
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,440
of the Qin dynasty in the Xiyang Village,

727
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,470
which is under Mount Li in Shaanxi Province.

728
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,370
Three pits of Terra-cotta Warriors have been discovered so far,

729
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,310
They occupy an area of 3,500 square meters.

730
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,850
Bronze swords,

731
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,940
the One Chariot and Six Horses

732
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,670
and many other relics were also discovered at the same time.

733
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,700
The experts said

734
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,520
the excavation this time has a great meaning

735
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,640
to the historical research.

736
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,830
It has filled in

737
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,140
the gap of history

738
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,810
of the Warring States in ancient China to a large extent.

739
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,790
At the same time,

740
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,250
the discovery of Terra-cotta Warriors

741
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,600
and many Bronze Chariot and Horse sculptures

742
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,800
is very likely to prove the theory

743
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,020
proposed by the academic circles

744
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,230
that the State of Qin unified the other six states

745
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,500
and established the first

746
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,810
feudal dynasty in China.

747
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,910
To you, the hero.

748
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,830
A toast to you.

749
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:30,870
Cheers.

750
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,740
Good.

751
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Come on.

752
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,780
Actually,

753
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,540
what I did

754
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,530
is just a small favor.

755
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,640
This is not a small favor.

756
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,670
It's really a small favor.

757
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,530
The chariot sculptures

758
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,380
and the bronze

759
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,610
artifacts we had found

760
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,690
were taken by me to the lab

761
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,380
for a comparison.

762
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,170
Guess what?

763
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,740
Standard quality.

764
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,190
All those several Bronze Chariot and Horse sculptures can be switched with each other.

765
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,300
This is a miracle.

766
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,690
I'll report to my superiors tomorrow

767
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,720
and apply for more funds to

768
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,540
organize a team

769
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,650
and conduct emergent excavation.

770
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,490
We might have other new discoveries.

771
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,290
Professor,

772
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,380
I have a concern.

773
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,080
I think

774
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,080
our current technology

775
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,690
isn't good enough to protect these relics.

776
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,240
As you could see,

777
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,660
when the Terra-cotta Warriors had just been dug out,

778
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,630
the color was so bright.

779
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:28,850
They were vivid.

780
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,810
After they were exposed to the air

781
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,980
for a while,

782
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,410
the color was gone.

783
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,030
I think

784
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,300
the two pits of Terra-cotta Warriors we've found

785
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,200
are enough for you to study

786
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,480
for a period of time.

787
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,800
It's a worldwide problem.

788
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,600
When those ancient mineral paints

789
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,770
meet air and light,

790
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,870
they'll be oxidized instantly.

791
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,700
No one can solve this problem in the world.

792
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,420
You have a foresight in this.

793
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,440
As an old archaeologist,

794
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,670
I should learn from you.

795
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,050
Cheers.

796
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,410
-I just think... -Good.

797
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,000
In terms of the number

798
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,520
of the Terra-cotta Warriors we've found,

799
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,750
it's enough to turn this place

800
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,820
into a tourist spot,

801
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,020
-Good. -...to help the villagers here

802
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,540
get rich.

803
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,040
Good.

804
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,530
As for the rest,

805
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,910
we can wait

806
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,410
till the technology

807
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,840
gets maturer and then dig them out.

808
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,410
After all,

809
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,510
excessive excavation of relics

810
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,960
leads to destruction of relics

811
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,610
and shows disrespect for history.

812
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,280
Professor Qin.

813
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,570
You're right.

814
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,450
The bronze sword we had found

815
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,860
was bent with the angle of 45° at first.

816
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,360
When we tried to move it away,

817
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,350
it became straight so suddenly.

818
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,500
I was sweating all over.

819
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,850
I took it to the lab

820
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,730
and tested it.

821
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,590
There's a layer of

822
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,450
calcium salt compound on the surface.

823
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,240
This chrome-plating technology

824
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,780
has existed for less than 100 years.

825
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,420
But it was found in the Qin Dynasty tomb.

826
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,190
What does this mean?

827
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,860
It means we don't know much

828
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,580
of our ancestors' wisdom.

829
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,320
Here's another dish for you.

830
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,570
This problem should be left

831
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,460
to the descendants.

832
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,100
What wine is this?

833
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,320
The dishes are not all served yet.

834
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,430
-Forgive me for being drunk. -Look at you.

835
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,420
So you know you're drunk.

836
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,820
Don't drink if you can't hold it.

837
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,250
I made so many dishes,

838
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,240
but you vomited all of them.

839
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,540
I shouldn't have made them for you.

840
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,680
Why did I have to bother?

841
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,240
It's all in vain.

842
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:27,910
Be careful.

843
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,410
Lie down.

844
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,140
Don't go.

845
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,880
Go to sleep.

846
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,380
Come here.

847
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,440
Talk with me.

848
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,710
Okay. Don't.

849
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,940
Come here.

850
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,980
I can't sleep.

851
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,940
I feel so dizzy.

852
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,430
Don't throw up on me.

853
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,260
If you dare to throw up on me,

854
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,320
I'll put it all

855
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,220
back into your mouth.

856
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,460
Do you know

857
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,240
how the people from 2,000 years ago

858
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,440
lived differently from the people

859
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,139
of the current society?

860
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,770
That's nonsense.

861
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,750
There was no computer 2,000 years ago.

862
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,620
No mobile phone.

863
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,940
Life was so easy back then.

864
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,949
Worked after sunrise and rested after sunset.

865
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,889
Had two meals a day, washed the hair every three days,

866
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,580
and took a bath every five days.

867
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,210
When it got dark,

868
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,310
people would go home.

869
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,030
The only recreation at night was...

870
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,370
What was it?

871
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:36,750
I don't know.

872
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,530
Actually, at that time,

873
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,540
marriage was arranged by parents and matchmakers.

874
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,850
There was no love, either.

875
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,139
The night life back then

876
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,219
was boring.

877
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,980
Who said there was no love back then?

878
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,949
I know a story

879
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,150
which happened in the Qin dynasty.

880
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,710
It's about a terra-cotta warrior

881
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,440
falling in love with

882
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,560
a girl from reincarnation.

883
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,530
It's fabricated, isn't it?

884
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,610
Can a terra-cotta warrior fall in love?

885
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,370
Of course. Let me tell you.

886
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,180
In order to

887
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,280
achieve immortality, the First Emperor of Qin

888
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,720
asked Xu Fu to sail eastward and look for immortals.

889
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,720
A maiden named Han Dong'er

890
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,250
fell in love with an official named Meng Tianfang.

891
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,130
When the Emperor of Qin found out,

892
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,500
he was very angry,

893
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,710
so he killed

894
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,180
both of them.

895
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,110
Before the maiden

896
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,430
Han Dong'er died,

897
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,780
she put the medicine

898
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,060
for immortal life,

899
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,800
which she had stolen from Xu Fu,

900
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,940
into Meng Tianfang's mouth,

901
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,320
and then jumped into the fire.

902
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,180
Meng Tianfang

903
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,250
was made into a terra-cotta warrior

904
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,180
to guard the mausoleum for thousands of years.

905
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,540
Guess

906
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,110
when they met each other again.

907
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,780
I don't know.

908
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,450
After three lifetimes.

909
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,150
After three lifetimes,

910
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,310
the maiden Han Dong'er was reincarnated,

911
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,170
and was called Xu Xiaojing.

912
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,120
She met Meng Tianfang.

913
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,450
The two of them

914
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,330
were together again.

915
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,690
Three lifetimes.

916
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,180
After the three lifetimes,

917
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,710
Meng Tianfang

918
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,760
could recognize this woman?

919
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,150
Why couldn't he recognize her?

920
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,100
Take myself as an example.

921
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,120
Even after 2,000 years,

922
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,130
even if I return to

923
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,350
the original world,

924
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,480
I will remember you

925
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,060
and fall in love with you deeply.

926
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,490
I will never leave you.

927

♫I thought no matter how dark the city was♫

928

is real.

943
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,500

♫I'll give you whatever you want♫

Zhang Ye.

951
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,690
the D University has invited me

952
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,060
to talk about the Terra-cotta Warriors.

953
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,100
I'm too busy to go.

954
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,530
You participated in the whole process

955
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,670
of excavation at the archaeological site.

956
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,190
Meet the students on my behalf.

957
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,050
[D University]

958
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,370
About the discovery process of the Terra-cotta Warriors,

959
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,140
that's all for today.

960
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,690
Great! Great!

961
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,900
Just talk like that later.

962
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,220
Just get ready.

963
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,870
It's time.

964
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,750
Why haven't they arrived yet?

965
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,400
I'll go take a look.

966
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,620
They're coming.

967
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,030
They're coming.

968
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,670
It's about the Terra-cotta Warriors.

969
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,610
Come and learn about Zhang Ye.

970
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,630
The eighth wonder of the world

971
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,510
is right in this classroom.

972
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,160
There are Terra-cotta Warriors inside.

973
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,350
The Terra-cotta Warriors owned by the the First Qin Emperor.

974
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,700
The eighth wonder of the world.

975
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,190
Excuse me.

976
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,540
Where are you going for class?

977
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,360
We're going to the classroom next door for the classical literature

978
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,950
of Dream of the Red Chamber.

979
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,560
Hurry up. Let's go.

980
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,700
Right behind this door.

981
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,560
Come and learn about it.

982
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,410
The Terra-cotta Warriors.

983
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,550
Dream of the Red Chamber. The Classical Literature.

984
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,320
Go inside. Go inside.

985
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,470
Right inside this classroom.

986
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,530
As the last of China's Four Great Classic Novels,

987
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,240
Dream of the Red Chamber

988
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,930
was written by Mr. Cao Xueqin

989
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,530
from the Qing dynasty.

990
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,240
Its background was based on the rise and fall of

991
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,270
such four families as Jia, Shi, Wang and Xue.

992
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,130
With the perspective of Jia Baoyu, a boy

993
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,890
from a rich family,

994
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,160
it depicts the vicissitudes of life

995
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,000
for a group of young ladies

996
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,920
who had better manners and knowledge than men.

997
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,590
It shows the beauty of humanity

998
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,010
and the beauty of a tragedy.

999
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,670
We can say it's an epic work

1000
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,130
which describes feminine beauty from various angles,

1001
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,220
and different aspects of life

1002
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,760
in the ancient society of China.

1003
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,910
But there's a big flaw

1004
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,580
for the ending of the novel.

1005
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,020
It contradicts

1006
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,420
the first half of the novel in many aspects.

1007
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,940
I don't know whether it was written mistakenly by Mr. Cao Xueqin,

1008
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,550
or he wrote it like that on purpose.

1009
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,340
Maybe Mr. Cao Xueqin

1010
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,410
fell ill in his late years,

1011
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,190
so he failed to

1012
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,090
write this masterpiece in a more careful way.

1013
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,480
That's why

1014
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,950
problems and flaws appeared

1015
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,840
one after another.

1016
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,300
Ma'am.

1017
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,220
Who is he?

1018
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,010
Who is he?

1019
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,010
Who is this?

1020
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,820
I've never seen him before.

1021
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,840
He talked to the teacher at the door.

1022
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,020
I think the reason why there are many

1023
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,890
logical problems and contradictions

1024
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,080
in Dream of the Red Chamber

1025
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,210
is that the last forty chapters

1026
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,100
of this novel

1027
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,470
were not written by Cao Xueqin.
