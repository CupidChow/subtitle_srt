4
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,910
Why did you inform him?

5
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,700
You should catch him

6
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,789
and break his legs.

7
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,620
Exactly.

8
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,830
If he really ran away,

9
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,550
you won't be able to explain.

10
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,150
The result doesn't matter when dealing with someone like him.

11
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,280
If I

12
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,130
file a lawsuit against him,

13
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,860
he will lose.

14
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,490
He'll be sentenced to three years or five years.

15
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,330
I think

16
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,670
this punishment means nothing for him.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,670
I want him to know

18
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,970
the feeling of having to hide

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,330
all his life.

20
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,500
We should

21
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,670
get rid of him completely.

22
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,790
What is

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,880
to get rid of him completely?

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,900
We should make him regret

25
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,350
from the bottom of his heart.

26
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,400
Have you been in a mental hospital

27
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,490
for a long time?

28
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,400
Why are you talking without any logic?

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,160
It seems that

30
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,310
you have reflected a lot in there.

31
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,450
Zhang Ye has grown up.

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,710
Have you ever thought of giving up?

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,240
If I give up,

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,360
what will you do?

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,040
I remember

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,620
what I have promised you.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,380
What did you promise her?

38
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,910
Nothing.

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,350
Just buy her more delicious food.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,660
Really?

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,540
Yes.

42
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,170
All you know is eating.

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,850
The program host,

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,710
program planner,

45
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,570
and writer Zhang Ye

46
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,530
who was hospitalized for mental problems,

47
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,950
recently escaped from the mental hospital.

48
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,320
It is reported that Zhang Ye had suffered from

49
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,600
severe schizophrenia

50
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,080
and was aggressive.

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,570
The police have now intervened in the investigation.

52
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,390
Citizens are requested to contact the police

53
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,840
as soon as possible after discovering his trace.

54
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,110
Tian Bin is so despicable.

55
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,110
I treated him so well

56
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,320
but he turned against me.

57
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,030
It's a modern version of

58
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,120
The Farmer and the Snake.

59
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,340
What do you mean?

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,040
It is a fable.

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,770
It tells the story of

62
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,150
a cold winter.

63
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,250
A poisonous snake

64
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,220
was frozen.

65
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,840
The farmer saw the frozen snake.

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,030
Out of sympathy,

67
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,560
he put it in his arms

68
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,750
to warm it up.

69
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,400
When the snake woke up,

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,510
out of the vicious nature,

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,740
it bit the farmer.

72
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,190
Before the farmer died,

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,430
he said, "since I chose to save this snake,

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,530
I should bear

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
the consequences of being bitten to death."

76
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,430
What time is it now?

77
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,720
Can you stop joking?

78
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,230
I think this story

79
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,760
is very educational.

80
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,330
Sometimes I wonder...

81
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,200
Zhang Ye, are you crazy?

82
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,180
Why do you have so many

83
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,100
strange ideas?

84
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,270
Haven't you heard of this story?

85
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,000
Then how about The Fox and the Grapes,

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,380
Crow drink water,

87
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,630
the Wolf and the Lamb,

88
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,730
or the Rabbit and the Tortoise?

89
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,350
Are you crazy?

90
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,830
Can you get down to business?

91
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,160
Stop talking about

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,580
the animals here.

93
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,230
I see.

94
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,910
I'm going to publish

95
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,970
a fable collection.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,860
What do you think?

97
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,310
Are you going to publish or copy?

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,060
It doesn't matter.

99
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,210
I just want to use these simple stories

100
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,860
to tell

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,700
the truth

102
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,450
that is often ignored in daily life

103
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,540
Wait.

104
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,280
She mentioned copy earlier. Whose work do you copy?

105
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,880
Not copy.

106
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,190
These stories

107
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,000
are told by

108
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,040
my friends from the mental hospital.

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,840
After staying inside for a long time,

110
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,890
I can't even tell

111
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,670
who is normal

112
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,760
and who is abnormal.

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,100
Anyway,

114
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,020
in this world,

115
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,840
there are always bad people who want to harm me.

116
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,100
I've suffered

117
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,180
as well as enjoyed.

118
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,600
Later I thought

119
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,590
why didn't I tell others

120
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,570
what I know,

121
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,760
and share my knowledge with people here

122
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,120
to benefit them.

123
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,480
I think you're really crazy.

124
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
One must be crazy to be successful.

125
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,120
You're a street rat now.

126
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,510
Stop thinking about useless things.

127
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,160
Unless Tian Bin

128
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,480
can prove your innocence.

129
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,470
Do you have a plan now?

130
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,390
Yes.

131
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,720
But I haven't figured out

132
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,659
how to implement it.

133
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,060
It's okay. Tell me first.

134
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,000
Look.

135
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,880
I called Tian Bin.

136
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,770
I think we can scare him.

137
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,630
He won't be able to

138
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,710
cause any trouble in a while.

139
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,040
So?

140
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,010
My guardian and job can wait

141
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,110
for now.

142
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,850
The most important thing at this moment is

143
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,000
to find a place to live.

144
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,380
I can't go back

145
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,460
to the mansion again.

146
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,320
Now, I don't have any money

147
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,550
or a house to live in.

148
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,480
I thought it was something more difficult.

149
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,570
It's no big deal.

150
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,110
You can stay at my place.

151
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,420
What's wrong?

152
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,620
Didn't he

153
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,710
used to stay at my place?

154
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,720
But I think

155
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,750
it's better to stay here.

156
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,350
Tian Bin has known

157
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,430
your address.

158
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,450
It's not safe for Zhang Ye to stay there.

159
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,020
Besides, if he stays here,

160
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,620
Nan can take care of him.

161
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:21,930
Yeah.

162
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,000
I can take care of them.

163
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,750
I'm here. I don't need Nan's care.

164
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,170
I think he's used to

165
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,260
staying at my place.

166
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,720
Your place is icily.

167
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,460
It doesn't feel like home at all.

168
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,880
He's not used to it.

169
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,680
Time is running out.

170
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,770
We don't have time

171
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,850
to fight over.

172
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,240
Can you stop being so willful?

173
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,440
Who are you calling willful?

174
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,970
You said I was willful?

175
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,820
Shut up.

176
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,940
I'm willful?

177
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,470
You think you are the only one who have thought it over?

178
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,170
Let me tell you.

179
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,630
Firstly, I'm not your fan.

180
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,020
Secondly, I don't rely on you to make a living.

181
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,350
Don't try to overrule me

182
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,950
with your superstar identity.

183
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,310
But you have to admit that

184
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,280
in all aspects,

185
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,510
staying at my place

186
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,250
is the best.

187
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,350
I don't think so.

188
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's vote then.

189
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,920
Don't be like this.

190
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,400
Listen to me.

191
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,880
-Men shouldn't interrupt when women are talking. -Men shouldn't interrupt when women are talking.

192
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,800
I give up.

193
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,750
Alright, let's vote.

194
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,560
Raise your hand if you agree to live with me.

195
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,300
Two to one.

196
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,140
Stay at my place.

197
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,500
What are you worried about?

198
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,630
Why are you here?

199
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,620
These two women

200
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,280
fight over me every day.

201
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,680
I feel bad.

202
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,310
And they both do it out of good will.

203
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,160
What should I do?

204
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,700
You...

205
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,790
You're just not confident.

206
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,910
How about having some Confidence Potion?

207
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,680
New flavor, new recipe.

208
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,000
It's stronger than before.

209
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,670
After drinking it,

210
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,530
you can have whatever you want.

211
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,690
I don't want it. Take it away.

212
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,070
This is an improved formula.

213
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Not toxic, without any side effects.

214
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,640
And not addictive.

215
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,990
You can enjoy

216
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,080
the utmost happiness in the world without any worries.

217
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,360
It's really not addictive at all?

218
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,370
Of course.

219
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,360
I pledge by the credit of our planet.

220
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,700
Do you want to try?

221
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,540
What credibility does your planet have?

222
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,690
No.

223
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,310
Since you're an old client,

224
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,700
buy one and get one free.

225
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,310
What do you think?

226
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,400
I told you.

227
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,140
I don't want it.

228
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,130
Don't waste my time.

229
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,140
Just go.

230
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,380
All right.

231
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,940
By the way,

232
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,690
we have a new product

233
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,030
called A Vanished Dream.

234
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,500
After using it,

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,310
many people have no more desires and choose to become monks.

236
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,510
No more desires

237
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,880
and become a monk?

238
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,060
No, no, no.

239
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,750
They are experiencing the beauty of life

240
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,870
without worries.

241
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,320
Do you want to try?

242
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,300
Is your product

243
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,160
safe?

244
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,320
Did you pass the test?

245
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,510
Safe.

246
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,210
We've been clinically tested

247
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,320
10000 times.

248
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,920
You just had a dream.

249
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,620
Other than that,

250
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,720
nothing else.

251
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,180
Forget it.

252
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,400
It won't solve the problem.

253
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,900
During the promotion period,

254
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,280
it's all free.

255
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,720
These are all for free.

256
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,800
Help yourself.

257
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,960
Didn't I tell you?

258
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,380
I don't want the Confidence Potion.

259
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,340
If you keep doing this,

260
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,630
I'll turn my back on you.

261
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,360
Are you serious?

262
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,420
Of course.

263
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,510
Let me tell you.

264
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,990
Zhang Ye now

265
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,970
is not the same Zhang Ye as before.

266
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,180
Just leave.

267
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,080
All right.

268
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,300
Let's not talk about this.

269
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,700
It's up to you.

270
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,020
This A Vanished Dream.

271
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,110
Stick to the body.

272
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,390
She is annoyed.

273
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,980
It's your fault.

274
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,230
Move your brother's stuff here

275
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,320
tomorrow.

276
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,820
Zhang Ye!

277
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,550
Zhang Ye!

278
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,910
Zhang Ye!

279
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,130
Come here.

280
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,330
Zhang Ye has a stroke.

281
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,770
Zhang Ye!

282
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,940
Zhang Ye!

283
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,240
Zhang Ye!

284
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,820
Hurry up! He has a stroke.

285
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,380
What's wrong?

286
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,260
He has a stroke.

287
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,600
Hurry up, he is vomiting.

288
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,750
What's going on?

289
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,610
I'll get an ambulance.

290
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,700
No, come back.

291
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,910
We just saved him.

292
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,730
We can't send him back anymore.

293
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,840
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

294
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,370
Let me do it.

295
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,270
Zhang Ye, wake up!

296
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,900
Wake up!

297
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,910
Zhang Ye.

298
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,910
He is feeling terrible.

299
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,790
-We should go to the hospital. -Right.

300
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,980
No.

301
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,130
If we send him to the hospital,

302
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,700
all our efforts these days

303
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,790
are in vain.

304
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,550
If you don't send him to the hospital, I'll.

305
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,190
What if something happens?

306
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,500
If you don't care, I will.

307
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,310
Zhang Ye bought me

308
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,390
quite a lot of delicious food.

309
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,670
I think we should send him to the hospital.

310
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,430
You're not helping him,

311
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,860
but harming him.

312
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,660
Say it again.

313
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm telling you, I've had enough of you.

314
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,780
-Fine. -Say it again!

315
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,790
Say it again.

316
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,660
Sister-in-law.

317
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,820
Who? What sister-in-law?

318
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,920
Sister-in-law.

319
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,570
We're not sure yet.

320
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,720
Who is your sister-in-law?

321
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,360
Zhang Ye, you're awake.

322
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,980
Are you okay?

323
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm fine.

324
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,630
I just

325
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,060
fell asleep.

326
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,590
I think we should put aside

327
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,010
the problem about where I live.

328
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,860
We should deal with the problem of

329
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,230
the guardian first.

330
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,550
Otherwise, after a few days,

331
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,150
the police will come to us.

332
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,320
Okay.

333
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,840
If I were your real brother,

334
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,930
this would be easy.

335
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,490
How about

336
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,690
doing a DNA test?

337
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,000
Right? Sister-in-law.

338
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,310
I think this might work.

339
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,870
Just have a try.

340
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,770
Did he ask you?

341
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,030
She's asking me.

342
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,290
Can't I even say a word?

343
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,380
Does he call you sister-in-law?

344
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,470
I am.

345
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,200
Zhang Ye.

346
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,800
Brother.

347
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,120
Why did he faint again?

348
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,880
Zhang Ye!

349
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,320
Slap him!

350
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,650

You do it.

You can do it.

Nothing.

Look.

This is a little gift.

You don't understand.

I mean

388
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,990
the result comes out so fast.

389
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,300
It needs some extra fee,

390
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:47,820
right?

391

Suddenly,

you became my brother.

No wonder when I see you,

401
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,290
I felt

402
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,570
a familiar feeling.

403
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,960
You are my actual brother.

404

Brother, let's go home and see our parents.

405

Don't.

Our parents are old.

I'm afraid they can't accept

such a surprise.

410

So,

411
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,340
it's enough for me to know now that

412
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,820
they are my biological parents.

413

when I was born?

Why do you ask?

428

I want to calculate my birthday horoscope.

429
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,020
Ten o'clock.

430
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,320
I remember it very clearly.

431
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,990
I was at work that day.

432
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,440
I just sat down.

433
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,310
The hospital called me

434
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,940
saying you were going to give birth.

435
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,150
I didn't have time to apply for leave.

436
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,840
I went to the hospital and you were born.

437
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,380
That's enough.

You got it all wrong. What ten o'clock?

439

I gave birth at the hospital that day.

440
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,300
And there were many people

441

giving birth that day.

442
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,500
They gave birth

quickly.

Just you.

460

You were the only one that day.

461

There were many pregnant women that day.

A lot.

463
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,490

the new-born babies were all boys.

There were two couples.

472

Their children grew up.

473
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,400
And they found that

474

their children don't look like them.

475
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,820
So they took their children to the hospital

476
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,770
for a paternity test.

477

Guess what?

478

527
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,830
and stay at home longer.

528
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,870
I need to go and clean our house.

529
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,700
-Hot meal is here. -Delicious.

530
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,850
It's delicious.

531
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,930
Eat more.

532
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,550
Zhang Ye,

533
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,900
are you born with this nose?

534
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,230
Yes.

535
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,340
It looks just like your godmother's.

536
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,020
Do you think my nose

537
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,340
looks like my godmother's?

538
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,910
I also think my nose

539
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,900
looks like my godmother's.

540
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:16,990
Not just nose.

541
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,860
Look.

542
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,460
We have similar eyes.

543
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,230
Also,

544
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,120
my godmother has

545
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,100
three moles on the back.

546
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,180
I have them too.

547
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,220
Ye.

548
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,310
Where are you from?

549
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,360
I am a local.

550
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,820
A local?

551
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,960
Why does your accent

552
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,040
sound like Yunnan's accent?

553
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,510
Yunnan?

554
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,140
Impossible.

555
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,700
I've never been to Yunnan.

556
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,190
Why didn't I know

557
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,350
he has a Yunnan accent?

558
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,520
When I was young,

559
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,590
I was a passionate young man.

560
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,630
When I heard that the country needed us,

561
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,210
I went to Yunnan Mountain areas

562
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,670
to teach there without hesitation.

563
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,060
I stayed there for three years.

564
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,300
Without your support,

565
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,860
how could I

566
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,070
leave my best time

567
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,110
there?

568
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,750
Now that I think about it,

569
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,960
I still have a lot of precious memories.

570
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,720
Dad, have some dumplings.

571
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,210
Are there more dumplings, mom?

572
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,610
It's all soggy.

573
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,680
Mom, do you have more hot dumplings?

574
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,540
Dumplings?

575
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,860
Dumplings. Yes.

576
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,940
I'll get it.

577
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,890
It's leaked.

578
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,130
Actually, it's not that similar.

579
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,070
Right? Not really.

580
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,940
It's normal.

581
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,770
I have eyes without the same size.

582
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,940
But my godmother doesn't.

583
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,270
Not that similar.

584
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,200
Not that much.

585
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,960
Yes.

586
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,400
Let's eat dumplings.

587
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,820
There are two plates of dumplings left.

588
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,590
Why is there only one left?

589
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,740
Where are my dumplings?

590
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,940
The dumplings mom made

591
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,950
can also make one cry.

592
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,220
Earthmen are

593
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,480
really complicated creatures.

594
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,760
Their homemade dishes

595
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,240
are even more mysterious.

596
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,230
I've added another 10000 home-cooked dishes into my list.

597
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,510
Where should we start?

598
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,690
Look how happy the whole family is.

599
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,230
Yes.

600
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,310
Kid.

601
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,160
From now on,

602
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,800
take this place as your home.

603
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,620
No matter how many

604
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,710
difficulties you encounter outside,

605
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,240
godmother and godfather

606
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,560
are always your harbor.

607
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:46,880
Okay.

608
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,630
Your nails are too long.

609
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,060
Let me cut it for you.

610
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,900
No need.

611
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,980
I can do it myself.

612
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,890
Don't by shy.

613
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,570
You just recovered.

614
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,700
Let me help you.

615
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,790
Give me a piece of paper.

616
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,360
Come on.

617
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,040
Godmother is so nice to me.

618
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,840
Even better than my own mother.

619
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,780
Your nails on this hand

620
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,890
are also a bit long.

621
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,490
I'll do it for you too.

622
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,740
My godparents are so nice to me.

623
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,190
They are even better than my own parents.

624
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,510
I'm so happy.

625
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,470
Parents' love for me

626
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,020
is too cruel.

627
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,490
Doctor,

628
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,120
I want to verify

629
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,710
whether

630
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,310
they are father and son?

631
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,280
Sure.

632
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,360
How long will it take?

633
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,550
It is very quick.

634
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,640
Put your things here.

635
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,920
And pay the fee there.

636
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,460
Okay.

637
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,430
Why are you here?

638
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,430
Why are you here?

639
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,520
Why are you here?

640
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,570
Why am I here?

641
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,670
You did it yourself.

642
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,470
You dare to ask me.

643
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,410
Don't you know?

644
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,540
I did?

645
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,430
What did I do?

646
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,750
When you were teaching there,

647
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,830
I was at home alone

648
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,480
and took care of the child.

649
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,590
You were there.

650
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,530
You found another woman

651
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,090
and had a child.

652
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,330
You lived a happy life.

653
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,760
You're talking nonsense.

654
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,430
Now you're accusing me

655
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,910
and putting the blame on me.

656
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,150
You know what?

657
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,720
The DNA comparison.

658
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,550
The DNA comparison

659
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,170
is

660
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,900
99.99 percent.

661
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,250
What does it mean?

662
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:15,780
It means the two children

663
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,340
were born by you.

664
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,620
But it has nothing to do with me.

665
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,720
Understand?

666
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,620
I married you

667
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,950
because you have a good temper.

668
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,990
Now that not only did you cheat on me,

669
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,190
you even dare to throw a tantrum at me.

670
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,190
Fine.

671
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,880
Let me tell you.

672
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,330
We have to do this DNA test today!

673
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,420
Yes.

674
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,090
Go, go, go.

675
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,350
Come in.

676
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,980
Go in.

677
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,340
Let me see.

678
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:40,950
[Kinship Determined]

679
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,980
[Kinship Determined]

680
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,780
This...

681
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,360
This...

682
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,820
Zhang Ye is my son.

683
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,430
He's also my son.

684
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,470
So, this means...

685
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,240
They are our children?

686
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,820
Well, if you...

687
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,220
If you told me you were having twins,

688
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,960
I would be so happy.

689
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,530
No one told me

690
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,770
I had twins.

691
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,770
Besides,

692
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,730
when I was pregnant,

693
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,780
my belly wasn't that big.

694
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,880
Think about it.

695
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,820
What should I think about?

696
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,100
It must be...

697
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,180
It is...

698
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,150
You know what?

699
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,740
I remember

700
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,660
when I was pregnant,

701
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,240
I could eat a lot, right?

702
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,170
I could eat the equivalent food amount of three people

703
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,250
all by myself.

704
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,020
Maybe...

705
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,920
it was twins.

706
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,620
The hospital must have made a mistake.

707
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,490
Not to mention,

708
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,700
Zhang Ye's eyes and nose

709
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,780
really resemble yours.

710
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,690
Yes.

711
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,770
Right?

712
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,770
This part, he looks like me too.

713
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,690
I think so.

714
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,370
Well, how can he

715
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,600
be someone else's child?

716
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,090
Right?

717
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,180
Yes.

718
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,760
He is ours.

719
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,510
Godfather, godmother.

720
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,640
My son.

721
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,610
My son.

722
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,420
I miss you so much.

723
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,060
Son.

724
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,980
I miss you so much.

725
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,630
Son.

726
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,460
I miss you so much.

727
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,040
Wait.

728
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,710
Wait.

729
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,040
-You are my son. -Wait, wait.

730
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,040
You are my son.

731
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,740
Take a good look.

732
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,820
Let me see.

733
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,630
Wait a minute.

734
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,360
Son, let me take a good look.

735
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,890
Son.

736
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,030
Dad, mom.

737
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,720
My son.

738
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,060
Son!

739
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,400
It's a son.

740
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,060
Someone is missing.

741
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,270
The food won't taste good.

742
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,390
Stop eating.

743
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,200
Chi'ou is still hungry.

744
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,420
No, no, no.

745
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,300
I will eat.

746
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,930
Eat, so delicious.

747
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,550
Delicious.

748
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,610
It smells so good.

749
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,340
You make it very delicious.

750
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,400
Dad.

751
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,650
Son.

752
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,810
Mom.

753
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,990
Son.

754
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:24,900
Brother.

755
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,970
Brother.

756
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:27,720
Cheers.

757
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,150
Come on.

758
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,230
Come on.

759
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,500
Cheers.

760
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,690
Fine.

761
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,570
I'll tell you.

762
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,700
Don't cry.

763
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,460
Today is a family reunion.

764
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,720
It is a happy thing.

765
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,890
Yes.

766
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,170
I'm just happy.

767
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:46,940
Mom.

768
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,020
Do you know

769
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,340
what this is called?

770
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,200
Peace in the world.

771
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,380
Peace and stability.

772
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,110
Peace in all seasons.

773
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,840
Great.

774
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,910
We have four people in our family,

775
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,020
we can play mahjong together.

776
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,590
Mom, I don't know how to play mahjong.

777
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,880
Neither can I.

778
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,820
You can't? Then...

779
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,139
Then you should all get married.

780
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,320
Bring your wife back.

781
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,560
Our family will have six people then.

782
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,610
If we have six people,

783
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,000
we can play Chinese poker.

784
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,030
Six people are better.

785
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,739
Everything goes well.

786
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,820
Dad, right?

787
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,610
Look at our family.

788
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,100
Can this place hold six people?

789
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,500
Besides, I don't even have

790
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,090
a girlfriend now.

791
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,449
You always talk about

792
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,560
meaningless things all the time.

793
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,690
It seems that

794
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,750
I don't need you

795
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,110
to have a grandchild.

796
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,150
You can't count on me.

797
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,510
What about you?

798
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,980
When will you

799
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,620
bring back your girlfriend for me?

800
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,130
Okay.

801
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,630
Let's eat.

802
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,300
Let's eat.

803
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,060
Let's eat.

804
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,640
Who is it?

805
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,420
What are you doing?

806
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,830
Didn't you have a reunion dinner?

807
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,510
Without you,

808
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,740
how can this be a reunion dinner?

809
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,470
Sweet words.

810
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,400
I came back because I missed you.

811
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,360
Cut it out.

812
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,720
You're glib-tongued.

813
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,090
I'm not glib-tongued.

814
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,700
It's true love.

815
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,420
Unlike someone,

816
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,850
stubborn but soft-hearted.

817
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,620
Who is soft-hearted?

818
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,710
I never do that.

819
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,800
I wonder

820
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,910
who was in a hurry to save me.

821
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,770
She cried and wanted to marry me.

822
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,490
Don't be shameless.

823
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,660
Let's celebrate.

824
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,350
Celebrate what?

825
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,520
To live.

826
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,830
To freedom.

827
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,760
To be with someone you love.

828
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,280
Isn't it worth celebrating?

829
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,730
♫Look at the bright fireworks in the sky♫

830
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,340
♫They are in your eyes♫

831
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,330
♫That's the gentleness hidden in my hands♫

832
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,100
♫Slipping by quietly♫

833
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,860
♫You are the reason I fall in love♫

834
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,390
♫I want to hold your hand♫

835
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:32,080
♫The time stops when I'm looking at you♫

836
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,830
♫You're enough♫

837
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:43,110
♫I want to be with you♫

838
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,430
♫Collect happy memories♫

839
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,390
♫And fill up all your wishes♫

840
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,990
♫It's the way I love you♫

841
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,040
♫You just lean on my shoulder♫

842
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,430
♫The night is long♫

843
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,670
♫You're the warmest light♫

844
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,560
♫I can't forget♫

845
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,150
When I was homeless,

846
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,470
you took me in.

847
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,770
I think this is fate.

848
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,440
I took you in because of Chi'ou.

849
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,520
I don't care.

850
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,670
Anyway,

851
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,230
I was like a duck.

852
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,870
I was...

853
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,430
The moment I broke my shell,

854
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,520
whoever I target

855
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,050
will be mine.

856
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,180
I'll watch her for the rest of my life.

857
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,900
The first person you saw

858
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,180
was

859
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,190
still Chi'ou.

860
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,140
I can distinguish between dogs and humans.

861
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,330
I said it's human.

862
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,990
I said it's a human, not a dog.

863
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,430
Don't say that as if

864
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,690
when I saw you,

865
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,180
you were just born.

866
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,090
When I saw you,

867
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,280
you mistook me for someone else.

868
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,640
You called me Wang.

869
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,440
I don't care.

870
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,230
The life before I met you,

871
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,610
is my previous one.

872
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,100
After I met you,

873
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,840
this life has just begun.

874
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,400
You are you.

875
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,740
You are

876
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,410
the most unique person in this world.

877
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,220
I don't know

878
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,330
if you believe it or not.

879
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,410
But

880
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,390
I mean it.

881
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,320
Scissors.

882
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,180
Drink it.

883
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,750
The moon is so beautiful.

884
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,400
What are you doing?

885
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,820
I...

886
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,930
Nothing.

887
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,630
No.

888
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,600
Didn't you just look at the moon?

889
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,910
Yes, look at the moon.

890
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,360
-Look at the moon. -I... I am not cold.

891
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,110
I'm not cold.

892
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,110
Look at the moon.

893
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,830
The moon is so beautiful.

894
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,810
Do you want to see the sunrise?

895
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,870
If you want,

896
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,580
I'll watch it with you.

897
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,560
♫Look at the bright fireworks in the sky♫

898
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,910

899

900

901

00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,060
♫I want to hold your hand♫

903
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:08,730
