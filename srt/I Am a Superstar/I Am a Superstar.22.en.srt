Um... Eight of Characters?

10
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,660
Sorry, I knocked them down by accident.

11
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,829
Why was I so careless?

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,690
One of Circles can also do?

13
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,630
Look, is this it?

14

Well...

No hurry.

Take your time scratching yourself.

18
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,710
Yeah, well.

19
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,200
Think about all the Circles and Bamboos and stuff.

20
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,010
Don't hurry.

21

Otherwise it's easy to get a heart attack.

in the middle of the night?

Professor Wu, why are you here?

72
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,490
What a coincidence.

73
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,090
I think so too.

74
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,630
No, it's really a coincidence.

75
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,850
I even can't imagine this in a drama.

Nothing.

79
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:03,930
By the way,

80
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,700
I've asked experts

81
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,970
to look at the two ancient books you left me.

82
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,440
They are authentic.

83
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,440
They cover

84
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,780
a lot of information

85
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,490
that we can't even imagine.

86
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,090
The academic status of Dream of the Red Chamber

87
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,810
has been changed in the books.

88
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,520
There are lots of things at school,

89
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,810
so I came here

90
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
to study

91
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,700
in a peaceful mind.

92
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,610
Actually,

93
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,910
Dream of the Red Chamber is a wonderful book.

94
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,100
If you understand it,

95
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,730
you will find that

96
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,360
not only it has literary value,

97
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,320
history value,

98
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,380
but also folklore value.

99
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,270
Since we hit it off with each other so much,

100
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,420
let me give you some advice.

101
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,460
How about

102
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,580
not limiting academics

103
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,659
within the campus?

104
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,810
I can introduce a video website

105
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,570
to you.

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,460
You can do

107
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,250
a theme program there

108
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,620
focused on Dream of the Red Chamber.

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,020
I'm sure it's gonna be a hit.

110
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,100
You really are an amazing person.

111
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,140
You are good at poetry and songs.

112
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,450
You even know archaeology.

113
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,700
I asked someone

114
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,270
about your discovery of Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor.

115
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,340
It's a complete turnaround for the history.

116

That's the eighth wonder of the world.

Well... I was just lucky.

118

It's just a coincidence.

119
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,720
Lucky?

120
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,120
Why were you sighing if you're lucky?

121

According to my observation,

150
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,680
you want a Four of Characters or a One of Characters.

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,870
What do you mean?

179
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,370
Someone wants Mr. Zhang

180
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,030
to come over for a talk.

181
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,690
Who is it?

182
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,690
You'll know when you get there.

183
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,380
This way, please.

184
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,300
You're really making this serious.

185
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,880
Welcome, Mr. Zhang.

186
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,680
Welcome.

187
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,860
I've been waiting for you.

188
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,000
Cut the crap. Just cut to the chase.

189
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,660
You're straight.

190
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,400
Then let's

191
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,580
be frank.

192
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,300
Mr. Zhang,

193
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,020
if you give up the competition,

194
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,050
all these will be yours.

195
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,220
For the rest of your life,

196
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,860
just do whatever you want

197
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,690
and enjoy yourself.

198
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,500
I didn't do this quite well.

199
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,160
Why are you behaving like

200
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,450
you're acting in a movie?

201
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,940
If I don't take the money,

202
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,010
will someone

203
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,170
come out and kill me later?

204
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,560
What are you talking about?

205
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,850
Harmony brings wealth.

206
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,680
Harmony brings wealth.

207
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,400
Well, so far as we know,

208
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
your financial status

209
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,350
doesn't look good recently, right?

210
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,170
There are a few companies

211
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,400
going to sue you.

212
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,480
Yeah, and you know that?

213
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,490
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,320
But I do need that ring.

215
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
Sorry I can't do what you want me to.

216
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,370
I thought

217
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,510
I could see

218
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,830
some new tricks here.

219
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,060
Boring.

220
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,840
Mr. Zhang, do you talk more?

221
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,010
See you.

222
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,890
See you.

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,620
Here.

224
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,210
Don't worry.

225
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,530
What took you so long?

226
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,650
I got lost.

227
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,820
I'm telling you.

228
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,740
This hotel is like a maze.

229
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,980
I've never walked back

230
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,940
on my own for once.

231
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,000
Mom, is there any secret

232
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
of playing mahjong?

233
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,010
You don't even know this?

234
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,650
How did you win?

235
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,380
Isn't your son lucky?

236
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,800
Wait a minute.

237
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,150
Hold on. Stop.

238
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,080
Just stop for a while.

239
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,300
Son, let me tell you.

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,860
There are secrets of playing mahjong.

241
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,860
Start off with a South tile, and you don't regret.

242
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,640
Start off with a North tile, and you don't regret.

243
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,400
Don't Discard Little Chick right away if you draw one,

244
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,540
unless you have two of them.

245
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,380
If you draw the same tile that you just discard...

246
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,180
-Alright, mom.
-Keep it.

247
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Mom, it's enough.

248
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,220
I need to go to the toilet.

249
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,230
No, son.

250
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,170
I haven't finished yet.

251
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,750
Listen.

252
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,480
If you draw the same tile that you just discard, keep it.

253
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,970
Remember it, so you won't lose.

254
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,020
Special offer.

255
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,530
Confidence Potion. Draw one and get one free.

256
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,690
You don't have to do that.

257
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,510
[Lucky Sticker]

258
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,530
I want nothing

259
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,570
but lucky stickers today.

260
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,260
Have you gone too far

261
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,690
if you keep doing this?

262
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,300
What does it have to do with me?

263
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,940
There's a bug in your system.

264
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,980
Change the program if you can.

265
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,980
Anyway I'll do it this way this time.

266
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,570
Come on.

267
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,420
Again.

268
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,520
Actually,

269
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,770
you don't have to do this procedure.

270
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,500
Why don't you just give it to me?

271
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,530
I think

272
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,320
we should carry out the plan B.

273
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,940
Ladies and gentlemen,

274
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,090
welcome

275
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,450
to the live stream

276
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,410
of the International Mahjong Tournament.

277
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,530
The first contestant is

278
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,360
Quan Xiangyu.

279
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,540
His nickname is Snake-shaped Ghost Hand.

280
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,360
What do you think about this player?

281
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,490
He was the champion for three world tournaments.

282
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,020
He is called the Asian Mahjong Master.

283
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,900
Although Quan Xiangyu

284
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,090
had defended his championship

285
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,980
in three world tournaments,

286
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,000
in the last two years,

287
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,290
Li Zaiyin, the compatriot who broke his consecutive wins,

288
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,830
also got attention.

289
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,760
Li Zaiyin is known as Fortune Teller.

290
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,260
He is good at predicting the tiles

291
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,880
through probability.

292
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,470
What's worth being noticed is

293
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,230
Li Zaiyin is also the founder

294
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,830
of the famous virtual currency,

295
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,170
Otter Coin.

296
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,870
The third contestant

297
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,090
is even more amazing.

298
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,740
People call him Smiling Tiger,

299
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,060
Jin Yongsan.

300
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,260
His assets have exceeded 100 million.

301
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,180
He has won the most championships

302
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,980
in the past 20 years.

303
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,770
He is known as Mahjong Master.

304
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,450
Besides,

305
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,570
he never let anyone win

306
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,890
by his discard

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,450
in his career,

308
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,760
Really?

309
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,690
Yes.

310
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,740
Similarly,

311
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,670
next let's focus on

312
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,230
the fourth contestant.

313
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,450
He's the one

314
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,590
who overcame all the difficulties

315
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,530
and beat the seeded player

316
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,620
Piao Deshuang.

317
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,530
He's Zhang Ye from China.

318
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,980
Good.

319
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:58,860
Good.

320
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:11,599
Good.

321
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,060
Good.

322
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,660
Come on. Cheer up.

323
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,020
We don't have too much information

324
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,160
about this contestant.

325
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,619
But judging from

326
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,020
the recording of his competition with Piao Deshuang,

327
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,000
it seemed that he won as a result of good luck.

328
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,690
Of course,

329
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,670
chances are

330
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,720
he might be hiding something.

331
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,690
Son, come on!

332
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,410
Come on!

333
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:30,880
Come on.

334
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,170
We'll do four rounds of play.

335
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,170
Whoever wins the most grades

336
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,020
will be the winner.

337
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,080
The winner

338
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,210
will get

339
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,930
a jade ring

340
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,290
provided by the sponsor of this tournament,

341
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,900
Royal Calorie Cruise Company.

342
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,170
Now let's

343
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,970
focus on the game.

344
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,950
[East Wind, Round One]

345
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,620
This competition

346
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,900
plays by the rules of Jinhua Mahjong.

347
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,810
We don't have any jokers.

348
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,170
This is also the first time

349
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,630
we follow this rule in our competition.

350
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,880
Will it be too simple?

Isn't it a sure win?

The jade ring is our national treasure.

We can't let Zhang Ye have it.

447

Boss.

448
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,820
He is indeed

449
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,110
beyond our expectations.

450
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,160
But don't worry.

00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,590
We have a backup plan.

452
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,170
A backup plan?

453
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,570
Yes.

454
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:54,990
A backup plan.

455
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,830
We also have a backup plan.

Start off with a South tile, and you don't lose.

461
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,180
It can bless you.

if they watch me compete here.

466
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,880
Okay.

467
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,570

-I want to cheer for you.

Well...

Mom, let's go.

471
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,810
You go back first.

472
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,620
I'll take you to have some delicious food.

473
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,210
Don't worry.

474
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,690
Go get them, bro.

475
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,060
It's just a competition. Don't be nervous.

476
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,710
It's not like you're on the battlefield.

477
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,330
To be honest,

478
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,190
I was threatened.

479
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,570
He told me that I have to lose.

480
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,600
If I don't lose,

481
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,760
they will kill the hostage.

482
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,680
Kill the hostage?

483
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,750
Who?

484
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,540
Professor Wu Zeqing from D University.

485
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,720
The professor you said

486
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,170
who's old and ugly?

487
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,930
Is she here?

488
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,690
Yes.

489
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,250
Yes, it's just a coincidence.

490
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,570
She might be here too.

491
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,900
Wait a minute.

492
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,900
They threatened you with killing her?

493
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,900
Yes, this is ridiculous, right?

494
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,930
Tell me the truth.

495
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,060
Is she really old and ugly?

496
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,010
What's your relationship with her?

497
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,460
She's not that old.

498
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,210
And she's pretty.

499
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,600
She's young.

500
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:14,820
But I swear,

501
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,500
I have nothing

502
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,410
to do with her.

503
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
I lied to you because I didn't want you to be jealous.

504
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,480
Seriously. Look.

505
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,270
You're that good at martial arts.

506
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,500
You can beat ten guys on your own, right?

507
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,410
I can only count on you.

508
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,560
You really think highly of me.

509
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,290
It's a matter of life.

510
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,360
Can we leave her alone?

511
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,970
If anything happens to her,

512
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,640
it'll be a loss for the education industry.

513
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,580
I swear.

514
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,210
I have nothing

515
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,260
to do with her.

516
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,450
If I lied,

517
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,870
I would be struck by lightning,

518
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,770
or hit by a car.

519
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,610
I was a dog if...

520
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,400
All right.

521
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,900
Leave it to me.

522
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,690
Go for the game first.

523
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,490
You're the best.

524
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,980
Kiss.

525

[Infinite Hotel]

705
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,440
We're home.

706
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,990
Be careful.

707
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:59,220
There you go.

708
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,650
Thank you, sir.

709
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,760
Thank you.

710
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,500
Are you Mr. Zhang?

711
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,260
You signed a lot of creation contracts

712
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,950
with Tian Bin

713
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,620
and received a great deposit.

714
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,780
Now it's regarded as a breach of the contract

715
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,780
because of the delay

716
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,940
of fulfilling the contract.

717
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,610
Because of the huge amount,

718
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,310
you're now suspected of fraud.

719
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,500
We will sue you

720
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,720
if you can't

721
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,710
redeem our loss.

722
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,170
All your property under your name

723
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,500
including the award you won

724
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,230
has been frozen.

725
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,370
Now,

726
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,430
please hand over the jade ring.

727
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,500
Hold on.

728
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,820
Tian Bin is the one you are having a legal battle with.

729
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,360
Right?

730
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,470
Then go find Tian Bin.

731
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,460
Why did you came for us?

732
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,020
It's okay.

733
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,560
Tian Bin is

734
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,570
your universal agent.

735
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,650
Whatever decision he makes

736
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,480
is equal to your decision.

737
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,710
I heard you two are getting married.

738
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,340
So what?

739
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,250
Congratulations.

740
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,790
Who is getting married with her?

741
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,210
It's not gonna happen.

742
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,410
No, you...

743
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,410
Listen to me, your jade...

744
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,510
Your jade ring is indeed mine.

745
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,460
However,

746
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,050
before you file a lawsuit,

747
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,590
I have given it

748
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,580
to this Ms. Rao by my side

749
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,510
as a gift.

750
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,100
The ring is hers now.

751
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,540
We're not married.

752
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,680
She doesn't have to

753
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,780
be responsible for my debts, right?

754
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,320
Besides,

755
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,780
I will find a way

756
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,260
to repay the money I owe you.

757
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,850
You can freeze

758
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,180
whatever you want.

759
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,850
If it still doesn't work,

760
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,410
you can sue me.

761
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,500
This is the result of me trusting the wrong person.

762
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,410
I accept it.

763
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,790
Well, I think...

764
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,310
Judging from what you said,

765
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,410
you want to welsh on your debts?

766
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,050
You...

767
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,880
You... Stop, Chenchen.

768
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,010
In another word,

769
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,970
a dead mouse feels no cold.

770
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,780
We've got nothing to lose.

771
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,860
And, lawyers,

772
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,780
let me remind you,

773
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,500
I was once sent

774
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,400
to a psychiatric hospital.

775
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,780
I'm not sure

776
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,610
when my mental illness will occur again.

777
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,480
What do you say?

778
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,580
Do you hear me?

779
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,610
No.

780
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,400
Zhang Ye, are you not going to marry me?
