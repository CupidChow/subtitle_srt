Mr. Chandler

7
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,580
had absolute advantage.

You know what, billiard performers?

used to work for me.

00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,970
He was just an errand boy.

I don't want to use him.

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,460
These two contestants fight with wisdom and courage.

179
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,810
OK.

180
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,620
Who will win?

181
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,660
The final round has come. Now it's nine to nine.

182
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,530
Come on!

183
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,430
Zhang Ye, come on!

184
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Come on!

185
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,940
Zhang Ye, come on!

186
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,450
Come on!

187
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,770
Zhang Ye will start the game on the final round.

188
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,610
I think his fingers are injured.

189
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,810
They are a little swollen.

190
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,700
Referee,

191
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,900
-Can... Can I ask for a whistle? -He's indicating the referee to come over.

192
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,640
Pause.

193
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,100
Look at my hand.

194
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,430
Have a seat.

195
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,640
The doctor is here too.

196
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,460
It seems

197
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,620
it has become big.

198
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,860
It seems that Mr. Zhang Ye's hand

199
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,730
is injured.

200
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,330
Our game

201
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,540
needs to be paused.

202
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,730
We might need some emergency treatment.

203
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,580
We'll be right back.

204
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,420
Go get ready.

205
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:11,950
Okay.

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,690
The four of you

207
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,500
each take a bath towel.

208
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,860
Once the game is over,

209
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,940
you two

210
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,860
cover the camera as soon as possible.

211
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,530
You two,

212
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,500
cover Zhang Ye up.

213
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,430
Understand?

214
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:23,980
Yes.

215
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,450
Go.

216
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:27,740
Okay.

217
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,770
Now we can see it.

218
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,240
Coming.

219
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,700
Mr. Zhang Ye has returned to

220
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,740
to our competition site.

221
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,780
His fingers

222
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,920
seem to be badly hurt.

223
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,570
He has them bandaged.

224
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,580
I don’t know if it will

225
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,260
affect the game.

226
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,660
Right.

227
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,140
But competition is cruel.

228
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,180
The game has to continue.

229
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,560
Here.

230
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,040
Let's invite Mr. Chandler

231
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,170
to kick off again.

232
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:43,980
Welcome.

233
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,940
Let's give them a round of applause.

234
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,410
Okay.

235
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,570
Nice!

236
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,490
Chandler.

237
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,820
Congratulations, Chandler.

238
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,810
Looks like you're going to win.

239
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,260
I'm impressed. Come on.

240
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,380
Are you ready to run naked?

241
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,340
A bet is a bet.

242
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,230
Friendship is the first, and competition is the second.

243
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,390
My hands hurt.

244
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,370
Come on. Come on. Come on.

245
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,470
We can see that Zhang Ye

246
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,010
shaked hands with Chandler.

247
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,510
This...

248
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,520
Does that mean admitting defeat?

249
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,790
Come on, bro.

250
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,540
Have you given up?

251
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,340
-Have one. -Spicy.

252
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,130
Open a good one.

253
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,860
I don't understand.

254
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,770
Here, the last shot.

255
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,520
Let's take a look.

256
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,650
OK. The winner

257
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,090
will be determined soon.

258
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,580
The last point!

259
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,670
He missed.

260
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,370
Chandler had

261
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,640
a major mistake.

262
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,390
My goodness.

263
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,090
Chandler.

264
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,050
What's going on?

265
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,780
Chandler, you're too gentle.

266
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,370
My hands are injured.

267
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,580
But you don't have to be like this.

268
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,340
You can leave now.

269
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:25,930
Let me do it.

270
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,460
You go.

271
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,900
The winning scale

272
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,300
is balancing.

273
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,710
Where will it fall?

274
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,690
Let's see.

275
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,890
Mr. Zhang Ye's fatal attack.

276
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,810
Don't be sad.

277
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,740
Looks like this deadly attack

278
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,100
will still be left to Mr. Chandler.

279
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,420
Come on. Hurry up.

280
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,260
Hurry up.

281
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,110
Hurry up.

282
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,770
Let's record together.

283
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,130
Repost and like it.

284
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,360
Zhang Ye, great!

285
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,490
Zhang Ye, great!

286
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,120
Hurry up.

287
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,540
Don't be shy. Hurry up.

288
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,220
Just close your eyes

289
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,660
when I tell you to later.

290
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,300
Don't open them.

291
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,780
Unbelievable!

292
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,560
What's going on?

293
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,420
Billiard master, Mr. Chandler, kicked the cue ball

294
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,060
to the sky.

295
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,480
This...

296
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,280
That's impossible.

297
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,390
There must be something wrong with the table.

298
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,730
Tell him to watch the replay.

299
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,350
Let's take a look.

300
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,250
Let's watch the replay.

301
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:27,820
Okay.

302
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,220
Take a look.

303
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,940
Look at the playback.

304
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:29,710
Here.

305
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:30,900
Slowly.

306
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,110
Slow down the video.

307
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,260
Okay, slow down.

308
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,200
I see.

309
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,570
The white ball seems to stop,

310
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,310
but it's actually rotating at a high speed.

311
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,850
That's right.

312
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,060
Let's congratulate Mr. Zhang Ye

313
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,800
for winning the cross-border battle.

314
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,470
Congratulations.

315
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,250
Mr. Zhang said before the competition

316
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,930
that all the profits

317
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,050
will be donated

318
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,990
to poor elementary schools.

319
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,980
Thank you.

320
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,860
Generous Mr. Zhang.

321
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,340
Aunt,

322
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,900
when can I

323
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,740
finish eating

324
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,900
36 pig trotters?

325
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,770
All you know is eating.

326
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,340
Bro,

327
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,230
we had a deal.

328
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,100
Pay me back in a week.

329
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,660
Stop shooting. Stop.

330
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,220
Stop!

331
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,700
Boss! Boss!

332
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,300
Stop shooting!

333
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,820
Turn it off.

334
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,940
Hello?

335
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,180
Variety show?

336
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,420
What variety show?

337
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,660
I never take variety shows.

338
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,300
Advertising endorsements?

339
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,060
Recently,

340
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,210
I'm not well.

341
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,660
Yes, I may not be able to take it.

342
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,940
Sorry.

343
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,210
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

344
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,040
Coming.

345
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,880
Coming.

346
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,090
I'm thirsty.

347
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,340
I can't open it.

348
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,140
The dishes are good.

349
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,570
Yes, have some. Here.

350
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,380
Celery is a bit old.

351
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,750
Chili is spicy.

352
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,220
It's so spicy.

353
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,580
But it tastes great.

354
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,740
I don't want chili.

355
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,420
No chili.

356
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,050
No chili.

357
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,570
Spicy. Spicy. Give me some water.

358
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,060
What's wrong?

359
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,110
Get out.

360
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,890
Give me a chance.

361
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,990
Get lost as far as you can.

362
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,010
Don't ever come back.

363
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,650
It makes me angry.

364
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,810
Zhang Ye.

365
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,280
It's good to be famous.

366
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,970
Now when I walk,

367
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,170
I feel great.

368
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,020
I think you've become a bit over proud.

369
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,900
Don't forget

370
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,960
we have to go back.

371
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,810
I don't want

372
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,770
to be trapped here forever.

373
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,140
Of course we have to go back.

374
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,340
I'm just worried that

375
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,090
this game is over

376
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,930
before I have enough fun.

377
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:20,850
What do you mean?

378
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,970
It means we are

379
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,280
in a game world.

380
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,290
Don't you want to be free

381
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,320
and experience

382
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,060
all those food and fun?

383
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,690
To experience

384
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,640
everything you need to experience.

385
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,540
Have you ever had that kind of dream?

386
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,120
Like when you just get married

387
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,890
and you are about to sleep with your wife.

388
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,360
Dream?

389
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,870
I don't think you can dream like this.

390
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,370
You dreamed of having a feast?

391
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,890
The food is right beside your mouth.

392
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,380
When you are about to open your mouth,

393
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,660
you wake up from your dream.

394
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,890
I just don't want to have such regrets.

395
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,510
I see.

396
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,340
You just want to be cloying.

397
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,990
No wonder people say

398
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,460
people will be arrogant after becoming famous.

399
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,530
I think

400
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,620
you have really gone far.

401
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,770
What do you mean?

402
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,680
You go first.

403
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,820
I'll find you later.

404
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,680
I have something to do.

405
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,260
What are you doing?

406
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,500
Forget it. Go first.

407
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,800
You have malnutrition.

408
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,400
Let me give you some fertilizer.

409
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,260
Walking a dog and the man is missing.

410
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,410
Good for him.

411
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,920
He must have gone to Zhang Yuanqi's place.

412
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,170
No way.

413
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,570
He didn't bring his phone.

414
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,470
Did something happen?

415
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,500
What could happen to him?

416
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,770
Go feed the dog.

417
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,340
Zhang Ye.

418
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,210
You deserve this.

419
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,660
Tian Bin.

420
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,980
Fine.

421
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,410
No, you...

422
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,070
What are you doing?

423
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,170
Let go of me.

424
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,220
You still know me?

425
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,990
I thought I hit you too hard

426
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
and you became stupid.

427
00:22:59,560 --> 00:22:59,960
Okay.

428
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,900
Wait, Tian Bin.

429
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,260
What are you doing?

430
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,750
Isn't it obvious?

431
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,100
Look at you.

432
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,310
Do I have to rob beauty from you?

433
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,590
I don't have money even if you rob me for it.

434
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
You'd better rob beauty.

435
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,620
Who would rob you for that?

436
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,640
You've done so many things.

437
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,340
Who are you trying to fool if you don't make money?

438
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,890
I really didn't make any money.

439
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,570
Although I did a lot of things,

440
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,600
those things

441
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,400
are charity.

442
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,330
There is no money.

443
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,060
I know celebrities

444
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,580
like you.

445
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,180
You're doing charity for the news.

446
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,090
Take out your phone.

447
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,700
No, I was walking the dog.

448
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,750
I didn't bring my phone.

449
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,710
I don't believe your life

450
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,340
won't worth 8 or 10 million.

451
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,610
What are you doing?

452
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,910
Your phone is at home, right?

453
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,580
No, you...

454
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,620
Don't call me.

455
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,340
If you call me,

456
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,420
Rao Aimin will be worried.

457
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,050
You...

458
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:06,650
Hello?

459
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
Listen carefully.

460
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
I have Zhang Ye.

461
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,550
Prepare 1 million cash for me.

462
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,260
Don't ask who I am

463
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,300
or call the police.

464
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,070
Otherwise, you can just collect the body.

465
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Don't give him a penny.

466
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,280
Don't give him a penny.

467
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,690
Do you hear me?

468
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Tian Bin, are you crazy?

469
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,100
No, you...

470
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,930
How do you know who I am?

471
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,020
You're calling Zhang Ye.

472
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,700
There's a caller ID on his phone.

473
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,330
Is it awkward?

474
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,800
I told you

475
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,990
not to call me.

476
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,450
Have you never thought

477
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,400
I would save your phone number?

478
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,670
Why didn't you delete my number?

479
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:55,410
I...

480
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,490
This is my first time.

481
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,350
I have no experience.

482
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,110
I...

483
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,580
I was afraid I might forget you.

484
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,150
Hello.

485
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,060
Tian Bin.

486
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,430
I suggest you turn yourself in now.

487
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,980
Or I'll call the police.

488
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,780
Something happened.

489
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,110
Zhang Ye, I'm sorry.

490
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,130
I wanted to rob money.

491
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,550
But my identity is exposed now.

492
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,340
I must kill you to silence you.

493
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,780
Wait.

494
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,450
Why do you have no logic

495
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,100
when you do things?

496
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,660
What it means to kill someone and silent it?

497
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,250
It's to

498
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
keep a secret

499
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,600
and kill everyone

500
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,550
who knows about this.

501
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,040
Think about it.

502
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,340
If you kill me now,

503
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,350
who else knows?

504
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,260
Rao Aimin knows.

505
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,880
Chenchen knows.

506
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,470
And the police know.

507
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,600
Then, can you

508
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,750
kill them all?

509
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,560
No.

510
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,820
So,

511
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,010
it's too late

512
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,380
to keep it a secret now.

513
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,500
How about this?

514
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,620
I have 400 yuan

515
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,230
in my pocket now.

516
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,820
Take this 400 yuan

517
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,350
to take a shower,

518
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,580
buy some food and two bottles of wine.

519
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,910
After that,

520
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,470
go home and have a good sleep.

521
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,180
Nothing can't be solved.

522
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,640
Do you have to use violence?

523
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,170
No.

524
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,720
Look.

525
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,260
No.

526
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,060
If you kill me now,

527
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,090
will you

528
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,150
become a fugitive?

529
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,080
Do you have to

530
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,990
travel around the world

531
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,850
with your identity hidden and being scared?

532
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,170
But the law is wide

533
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,000
and is never negligent.

534
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
The police will definitely catch you

535
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,610
and bring you to prison one day

536
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,060
and execute you on the spot.

537
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,690
You're bullying me.

538
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,390
How about this?

539
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,620
Let me go now.

540
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,360
When the police come,

541
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,710
I'll tell them

542
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,380
we were just playing.

543
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,690
It's just a disruption of social security for most.

544
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,090
How could you

545
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,480
insult my IQ?

546
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,760
Who are you trying to fool?

547
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,520
Zhang Ye, no.

548
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm really sorry.

549
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,760
What?

550
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,900
No, Tian Bin.

551
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,010
I told you so much.

552
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,280
Why can't you understand?

553
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,380
I won't die.

554
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,620
If you don't believe me, just stab me.

555
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,520
Who are you trying to fool? Don't provoke me.

556
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,180
I'm not.

557
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,610
If you stab me, stab here.

558
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,670
Don't stab me in the stomach.

559
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,710
If you stab it on my stomach,

560
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,780
it'll be painful even if I don't die.

561
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:24,910
Okay.

562
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,140
I'm coming.

563
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,110
You do it.

564
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,580
Ready.

565
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,060
You do it.

566
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,380
Let me do it.

567
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,020
I'll do it.

568
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,780
Here. Here.

569
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,740
Here.

570
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,810
Oh no.

571
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,800
The program is wrong again.

572
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,470
If the characters in the virtual world

573
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,910
kill the experimental subject,

574
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,300
the data will be gone.

575
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,810
We have to start over.

576
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,190
I don't want

577
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,620
to start over again because of the program.

578
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,260
We can't afford it.

579
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,130
We have to go to the next astrology.

580
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,870
There is only one way now.

581
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,580
You want to do the game intervention experiment?

582
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,570
Yes.

583
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,170
Come here.

584
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,540
I'm coming.

585
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,250
Come on.

586
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,230
Come on, stab.

587
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:54,970
Do it.

588
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,640
Come on.

589
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,590
Are you scared?

590
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,810
Who is it?

591
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,940
Sanzhi.

592
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,620
So this is what you look like.

593
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,180
I'm not lying.

594
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,390
There really is an alien.

595
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,550
I'm not lying.

596
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,340
It eats people.

597
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,110
I'm not sick.

598
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,100
Chenchen.

599
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,340
When I was kidnapped,

600
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,810
did your aunt really prepare to gather money for me?

601
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,630
She's really worried for not getting enough money.

602
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,560
Hold on.

603
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,430
In this side,

604
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,110
your aunt is quite rich, isn't she?

605
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,280
I thought so at first.

606
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,850
Later I found out

607
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,640
she was under a lot of pressure.

608
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,950
She manages such a small hotel.

609
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,500
The money she earned cannot even cover

610
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,020
the maintenance fees every year.

611
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,180
Zhang Ye.

612
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,920
If Tian Bin

613
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,190
really had killed you this time,

614
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,560
the game would be over.

615
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,660
Are you willing to leave?

616
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,140
Go out and turn right. Go upstairs.

617
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,710
Okay, thank you. Let's go.

618
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,730
♫We're as uneasy as each other♫

619
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,860
Eat this.

620
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,380
♫We're as uneasy as each other♫

621
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,080
Just give it to me.

622
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,740
Just give it to me.

623
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,500
♫We're as uneasy as each other♫

624
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,760
You've had a long day.

625
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:18,850
Rest early.

626
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,480
♫We're as uneasy as each other♫

627
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,650
Isn't that what I should do?

628
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:31,080
♫We're as uneasy as each other♫

629
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,070
You've suffered a lot, poor boy.

630
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,780
♫We're as uneasy as each other♫

631
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,380
You must be hungry.

632
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,580
I'll cook you some noodles.

633
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,700
Wait for me.

634
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,800
♫People think I'm not qualified♫

635
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,020
♫And it affects me♫

636
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:53,870
♫Who can tell me what is right to do♫

637
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,580
♫I'll give you whatever you want♫

638
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,300
Qi, what's wrong?

639
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,170
Let's continue with the rehearsal.

640
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,250
Director,

641
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,850
I think there are some problems

642
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,840
with our dance play.

643
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,220
Can you let everyone

644
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,480
take a break?

645
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,470
I want to read the script again.

646
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,430
What else do you have to think about?

647
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,230
Our musical show,

648
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,300
from script creation

649
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,400
to the band rehearsal

650
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,940
are all masterpieces.

651
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,480
We will be fine.

652
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,500
If there is a problem,

653
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,050
it's because

654
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,110
you have listened too much pop music.

655
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,750
You don't understand

656
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,920
classic music deep enough.

657
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,720
We are doing fine art,

658
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,270
not a lame drama.

659
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,760
Elegance and ordinary

660
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,880
are not contradictory.

661
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,770
The art of creativity

662
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,020
and the audience's acceptance

663
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,800
are not contradictory as well.

664
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,580
We have to face the audience,

665
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,720
instead of pursuing high quality without the participation of them.

666
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,700
It doesn't make sense to you.

667
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Let's stop discussing, okay?

668
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,290
Why are you here?

669
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,760
I'm looking for Qi.

670
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,730
Isn't she going to work with me for the long term?

671
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,810
Hurry up.

672
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,570
My talent is overflowing.

673
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,590
Stop shouting. Qi is worried.

674
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,300
Good.

675
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,780
I'll go and comfort her.

676
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,550
She'll be fine.

677
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:57,990
Go in.

678
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,820
You must be tired.

679
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,950
Take a rest.

680
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,210
Let's take a rest first.

681
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,350
Qi.

682
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,900
Nan told me that

683
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,850
you were worried.

684
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,860
What's wrong?

685
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,460
Zhang Ye, you're just in time.

686
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,430
Help me read the script.

687
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,390
A Perfect Match.

688
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,210
Here, take your medicine.

689
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,340
Here.

690
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,240
Here, take your medicine.

691
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,780
Yours.

692
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,180
Here.

693
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,300
This is yours.

694
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,170
Take your medicine.

695
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,210
Here, take it. This is yours.

696
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,030
Let me see.

697
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,980
Here, take it.

698
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,830
Young man,

699
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,910
did you sleep well?

700
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,550
Yes.

701
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,200
Do you know where you are?

702
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,940
Hospital.

703
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,760
Do you know

704
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,140
why you are in the hospital?

705
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,990
I'm sick.

706
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,460
I always think too much. I need treatment.

707
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,670
Not bad.

708
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,610
It seems the result of our treatment

709
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,440
is very obvious.

710
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:10,870
Take the medicine.

711
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,890
Dr. Chen, continue to distribute the medicine.

712
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,050
I'm going to the bathroom.

713
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,050
Let me explain.

714
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,900
Attention, everyone.

715
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,460
Your dance

716
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,110
should be more relaxed

717
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,220
and interesting.

718
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,460
Especially you, Fatty.

719
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,110
Your steps are too heavy.

720
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,310
And, members of the musical group

721
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,260
are the same.

722
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,600
This is

723
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,590
a comedy that families can share.

724
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,800
You have to be

725
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,420
relaxed, fun and jolly.

726
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,220
Don't be so sad.

727
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,060
Let's have fun, okay?

728
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,940
Excuse me.

729
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,590
Who wrote this script?

730
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,670
Me.

731
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,780
It's brilliant.

732
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,659
Thank you.

733
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,429
But

734
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,790
I have some questions.

735
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,060
Can I discuss with you?

736
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,310
Of course. Please.

737
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,620
Your script is about

738
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,440
a couple of young man and woman

739
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,060
from knowing each other to loving each other,

740
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,489
who are opposed strongly

741
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,929
by two families.

742
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,300
Later, they break the chains

743
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,389
of the social rules

744
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,190
and finally be together.

745
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,780
Right?

746
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,420
Yes.

747
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,880
The story is smooth

748
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,370
and the characters were carved deeply.

749
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,219
But

750
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,050
it seems to be too smooth.

751
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,480
The two of them

752
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,389
just have a simple daily life.

753
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,260
There's no such thing

754
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,199
in this world.

755
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,100
They will definitely quarrel

756
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,890
over something trivial.

757
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,590
Am I right?

758
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,760
Easier said than done.

759
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,120
What do you think?

760
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,890
Based on my understanding of

761
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,310
the script,

762
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,880
I think

763
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,660
the conflict can be expanded.

764
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,650
A happy ending

765
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,490
is not as impressive as

766
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,130
a tragic ending

767
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,560
to hit people's hearts.

768
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,850
Come on.

769
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,460
Let's hear it.

770
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,730
Let's hear his opinion.

771
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,180
Actually, the script of

772
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,010
A Perfect Match

773
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,150
is similar to a legend

774
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,120
in our hometown.

775
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,580
This legend

776
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,520
is about a young couple.

777
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,540
They fell in love at first sight and decided to marry each other

778
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,060
when they met at a gathering.

779
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,500
But they were strongly opposed

780
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,330
by the two families.

781
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,710
Because these two families

782
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,740
were sworn enemies.

783
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,170
The boy

784
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,220
stabbed the girl's cousin

785
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,270
and was exiled.

786
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,810
The girl

787
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,790
was forced to marry.

788
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,090
The girl

789
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,550
could only take sleeping pills

790
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,320
to pretend to kill herself.

791
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,410
But the boy

792
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,160
misunderstood.

793
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,320
By mistake,

794
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,420
they died for each other.

795
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,630
The two families

796
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,830
gradually came to their senses

797
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,900
from the pain of losing their children

798
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,060
and resolved their grudges.

799
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,810
In the end,

800
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,940
they made golden statues for

801
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,710
each of them.

802
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,850
What is this story called?

803
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,620
This story is called

804
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,940
Romeo and Juliet.

805
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,970
You can fly too?

806
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,310
Fly with me.

807
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,530
Oh no!

808
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,330
Come out!

809
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,940
I'm sorry.

810
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,700
I didn't mean it.

811
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,960
I think the patient's condition

812
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,140
is not only not under control,

813
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,790
but also worse.

814
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,920
He has hallucinations

815
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,720
and severe violent tendencies.

816
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,070
He must be isolated.

817
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,070
Actually,

818
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,290
the script of A Perfect Match

819
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,930
is really similar to

820
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,910
Romeo and Juliet.

821
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
I think it's the incomplete version

822
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,600
of Romeo and Juliet.

823
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,540
So I think

824
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,570
based on the structure of Romeo and Juliet,

825
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,430
we can enrich the script.

826
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,340
I won't involve in the discussion of

827
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,580
how to change the story.

828
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,520
But this is a musical after all.

829
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,100
You can't let our music

830
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,610
be remade completely.

831
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,210
Why don't we quit

832
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,760
and you do drama?

833
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,490
No.

834
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,790
Well,

835
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,820
I can help.

836
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,060
But

837
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,650
I don't know the score.

838
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,960
If I sing it out,

839
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:29,870
you should be able to

840
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,940
compose a song, right?

841
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,290
You people who do pop music

842
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,460
are so poor in musical knowledge.

843
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,010
You don't even know the score.

844
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,900
Do you think this is a mountain song?

845
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,900
The knowledge of music is a little poor.

846
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,160
Just tell me whether you can or not.

847
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,030
It's as simple as whistling.

848
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,180
I'll hum then.

849
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,180
Please.

850
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,970
The step of fate

851
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,570
is coming towards us.

852
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,840
Sol sol sol mi.

853
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,550
Fa fa fa re.

854
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,660
Come.

855
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:49,830
Zhang Ye.

856
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,420
It's unbelievable.

857
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,160
This is the best song ever.

858
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,620
You're amazing.

859
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,840
If I tell you

860
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,700
it's not free,

861
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,480
are you going to look down on me?

862
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,940
This is priceless.

863
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
As much as you want.

864
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:07,940
Okay.

865
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,260
Enjoy yourselves.

866
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,230
I quit！

867
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,020
I quit!

868
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,450
I quit!

869
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,800
Didn't you say you made a fortune?

870
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,600
What money did you make?

871
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,720
I sold Romeo and Juliet

872
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,220
to Zhang Yuanqi.

873
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,250
What pig(sounds like Ju)?

874
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,490
Did you do pigs?

875
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,210
It's not a pig. It's a human.

876
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,340
That one.

877
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,610
Shakespeare, right?

878
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,660
Wait a minute, human.

879
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,710
Kill who?

880
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,760
His name is Shakespeare.

881
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,470
I am...

882
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,060
Zhang Ye.

883
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,620
How much did you sell

884
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,480
such a classic?

885
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:07,770
How much?

886
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,350
How much can you earn? And you have a card for it.

887
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,320
Zhang Ye,

888
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,180
we can't do anything

889
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,110
against the law.

890
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,030
Who did anything illegal?

891
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,420
I sold it

892
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,570
for this amount.

893
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,290
10,000?

894
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,140
Not a penny.

895
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,830
Did Zhang Yuanqi

896
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,170
use honey trap to you?

897
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,030
What honey trap?

898
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,630
Listen carefully.

899
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,360
This card is the salary card.

900
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,840
20 thousand will be transferred

901
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,200
every month.

902
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,180
This card will be put

903
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,090
at your hand right now.

904
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,230
From now on,

905
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,570
just mind my food.

906
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,260
I don't need anything else.

907
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:48,750
And

908
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,710
Zhang Yuanqi and I

909
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,530
agreed that

910
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,640
as long as they take back the cost,

911
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,910
the ticket price of her performance

912
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,850
will be only one yuan per ticket.

913
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,060
20,000 yuan?

914
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,460
So this fox, Zhang Yuanqi,

915
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,180
really played honey trap on you.

916
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,840
Tell me.

917
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,710
What honey trap did she play?

918
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:06,440
Let us see.

919
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,270
What honey trap?

920
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,570
Am I that kind of person?

921
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,300
Aren't you?

922
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,400
Of course not.

923
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,970
How about this?

924
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,690
You use honey trap to me.

925
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,590
See if I take the bait.

926
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,290
You will know it.

927
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,330
Sure.

928
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:17,890
Come.

929
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,590
Come on.

930
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,940
Is this a honey trap?

931
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,650
Password.

932
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
Let's go eat.

933
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:23,470
Let's go eat.

934
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:24,530
The password.

935
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,720
Password. Password.

936
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,950
How old are you?

937
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:27,730
Password. Hurry up.

938
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,900
How old are you?

939
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,820
Qi, time to eat.

940
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,090
We're going to attend a premiere after dinner.

941
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,950
After the movie,

942
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,660
the director may

943
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
let you give a speech on stage.

944
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,300
We have a party tonight.

945
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,990
The endorsements of last time will all be there.

946
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,420
You might need to social.

947
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,660
Tomorrow morning,

948
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,490
it will be the magazine cover shooting.

949
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,920
You need to get up at six for the makeup.

950
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:50,970
After the shooting,

951
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,450
you need to come back to rehearse the musical.

952
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,720
I can at least

953
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,700
sleep for five hours, right?

954
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,080
You eat first.

955
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:56,920
I'll get the car ready.

956
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,330
I didn't expect

957
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,730
you would come to see me.

958
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,970
Stop talking. Eat.

959
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,090
I didn't expect

960
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,340
you can forgive me.

961
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,170
We are a couple and we have the connection.

962
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,790
Don't worry.

963
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,670
I will make all the money

964
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,440
I lost back.

965
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,470
The debt collectors

966
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,070
always make a scene in front of the house.

967
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,200
I moved back to my parents' house.

968
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,110
What did they do?

969
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,030
Do they dare to

970
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,020
come here and make trouble?

971
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:38,570
I can pretend to be a psycho

972
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,870
for a few more days.

973
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,070
So you're not mentally ill?

974
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,060
What illness can I have?

975
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,060
It's a misunderstanding. I...

976
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,870
I'm just pretending.

977
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,410
Then I'm relieved.

978
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,550
Let's get a divorce.
