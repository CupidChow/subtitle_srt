00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,579

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,980
Hello, everyone.

I play Ye Da in the movie.

27
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,579
Good!

28
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,240
Good.

29
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,020
Good.

30
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,160
Wow!

31
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,030
Hello, I'm Zhang Yuanqi.

32
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,670
I play Gong Yi in the movie.

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,780
Good!

34
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,130
Good!

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,830

37
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,160
Thank you.

38
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,370
Wow!

39
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,340
Good!

40
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,420
Hello, everyone.

41
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,930
I'm Buluobushufu.

Buluobushufu.

43
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,220
Speaking of Yuanqi,

44
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,380
on behalf of the audience,

45
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,510
I have a few questions.

46
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,850
As far as I know,

47
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,160
this movie

48
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,890
is not the first time

49
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,940
you cooperate with Director Zhang Ye, right?

50
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,250
It is said that

51
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,730
you have many cross-border cooperation with him.

52
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,860
I have a question.

53
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,240
What is

54
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,210
so special about Zhang Ye

55
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,220
that keeps

56
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,000
attracting you?

57
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,970
Let me tell you

58
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,780
a true story happened to me.

59
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,060
Is it a story related

60
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,600
to Director Zhang Ye?

61
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,579
That day at the radio station,

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,060
I heard the song

63
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,140
My Future is not A Dream.

64
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,060
The longer I listened to it, the more touched I was.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,930
I couldn't help crying.

66
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,800
I didn't know if I was happy, or sad,

67
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,890
or excited.

68
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,860
Anyway,

69
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,370
Zhang Ye touched me.

70
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,840
I found that in his spiritual world,

71
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,970
we had much in common.

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,380
Although we haven't met yet,

73
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,040
I think we're familiar.

74
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,620
Is this a preemptive move?

75
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,700
At that time, I was thinking

76
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,130
when we could meet

77
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,360
and if we would have a chance to work together.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,640
I didn't expect that

79
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,560
we've worked together so many times.

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,490
So,

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,440
fate is unpredictable.

82
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,460
What a good saying.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,970
Let's applaud to thank her.

84
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,530
Next,

85
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,690
I'd like to ask

86
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,250
our famous director,

87
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,050
Director Zhang.

88
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,620
Do you feel

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,920
the same at this moment?

90
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,460
Actually,

91
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,530
my relationship with Qi

92
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,680
is like the talent and the scout.

93
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,810
And I think

94
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,370
you shouldn't think too much.

95
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,630
My fiancee

96
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,580
is still sitting down there.

97
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,950
If you talk nonsense,

98
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,730
when I get back home tonight,

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,120
I might get beaten up.

100
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,880
Although the idea of the Second Generation Master

101
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,140
is from a movie

102
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,010
I am familiar with.

103
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,980
But I believe

104
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,170
after watching this film,

105
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,420
you'll find two most important elements

106
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,460
in this film,

107
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,650
that is love and being beaten.

108
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,180
What it shows now

109
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,140
is a new original story.

110
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,070
The inspiration

111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,360
came from my fiancee.

112
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,980
She is a martial art champion

113
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,790
who often uses me as the practice object.

114
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,520
So I want to thank her here.

115
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,650
Good! Thank you.

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
Thank you, Director Zhang

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,740
and Director Zhang's fiancee.

118
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,510
Director Zhang is not only talented,

119
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,440
but also...

120
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,620
What? Humorous!

121
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,440
Humorous.

122
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,710
Zhang Ye, our Director Zhang here,

123
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,080
are the directors and scriptwriters

124
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,590
of our movie.

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,050
Moreover, he also serve as an action instructor.

126
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,480
Today we have

127
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,630
a special activity here.

128
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,730
Do you want to have a feast?

129
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,180
Okay!

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,820
Let's welcome Director Zhang.

131
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
Zhang Ye, Mr. Zhang,

132
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,400
and our Russian strong men.

133
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,300
So big.

134
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,620
Are you ready?

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,930
The battle begins.

136
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,080
The system will kick you out automatically.

137
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,250
Look over there.

138
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,980
Hurry up.

139
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,570
The creators

140
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,860
will come over here to talk later.

141
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,600
So hurry up and carry those display boards

142
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,870
and lights.

143
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,690
Go now.

144
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,080
Okay.

145
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,210
Why are you here?

146
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,000
I wouldn't know if I didn't come.

147
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,390
You've been working with Zhang Ye.

148
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,890
Let me tell you.

149
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,120
This is not

150
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,780
where you should be.

151
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,570
Leave now.

152
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,510
If you don't leave, I'll call the security.

153
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,740
Tian Bin, what are you doing?

154
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,030
Today is

155
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,290
the movie premiere ceremony of

156
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,280
our Director Zhang.

157
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm here to wish him

158
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
to achieve a huge hit at the box office.

159
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,740
Tian Bin,

160
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,140
are you going to set a fire?

161
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,330
Tian Bin, are you crazy?

162
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,640
Do you know how many people

163
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,300
are there in this building?

164
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,560
All of them will die.

165
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,940
I'm not crazy.

166
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,300
Not only Zhang Ye is here today,

167
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,330
all his relatives and friends,

168
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,920
and his supporters

169
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,910
are here, right?

170
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,250
Perfect.

171
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,800
None of them can escape.

172
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,570
They will all die with Zhang Ye.

173
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,700
It's so glorious

174
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,410
and dignified.

175
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,380
Right?

176
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,890
It's dramatic.

177
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,830
Bin, I beg you.

178
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,990
Let me go.

179
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,430
I'm not on their side.

180
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,690
You can let them die,

181
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,580
but let me go.

182
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,550
You see,

183
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,500
how treated you before.

184
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,250
Let me go.

185
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,520
I have a family.

186
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,950
I don't want to die with Zhang Ye.

187
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,120
Yes.

188
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,780
Bin, I beg you.

189
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,630
Let me go.

190
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,130
Baby.

191
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,350
As soon as something happened to me,

192
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,860
you went to work for Zhang Ye.

193
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,590
And whenever

194
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,830
I borrow money from you

195
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,820
and find a new place

196
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,420
to settle down.

197
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,210
The police will be there soon.

198
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,780
I don't understand.

199
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,070
Am I unlucky?

200
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,990
Or I deserve it?

201
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,290
Later, I thought

202
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,050
you and Zhang Ye

203
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,880
had come up this plan

204
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,690
to mess with me.

205
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,180
No.

206
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,130
No.

207
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,980
No.

208
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,570
No.

209
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,040
Mess with me.

210
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,500
Bin.

211
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,980
You made me

212
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,060
like a street rat.

213
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,450
Right?

214
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,160
Bin, listen to me.

215
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,460
He forced me.

216
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,740
He forced me to do that.

217
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,860
He forced you and you just did it?

218
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,620
Bin, I beg you.

219
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
Let me go.

220
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,130
So...

221
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,620
Help!

222
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,680
You can die with him.

223
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,960
Help!

224
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,450
I didn't expect

225
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,610
Tian Bin is the biggest villain

226
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,620
in the game world.

227
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,160
And he

228
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,150
was raised by Zhang Ye.

229
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,720
Looks like he can't escape

230
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,500
this time.

231
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,440
Okay.

232
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,370
Fire!

233
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,310
Fire! Fire!

234
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,920
Fire! Run!

235
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,540
Fire!

236
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,430
Run!

237
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,310
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

238
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,750
Zhang Ye!

239
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,630
Rao Aimin, run!

240
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,390
Run! Zhang Ye!

241
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,900
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

242
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,010
Rao Aimin!

243
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,530
Where are you going? Call Zhang Ye!

244
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,490
Zhang Ye!

245
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,130
Rao Aimin!

246
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,860
Rao Aimin!

247
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,570
Run, Zhang Ye!

248
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,190
Open the door!

249
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,180
Open the door!

250
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,420
Move!

251
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,760
Move. Come on.

252
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,460
Excuse me.

253
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,710
Let me through.

254
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,500
Fire!

255
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,840
Rao Aimin! Chenchen!

256
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,450
Rao Aimin! Zhang Hua!

257
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,770
Rao Aimin!

258
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,359
Chenchen!

259
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:04,859
Zhang Ye!

260
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,450
Zhang Hua!

261
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,020
Brother.

262
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,660
Zhang Hua!

263
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,349
Dad, mom, Rao Aimin.

264
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,859
Brother.

265
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,470
Chenchen, Zhang Hua.

266
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,690
Dad.

267
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,859
Zhang Ye!

268
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,170
Zhang Ye!

269
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,170
Rao Aimin!

270
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,930
Don't take the elevator.

271
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,900
Take the stairs.

272
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,050
Don't take the elevator.

273
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,619
Zhang Ye.

274
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,369
Take the stairs.

275
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,750
Don't take the elevator. Take the stairs.

276
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,160
It is reported that this crisis

277
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,270
was caused by arson.

278
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,600
The suspect, Mr. Tian,

279
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,020
has been arrested by the police on the spot.

280
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,680
It is reported that this man

281
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,910
has been wanted by the police

282
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,870
for a series of illegal acts

283
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,500
such as gambling, kidnapping, arson

284
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,610
and forging contracts.

285
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,900
Are you okay?

286
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,210
Here.

287
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,680
Can anyone help save her?

288
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,820
Are you okay? Wake up!

289
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,400
Help!

290
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,370
Wake up. Are you okay?

291
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,330
Let's go. Let's help her.

292
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,330
Let's go.

293
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,850
I want to rest.

294
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,860
I want to rest.

295
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,690
I want to rest.

296
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,690
Miss. Miss.

297
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,740
Miss! Miss!

298
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,740
Brother! Brother!

299
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,500
Mirror.

300
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,690
Hello, Zhang Ye.

301
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,930
We finally meet.

302
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,700
At this time,

303
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,070
will you want to draw a lottery?

304
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,570
Cut the crap.

305
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,530
I want Lucky Sticker

306
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,540
and Return Sugar.

307
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,020
Actually, you have another choice.

308
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,780
What?

309
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,920
According to the system,

310
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,720
you are liked by

311
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,110
more than half of all people in this world.

312
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,020
Congratulations.

313
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,500
You can use this

314
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,300
to send yourself back

315
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,410
to the original world.

316
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,090
I've told you

317
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,980
you have passed this game

318
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,020
for you.

319
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,300
Wake up!

320
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,250
Open the door!

321
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,540
Open the door!

322
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,430
Help!

323
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,600
What about these people?

324
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,860
They are my family.

325
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,760
My love, friends,

326
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,210
and innocent people.

327
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,450
Isn't that good?

328
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,690
Aren't you worried that

329
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,420
they will be sad

330
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,370
after you leave?

331
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,710
Now they are all here.

332
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,010
What are you talking about?

333
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,770
It's up to you.

334
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,620
Even if I go back,

335
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,520
I want them to be safe.

336
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,970
You've upgraded.

337
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,930
You don't need to look for a mirror

338
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,780
to draw a lottery.

339
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,090
You can

340
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,240
buy props

341
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,440
from your perspective.

342
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,940
Just think about it.

343
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,920
But I have to remind you,

344
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,860
you should keep some of your Fame Value.

345
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,370
Or whether it's in the game world,

346
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,290
or in the real world,

347
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:45,530
[Return Sugar Lucky Sticky]

348
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,430
you will die.

349
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,580
I didn't expect

350
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,840
after going through so many planets.

351
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,420
This is the first time

352
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,240
this kind of ultimate test appears.

353
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,190
He's going to face the final test.

354
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,780
If you were him,

355
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,780
what would you do?

356
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,110
This is a difficult choice.

357
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,610
Sacrifice a part to save the majority.

358
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,810
The wisdom of Earthmen

359
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,020
can only do this.

360
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,450
This is the limit.

361
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,990
The obstacle of their civilization development.

362
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,470
In galaxy civilization,

363
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,330
love is indeed

364
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,170
a big obstacle of development.

365
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,170
But without emotions,

366
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,290
just like those Namekians,

367
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,480
they chose to sacrifice rationally.

368
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,290
It's more beneficial

369
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,720
for survival to keep some people alive.

370
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,210
In the end,

371
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,980
they became robbers in the universe.

372
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,680
They kept invading other galaxy

373
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,580
to protect themselves.

374
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,610
They have lost their civilization.

375
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,030
They only have the desire

376
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,250
to live and to produce.

377
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,720
They have returned to the original.

378
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,520
A group of ants evolved into

379
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,380
intelligent creatures.

380
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,290
Then, under the pressure of survival,

381
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,200
return back to ants.

382
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,930
How pathetic!

383
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,350
Do you think the earthmen will

384
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,330
become like that?

385
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,320
The system will give us the answer.

386
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,760
Zhang Ye doesn't have much Fame Value left.

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,570
If you leave today,

526
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,090
don't regret tomorrow.

527
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,770
I just want to

528
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,000
save some money for you.

529
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,820
It costs thousands a month.

530
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
What are you doing if you don't do this?

531
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,630
I still want to go to the radio station

532
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,420
to see if I can make a living with my mouth.

533
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,500
Okay, nephew.

534
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,100
You really care about your uncle.

535
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,469
I'll wait for your success.

536
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,130
Uncle.

537
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,670
Watch out!

538
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,040
What are you doing? Let go!

539
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,130
Let go!

540
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,980
What are you doing?

541
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,010
Wait.

542
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,210
Get lost!

543
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,220
In my dream,

544
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,930
I copied, plagiarized,

545
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,300
I did everything I could to get fame and fortune.

546
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,100
I lost myself under the temptation of material

547
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,060
and almost made a huge mistake.

548
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,000
I realized it after I woke up from my dream.

549
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,740
This is my dream.

550
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,100
Ridiculous, hilarious and unbelievable.

551
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,020
Life is equal.

552
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,980
But each person's life is always unfair.

553
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,690
If we treat life

554
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,020
the way

555
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,340
the universe treats us.

556
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,340
Then life

557
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,240
will only be filled with

558
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,740
anger and violence.

559
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,400
Who is Ai Dong? It's your turn.

560
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,090
Okay.

561
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,340
In the past,

562
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,570
I wanted to destroy the world.

563
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,020
But later,

564
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,650
I was punished

565
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,740
by this world.

566
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,210
It's not its fault.

567
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,850
Heaven and earth are merciless.

568
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,820
It takes everything as a puppy.

569
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,780
When I asked the world

570
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,100
for more,

571
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,060
I never thought about

572
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,330
giving the world more.

573
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,370
After I became a star,

574
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,160
I realized

575
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,450
how I treat life is also

576
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,300
how life treats me.

577
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,300
Be more positive and work harder.

578
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,850
Be optimistic.

579
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,810
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

580
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:44,920
Kid,

581
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,480
how do you know my surname is Zhao?

582
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,930
Didn't a poet say

583
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,580
black eyes

584
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,930
are destined to look for the light?

585
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,450
I think

586
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,650
even if I was born in the dark,

587
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,540
even if it's dark in front of me,

588
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,370
there must be light in your heart.

589
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,820
I'm Zhang Ye. Today's show

590
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,650
is over.

591
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,780
Thank you for listening.

592
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,130
Good night.

593
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:20,660
Good dream.

594
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,860
I think he said it so well.

595
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,180
Right? I think so too.

596
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,100
I'm leaving.

597
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,010
Take care.

598
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,550
Bye.

599
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,610
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

600
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,490
What song will you play later?

601
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,690

602

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,360
I will buy you meat brochette.

605
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,780

606
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:49,930
Okay.

608

Bye.

609

610
