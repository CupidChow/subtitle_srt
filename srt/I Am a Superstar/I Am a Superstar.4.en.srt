[Episode 4]

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,450
Did you listen to my show

5
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,420
last night?

6
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,710
Am I talented?

7
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,250
What's the show?

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,789
I have no idea.

9
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,340
You must have listened to it.

10
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,220
Otherwise, how come

11
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,410
you look so pretty today?

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,490
Cut the crap.

13
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,580
I made breakfast.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,220
It's not for free.

15
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,780
If you eat breakfast

16
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,780
without working in the future,

17
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,300
I'll put it

18
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,380
in this book for you.

19
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,740
You must pay back the money after you get paid.

20
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,870
And,

21
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,060
finish your meal and get to work.

22
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,020
If you're holding up the hotel

23
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,620
because of your work,

24
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,310
then you'll get out of here.

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,420
Is that clear?

26
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,250
Okay.

27
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,620
Are you still on the show tonight?

28
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,190
You're a bit addicted to it, right?

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,540
I'm reminding you.

30
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,220
When you get back to the hotel

31
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,380
after the show,

32
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,860
remember to finish your work

33
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,650
before going to bed.

34
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,660
It sounds awful.

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,460
Let's go, Zhang Ye.

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,579
It's time to eat.

37
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,420
I still have some left.

38
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,010
I'll finish it first.

39
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,850
You go ahead.

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,150
Okay, I'll leave.

41
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,020
Ye,

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,140
Ye, you are still busy?

43
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,660
The top-quality Longjing tea

44
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,210
with just the right temperature and time.

45
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,090
Try it.

46
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,829
No. Thanks.

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,120
I'm going to eat later.

48
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,620
What's the rush?

49
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,560
I will treat you to the meal later.

50
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,620
If you leave the tea for a long time,

51
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,690
it won't taste good.

52
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,900
Ye.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,770
You are really talented.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,820
You got me.

55
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,300
I'm flattered.

56
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,340
But your talent

57
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,700
needs a platform

58
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,060
to show.

59
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,100
So?

60
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,940
Are you trying to give me your show?

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,340
No, no.

62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,779
Not really.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,510
I want to work with you.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,220
Cooperation?

65
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,380
Why should I?

66
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,180
Look.

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,540
You are talented,

68
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,050
and I am good-looking.

69
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,750
Let's join forces.

70
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,040
You'll write the script, and I'll do the broadcast.

71
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,860
I guarantee the ratings

72
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,100
will go up.

73
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,540
And taking the top spot

74
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,060
is just around the corner.

75
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,659
So you just want me

76
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,860
to write scripts specifically for you.

77
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,460
Yes.

78
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,620
Mr. Tian, I majored

79
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,900
in broadcast hosting, too.

80
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,420
I also want to be an anchor.

81
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,820
You should

82
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,990
be self-aware.

83
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,540
I rejected you

84
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,450
because I knew that.

85
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,659
Actually, cooperation

86
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,490
is possible.

87
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,180
Yeah.

88
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,460
But I don't like you.

89
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,740
Good tea is more suitable for a good man.

90
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,260
If you drink this cup of tea,

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,230
you'll just waste it.

92
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,270
Have you ever considered

93
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,970
the consequences of going against me?

94
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,010
Yes.

95
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,900
At worst,

96
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,270
I might step on a foot of dog poop.

97
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,120
I...

98
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,210
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

99
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,250
Alright, let's start the meeting

100
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,140
since everyone's here.

101
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,900
Have you got

102
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,420
last week's ratings yet?

103
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,510
I just got it.

[The Qomolangma Network Entertainment]

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,740
Are you sure you didn't get it wrong?

106
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,460
A staff of the statistics department

107
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,380
gave it to me.

108
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,220
It can't be wrong.

109
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,460
Read it.

110
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,190
No. 1. Daily Mood.

111
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,060
No 2. Daily Entertainment.

112
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,220
No.3.

113
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,700

The next ones are Daily Smile,

and Whispering.

118
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,200
Did the statisticians get it wrong?

119
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,890
No way.

120
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,820
I can only say Tian Bin is lucky.

121
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,050
I can tell from your expressions.

122
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,820
We got a dark horse here.

123
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,860
Something happened

124
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,900
last night,

125
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,860
so the Late Night DJ

126
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,260
was hosted by Zhang Ye.

127
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,700
We should thank Tian Bin's teaching

128
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,520
and Zhang Ye's efforts

129
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,860
for getting such a good result.

130
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,670
A late-night show

131
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,260
can squeeze into the top three in ratings

132
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,090
on its first day of broadcast,

133
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,380
which has never happened before

134
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,740
in our company.

135
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,040
It can almost go down in history.

136
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,100
I've seen

137
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,540
the curve of the ratings.

138
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,290
The highest ratings

139
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,940
and the lowest ratings didn't change much.

140
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,340
What does it mean?

141
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,780
The audiences like this show very much.

142
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,940
What are you waiting for?

143
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,820
Hurry up.

144
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,210
Give Zhang Ye a round of applause!

145
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,180
I hope he can keep up the good work.

146
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,830
It's all thanks to Mr. Zhao's support

147
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,060
and everyone's help.

148
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,870
I can't take all the credit for that.

149
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,900
By the way,

150
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,980
most importantly,

151
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,100
thanks to Bin for the push.

152
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,620
You...

153
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,340
Well.

154
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,110
Since Zhang Ye is so motivated,

155
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,180
so the Late Night DJ should be

156
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
into two programs.

157
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,340
Zhang Ye will host on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,

158
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,670
and Tian Bin on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

159
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,340
Leave some opportunities

160
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,330
for young men.

161
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,860
Since

162
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,250
Zhang Ye has been doing well lately,

163
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,140
I've decided

164
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,700
to let him turn positive early

165
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,900
and become

166
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,180
one of our regular anchors.

167
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,860
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

168
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,340
Alright.

169
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,100
Let's continue the meeting.

170
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,340
Let's summarize

171
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,420
last week's shows and advertisers...

172
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,680
Here, have some more hot water.

173
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,460
Thank you.

174
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,700
Congratulations.

175
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:12,540
Thank you.

176
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,070
It's radiation-proof.

177
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,210
Congratulations.

178
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,780
Thank you.

179
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,600
Congratulations.

180
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,980
Congratulations! Keep it up!

181
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,820
Keep it up.

182
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,530
[Fighting! Go for it!]

183
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,940
It's another bitter cold.

184
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,460
It feels like it's far from last year.

185
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,380
What has changed?

186
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,880
I have no idea yet.

187
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,340
Actually, this feeling is very familiar.

188
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,860
It's cold.

189
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,140
Maybe

190
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,260
it's the lonely life that many people pursue.

191
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,410
Something like songs sung by You Haoming.

192
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,210
Things just stay there,

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,930
just like in the dream.

194
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,150
The falling leaves are coming again.

195
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,810
[Shuang]

196
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,570
Sir,

197
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,580
it's my first day

198
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,540
on the air.

199
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,860
It's a small gift.

200
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,520
Please take it.

201
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,570
I brought you

202
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,580
some cigarettes.

203
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,230
You're too polite.

204
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,610
Wait.

205
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,450
Where is your badge?

206
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,420
My badge...

207
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,070
You don't have it with you?

208
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,660
Don't you know me?

209
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,610
I'm Zhang Ye.

210
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,020
I solved the live incident

211
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,980
two days ago.

212
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:49,970
I know.

213
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,600
I thought you looked familiar.

214
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,820
Is it time for you to go on the show?

215
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,500
Yes.

216
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,660
From now on,

217
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,660
I'll be on the show here on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

218
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,420
As a rookie,

219
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,130
I feel ashamed

220
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,500
to take away the job of the senior.

221
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,740
In the future,

222
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,980
we'll meet each other often.

223
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,460
Please take care of me.

224
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,050
Congratulations.

225
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,730
Thank you.

226
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,350
By the way,

227
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,810
if any of my pretty female fans

228
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,000
come over in the future,

229
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,100
please open the door

230
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,940
for them.

231
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't worry.

232
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,650
As long as I'm here,

233
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,910
not to mention a fan,

234
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,720
even a fly can't fly in.

235
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,500
You're reliable.

236
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,450
Sir.

237
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,030
With you here,

238
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,220
it's more reliable than a door god.

239
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,530
I'm in a hurry to go on the show.

240
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,060
I'll go in first.

241
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,010
And I'll talk to you another day.

242
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,980
Stop.

243
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,300
Don't rush in.

244
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,220
Step back.

245
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,700
Back up a bit more.

246
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,460
Well,

247
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,260
I can't let you in

248
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,540
without the badge.

249
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,460
You can enter after finding your badge.

250
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,940
You know me, right?

251
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,330
Why not call Mr. Zhao to let me in?

252
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,150
If you bring him up,

253
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,980
then you are unwise.

254
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,980
I know more people

255
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,930
than you do.

256
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,090
This is a streaming site.

257
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,440
No one is allowed to enter without a badge.

258
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,470
Oh, come on.

259
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,100
Well...

260
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,120
Shut up. Find it yourself.

261
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,220
Sir.

262
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,620
This is my first day on the show.

263
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,460
If I don't go in

264
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,140
and host the show,

265
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,300
then it will be treated as a live-streaming incident,

266
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,660
and both of us will suffer.

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,960
No, it's your responsibility.

268
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,180
You have to bear it yourself.

269
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,710
Anyway, I only look at the badge.

270
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,100
Come on. You can't do that.

271
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,220
That's just a rule.

272
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,660
We can deal with it flexibly, right?

273
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,500
This is a rigid rule.

274
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,690
You can't enter without a badge.

275
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,540
And pulling back from despair.

276
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,150
I've described

277
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,460
more than once

278
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,680
the bitter cold, falling leaves, autumn winds,

279
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,790
and French sycamores.

280
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,430
You...

281
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,820
Why are you still chatting here?

282
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,300
Hurry up.

283
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,340
The program ahead is almost over.

284
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,010
Come in and get ready.

285
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,540
He knows me,

286
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,620
but he won't let me in.

287
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
Without a badge,

288
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,240
no one can get in.

289
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,450
Sir,

290
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,730
it's your fault.

291
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,420
My fault?

292
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,100
He has no badge,

293
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,140
so he can't enter.

294
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,580
Please make an exception.

295
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,180
Look.

296
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,940
It's almost the time.

297
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,220
We can't do the show without an anchor.

298
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,660
And now it's too late

299
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,340
to let him

300
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,060
get the leader's signature.

301
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,020
Please make an exception.

302
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,060
Sir, please.

303
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,100
Step back.

304
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,180
Listen.

305
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,140
you've been working here

306
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,860
for a while. You know that.

307
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,620
Past the post,

308
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,020
there are a dozen shows on live.

309
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,990
If I let you in,

310
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,250
it would be an incident.

311
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,340
What do you mean?

312
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,140
I... You...

313
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,260
Not to mention you,

314
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,140
even if Mr. Zhao came

315
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
without the badge, he couldn't get in either.

316
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,260
Sir,

317
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,460
I'm begging you.

318
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,260
Give me a few minutes.

319
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,860
I'll figure it out.

320
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,780
Where is your badge?

321
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,200
I...

322
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,140
Come out. Come out.

323
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,460
Whatever you want, you will get it.

324
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,860
You won't have a loss.

325
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,540
Today's special recommendation is...

326
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,060
Cut the crap.

327
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,820
I want to get a return candy.

328
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,500
I lost something.

329
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,640
Sorry, sir.

330
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,780
All our products

331
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,530
can't be sold alone.

332
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,730
You can only get it by draw.

333
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,660
I won't draw,

334
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,520
I just want a return candy.

335
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,580
I have no choice.

336
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,620
This is the rule.

337
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,690
You're doing this too?

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,740
I'll pay double.

339
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,260
How about this?

340
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,380
Give me 100,000 Fame Values,

341
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,700
and I'll give you a return candy.

342
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,170
100,000 Fame Values?

343
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,140
I can't believe you raised the price!

344
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,260
What if I give you 100,000 Fame Values,

345
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,380
but I can't find what I want?

346
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,530
Isn't that a waste?

347
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,580
How about this?

348
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,990
Give me 150,000 Fame Values,

349
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,460
and I'll give you a lost property sticker.

350
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,160
What do you think?

351
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,190
A lost property sticker.

352
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,100
150,000 Fame Values?

353
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,300
If I give you my Fame Value,

354
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,660
I'll only have ten minutes to live.

355
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,370
You're so cunning.

356
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,560
I have no choice.

357
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,530
It's not cheap, but it's worth it.

358
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,740
How is it?

359
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,940
Do you want it?

360
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,610
Yes.

361
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,100
Oh, come on.

362
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,700
Where are you?

363
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,280
Give me that.

364
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,540
Now I'm screwed.

365
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,020
I was cheated.

366
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,420
I found the badge.

367
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,040
Your name.

368
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,470
Zhang Ye.

369
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,130
Come in.

370
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,050
Hurry up.

371
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,140
Zhang Ye,

372
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,110
I'll keep you in mind.

373
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,450
Enjoy a new song

374
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,660
before the end of the show.

375
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,740
I'm Wang Xiaomei.

376
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,460
Tonight,

377
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm your DJ,

378
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,380
Miss Xiaomei.

379
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,550
Hey.

380
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,420
You may get a little nervous

381
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,480
when you host a show the first time,

382
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,420
just get used to it.

383
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,740
Are you familiar with the equipment?

384
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,180
Do you need me

385
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,980
to stay and help you?

386
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,180
No, thank you, Miss Xiaomei.

387
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,890
Well,

388
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,140
I'm in a hurry.

389
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,600
Why don't you get up first?

390
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,980
I...

391
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,360
I...

392
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,030
Sorry.

393
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,690
Shuang,

394
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,660
do you have a mirror?

395
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,480
Can I borrow it?

396
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,810
Thank you.

397
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,540
You may leave.

398
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,240
Thank you.

399
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,820
I'm sorry.

400
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,330
Something must be wrong with him.

401
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,740
This is not live TV.

402
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,090
Warning. Your Fame Value is low.

403
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,080
Please recharge quickly,

404
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,820
otherwise, the timer will automatically shut down,

405
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,460
your life will stop forever.

406
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,100
Let's go.

407
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,050
You guys may go out first.

408
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,270
[The strongest snail]

409
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,420
Our experiment is almost over.

410
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,700
What a pity!

411
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,380
We have to

412
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,750
say goodbye

413
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,440
to this planet's cuisine.

414
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,700
Yeah.

415
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,380
But I miss my wife

416
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,020
more than that.

417
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,050
It seems that this race

418
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,420
is nothing remarkable.

419
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,710
Yeah, just like this game.

420
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,500
In the end, all that's worth it

421
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,260
is probably just this little snail.

422
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,890
We're going home.

423
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,620
Welcome to

424
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Qomolangma Internet Radio.

425
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,880
Now it's Midnight Song.

426
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,650
I'm the host, Zhang Ye.

427
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,850
In this early morning, it is cold as water.

428
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,010
The breeze is blowing like a song.

429
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,740
I'll start

430
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,520
with a fast-paced dance song.

431
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,260
Those who are driving,

432
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,050
those who are working overtime,

433
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,910
and those who can't sleep,

434
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,070
come and have fun together.

435
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,550
We set sail at dawn from Baidi Town under a rosy sky,

436
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,240
on the thousand-mile trip to Jiangling and back the same day.

437
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,260
The noisy chatter of apes from the shores follow us all the way.

438
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,060
Our boat skips past ten thousand green mountains.

439
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,930
My old friend said farewell at Yellow Crane Tower.

440
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,760
In scenic April, he headed down to Yangzhou.

441
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,590
The lone sail vanished at the edge of the blue sky.

442
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,330
All I saw was the surging Yangtze merging with the horizon.

443
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,660
An affectionate man is like a heartless man.

444
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,380
I feel I can't smile in front of the parting feast.

445
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,230
The candle seems to feel the parting.

446
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,970
It is sad and weeping for us until dawn.

447
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,960
Until dawn.

448
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,900
Flowers fall from the sky as if from the moon.

449
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,720
Picking up the fresh flowers in front of the temple.

450
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,470
I still don't know why someone doesn't like the trees.

451
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,420
That must be because Chang'e scattered the flowers to the people.

452
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,060
Sunlight shines on the stones kindling violet smoke.

453
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,990
Look at the waterfall flying down the long river from afar.

454
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,860
Flying waters descending straight down three thousand feet.

455
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,620
Till I feel the Milky Way has fallen from the ninth height of heaven.

456
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,450
Crows call and the moon sets, frost filling the air.

457
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,220
Lamps aboard and the shore maples accompany sleepless me.

458
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,980
From a temple on a mountain out of Suzhou,

459
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,810
the ring bells float to the ship at midnight.

460
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,859
To the ship at midnight.

461
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,339
I wonder if the music just now

462
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,540
has made you

463
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,819
feel the youthful vigor?

464
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,500
Excellent words.

465
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,260
This kind of music

466
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,140
comes from my hometown.

467
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,089
I didn't know

468
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,339
he was talented.

469
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,500
Hey, you know what?

470
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,609
I'm not sleepy anymore.

471
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,780
Wow.

472
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,540
The number is 439888.

473
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,859
Welcome to join me.

474
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,569
In the Midnight Song,

475
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,230
speak out your mood together

476
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,810
and enjoy my music.

477
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,380
Zhang's song

478
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,700
is quite interesting.

479
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,490
It's awesome.

480
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,940
It's much more interesting

481
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,810
than your show

482
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,800
that played songs at midnight.

483
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,220
It shows

484
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,990
I have been doing a great job for years

485
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,380
and attracted so many listeners,

486
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,660
but I didn't expect him to steal the limelight.

487
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,300
Stupid.

488
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,900
Come on.

489
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,060
I've heard

490
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,850
your show.

491
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,300
It always makes me sleep.

492
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:56,940
How foolish.

493
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,540
If my show's ratings

494
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,290
go down,

495
00:17:59,290 --> 00:17:59,980
it's going to be a disaster

496
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,860
for our family.

497
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,620
I can't believe you're still happy for him.

498
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,100
Stupid.

499
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,130
And you even laughed at me.

500
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,840
You look so happy.

501
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,360
Whose side are you on?

502
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,790
Who are you calling?

503
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,780
Hello.

504
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,290
Four,

505
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,700
find someone for me.

506
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,970
-Thank you.
-Here. Sign it here.

507
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,500
It's okay.

508
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,280
Give it to me.

509
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,660
Mr. Zhang.

510
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
I think your lyrics

511
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,830
are very refined.

512
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,750
How did you get it?

513
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,520
They were written by poets from my hometown.

514
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,330
Where are you from?

515
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,000
Why don't you introduce them to me?

516
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,620
They are old men.

517
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,090
You won't be interested.

518
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,580
I have to go.

519
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,050
I have something to do.

520
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,950
I have to get back to work.

521
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,940
Noodles.

522
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,900
15 yuan.

523
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,430
Forget it.

524
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,040
Five yuan.

525
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,780
What are you doing?

526
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,940
Why are you

527
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,260
eating instant noodles in my hotel?

528
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,220
This is a high-end hotel.

529
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,980
You're eating it here.

530
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,690
You're making

531
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,580
this place smell bad.

532
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,060
I saw

533
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,340
other customers eating instant noodles here before

534
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,450
and you didn't mind.

535
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,370
I got off work late today.

536
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,570
I'm really hungry, so I...

537
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,570
You can't eat it even if others did.

538
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,140
You...

539
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,380
Just eat this if you want.

540
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,090
Gosh.

541
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,460
Here is the weekly listening ranking.

542
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,780
No. 1. Daily Mood.

543
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,820
Shuang,

544
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,280
didn't you get the wrong form?

545
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,100
No.

546
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,210
That is yesterday's ranking.

547
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,500
No.2. Midnight Song.

548
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,110
Zhang Ye, you're awesome.

549
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,630
You did a good job.

550
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,180
Actually, I'm very happy today.

551
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,140
Zhang,

552
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,620
he is a rookie of our company.

553
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,340
I was trying

554
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,420
to get him to do a show.

555
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,370
I didn't expect

556
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,700
to be popular.

557
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,700
As the saying goes,

558
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,460
the waves behind the Yangtze river push on those ahead.

559
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,020
You're better than the elders.

560
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,100
While, look at us, the older generation,

561
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,000
we are old-fashioned,

562
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,930
stubborn, and self-righteous.

563
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,590
Now we have been surpassed

564
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,220
by the younger generation.

565
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,140
Mr. Zhao.

566
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,300
Anyway,

567
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,280
his show

568
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,020
in this time slot,

569
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,060
at least

570
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,300
half of the listeners

571
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,620
should be mine.

572
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,210
I didn't mean you.

573
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,540
You'd better show your abilities

574
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,980
and leave these things alone.

575
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,700
Zhang,

576
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,620
what you shouted

577
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,620
yesterday in the show...

578
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,500
It's called rapping.

579
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,750
It is a way of performing

580
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,550
that is closely bound up with the people.

581
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,260
The format is common,

582
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,660
but these words

583
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,650
are all golden sentences.

584
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,780
Xiaomei has asked the director to sort it out.

585
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,660
Wonderful.

586
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,610
Let me read it to you.

587
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,120
From Gushan Temple's north to Jia Ting's west,

588
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,210
the water is calm and just level with the dike.

589
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,580
Everywhere the early songbirds argue in the trees.

590
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,410
And whose new swallows are nesting with spring mud?

591
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,020
Myriads of flowers slowly enchant the eye.

592
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,430
The new grass barely covers the horse's hooves.

593
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,590
I love this eastern shore. I can't get enough of the tour,

594
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,710
especially the white dike under the shade of willows.

595
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,930
That's fantastic.

596
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,670
The picture

597
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,330
feels right in front of you.

598
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,780
How did you come up with that?

599
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,460
I just...

600
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,380
Well.

601
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,380
I just said it casually.

602
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,900
And these sentences.

603
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,040
Flowers fall from the sky as if from the moon.

604
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,390
Picking up the fresh flowers in front of the temple.

605
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,530
I still don't know why someone doesn't like the trees.

606
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,750
That must be because Chang'e scattered the flowers to the people.

607
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,410
You are excellent.

608
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,430
They're not golden sentences,

609
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,700
but unique ones.

610
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,840
Haven't you

611
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,290
heard any of these poems?

612
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,500
Never.

613
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,120
Amazing!

614
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,740
I've never heard of it.

615
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,210
Awesome.

616
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,870
Hello, everyone.

617
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,300
This is the Midnight Song of

618
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,250
Qomolangma Internet Radio.

619
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,520
I'm the host, Zhang Ye.

620
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,730
Therefore, our online hotline

621
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,260
is opening!

622
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,180
Hello?

623
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,140
Hello.

624
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,940
Mr. Zhang, is that me?

625
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,690
Yes.

626
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,600
Can you tell me

627
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,990
a good place to treat diarrhea?

628
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,700
This is obviously beyond

629
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,540
our show.

630
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,050
Well.

631
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,300
Let's enjoy

632
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,060
today's hot single.

633
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,480
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

634
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,150
♫It's deep night♫

635
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,810
Shuang,

636
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,850
what happened just now?

637
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,060
♫There are a few stars beside you♫

638
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,420
I've filtered it.

639
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,280
It was fine just now.

640
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,450
I don't know why that happened.

641
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,770
You'd better filter it strictly.

642
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,730
Don't answer

643
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,550
this kind of call again.

644
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,450
Okay.

645
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,200
♫I promise you♫

646
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,300
Look, Bin.

647
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,260
Isn't it awesome?

648
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,330
Do you have any other sounds?

649
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,570
Yes. I have a lot.

650
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,420
From a lady's voice, an auntie's voice,

651
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,060
a robot's voice to an old grandfather's voice,

652
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,900
I have it all.

653
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:02,950
Amazing.

654
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,860
Bin, rest assured.

655
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,060
I assure you,

656
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
he won't last for a week.

657
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,490
We'll let him leave

658
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,400
in frustration.

659
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,910
As long as you help me

660
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,900
get the Late Night DJ back,

661
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,720
we'll split the advertising fees

662
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,390
for this show equally

663
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,770
in the future.

664
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,100
Music only.

665
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,820
Besides.

666
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,540
Bin, don't worry.

667
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,830
Leave it to us.

668
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,380
Keep calling, man.

669
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,740
Mr. Four's business is my business.

670
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,380
Well done.

671
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,940
Good man.

672
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,860
What next?

673
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,540
Let's continue to answer our hotlines.

674
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,020
Hello?

675
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,660
Where are you?

676
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,850
Yeah, I have a date with your wife.

677
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,560
Sorry.

678
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,470
We only take

679
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,580
music calls only.

680
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,650
We don't chat.

681
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,450
Hello?

682
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,030
Hello.

683
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,750
Can you hear me?

684
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,330
Yes.

685
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,020
Mr. Zhang,

686
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,100
can I sing a song?

687
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,800
Sure.

688
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,410
The netizen

689
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,250
has just

690
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,140
inexplicably

691
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,020
expressed his excitement.

692
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,990
We can feel...

693
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,460
Hello.

694
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,410
The power in the song.

695
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,140
Yes.

696
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,460
We're taking singing calls right now.

697
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:06,930
But,

698
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,740
this may be the purpose

699
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,380
of our Midnight Song.

700
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,640
To relieve your pressure

701
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,900
and feel the meaning of life.

702
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,820
Next,

703
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,420
let's welcome the next listener.

704
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,380
Hi, Mr. Zhao.

705
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,180
I heard those hotlines just now.

706
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,140
Is something wrong?

707
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:20,980
What's going on here?

708
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,180
Look, Mr. Zhao.

709
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,780
These are hotlines just now.

710
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,980
I think someone did it on purpose.

711
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,460
But with your voice,

712
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,770
you can try...

713
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,050
Look, Shuang.

714
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,700
These IP addresses

715
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,540
are the same.

716
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,360
If you see the same IP

717
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,390
in the future,

718
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,740
you should try not to take it.

719
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,180
Understand?

720
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,180
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

721
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
Did she hang up all?

722
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,060
Man, I think

723
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,940
he must have changed his plan.

724
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,980
What should we do next?

725
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,660
What else,

726
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,860
keep calling.

727
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,980
If we get through, we should sing as hard as we can.

728
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,580
We must ruin the show.

729
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,130
With you by my side,

730
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,490
I can feel it.

731
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,660
Sorry

732
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,220
to keep the listener waiting.

733
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,820
I'll leave you to it.

734
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,060
Mr. Zhao, take care.

735
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,420
It makes me feel enlightened

736
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,300
and vigorous.

737
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,600
I don't get to hear that often.

738
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,530
I hope

739
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,700
you can

740
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,080
call our hotline often.

741
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,580
Because your voice

742
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,460
is really precious.

743
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,410
Let's welcome

744
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,270
the next listener.

745
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,750
Your voice is good.

746
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,420
But,

747
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,780
you'd better find a teacher

748
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,740
to guide you.

749
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,810
No one's answering the phone, Bin.

750
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,340
Stop pulling my arm.

751
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,300
Next,

752
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,000
let's welcome the next listener.

753
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,780
Hello?

754
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,210
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

755
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,540
I want to sing a song too.

756
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,250
Go ahead.

757
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,360
What do you want to sing?

758
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,350
We set sail at dawn from Baidi Town under a rosy sky,

759
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,330
on the thousand-mile trip to Jiangling and back the same day.

760
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,200
The noisy chatter of apes from the shores followed us all the way.

761
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,930
Our boat skips past ten thousand green mountains.

762
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,670
Ten thousand green mountains.

763
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,690
In scenic April, he headed down to Yangzhou.

764
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,300
My old friend said farewell at Yellow Crane Tower.

765
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,800
The Midnight Song

766
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,690
is so funny.

767
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
I've been listening to it for a week.

768
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,690
There's something new everyday.

769
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,450
Leaves always keep me so busy.

770
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,900
Hello, everyone.

771
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,120
Here is the Midnight Song of

772
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,120
Qomolangma Internet Radio.

773
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,200
I'm the host, Zhang Ye.

774
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:40,980
Okay.

775
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,380
Okay.

776
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,020
I'm leaving.

777
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,380
Bye.

778
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:42,780
Here you are.

779
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,210
Thank you.

780
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,290
Okay. Thank you.

781
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,460
Your style...

782
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,700
I think your current hosting style

783
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,340
is great too.

784
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,380
What do you think is your favorite

785
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,700
color scheme of the season?

786
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,090
What did I eat? Let me think about it.

787
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,090
After traveling across half of the city,

788
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,000
we were finally together.

789
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,860
Bin, did you get someone

790
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,020
to call those hotlines?

791
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,120
Don't slander me. I am a good man.

792
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,460
Bin,

793
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,940
I was wrong.

794
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,080
It's all my fault.

795
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,170
Can you stop pranking me.

796
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,540
If you keep doing that,

797
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,900
my show won't be able to go on.

798
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,780
I'll be doomed.

799
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,330
Now you know

800
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,640
who is the boss.

801
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,820
Everyone

802
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,930
has bad luck at times.

803
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,740
If you had given in earlier,

804
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,570
we wouldn't be

805
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,820
as unhappy as we are today.

806
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,500
Am I right?

807
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,250
Bin,

808
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,220
from now on, you are my boss.

809
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,900
I, Zhang Ye, will follow your lead.

810
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,300
Well, the show in the future...

811
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,300
You preside, I'll assist you.

812
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,820
Instead of splitting

813
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,460
the program,

814
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
let's merge the two shows.

815
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,820
But I think we need

816
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,660
to change the name of the show.

817
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,820
Look.

818
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,560
It is a talk show.

819
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,700
If it's called DJ,

820
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,780
then the interaction with the listeners will be bad.

821
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,260
I agree.

822
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,130
But the manuscript...

823
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,710
I'll write it.

824
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:49,820
What about the playlist?

825
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,540
I'll get it.

826
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,660
How did you figure it out?

827
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,980
I thought about it for a long time.

828
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,140
Look.

829
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,580
I'm a new bee

830
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,060
here.

831
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,820
I'm too weak

832
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,420
to compete with you.

833
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,340
Besides,

834
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,580
you've made so many IP calls

835
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,380
to disturb me.

836
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,650
It's an electronic war.

837
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,940
I didn't force you, right?

838
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,060
No, no.

839
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,140
If you regret it,

840
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,540
just tell me.

841
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,620
Well. Let us

842
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,340
make a deal then.

843
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,140
It's done.

844
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,920
Have you made up your mind?

845
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,830
Yes.

846
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,060
Mr. Zhao, Bin

847
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,850
is my senior

848
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,460
and the pillar of our station.

849
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,600
Let us do the show together.

850
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,730
Only by joining forces can we both win.

851
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,540
Zhang, you're being modest.

852
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,260
You did a good job.

853
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,020
And it's my duty

854
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,340
to bring up a new generation.

855
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,180
Bin is right.

856
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,060
Okay.

857
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,990
If you've made up your mind, just do it.

858
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,220
But I have one condition,

859
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,780
the ratings can't go down.

860
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,980
-Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.
-Rest assured, Mr. Zhao.

861
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,740
Alright.

862
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,300
Well, you...

863
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,020
After you, Bin.

864
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,980
You...

865
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,940
Bin, in the future,

866
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,550
I shall learn more from you.

867
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,580
You're too modest.

868
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,120
Here you are.

869
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,220
Well...

870
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,310
I can tell that you love it.

871
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,220
Thank you.

872
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,740
Come on, bro.

873
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,420
She rolled her eyes at me.

874
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:50,860
What does that mean?

875
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,340
No, no, no.

876
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
She's always like this.

877
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,020
Maybe she likes you.

878
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,540
Really?

879
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,940
Many people in the company

880
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,900
always do that to me.

881
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,700
Probably they all like you.

882
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,370
No way.

883
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,380
It's your damn charm.

884
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,220
Okay.

885
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,700
Get the hotline in.

886
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,080
♫I admit♫

887
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,630
♫I do not have the talent to be loved♫

888
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,220
♫but I try to give it up♫

889
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,400
Hello.

890
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,500
I heard your touching voice just now.

891
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,380
I think

892
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,650
if you want to

893
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,220
to be professional,

894
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,210
your vocal position

895
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,710
still needs to be adjusted.

896
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,340
Okay, the next one.

897
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,650
♫To protect you♫

898
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,230
Auntie,

899
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,680
after you finish

900
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,500
the braids today,

901
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,540
will it look as pretty as yours

902
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,700
when I untie it

903
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,380
as yours tomorrow?

904
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,220
Yes.

905
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,380
You'll become

906
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,320
as pretty as I am.

907
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,460
Hello.

908
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,780
In fact, I think

909
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,260
singing...

910
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,060
If you ask yourself

911
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
as a singer,

912
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,230
then your emotions...

913
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,900
He is so annoying,

914
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,780
sings badly,

915
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,699
and talks too much.

916
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,020
He always interrupts

917
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,900
when others are talking.

918
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,500
you can't accumulate life, this should be life experience,

919
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,580
the better emotions

920
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,690
you will express.

921
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,250
Okay?

922
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:21,630
Okay.

923
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,980
So,

924
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,040
let's listen to a piece of music

925
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,540
and relax.

926
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,620
So annoying.

927
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,650
Auntie, you are concerned about him.

928
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,500
Nonsense.

929
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,840
I'm afraid he can't pay me back.

930
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,650
I'm afraid he can't pay my rent.

931
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,300
Go to bed now.

932
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,820
I'm going to stop braiding for you.

933
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,170
You haven't finished it yet.

934
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,380
Braid some more for me.

935
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,150
I'll do it tomorrow.

936
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:42,580
Go.

937
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,630
Okay.

938
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,990
Say something,

939
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,210
Zhang Ye.

940
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,350
He's so annoying.

941
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,400
Bin, you're great.

942
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,130
That's terrible.

943
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,810
Have a bite.

944
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,550
Oh, no.

945
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,890
Are we gonna take hotlines again later?

946
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,780
I told you few people

947
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,010
would listen to the late-night show.

948
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,850
Enjoy it in time.

949
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:23,650
Wow.

950
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,870
Let's get drunk today.

951
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,900
Come on.

952
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,500
I'm not drinking.

953
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:29,900
I really don't drink.

954
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,340
Listen.

955
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,500
Next time,

956
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,660
if there's wine,

957
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,100
you can serve

958
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,420
it with...

959
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:35,900
Some fruit plates?

960
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,100
Some side dishes?

961
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,480
Yeah.

962
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,190
Okay.

963
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,900
I'll prepare it for you next time.

964
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,650
The rating of the Midnight Song

965
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,900
is dropping to the sixth at the same time slot.

966
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,670
Its quality is seriously declining.

967
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,980
What's going on?

968
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,050
The two of you doing the show together

969
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,150
is worse than one doing it alone.

970
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,290
The advertisers

971
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,710
called several times.

972
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,210
If this goes on,

973
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,010
both of you

974
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,120
will suffer.

975
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,660
Well...

976
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,650
Tian Bin, tell me.

977
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,560
What's going on?

978
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:08,970
Mr. Zhao.

979
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,940
Zhang Ye did the planning

980
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,140
of the show.

981
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,780
Tell it to Mr. Zhao.

982
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,710
Hurry up.

983
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,500
He...

984
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,390
Zhang Ye.

985
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,180
You were eloquent

986
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,490
when you hosted before.

987
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,900
Recently,

988
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,020
why haven't I heard you speaking?

989
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,660
I've listened to your show.

990
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,980
All you said was "Mm," and "Ah's."

991
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,260
There's no atmosphere at all.

992
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,290
Do you have toothache or sore throat pain?

993
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,580
Is it so hard for a top student

994
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,180
from the broadcasting institute to talk?

995
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,740
Tell us.

996
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,920
Say something.

997
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,300
Bin,

998
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,860
you made me speak.

999
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,780
Well, I'll speak out.

1000
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,860
Hurry up.

1001
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,090
We are waiting for you.

1002
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,480
I'm gonna tell everyone what happened.

1003
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,820
Mr. Zhao.

1004
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,210
Here's the thing.

1005
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,600
Bin was drinking in the studio.

1006
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,900
He got drunk

1007
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,160
and spoke incoherently.

1008
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,900
I uttered

1009
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,060
so many filler words

1010
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,100
just to cover up the sound

1011
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,780
of his drinking.

1012
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,620
It's to cover up that sound.

1013
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,100
I didn't...

1014
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:07,450
And...

1015
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,090
Look.

1016
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,600
This is a live show.

1017
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,980
I have to take the hotlines.

1018
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,140
It's a huge responsibility,

1019
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,350
so I dare not neglect it.

1020
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,020
That's why I can't be talkative.

1021
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,700
No, I...

1022
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,760
You're talking nonsense!

1023
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,880
Zhang Ye, you're slandering me!

1024
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,520
Do you have evidence

1025
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,610
that I was drinking during that time?

1026
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,590
I...

1027
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,820
How could I have evidence?

1028
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,250
Look.

1029
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
You have no evidence,

1030
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,900
so you are slandering me.

1031
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,300
Listen.

1032
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,820
Besides,

1033
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,020
he gave me the wine.

1034
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,700
So,

1035
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,060
you admit

1036
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,220
you drank in the live stream room?

1037
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,900
No, I don't.

1038
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,800
No, I...

1039
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,310
I have never drunk it.

1040
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
I didn't drink it.

1041
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,580
He gave it to me,

1042
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,300
but I didn't drink it.

1043
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:44,900
I gave you the wine.

1044
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,340
I didn't expect

1045
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,700
you would drink it in the live stream room.

1046
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,370
No...

1047
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,850
I did give you a drink.

1048
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,340
Shut up!

1049
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:49,940
I... I...

1050
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,700
I'm Zhao Guozhou.

1051
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,340
Go and investigate

1052
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,940
the surveillance footage

1053
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,860
during the Midnight Song hours.

1054
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,660
If you find

1055
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,420
any violation of the rules,

1056
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,660
let me know immediately.

1057
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,700
Okay.

1058
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,420
No need to check it.

1059
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,450
No, no.

1060
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,110
Dismiss.

1061
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:05,820
Well.

1062
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,060
No, no, no.

1063
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,440
Mr. Zhao.

1064
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,870
Mr. Zhao, actually I...

1065
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,550
Mr. Zhao, I...

1066
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:18,940
Tian Bin,

1067
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,080
put down

1068
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,610
all the work.

1069
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,650
Leave it to Zhang.

1070
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,650
Well...

1071
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,140
Report to the printing room

1072
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,980
after work.

1073
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,900
Well. Listen.

1074
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,190
Fine, drinking on the show

1075
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,540
is not a small matter.

1076
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,720
The company has informed us.

1077
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,360
We'll talk about it later.

1078
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,620
Congratulations.

1079
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,850
You will be

1080
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,460
my real competitor.

1081
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,000
Come on, Miss Xiaomei.

1082
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,340
You're my senior.

1083
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,440
I have a lot to learn from you.

1084
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,740
Okay, I'm leaving.

1085
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,530
Bye, lady.

1086
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,570
I didn't know

1087
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,100
you're quite tolerant.

1088
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,580
I thought you were convinced.

1089
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,260
You did a great job

1090
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,580
with this trick.

1091
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,970
Sure.

1092
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,430
If you see it all,

1093
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,150
then it's not a good trick.

1094
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,100
Fine.

1095
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,740
Are you playing this trick with me?

1096
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,940
You'll see!

1097
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,860
You threaten me.

1098
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,380
Ignore him.

1099
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,970
It's funny.

1100
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:34,660
By the way,

1101
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,860
remember to check the accounts.

1102
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,700
It's pay day.

1103
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,120
Treat us to dinner when you get the money.

1104
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:40,900
Remember it.

1105
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,420
Don't forget to treat us to dinner.

1106
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,900
Your cousin is getting married.

1107
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,300
We need to give them the money.

1108
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,700
It's 1,600 yuan.

1109
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,210
And we need

1110
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,980
to pay our Internet bill this month.

1111
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:01,810
We need to pay for a year.

1112
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,870
It's 1,400 yuan.

1113
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,580
And the gas, water bill,

1114
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,660
and the electricity bill

1115
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,020
let's do it as 200 yuan.

1116
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,740
And the monthly food

1117
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,780
is 600 yuan.

1118
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,620
And,

1119
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,380
your sneakers are broken.

1120
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,540
Can you get them mended

1121
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,220
and try to wear them?

1122
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,500
If...

1123
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:18,980
No, no.

1124
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,220
No, the sneakers can't be mended.

1125
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,650
Well.

1126
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,220
I'll give you 200 yuan

1127
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,100
to buy a new pair.

1128
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,780
200 yuan?

1129
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,990
I can't even buy one of them

1130
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,540
for 200 yuan.

1131
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,690
Do you want it?

1132
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,740
If not, you shall wear sandals.

1133
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,660
It's not cold now.

1134
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,060
All right.

1135
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,580
I still have

1136
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,780
100 yuan for cigarettes every month.

1137
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,280
You take it.

1138
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,900
I'll quit smoking next month.

1139
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,090
You said it.

1140
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,220
You can't go back on your word.

1141
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,420
Give the money to him.

1142
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:47,940
Okay.

1143
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,100
From now on,

1144
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,760
your monthly 100 yuan for cigarettes

1145
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,210
is gone.

1146
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,420
That will be yours.

1147
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,380
Is 300 yuan enough?

1148
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,940
Even 300 yuan is not enough.

1149
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,380
I'll quit drinking next month too.

1150
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,700
Smoking is bad for the lungs,

1151
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,340
and drinking is bad for the liver.

1152
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,180
To save some medical expenses in the future,

1153
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,020
I'll quit them both.

1154
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,020
As the old saying goes,

1155
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,360
if you don't arrange the money well,

1156
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,300
you'll be poor.

1157
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:10,850
Brat,

1158
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,340
when you have money later,

1159
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,600
buy your dad a big wine jar

1160
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,060
and let him soak in it every day.

1161
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:19,860
What do you think?

1162
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,620
Did you hear that?

1163
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,170
She must hate me so much.

1164
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Look at your dad.

1165
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,500
I just want you to drink enough.

1166
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,740
Look at him.

1167
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,060
Hello?

1168
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,220
I'm leaving.

1169
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,360
Has Shishi arrived?

1170
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,820
Okay, I'll be right there.

1171
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,410
Okay.

1172
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,500
Does he have the same experience

1173
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,420
with me?

1174
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,290
It chased him half the village, you know?

1175
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,240
Are you kidding me?

1176
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,390
It's not a big deal.

1177
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,220
The point is

1178
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,050
that he didn't bring up his pants.

1179
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,800
You know?

1180
00:41:59,490 --> 00:41:59,930
This way, please.

1181
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,900
He was running over there

1182
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,980
in the half-torn pants.

1183
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,140
Can you imagine that?

1184
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,340
Please come in.

1185
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:05,900
Drink it.

1186
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,580
Okay.

1187
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,660
Otherwise, we will be embarrassed to start eating.

1188
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:11,930
Zhang Ye!

1189
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,680
I thought you weren't coming.

1190
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,620
Waiter, add a chair.

1191
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,050
Okay.

1192
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,700
It's okay.

1193
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,970
I'm a little busy at work.

1194
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,470
I'm late.

1195
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,420
Cheers.

1196
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:20,860
Come on.

1197
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,460
Have a toast.

1198
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:21,900
Come on.

1199
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,210
Come.

1200
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,100
Come on.

1201
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,270
Your bracelet is a limited edition, right?

1202
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,180
It's for fun.

1203
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,380
I just saw

1204
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,420
the diamond ring on Sisi's hand

1205
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,540
dazzling enough,

1206
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,880
at least two carats.

1207
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,060
Come on, look. Gorgeous.

1208
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,810
It's so sparkling.

1209
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,650
So beautiful.

1210
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,060
Qiang.

1211
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,720
Nice.

1212
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,220
It's great.

1213
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,140
Where did you buy the watch?

1214
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,330
I bought it on a trip to Europe.

1215
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,040
I didn't raise the price.

1216
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,580
Your piece is good too.

1217
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,660
It's gold, right?

1218
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,270
Zhang Ye, let me tell you.

1219
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,960
Wearing a suit,

1220
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,610
you have to

1221
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,780
pull the sleeves out.

1222
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,640
Otherwise, not only is it ugly

1223
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,100
but this is very disrespectful to yourself.

1224
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,360
Well, don't tell me

1225
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,950
you're wearing

1226
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,060
a half-sleeve shirt inside?

1227
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,410
Stop guessing.

1228
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:02,860
I'm sorry.

1229
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,290
Zhang Ye, what's wrong with your hand?

1230
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,280
To be honest, I burned my hand from cooking.

1231
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,660
Zhang Ye,

1232
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,270
I heard that

1233
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,900
you went to the technical school to learn to be a chef.

1234
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:13,720
You are

1235
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,900
a talented student of the broadcasting institute.

1236
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,370
Are you really going to be a cook?

1237
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,980
What are you doing?

1238
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,290
You look shabby.

1239
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,340
Forget it.

1240
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,010
I am unwilling to buy

1241
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,880
a decent shirt.

1242
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,390
I could only hang a fake collar

1243
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,230
to pretend to be wearing a shirt.

1244
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,900
Is it funny?

1245
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,300
I thought you were funny.

1246
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,530
Stop pretending.

1247
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,780
Did you buy

1248
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,570
your watch yourself?

1249
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,130
Did you

1250
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,620
find your job by yourself?

1251
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:57,930
Man,

1252
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,060
do not study the watch,

1253
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,480
read more if you have time.

1254
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,070
Mo Yan was not related

1255
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,530
to Maupassant.

1256
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,460
You're the most ridiculous.

1257
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,520
You told us that

1258
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,460
your husband was responsible for making money

1259
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,060
but you're in charge of beauty.

1260
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,380
Have you heard of a saying?

1261
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,580
People don't live a good life all the time,

1262
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,510
and flowers don't last red forever.

1263
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,740
Beauty

1264
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,160
is the most unreliable thing.

1265
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,380
When you get old one day,

1266
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,060
your husband can raise another woman.

1267
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,740
Well...

1268
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,900
Zhang Ye drank a lot today.

1269
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:29,900
Yes.

1270
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:30,960
What else

1271
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,660
do you want to say to Sisi and me?

1272
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,140
Tian Bin.

1273
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,260
Wang Sisi.

1274
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,750
I wish you happiness.

1275
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:52,780
Come on.

1276
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,260
It's a happy day.

1277
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,780
It's a reunion.

1278
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,380
Stop acting.

1279
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:58,860
Let's drink.

1280
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,540
This way, please.

1281
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:16,910
Please come in.

1282
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,020
I'll drink first.

1283
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,440
Young Master.
