[Episode 7]

4
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,400
Everyone,

5
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,660
it happened suddenly today.

6
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,060
I was in a hurry.

7
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,890
So I stole some of your masterpieces.

8
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,140
If I offended

9
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,140
you,

10
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,590
please forgive me.

11
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,630
Don't blame me.

12
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,660
I...

13
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,380
I prepared some sacrifices

14
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,940
for you.

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,620
You guys are generous.

16
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,460
Please take it as the copyright fee.

17
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,500
Don't blame me.

18
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Let me kowtow to you.

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,390
I'll accept it.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,580
Are you crazy?

21
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,060
You are not in the same time and space.

22
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,340
They can't receive the apples

23
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,490
you gave them.

24
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,020
It's the thought that counts.

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,140
Let me tell you.

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,980
We literary academics

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,780
can refer to other people's works,

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,340
but we can't plagiarize them.

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,290
You're quite special.

30
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,130
But those poets

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,140
help you find

32
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,860
a new job.

33
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,940
And you accepted that, didn't you?

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,280
Well...

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,500
That's different.

36
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,540
Anyway you've already resigned,

37
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,380
you will work

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,940
in Big Durain Company, right?

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,140
Do me a favor.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,460
Give me a membership account

41
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,500
of their company.

42
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,820
I'm binge-watching

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,740
on their website.

44
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,940
That's all?

45
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,060
Mr. Yao

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,820
asked me to go to work tomorrow.

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,980
I told him to wait.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,420
I have one more thing to do.

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,530
What is it?

50
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,140
Something important.

51
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,380
♫Are you the same as me♫

52
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,320
♫Lowering your head under the sun♫

53
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,380
♫Sweating♫

54
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,820
♫And working hard silently♫

55
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,140
♫Are you the same as me♫

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,100
♫Being ignored♫

57
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,140
♫But still not giving up♫

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,300
♫The life you want♫

59
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,500
♫Because I don't care♫

60
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,540
♫What others say♫

61
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,060
♫I've never forgotten♫

62
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,700
♫My promise to myself♫

63
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,090
♫And my perseverance to love♫

64
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,220
♫I know my future is not a dream♫

65
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,420
♫I live every minute seriously♫

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,420
♫My future is not a dream♫

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,620
♫My heart is beating with hope♫

68
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,540
♫It's beating with hope♫

69
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,100
Good.

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,540
You handled the details well.

71
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,850
Your emotions are also perfect.

72
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,460
It's really easy to record a song for you.

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,340
I don't need to edit it.

74
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,110
The lyrics are good.

75
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,409
It feels like

76
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,430
someone who has gone through difficulties,

77
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,900
but continues to

78
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,100
pursue his dream.

79
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,820
I wonder

80
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,980
what the writer was thinking

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,659
when he wrote the words.

82
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,730
I think you sang very well.

83
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,900
You touched me deeply.

84
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,540
But I always feel

85
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
something is missing.

86
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,460
Let me record it again.

87
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,380
Okay.

88
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,930
Tian Bin, I asked you here today

89
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,260
to know

90
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,250
about your work.

91
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,260
Have you met

92
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,580
any difficulties recently?

93
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,340
No.

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,980
My job

95
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,860
has been

96
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,810
going well.

97
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,570
Really?

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,620
The rate of audience is decreasing.

99
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,970
How can you explain that?

100
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,260
But, but my work attitude

101
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,180
has always been good.

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,510
But Mr. Zhao,

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,580
there must be something wrong

104
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,420
with Shuang's attitude.

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,810
She can't even

106
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,340
make

107
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,220
a cup of coffee.

108
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,170
Well,

109
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm talking about

110
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,580
about your work.

111
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,300
Someone said

112
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,180
you were drinking before the show.

113
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
No, I...

114
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,020
The donkey must eat grass

115
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,000
before grinding.

116
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,220
My show is very late.

117
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,130
If I don't eat suppers,

118
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,770
I can't hold on.

119
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,540
Besides,

120
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,210
I only drank a little.

121
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,980
I didn't delay my work.

122
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,820
You're ridiculous.

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,300
Drinking during work

124
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,540
is against the rules.

125
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,530
No, no, no.

126
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,370
Mr. Zhao,

127
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,050
please give me another chance.

128
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,020
After all,

129
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,740
I've contributed so much

130
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,420
for our company.

131
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,820
Right?

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,980
Last time,

133
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,420
I contact Zhang Yuanqi

134
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,820
in the name of our company

135
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,980
to sold her that song.

136
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,580
When she becomes famous,

137
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,460
she will

138
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,340
bring honor to our company.

139
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,050
We both know

140
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,380
who wrote that song.

141
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,210
In order to maintain the image of the company,

142
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:27,980
please

143
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,300
stop showing off

144
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,140
this thing.

145
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,330
The Mid-Autumn Poetry Event

146
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,500
was controversial

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,580
on the Internet a few days ago.

148
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,780
I don't need to

149
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,260
to remind you

150
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,020
of that, right?

151
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,060
About the Mid-Autumn Poetry Event,

152
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,620
it must be Zhang Ye

153
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,340
who framed me.

154
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,740
So,

155
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,290
he was fired.

156
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,740
Anyway, Mr. Zhao,

157
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,140
well...

158
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,420
That song

159
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,970
is the work of our company.

160
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,220
I will never

161
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,360
steal the thunder.

162
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,860
And the remuneration also has your share.

163
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,290
Tian Bin,

164
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,020
our company is gonna promote positive energy

165
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,620
to the whole society.

166
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,900
What you're doing now

167
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,700
is completely contrary to

168
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,700
the spirit of the company.

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,580
This is the decision of the board of directors.

170
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,460
You're fired.

171
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,220
I can't help you this time.

172
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,690
No, this...

173
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,340
This...

174
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,340
Shuang,

175
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,780
I gave you a book.

176
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,740
Take it back and have a look.

177
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,860
Sorry, I'm illiterate.

178
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:46,700
You...

179
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,620
You...

180
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,980
I just praised you to Mr. Zhao.

181
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,560
Miss Xiaomei,

182
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,180
I'm resigning to do We-Media.

183
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
Can you

184
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,870
record

185
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,060
for me?

186
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,220
We-Media

187
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,680
should be done by yourself.

188
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,330
No foresight.

189
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,260
Cao.

190
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,420
I've forgot that

191
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,820
Mr. Zhao is looking for me.

192
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,220
Your mind

193
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,460
is always not clear.

194
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,360
Zeng.

195
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,539
Does anyone want to go to the toilet?

196
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,260
I'll go.

197
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,179
I'll go.

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,659
Let's go.

199
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,980
Yuanyuan.

200
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,410
I think your voice

201
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,180
is also nice.

202
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,960
How about record a topic for me?

203
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,290
I can't do that.

204
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,440
I can teach you.

205
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,100
Look, the opportunity

206
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,460
is fleeting.

207
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,420
Bin, you're here too.

208
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,020
Are you avoiding me?

209
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,860
No.

210
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,100
I really didn't see you.

211
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,150
Then why did you run?

212
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,170
I left my phone in the car.

213
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm gonna get it.

214
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,740
Look.

215
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,790
My phone is right here.

216
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,390
My suspension is not contagious.

217
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,650
Why are you nervous?

218
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,430
Bin, to be honest,

219
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,820
someone knows

220
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,460
the last time

221
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,420
we asked someone

222
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,700
to harass Zhang Ye's show.

223
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,900
There are so many rumors.

224
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,680
And now you...

225
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,800
I have to avoid arousing suspicion.

226
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,110
When we did it,

227
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,310
you were as brave

228
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,450
as a chimpanzee.

229
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,020
Now you're frightened?

230
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
Let them know.

231
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,190
It's no big deal.

232
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,730
Bin, I can’t compare with you.

233
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
You've sold a song

234
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,250
and made enough money for living.

235
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,900
I have to support my family.

236
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,980
Alright, there are many people here.

237
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,980
It's inconvenient for us to talk.

238
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,820
I'm leaving.

239
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:20,710
Wait.

240
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,260
There's no one here.

241
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,040
Yuanyuan,

242
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,250
do you think what I said

243
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,780
makes sense?

244
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,940
We have nothing to do anyway, right?

245
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,300
Miss Zhang.

246
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,730
It's me.

247
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,460
Who are you?

248
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,340
No, no, no.

249
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,020
What are you doing?

250
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,580
No, no, no.

251
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,780
It's a misunderstanding.

252
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,540
I'm...

253
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,340
Tian Bin from the Qomolangma Network Entertainment.

254
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,070
Miss Zhang. Are you the same as me

255
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,540
lowering your head under the sun?

256
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,900
Yes, it's me.

257
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,180
Here, Ms. Qi, your coffee.

258
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,500
Okay, thank you.

259
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,260
Here.

260
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,900
My team is preparing

261
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,940
for the recording of this song

262
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,220
My Future Is Not a Dream.

263
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm looking for someone to arrange it.

264
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,140
You said you want to

265
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,650
share some creation experience with me.

266
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,340
Yes.

267
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,290
When I

268
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,860
composed this song,

269
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,740
I always thought

270
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,110
it was perfect

271
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,640
for you

272
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,900
to sing this song.

273
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,180
Really?

274
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,140
But the original tone of this song

275
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,750
is different from my voice.

276
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,110
Yes, it...

277
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,220
It's because someone

278
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,230
sang this song before.

279
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,830
You mean

280
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,500
someone sang this song

281
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,840
before setting the key.

282
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,490
No, it's not like that.

283
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,060
I... I mean

284
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,910
I made it for you

285
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,310
from the beginning.

286
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,840
But I didn't expect

287
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,070
I could hand it

288
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,820
to you personally.

289
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,780
So I set a boy's key.

290
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,200
Who would have thought that the dream would come true?

291
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,860
I see.

292
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,780
When you were writing,

293
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,900
why did you want me to sing?

294
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,460
I always think

295
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,580
there is a soft power

296
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,500
in your voice.

297
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,660
If you sing it,

298
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,490
it will definitely

299
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,420
make people cry.

300
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,320
Make people cry?

301
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,780
Isn't this

302
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,060
a song full of hope?

303
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,500
Full of hope

304
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,620
can still make people cry.

305
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,450
Actually, my creation...

306
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,860
Sorry.

307
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,260
No. You...

308
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,700
Who are you?

309
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,940
This is Zhang Ye.

310
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,980
Can I talk to you now?

311
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,260
Go ahead.

312
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
I wanted to talk to you

313
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,220
about that song.

314
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,420
What a coincidence.

315
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,220
Actually,

316
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,940
this song wasn't written by Tian Bin.

317
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,260
He heard me sing it

318
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,330
on the show.

319
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,780
Then he secretly registered the copyright

320
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,340
and sold it to you.

321
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,600
Of course, I have no evidence.

322
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,660
You don't have to trust me completely.

323
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,140
I just feel sorry.

324
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,060
Because during the show,

325
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,180
I made some mistakes when I sang it.

326
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,220
And I didn't express

327
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,820
the spirit of the original singer well.

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,820
This song

329
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,820
was supposed to bring people strength

330
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,980
and encourage people to work hard.

331
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,260
But

332
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,780
I didn't sing well that day.

333
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,620
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

334
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,260
Because the author of this song

335
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,300
is not me.

336
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,960
The original singer of this song is Zhang Yusheng.

337
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,940
He is

338
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,400
a very talented musician.

339
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,770
Can you introduce me to him?

340
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,480
He is...

341
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,290
He is my distant cousin.

342
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,400
But

343
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,010
he's gone now.

344
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,100
I heard

345
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,260
you're going to sing this song

346
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,100
at the charity party?

347
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,420
Yes.

348
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,420
In terms of singing,

349
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,420
I have a suggestion.

350
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,860
The rhythm of

351
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,460
the studio version

352
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,500
can be relatively simple.

353
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,530
But if you really want to sing live,

354
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
we should improve the rhythm.

355
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,500
And I hope you can add some harmony

356
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,320
in the chorus part.

357
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,180
How about this?

358
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,180
Let's go to the studio and have a try.

359
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,930
Sure.

360
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,300
Sorry, it's for work.

361
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
It's okay.

362
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,290
Help yourself.

363
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Then I'll continue.

364
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,900
For example,

365
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,580
after someone worked all day,

366
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,620
he was so tired that

367
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,740
he fell asleep as soon as he got home.

368
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,660
But the next day,

369
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,930
he woke up with hope again.

370
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,780
Actually, what I want to express

371
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,860
through the song

372
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,970
is like that.

373
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,560
Good.

374
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,530
Yes.

375
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,860
I have something to do later.

376
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,500
If you don't mind,

377
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,380
you can

378
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,260
finish your coffee here.

379
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,290
I don't mind. Go ahead.

380
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,110
Coffee.

381
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,780
Coffee is finished.

382
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,350
I know

383
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,050
♫My future is not a dream♫

384
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,920
♫I live every minute seriously♫

385
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,450
♫My future is not a dream♫

386
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,050
♫My heart is beating with hope♫

387
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,060
♫My future is not a dream♫

388
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,440
♫I live every minute seriously♫

389
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,930
♫My future is not a dream♫

390
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,700
♫My heart is beating with hope♫

391
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,460
♫It's beating with hope♫

392
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:29,800
Water.

393
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,600
How is it?

394
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,620
After the arrangement was modified,

395
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,620
it really

396
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,320
sounds

397
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,590
more exciting.

398
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,240
And the lyrics

399
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,320
are also edited well.

400
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,420
It's all thanks to Zhang Ye.

401
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,380
Thank you.

402
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,180
I'm not greedy for credit.

403
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,260
This song

404
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,670
should have been like this.

405
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,080
Don't be modest.

406
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,820
It's late. Let's have dinner together.

407
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,550
Sure.

408
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,340
I'm good at eating.

409
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,290
Let's go.

410
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,569
Ms. Qi, you're quite a drinker.

411
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,569
You don't drink much when you meet a bosom friend.

412
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,760
Go on.

413
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,300
Sound is

414
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,550
the most primitive form of communication

415
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,220
for all living creatures.

416
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,740
Although the moles have no eyes,

417
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,619
they can sense the world

418
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,740
through vibration.

419
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,540
Bats use ultrasound.

420
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,819
Whales can use sound waves

421
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,140
to communicate with their mates

422
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,820
thousands of miles away.

423
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,930
Have you ever felt like this?

424
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,620
You often get dizzy

425
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,180
or get goose bumps

426
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,900
because of the melody

427
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,220
or the rhythms of a piece of music.

428
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes, that's it.

429
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,060
Because vision

430
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,330
is objective,

431
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,900
while hearing is sensitive.

432
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,660
Do you know why

433
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,410
sound can move people?

434
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,900
Because it can

435
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,740
resonate with people's soul.

436
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,660
♫Are you the same as me♫

437
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,090
Of course, it's a bit mysterious.

438
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,700
♫Lowering your head under the sun♫

439
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,020
Because the soul

440
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,030
can't be explained until now.

441
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,500
And I think

442
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,180
♫Sweating and working hard silently♫

443
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,100
many feelings

444
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,020
are personal.

445
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,510
Music can be shared.

446
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,650
♫Are you the same as me being ignored♫

447
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,540
Good point.

448
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,940
Here, a toast to you.

449
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,260
Thank you.

450
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:14,940
Cheers.

451
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,740
Cheers.

452
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,160
♫But still not giving up the life you want♫

453
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,310
♫Are you the same as me being busy pursuing♫

454
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,980
Humans are still confused about

455
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,300
the so-called soul

456
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,660
and mind.

457
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:31,800
They're still in a low stage.

458
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,820
♫Pursuing some unexpected tenderness♫

459
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,740
We don't know

460
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,930
what the soul is either.

461
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,920
So we never waste time

462
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,290
on this.

463
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,940
♫Are you the same as me being all adrift once♫

464
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,580
We're in the advanced stage, idiot.

465
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,240
♫Over and over again wandering the crossing street♫

466
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,140
Auntie.

467
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,940
What do you want to watch?

468
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,620
You've changed

469
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,530
eight rounds.

470
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,300
Did Zhang Ye tell you

471
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,050
where he went?

472
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,260
No.

473
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,180
He was supposed to help me

474
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,060
with my homework.

475
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,620
He's not here yet.

476
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,220
What are you doing?

477
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,220
I didn't supervise you for a while.

478
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,540
Why did you open them all?

479
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,620
Didn't you brush your teeth?

480
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,970
Stop eating.

481
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,740
Go to brush your teeth.

482
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,980
They're all open.

483
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,540
I told you not to eat so many snacks.

484
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,700
Don't eat so many snacks.

485
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,180
Ms. Qi.

486
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,580
I can't drink anymore.

487
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,370
This is the last cup.

488
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,030
Let me make a toast to you,

489
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:58,980
on behalf of Zhang Yusheng.

490
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,500
You sang so well.

491
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,260
Come.

492
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,620
It's getting late.

493
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,100
Let me send you home.

494
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,340
Send me back?

495
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,260
I'm afraid I can't control myself.

496
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,460
What?

497
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,900
If I can't,

498
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,970
I'll throw up on your car. It's dirty.

499
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,950
If you throw up on my car,

500
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,660
I'll deduct the money from your remuneration.

501
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,530
Remuneration?

502
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,060
The remuneration for our next cooperation.

503
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,940
Didn't we agree that

504
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,560
we'll work together next time?

505
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,880
Deal!

506
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,020
You're back.

507
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,780
Why are you back so late?

508
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,580
What time is it?

509
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,580
I am wondering

510
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,900
why are you're still up so late?

511
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,090
I can't sleep. I'd like some tea.

512
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,570
Didn't you want me

513
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,730
to prove myself?

514
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,460
I drank a little

515
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,100
with Zhang Yuanqi.

516
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,780
I told her.

517
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I told her the song

518
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,450
was written by me,

519
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,910
but was stolen by Tian Bin.

520
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,420
Did she believe it?

521
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,700
Of course.

522
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,420
We're both artists.

523
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,690
We can get through easily.

524
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,570
Because she's a superstar.

525
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,060
Look at her good figure, manner

526
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,940
and temperament.

527
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,920
It's hard to find a bosom friend.

528
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,700
Besides drinking with the superstar,

529
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,580
what else did you talk about?

530
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,290
The superstar said

531
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,860
she understood me.

532
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,220
Then you drink your tea.

533
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,710
I'm going upstairs to sleep.

534
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,720
Good night.

535
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,650
[Protect intellectual property Get a reward of 50,000 fame value]

536
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,330
Protect intellectual property.

537
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,530
Get a reward of 50,000 fame value.

538
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,540
Are there pickles in your phone?

539
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,540
You've been staring at your phone.

540
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,660
That day,

541
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,260
I told Mr. Yao of Big Durain Company

542
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,980
that I'm ready

543
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,780
to join the company.

544
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,410
Why hasn't he answered me yet?

545
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,180
He invited you kindly, but you gave him the cold shoulder.

546
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,260
You're still playing hard-to-get on getting a job.

547
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,420
You've blown it!

548
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,860
Did he drink heavily

549
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,740
and go back on it after he woke up?

550
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,460
If you don't have a job,

551
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,740
let's go on a trip with Chenchen.

552
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,580
Hello.

553
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,900
You can come to work tomorrow.

554
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,900
Okay, Mr. Yao.

555
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,450
Really?

556
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,620
Okay.

557
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,700
Don't worry. I'll be ready.

558
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,780
Mr. Yao told me

559
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,380
to go to work tomorrow.

560
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,540
What did you just say?

561
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,100
Well...

562
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,260
Congratulations.

563
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,300
I can finally

564
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,780
get the rent again.

565
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,140
You're welcome.

566
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,370
Tomorrow is my first day at work.

567
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,980
I need to dress up.

568
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,020
How about

569
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,670
going shopping with me tonight?

570
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,060
I don't have time.

571
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:09,780
Squeeze.

572
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,300
Okay.

573
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,580
Then stop eating.

574
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,620
Alright.

575
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,860
This one looks nice.

576
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:30,860
Is this okay?

577
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,060
This is not formal.

578
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,170
I'm going to work

579
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,020
instead of hiking.

580
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,380
Let's look at others.

581
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,380
This one.

582
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,660
What do you think of this one?

583
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,060
I think they're all good.

584
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,730
You can try them on.

585
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:04,820
Okay.

586
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,100
Where can I pay the bill?

587
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,860

I'm here to report.

590
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,660
Hello, Zhang Ye, right?

591
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,060
Are you new in the Planning Department?

592
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,380
Yes.

593
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,560
It's on the second floor. Please follow me.

594
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,930
This is your seat.

595
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,450
What should I do?

596
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,870
Someone will tell you later.

597
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,020
Thank you.

You're welcome.

600
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,320
I'm new here.

My name is Zhang Ye.

602
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,410
He is the new employee

603
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,320
of our department?

604
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,740
I heard that

605
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,900
Mr. Yao introduced him.

606
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,290
I don't know who he is.

607

[Planning Department]

608
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,940
You're Zhang Ye, right?

609
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,140
Hello.

610
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,340
My surname is Yan, the director of the Planning Department.

611
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,900
Mr. Yao told me about you.

612
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,620
I didn't expect you to come so soon.

613
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,260
Welcome.

614
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,300
Director Yan,

615
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,100
what is my job?

616
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,300
You can watch some shows.

617
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,700
They are all in the computer.

618
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,060
Watch some shows.

619
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,770
What are you doing?

620
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,300
You don't work every day.

621
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,060
Just lie here.

622
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,180
Do the laundry.

623
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:27,820
The point is that

624
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,370
I have earned n one million yuan.

625
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,940
Do I need to work?

626
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,100
Just some dirty clothes. You...

627
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,220
You don't need to be mad.

628
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,100
Have a seat.

629
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,090
Tian Bin,

630
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,660
the one million you earned

631
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,020
is enough for your whole life?

632
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,940
Besides,

633
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,380
you said you invested that money,

634
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,820
but I didn't see any returns.

635
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,180
I see.

636
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,660
Take the money back.

637
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,180
and we can be relieved.

638
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,340
This is called long-term investment.

639
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,580
It's a win-win deal.

640
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,140
You need to

641
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,450
change your mind.

642
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,140
Okay?

643
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,500
Besides,

644
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,180
I didn't say I wouldn't look for a job.

645
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,020
Right?

646
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,980
You stayed up late

647
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,780
talking about work with Zhang Yuanqi

648
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,930
the other night.

649
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,980
How is it going on?

650
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,300
No progress?

651
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,780
She's not... I...

652
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,960
I don't have time

653
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,420
to answer her.

654
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:26,780
You...

655
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,600
I'm in a good mood today.

656
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,930
Let's give her a reply.

657
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,500
Yeah, just call her.

658
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,060
This is

659
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,740
Zhang Yuanqi.

660
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,900
Hello,

661
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,180
The subscriber you dialed

662
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,240
is busy now.

663
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,650
Please try again later.

664
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,660
Call again.

665
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,890
Hello.

666
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
The subscriber you dialed

667
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,170
is busy now.

668
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,630
Please try again later.

669
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,060
I think

670
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,980
you always harassed her.

671
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,540
She put you in her blacklist.

672
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,660
No.

673
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,460
Do the laundry.

674
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,570
Maybe they're

675
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,930
writing now.

676
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,700
They're artists, you know?

677
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,060
What's wrong?

678
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,180
I'm sorry.

679
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,740
How is it, Zhang?

680
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,860
What do you think?

681
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,540
Director Yan,

682
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,010
this is today's work report.

683
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,620
You've watched six series?

684
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,180
You're quite efficient.

685
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,380
Did you find anything special?

686
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,660
Nothing special.

687
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,980
They're all very similar.

688
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,660
And they are different

689
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,300
from our culture.

690
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,260
Not many can be used directly.

691
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,380
Look.

692
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,540
Why don't we create

693
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,340
an original show?

694
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,940
You don't know it.

695
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,620
The survival rate of original shows is too low.

696
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,260
It's hard to figure out

697
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,100
the preference of audience.

698
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,580
It's safer to learn from

699
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,740
successful shows abroad.

700
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,300
And the success rate is higher.

701

Director Yan,

702
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,660
I have a plan.

703
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:17,960
I made it by myself.

Hello, Director.

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,990
I'm Zhang Ye from the Planning Department.

We work in the same company.

Here is a event planning that

728
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,580
I wrote by myself.

All right.

738
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,380
Leave it here. I'll read it later.

739

What skill books?

761

Why did he do that?

806
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,510
Even you the original author said yes.

807
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,250
It seems this song is really good.

808
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,170
No.

809
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,270

00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,100
You can't.

No.

813
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,940
His level is not bad.

814
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,790
After all, I trained him.

815
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,180
But it depends on whom he compares with.

I'll be fine if you come.

843
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,340
Actually, I'm happy that you're here.

844
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,180
Why did you buy that?

845
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,660
That is what I should do.

846
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,760
The only thing I fear these days

847
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,340
was that day.

848
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,250
What would I do

849
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:33,780
if I didn't meet you?

850
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,710
Really.

851
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,990
If I hadn't met you that day,

852
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,120
I would have died there.

853
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,840
It's so scary.

854
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,640
Zhang Ye.

855
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,030
From now on,

you and I are no longer subordinate and superior .

857
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,280
We are brothers.

858
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,000
From now on,

859
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,790
tell me

860
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,040
if you have difficulties

861
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,390
no matter in your life or in work.

862
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,000
As long as

863
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,760
I can,

864
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,480
I will help you.

865

Yes.

Yes.

869
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,590
I've made a plan that

870
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,560
I've told Director Yan

871
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,590
many times,

872
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,920
but he refused.

873
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,630
Why?

874
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,240
Because he said a new show

875
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,110
without big data support

876
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,760
is not optimistic.

877
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,990
He knows nothing.

878
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,000
Just tell me.

879
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,670
Well...

880
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
Let me tell you.

881
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,530
Just tell me.

882
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,720
I want to hold

883
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,520
a singing talent show.

884
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,310
During the preliminary selection,

885
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,590
all the mentors

886
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,320
put on masks

887
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,910
and listen blindly.

888
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,150
Listen bindly?

889
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,270
Even if a cat is singing,

890
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,990
as long as the mentor likes its voice,

891
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,630
the mentor can take off his mask

892
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,600
and choose him

893
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,350
in his team.

894
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,630
I have a question.

895
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,110
If all the mentors

896
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,950
take off

897
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,480
their masks.

898
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,880
Which team will this cat belong to?

899
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,190
The person, not the cat.

900
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,840
OK, the person.

901
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,480
It depends on the players.

902
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,520
The contestants will

903
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,600
have the right to choose their mentors.

904
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,480
This kind of competition

905
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,350
is the best.

906
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,310
Because the mentors

907
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,080
will seduce the players

908
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,160
to join their own team.

909
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,990
And, another example,

910
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,030
let contestants wear masks.

911
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,750
The mentors can't see

912
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,520
their faces.

913
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,800
Just focus on music.

914
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,550
What do you think?

915
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
I think

916
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,630
your answer was

917
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,520
a little hesitant.

918
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,680
But I've decided to

919
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,430
give you this chance.

920
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,440
Let's make it clear.

921
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,390
Although your idea is good,

922
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,560
the audience rating

923
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,720
is unknown.

924
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,680
Well,

925
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,640
if this show is well done,

926
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,840
we can continue.

927
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,760
If it's not good,

928
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,920
you must stop.

929
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,320
It's work after all.

930
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,280
No problem. Don't worry.

931
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,350
I will do my best in this show.

932
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,000
You need a name for this show.

933
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,080
What is it called?

934
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,150
It's called...

935
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,530
Super Loud.

936
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,230
Okay.

937
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,520
Loud.

938
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,980
This name is interesting.

939
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,040
How about this?

940
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,320
You write a proposal first.

941
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,670
Take this proposal.

942
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,190
When I get discharged,

943
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,630
I'll show it

944
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,400
on Monday meeting.

945
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,510
It doesn't have to wait until you're discharged.

946
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,080
I know

947
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,440
you'll like it.

948
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,080
I brought you

949
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,880
the proposal.

950
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:28,750
Take a look.

951
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,560
Director Yan.

952
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,730
Tell me, what’s the matter?

953
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,440
I've checked

954
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,590
the budget for this show.

955
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,680
The budget is too small.

956
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,340
It's not even enough to set a scene.

957
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:48,960
Look.

958
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,110
How much do you expect

959
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,680
for B-level project?

960
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,160
Besides, your proposal

961
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,880
has not been investigated

962
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,720
and conducted data analysis,

963
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,630
It's good enough

964
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,950
for you to have budget.

965
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,400
Young man, be satisfied.

966
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,150
But the most important thing

967
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,280
of this show is

968
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,430
the authority of mentors.

969
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,310
We have to hire

970
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,150
a top singer.

971
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,230
So that can be convincing.

972
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,280
A top singer

973
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,990
like Zhang Yuanqi?

974
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:18,000
It's not enough

975
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,240
to give her all the budget.

976
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,800
What do you want me to do?

977
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,160
Perform in the streets?

978
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,140
Are you choosing a singer

979
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,870
or a street performance?

980
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,990
Think about it.

981
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,590
I'm busy.

982
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,400
No, Yan.

983
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,440
You can

984
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,740
record your Super Loud here.

985
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,710
It's so small.

986
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,760
It's good to have one.

987
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,100
This is too small.

988
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,410
How can we record the show?
