4
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,260
What is this?

5
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,340
Hello.

6
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,760
Mr. Zhang.

7
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,180
Did you see the things

8
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,020
in the box?

9
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,130
One million yuan.

10
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,900
It's a small gift from Director Yang.

11
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,060
Please accept it.

12
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,970
What do you mean?

13
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,520
I don't want the money.

14
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,660
Where are you?

15
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,380
Take it back.

16
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,940
We're already

17
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,140
on our way back to the company.

18
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,140
Something urgent came up in the company.

19
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,220
If there's any problem,

20
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,660
you can talk to him tomorrow.

21
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,300
It's one million yuan as you say so?

22
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,980
What if the amount doesn't tally with it

23
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,190
when we return it?

24
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,780
Chenchen.

25
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,610
Chenchen!

26
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,460
Where is Zhang Ye?

27
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,300
He's dead.

28
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,020
He can't come back as he's dead.

29
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,030
What's wrong with you?

30
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,540
Where did he get so much money?

31
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,380
This...

32
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,500
Isn't this Zhang Ye from our company?

33
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,420
When he just came here,

34
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,650
I thought he was not a good person.

35
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,580
Let me count.

36
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,260
That's right.

37
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,570
You think so too, right?

38
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,300
With his honest look, I didn't expect him

39
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,900
to be such a person.

40
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,220
No.

41
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,580
Look.

42
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,980
But do you think

43
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,690
it's possible that he...

44
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,500
See?

45
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,380
So much money.

46
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,410
Right.

47
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,740
Maybe it's him.

48
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,500
Where did he get so much money?

49
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,820
Didn't you say he has connections?

50
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,290
Yes.

51
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,220
Maybe it's

52
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,100
just as you said.

53
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,020
Hello.

54
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,760
Zhang Ye, where are you?

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,720
You've gone too far this time.

56
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,850
Auntie said she was going to kill you.

57
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,090
Why?

58
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,260
I sent you the video.

59
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,310
See what you've done.

60
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,010
Where is this?

61
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,690
Why is there no Return Sugar?

62
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,050
Come out now.

63
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,540
Where is the Return Sugar?

64
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,460
Why is there no Return Sugar?

65
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,450
It's sold out.

66
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,380
You can try the lucky draw.

67
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,740
The chance of winning is very high.

68
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,850
At this critical moment,

69
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,740
why are you still promoting it to me?

70
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,100
Help me come up with a solution.

71
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,210
I have no solutions.

72
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,300
This game

73
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,500
can only provide props.

74
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,050
As for how to solve the problem,

75
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,430
it's your own business.

76
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,460
Go ahead.

77
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,020
Return Sugar, Return Sugar, Return Sugar.

78
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,380
Return Sugar, Return Sugar, Return Sugar.

79
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,790
What is this?

80
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,860
Congratulations! You've got the Fruit of Charm.

81
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,390
Why am I so unlucky?

82
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,600
Again.

83
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,010
Sorry.

84
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,650
You can have the lucky draw once only today.

85
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,150
Why?

86
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,070
There's a small bug in the system.

87
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,620
Make do with it for one day.

88
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,190
Bye.

89
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,390
Why does the system have to

90
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,409
have a bug today?

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,930
I...

92
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,010
Don't go.

93
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,680
Zhang Ye is such a loser.

94
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,550
He's just been popular for a few days,

95
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,150
and he dared to take bribes and make a backstage deal.

96
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,370
He claimed to

97
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,670
give these young people

98
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,140
who have dreams and no chance

99
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,860
a stage.

100
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,930
Bah!

101
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,730
In the end,

102
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,910
money made him give up his principles.

103
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,720
Fine.

104
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,020
Zhang Ye, fine. You've learned bad things.

105
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,990
Today, I must

106
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,340
beat him and teach him

107
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,460
to be a righteous man.

108
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,460
Where are you going?

109
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,340
Do you want to inform Zhang Ye?

110
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,550
No, I want to...

111
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,010
go to the toilet.

112
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,800
Hold it.

113
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,540
Just sit here.

114
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,140
Don't go anywhere.

115
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,190
Watch this carefully.

116
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,900
Today, I'll teach him how to behave himself,

117
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,070
and set a rule for you.

118
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,070
Aimin, I'm wrong.

119
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,670
Please forgive me.

120
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,610
Zhang Ye, what took you so long?

121
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,150
I've been waiting for you all night.

122
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,310
Just come in.

123
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,220
I've been waiting for you all night.

124
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,000
I was so worried.

125
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,260
Come on.

126
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,310
Have a seat.

127
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,040
Are you okay?

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,410
Aimin.

129
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,190
I was framed.

130
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,150
Others can distrust me,

131
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,230
but you can't.

132
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,760
Calm down. Take your time.

133
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,260
What happened?

134
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,710
Director Yang got me drunk.

135
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,900
The female secretary sent me back to the hotel.

136
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,690
I don't remember

137
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,740
what happened later.

138
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,470
When I woke up,

139
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,770
the money was here.

140
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,350
I wanted to return it.

141
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,460
But I thought

142
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,700
the amount must be counted correctly.

143
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,430
I started counting the money.

144
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,820
I know this is ridiculous.

145
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,870
It's hard to believe.

146
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:13,630
But...

147
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,480
I believe you.

148
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,450
Zhang Ye,

149
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,440
I know your character.

150
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,800
You must have been framed.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,610
Don't worry. I'll handle everything.

152
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,510
You've suffered, poor boy.

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,230
You must be hungry.

154
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,030
I'll cook you some noodles.

155
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,450
Wait for me.

156
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,130
Wait for me.

157
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,830
How can she believe that?

158
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,080
She has just said

159
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,360
she's going to break your legs.

160
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,250
It seems

161
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,150
the Fruit of Charm is really useful.

162
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,560
Even Rao Aimin believes me.

163
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,790
If I apologize in public now...

164
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,270
Chenchen, give me your mobile phone.

165
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,400
I want a live stream.

166
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,280
Here.

167
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,470
I sincerely apologize.

168
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,200
In the video,

169
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,940
it was actually my real reaction.

170
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,220
First, let me explain what happened

171
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,300
in the video.

172
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,360
When I saw

173
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,680
there was so much money,

174
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,830
I was so shocked.

175
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,620
I apologize to you today,

176
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,040
through the live stream.

177
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,350
I struggled for a long time actually.

178
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,140
Come and watch.

179
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,190
Zhang Ye is making an apology through live stream.

180
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,590
I don't think

181
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,500
I should

182
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
take up public resources

183
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,590
over and over again,

184
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,210
as well as everyone's energy

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,040
to pay attention to

186
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,340
such a disgraceful matter.

187
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,870
But I'm wrong anyway.

188
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,770
I don't want to escape.

189
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,710
I don't want to be a coward who has

190
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
made a mistake and is afraid of punishment.

191
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:57,940
First of all...

192
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,990
I knew it.

193
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,060
it's not that simple.

194
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,540
He must be hiding something.

195
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,370
I think so, too.

196
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,830
When I watched the video,

197
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,690
I thought there must be something wrong.

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,650
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,310
I made you worry.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,150
Come to think of it,

201
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,990
Zhang Ye is quite handsome.

202
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,260
You're really good at finding time to get fascinated.

203
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,690
Right.

204
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,740
Don't you think so?

205
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,590
He's such a graceful gentleman.

206
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,060
He doesn't look like

207
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,230
a bad person.

208
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,990
He must have been framed.

209
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,350
I think so, too.

210
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,000
There must be

211
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,860
a twist to the story.

212
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,540
I don't expect you

213
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,500
to continue to support me and like me.

214
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,990
But I will learn from it.

215
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,070
I will still focus on creating good works

216
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,790
with life being the source

217
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,190
and art being the basis

218
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,190
to serve the public.

219
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,270
Secondly,

220
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm willing to

221
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
bear all the consequences

222
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,020
for my own mistake.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,050
I hereby announce

224
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,450
I'll officially withdraw from

225
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,580
the Sing for a Good Future today.

226
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,150
Actually,

227
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:58,820
I have something else

228
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,870
to tell you.

229
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,110
This show is now

230
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,230
against the intention

231
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,440
for which I wanted to make the show.

232
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,090
The reason why I wanted to make this show

233
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,140
was to give a chance to those who were

234
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,500
born among grassroots

235
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,190
but have a gift for music,

236
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,470
and make the judges think not about

237
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,300
such external factors as their looks,

238
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,530
appearance and figures,

239
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,740
and only focus on music itself.

240
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,940
But as you can see,

241
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,680
this show

242
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,620
is not

243
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,670
that pure anymore.

244
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,390
It also involves what happened

245
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,470
to me in the video.

246
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,940
So I announce

247
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,940
I'll officially withdraw from

248
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,960
Sing for a Good Future today,

249
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,430
and will disband the crew of the show.

250
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,060
Let this show stay as it is

251
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,770
at its most memorable moment.

252
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,040
I'm incompetent.

253
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,880
I failed to protect justice.

254
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,020
I apologize again.

255
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,890
What?

256
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,420
What is he doing?

257
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,270
No.

258
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:08,650
Right.

259
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,840
Do you believe

260
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,480
what Zhang Ye said?

261
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,150
It's hard to say.

262
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,800
It's hard to say.

263
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,870
The crew will be disbanded as he said so?

264
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,940
What should we do?

265
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,710
There must be something behind this show.

266
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,530
Yes.

267
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,670
Dismiss.

268
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,010
What are you watching?

269
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,080
Go back.

270
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,210
Turn it off.

271
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,580
Well,

272
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,350
it's working time.

273
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,870
You should work hard.

274
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,560
Right?

275
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,560
Time's up.

276
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,310
I'm sorry. I'm wrong.

277
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,680
Look over there.

278
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,550
I'm wrong. I surrender.

279
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,240
Mr. Yao.

280
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,700
I've heard about it.

281
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,640
Don't worry.

282
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,150
I hired you.

283
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,660
I trust your character.

284
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,490
Zhang Yuanqi has

285
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,540
called me.

286
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,490
I'll find out the truth

287
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,390
and give you an explanation.

288
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,460
Thank you, Mr. Yao.

289
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,330
Angela, right?

290
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,450
We're from the legal department.

291
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,380
Someone reported that

292
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,700
you had taken bribes from an advertiser

293
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,810
and framed a colleague.

294
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,840
I don't know.

295
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,160
You must be mistaken.

296
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,320
You should know this box.

297
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,390
The company has called the police.

298
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,730
Please cooperate with the investigation.

299
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,360
Well...

300
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,510
Director Yang

301
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,590
asked me to do this.

302
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,660
Can I report him?

303
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,110
Please come with us.

304
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,210
Ms. Zhang.

305
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,480
Why do you

306
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,990
call me when you're free?

307
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,260
Director Yang.

308
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,410
Stop pretending.

309
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,410
We have the evidence.

310
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,599
Since we're both senior staff,

311
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,680
I'll let you keep the dignity and quit by yourself.

312
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,619
Otherwise, if we take the actions,

313
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,150
it'll be so embarrassing for you.

314
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,530
Excuse me.

315
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,000
We're from the legal department of the Big Durain Company.

316
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,530
We have something to ask you.

317
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,010
I think

318
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,190
you know this box.

319
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,410
♫Love is just♫

320
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,250
♫An ordinary thing♫

321
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,510
♫It's not special at all♫

322
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,650
♫Men are just♫

323
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,460
♫Things for fun♫

324
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,970
♫What's so great about them?♫

325
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,800
Perfect.

326
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,900
What do you think?

327
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,560
With your singing like that,

328
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,790
this song is uniquely charming.

329
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,740
What pen name are you going to use this time?

330
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,530
Those aren't my pen names.

331
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,410
It's the name of the composer of the song.

332
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,010
For these works that can last forever,

333
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,260
the name of their composer should be revealed

334
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,200
to the public.

335
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,550
These are all old songs.

336
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,530
I merely

337
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,580
collected and organized them.

338
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,260
Unfortunately, they remained unknown

339
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,550
in this world.

340
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,710
I always believe

341
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,060
gold always shines.

342
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,900
They can compose

343
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,950
such excellent works,

344
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,340
and their talent shouldn't be wasted.

345
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,520
Not wasted.

346
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,040
I discovered them.

347
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,800
By the way,

348
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,060
tonight, we're going to record

349
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,740
the chorus version of My Future Is Not a Dream.

350
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,960
There will be many artists.

351
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,040
Are you interested?

352
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,670
I might not be able to join it.

353
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,580
See? Something happened at home.

354
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,150
[Rao Aimin, Missed Call]

355
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,490
Are you two

356
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,540
really together?

357
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,230
Well...

358
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,020
Will you consider a long-term cooperation with me?

359
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,770
Discuss it with her after you go back.

360
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,580
I have to go.

361
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,030
You're back.

362
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,020
Today,

363
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,960
my phone was put in the studio.

364
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,030
It was muted.

365
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,370
I really didn't hear your call.

366
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,940
If I had seen it,

367
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,990
I would have answered it.

368
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,650
You were so busy.

369
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,040
I was working.

370
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,030
Why did you come back?

371
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,790
It's great to be with that super star.

372
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,870
She offers you food and drinks.

373
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,160
What are you talking about?

374
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,950
Now matter how extravagant a place is,

375
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,130
it's not as good as my own kennel.

376
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,100
This place is more comfortable.

377
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,760
Right?

378
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,860
What do you mean?

379
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Where is the extravagant place?

380
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,610
Where is the kennel?

381
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,790
Don't come back.

382
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,780
No, that's not what I meant.

383
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,100
It's just a metaphor.

384
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,300
It's merely a meta-...

385
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,860
Auntie called you as she wanted to

386
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,190
treat you to roast duck.

387
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,580
She even packed it for you.

388
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,250
Zhang Ye,

389
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,270
you've been acting weird lately.

390
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,350
I don't understand.

391
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,710
It's just a recording.

392
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,000
Do you have to get up so early and come back late?

393
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,240
Others don't understand,

394
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,540
but don't you know

395
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,120
who I did it for?

396
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,760
I did it for us,

397
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,510
so that we can go back sooner.

398
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,270
I've asked Sanzhi.

399
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,100
The ultimate goal of this game

400
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,310
is to make over half of the people

401
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,330
in this game like me.

402
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,320
With my current development speed,

403
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,550
we can't go back

404
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,630
even till we get old.

405
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,870
Zhang Yuanqi is an international superstar.

406
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,140
I just want to

407
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,540
to earn more Fame Value.

408
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,320
The alien

409
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,670
didn't give me any task.

410
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,200
He only told me

411
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,060
I would live if you live.

412
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,470
If you die, I die, too.

413
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,800
So,

414
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,660
you should wish that

415
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,780
I could earn more Fame Value

416
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,710
to bring you

417
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,900
back to your parents sooner.

418
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,470
Don't use me as an excuse.

419
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,250
I can go back or not.

420
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,070
I'll be wherever you are.

421
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,670
You owe me a life wherever we go.

422
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,950
What are you talking about?

423
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,860
You can go back or not.

424
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,210
How could you say that?

425
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,890
Were you my debtor in the previous life?

426
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,500
Let's drop the subject.

427
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,330
Eat the roast duck while it's hot.

428
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,030
Did your auntie really bring it for me?

429
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,330
Why would I lie to you?

430
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,790
I'll kill you, Zhang Ye!

431
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,230
Auntie, are you jealous?

432
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,870
Of course not. I'm not jealous.

433
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,950
Will I be jealous because of him?

434
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,740
In terms of cars, houses, money, and good look,

435
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,310
he has none of them.

436
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,540
He looks like

437
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,480
a chicken fillet.

438
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
Is it possible I'm jealous because of him?

439
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,430
Is it possible that I like him?

440
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,550
Auntie, you're right.

441
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,340
He's just a loser

442
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,430
who has nothing.

443
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,920
Auntie,

444
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,840
how about I

445
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,770
tell him to leave

446
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,640
our home later?

447
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,720
We won't let him stay anymore.

448
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,030
I'll talk to him.

449
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,100
Come back.

450
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,830
I'm angry with Zhang Yuanqi.

451
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,380
What's so great about Zhang Yuan?

452
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,950
Why did Zhang Ye

453
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,180
rush to her

454
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,020
once he

455
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,070
got

456
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,140
her call?

457
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,470
But he didn't answer my call.

458
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,050
What's so great about her?

459
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,070
Did he

460
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,900
peep at her while she was taking a bath

461
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,970
so he was blackmailed

462
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,580
and threatened? Is it possible?

463
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,540
Auntie, I'm not blaming you.

464
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,150
But there's just a piece of

465
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,500
window paper between you two.

466
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,460
Do you have to probe like this every day?

467
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Window paper? What window paper?

468
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,370
Stop talking nonsense.

469
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,590
It's impossible I would like him.

470
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,660
Am I crazy?

471
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,550
Auntie.

472
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,750
The three of us can go on a trip.

473
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,000
No.

474
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,780
Just go. You're the best. Just go.

475
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,850
No.

476
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,090
If you want to go, we two go. I won't take him.

477
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,530
Don't regret

478
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,610
for not bringing a coolie.

479
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,150
Go to bed now.

480
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:00,840
Zhang Ye.

481
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,460
Why do you look so excited?

482
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,700
Are you free tomorrow?

483
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,550
I want to go to Mount Cuiyun.

484
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,820
Go with me.

485
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,670
I don't have time.

486
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,390
I have to write a song.

487
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,680
Don't be so ungrateful.

488
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm trying to

489
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,890
create an opportunity for you.

490
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,170
Your auntie is going, too?

491
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,590
Of course.

492
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,710
Do you think I really like you that much?

493
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,100
I'll go, too.

494
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,120
Whatever the cost is,

495
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,200
I'll go.

496
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,320
It's a deal.

497
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,120
Hello, Nan.

498
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,330
I'm sorry

499
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,240
for disturbing you so late.

500
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,630
Something urgent came up. Can you do me a favor?

501
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:47,960
What is it?

502
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,470
It's about the theme song of the benefit show

503
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,550
for the disaster area last time,

504
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,620
sung by various singers.

505
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,820
Kevin had a car accident,

506
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,890
and couldn't come.

507
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,900
I can't think of anyone who can do it.

508
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,230
Qi is being worried about it now.

509
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,840
Can you and Zhang Hua

510
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,910
come over to sing it?

511
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,310
Please help us and help Qi.

512
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,020
Can we do it?

513
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,120
No problem.

514
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,180
Kevin's speaking style

515
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,310
is very similar

516
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,700
to your rap style. It's okay.

517
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,800
When should we go?

518
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,270
It'd be best if you could come right away.

519
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,260
The press conference

520
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,310
of the new album will be held the day after tomorrow.

521
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,900
The last song is the chorus,

522
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,930
and it wasn't easy to make

523
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,980
everyone's schedule available finally.

524
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,220
But Kevin had an accident.

525
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,500
I'm really sorry

526
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,570
for troubling you.

527
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,750
Okay, no problem.

528
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,920
Wait for me.

529
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,990
I'll be there soon.

530
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,470
Zhang Ye.

531
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,830
Think carefully.

532
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,470
You know

533
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,550
what kind of person my auntie is.

534
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,720
If you miss it,

535
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,790
you won't have a second chance.

536
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,760
Don't worry.

537
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,500
I'll be back

538
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,850
before 8 a.m. tomorrow.

539
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,210
The next line.

540
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,300
We need to look forward to it.

541
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,890
Why are you here?

542
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,420
You're recording a song.

543
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,580
Of course I have to come and see it.

544
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,300
What if

545
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
my song is altered?

546
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,350
You know what?

547
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,590
We invited Kevin here today,

548
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,930
but he had an accident.

549
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,470
Look. They are all big shots in the circle.

550
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,900
It's not easy

551
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,950
to gather them together.

552
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,640
With one man less,

553
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,990
we can't record it.

554
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,660
Can you do me a favor?

555
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,790
Auntie, why are you still up?

556
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,090
Waiting for Zhang Ye?

557
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,180
Who said I am waiting for him?

558
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,040
I can't sleep.

559
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,740
I'm meditating.

560
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,340
I have to think about

561
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,780
what I need to take tomorrow.

562
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,610
Go to sleep.

563
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,610
What time is it?

564
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,690
I wonder if you can get up tomorrow.

565
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,230
Okay, I'm really sleepy.

566
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,020
You should also go to bed early.

567
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,990
♫Are you the same as me, lowering your head under the sun♫

568
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:42,170
♫Sweating and working hard silently♫

569

♫Are you the same as me, being ignored♫

570
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,090
This line.

571
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,060
♫But still not giving up the life you want♫

572
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,460
For this line,

573
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,860
the singer has a heavy nasal voice.

574
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,030
Can you help him

575
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,110
adjust it a little?

576
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,430
Okay, no problem.

577
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,810
♫Are you the same as me, being busy pursuing♫

As for the other materials,

591
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,270
save them for several times.

592
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,900

Great!

636
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,180
Zhang Ye, I didn't expect you

637
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,950
to have such attainments for music

638
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,620
at such a

639
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,750
young age.

640
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,260
I admire you.

641
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,660
When you have time,

642
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,750
compose a song for me.

643
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,410
Can you?

644
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,500
I'm flattered.

645
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,460
By the way,

646
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,030
let me clarify again.

647
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,220
For this song,

648
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,220
the original singer

649
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,270
is Zhang Yusheng.

650
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,320
Unfortunately, he has passed away.

651
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,300
I can't even express one tenth of the feelings

652
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,970
he expressed

653
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,020
in this song.

654
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,790
Amazing. I didn't expect that.

655
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,890
You're a promising young man,

656
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,240
but you're so indifferent to fame and fortune.

657
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,930
I admire you.

658
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,970
It's already late.

659
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,090
We've been recording all night.

660
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,450
It's dawn.

661
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,310
Thank you all.

662
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,560
Let's go for

663
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,520
breakfast later.

664
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,270
I'll pay.

665
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,840
Great!

666
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,070
Zhang Ye, join us.

667
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,740
Oh no.

668
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,180
I have something to do. I have to go.

669
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:39,980
See you next time.

670
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,800
Bye. Bye.

671
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,910
Let's go. Why is he leaving?

672
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,100
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

673
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,730
Rao Aimin, I'm back.

674
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,540
Rao Aimin!

675
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,170
Rao Aimin, I'm back.

676
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,000
[The key is in your room. Remember to feed the dog]

677
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,520
[Auntie and I didn't see you come back, so we went on a trip ourselves]

678
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,630
Aunt and I didn't see you back,

679
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,840
so we went on a trip ourselves.

680
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,360
The key is in your room.

681
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,550
Remember to feed the dog.

682
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,930
It's getting dark outside.

683
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,300
Will we be trapped inside?

684
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,650
The weather of Cuiyun Mountain

685
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,520
is like this.

686
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,630
It's sunny or rainy from time to time.

687
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,100
It's said that

688
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,630
the weather of Mount Cuiyun

689
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,800
is like a three-year-old child,

690
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,970
which is so fickle.

691
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,770
We'll reach

692
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,680
the hiking route soon.

693
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,990
Pack your luggage

694
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,190
and get ready to walk into the mountain with me.

695
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,350
Be careful.

696
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,420
Okay.

697
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,420
Be careful.

698
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,699
So steep.

699
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,790
Tour guide.

700
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,949
According to the weather forecast,

701
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,020
it'll rain today.

702
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,460
The weather forecast is not accurate.

703
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,770
Look at the sun.

704
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,989
There's a small dark cloud over there.

705
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,080
When the wind comes later,

706
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,210
it'll be blown away.

707
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,900
Let's make a bet if you don't believe me.

708
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,130
If it rains later,

709
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,120
I'll eat that rock

710
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,199
in front of us.

711
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,730
Don't worry.

712
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,239
It's windy, tour guide.

713
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,969
It's all right.

714
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,050
It's fine even if it rains.

715
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,030
There's a cave ahead.

716
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,250
I'll take you there to take shelter.

717
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:42,770
Come on.

718
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,560
Keep up.

719
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,530
It doesn't matter.

720
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,739
Are your words trustworthy?

721
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,060
We've got here anyway.

722
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,139
I often walk this path.

723
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,449
There won't be any problem.

724
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,590
Come on. Follow me.

725
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,540
Come on. Hurry up!

726
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,520
Be careful.

727
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,480
All here.

728
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,460
Dear tourists,

729
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,550
you should think you're lucky.

730
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,430
You signed up for my group.

731
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,290
Only I

732
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,540
know this cave.

733
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,270
If you had signed up for someone else's group,

734
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,480
you would have got wet outside.

735
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,140
Right?

736
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,220
Let's leave if it's not okay.

737
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,890
It seems the rain won't stop in a short time.

738
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,810
I'm worried

739
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,030
we can't get out later.

740
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,220
Impossible. It's just a rain shower.

741
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,370
It will stop soon.

742
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,440
Let's make a bet if you don't believe me.

743
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,930
How can you still make a bet

744
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,060
at a time like this?

745
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,600
Do something serious, okay?

746
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,860
If anything wrong happens,

747
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,810
can you bear the consequence?

748
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,860
There are kids here.

749
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,850
Yes, look.

750
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,460
There is no signal in this cave.

751
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,820
There's no signal here, too.

752
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,680
Well... Alright.

753
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,190
I'm going out now

754
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,580
to call the company, okay?

755
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:53,820
Ask them to pick us up.

756
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,590
Hurry up.

757
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,720
You guys

758
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,180
are used to living in a big city.

759
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,730
There's no need to be so surprised.

760
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,860
Let me tell you. I walk

761
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,560
this path every day.

762
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,650
Nothing wrong will happen.

763
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,040
You don't believe me? Let's make another bet.

764
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,560
The continuous rain

765
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,950
lasting for several days has caused

766
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,330
a large-scale landslide on the Mount Cuiyun.

767
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,040
Oh no.

768
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,040
Make a bet?

769
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,570
How ridiculous it is!

770
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,830
It's all blocked.

771
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,680
The continuous rain

772
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,080
lasting for several days has caused

773
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,560
a large-scale landslide on the Mount Cuiyun.

774
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,680
Our reporter

775
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,150
is currently at the rescue scene.

776
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,260
It is said that more than ten tourists

777
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,920
were in the mountain when the accident happened.

778
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,900
The situation is unknown.

779
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,510
This is the list of the missing people.

780
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,810
Up to now,

781
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,490
the rescue team hasn't got in touch

782
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,570
with the tour group.

783
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,380
[List of Missing People of the Large-scale Mudslide of the Mount Cuiyun in Shengyi Province]

784
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,510
Don't worry.

785
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,530
Before we went into the mountain,

786
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,750
it had been reported to our company.

787
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,820
They'll come to pick us up soon.

788
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,320
Just hang in there.

789
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,240
Hang in there.

790
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,070
I beg you.

791
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,310
Shut up.

792
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,020
OK?

793
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,470
You've spoken too much.

794
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,280
You're full of nonsense.

795
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,340
Auntie, don't be angry with him.

796
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,850
Have some chips to calm down.

797
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,930
It's delicious.

798
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,930
Why can you be so calm?

799
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,660
Don't you see the entrance is blocked?

800
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,920
It's okay if it's just for a short time.

801
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,990
What if it lasts for a long time?

802
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,430
Auntie, don't worry.

803
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,630
Zhang Ye hasn't completed his task yet.

804
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,900
He will definitely come to pick us up.

805
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,850
What Zhang Ye's task?

806
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,380
Are you crazy out of fear?

807
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,220
Don't worry.

808
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,990
Zhang Ye will definitely come to pick us up.

809
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:16,920
I wonder

810
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,270
if Zhang Ye had fed you some magic potion.

811
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,750
Even when I burp at home,

812
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,030
it would scare you.

813
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,160
Look at you now.

814
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,710
You still have the mood to eat chips.

815
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,670
Aren't you scared at all?

816
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,190
Auntie, I'm so scared.

817
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,510
Hug me. I'm so scared.

818
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,580
So scared.

819
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,870
-Don't be scared. -Hug me.

820
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,800
Okay.

821
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,870
Don't be scared.

822
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,860
Well...

823
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,240
Listen to me.

824
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,360
Since

825
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,660
we are all trapped here,

826
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,220
we have to unite together,

827
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:44,980
right?

828
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,240
I suggest

829
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,150
you should give all the food and drinks

830
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,340
to me.

831
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,750
I'll allocate them to you intensively.

832
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,320
OK?

833
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,400
Allocate them intensively.

834
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,630
Yes. Come on.

835
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,710
Give them all to me.

836
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,180
I have four eggs left.

837
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:04,910
Okay.

838
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,810
Anything else?

839
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,160
Sir, Ma'am.

840
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,260
I have a lot of water here.

841
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,170
I'll give you one bottle.

842
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,750
Okay.

843
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,610
-Thank you. -Thank you.

844
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,660
You're welcome.

845
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,150
Girl,

846
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,030
they're allocated intensively.

847
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,790
Give them to me.

848
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,860
Take a sip if you're thirsty.

849
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,380
According to our report,

850
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,770
the rescue team has arrived at the section

851
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,210
of the Mount Cuiyun where the landslide happened.

852
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,540
Okay, I got it.

853
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,580
They haven't rescued the trapped people out yet.

854
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,820
Qi, due to the weather,

855
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,420
all flights and trains

856
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,230
have been suspended.

857
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,310
We can't pass through.

858
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,490
What should we do?

859
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,580
I once performed there.

860
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,550
I'll contact

861
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,590
my friends over there.

862
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,270
If I manage to contact them,

863
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,390
I'll ask Nan to send you there.

864
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,820
It'll be too late.

865
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,470
Don't we have a off-roader?

866
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,930
I'll drive him there.

867
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,740
Nan.

868
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,600
Trust me.

869
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,670
Let me drive there myself.

870
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,500
It's such a long way.

871
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,550
I'll be worried if you go alone.

872
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,650
It's okay.

873
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,440
If you have any news,

874
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,520
you can tell me anytime.

875
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,040
The key.

876
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,330
Be careful.

877
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,070
Keep in touch.

878
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,790
I have to do our best.

879
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,270
Mr. Zhang, what happened?

880
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,060
Do you want a lucky draw?

881
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,110
What else can I do?

882
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,290
How much do you want?

883
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,530
Give me one day left.

884
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,700
Put the rest on the bet.

885
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,020
Got it.

886
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,580
Lucky Sticker! Lucky Sticker! Lucky Sticker!

887
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,580
Lucky Sticker! Lucky Sticker! Lucky Sticker!

888
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:02,750
No.

889
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,860
What are the prizes?

890
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,350
I want to do it again.

891
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,460
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

892
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,300
We can't satisfy

893
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,350
your unreasonable request like this.

894
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,100
Goodbye.

895
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,030
Captain Wang,

896
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:27,850
how much is the chance

897
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,020
for the people inside to survive?

898
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,530
We hold a cautious and optimistic attitude.

899
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,380
Go, go, go! Keep up!

900
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,970
Hello.

901
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,050
Can I join the rescue team?

902
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,120
Irrelevant personnel should leave here.

903
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,960
Hurry!

904
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,030
You can't go in.

905
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,100
Please say something.

906
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,260
The light is on, and it'll run out of battery soon.

907
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,710
Why don't we keep it off for a while?

908
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,710
To save electricity.

909
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,990
Do you agree?

910
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,170
Wait.

911
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,330
I have a power bank.

912
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,720
Rao Aimin!

913
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,410
Chenchen!

914
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,460
Rao Aimin! Rao Aimin!

915
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,910
Chenchen!

916
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,620
Rao Aimin!

917
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,980
Chenchen!

918
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,580
Rao Aimin!

919
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,940
Auntie, I don't want to die.

920
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,010
What are you talking about?

921
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,840
I don't want to die.

922
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,930
I don't want to die.

923
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,160
I don't want to die.

924
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,800
I don't want to die.

925
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:19,190
Rao Aimin! Chenchen!

926
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,240
Rao Aimin! Chenchen!

927
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,870
[Beast Language Card]

928
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,490
Can anyone hear me?

929
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,730
No.

930
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,030
Is there anything

931
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,110
that can hear me?

932
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,370
Tigers, monkeys, and wild beasts.

933
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,050
Anything.

934
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,490
Did you see

935
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,600
a tour group pass by here?

936
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,520
Did you see

937
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,510
anyone pass by here?
