00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,820
Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 33

4
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,810
His hand was hurt

5
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,350
because of making Osmanthus sugar for me.

6
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,510
He said he likes me.

7
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,350
At least I have to see his hand.

8
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,510
Oh dear. I’m lost again.

9
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,990
A bird.

10
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,630
Maybe I can find someone

11
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,470
to ask the way.

12
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,430
Su Tang.

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,550
Su Tang.

14
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,550
Younger master.

15
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,970
Did you find her?

16
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,970
Younger master.

17
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,560
Someone found that Miss Su seemed to have gone

18
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,630
towards the Forbidden House.

19
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,750
Darn it.

20
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,320
Isn’t that the old man’s place to practice austerities?

21
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,960
Master hates strangers in valley.

22
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,020
If he finds Miss Su,

23
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,750
she would be in danger.

24
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,210
Younger master.

25
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,230
What’s that?

26
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,500
The hottest chili.

27
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
I’ve always brought it for barbecue along the way.

28
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,280
It is mixed with saltpeter powder.

29
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,440
Master uses the Force of Temperature

30
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,750
in alchemy.

31
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,680
If he is disturbed in the process of cultivation,

32
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,880
something will happen to him.

33
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,800
How can I save my wife without disturbing him?

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,060
Who is more important?

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,380
My wife, or the old man?

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,930
Let’s go.

37
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,600
Someone is coming. Someone is coming.

38
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,190
Who is it?

39
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,330
Elder. Sorry to bother you.

40
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,270
I am lost.

41
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,600
Could you tell me Mo Lin’s residence?

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,590
Mo Lin?

43
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,630
That brat.

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,110
He comes back by himself.

45
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,909
Then there will be no return.

46
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,550
He won’t go out again.

47
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,230
Elder. You are one of Mo’s.

48
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,280
He is the younger master.

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,430
Don’t you afraid of him?

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,510
You are brought in

51
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,420
by Mo Lin from the outside, right?

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,910
You outsiders talking nonsense all day

53
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,670
lets that brat make up his mind

54
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,670
to be an assassin.

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,070
He is idle.

56
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
He wants to be the best assassin in the world.

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,400
You can look down on him.

58
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
But you can’t look down on his dream.

59
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,590
No outsiders in Wuyou Valley.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,430
Now that you’re in here.

61
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,690
You can come in alive

62
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,790
and go out dead.

63
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,310
Elder.

64
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,750
Elder.

65
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,390
Are you okay?

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,470
Get up.

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,000
Be careful.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,760
I don’t need your help.

69
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,840
I don’t want to help.

70
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,159
It’s my disciple’s home.

71
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,210
I don’t want anyone to die here.

72
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,040
It is going to be haunted.

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,710
Let’s go.

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,130
Younger master.

75
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,760
Once the Force of Temperature is disturbed,

76
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,720
the master will be severely hurt

77
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,640
and unable to move.

78
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,800
Why don’t you say it earlier?

79
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
You didn’t let me finish.

80
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,350
Miss Su?

81
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
How is our master?

82
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,910
This elder

83
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,230
is the master?

84
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,470
Old man.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
Old man, wake up! Old man.

86
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,430
You brat.

87
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,960
Didn’t you make such a fuss in the valley that

88
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,600
you wouldn’t come back without being an assassin?

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,750
Why did you return?

90
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,200
If I hadn’t return in time,

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,330
you would die there.

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
I would be all right if you didn’t come back.

93
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,870
Me…

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,510
Me…

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,190
Me…

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,310
He is our master, Mo Buliu.

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
He thinks that

98
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
Mo Family should learn medicine for generations.

99
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,159
Younger master asked me

100
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,620
to sneak out of the valley.

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,550
Elder.

102
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,159
Please forgive me for being impolite.

103
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,490
I am the master of Mo Lin.

104
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
My name is Su Tang.

105
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,350
Old man.

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,640
Have you seen my master’s Force of Heft?

107
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,790
I also have a boss and a senior.

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,610
One could use six forces

109
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,200
but he has the Force of Spirit Lock.

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
The other is the younger master of Wuji Manor.

111
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,930
I’ve been an assassin for long.

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,590
I am much better than you.

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,470
You’ve said you have a friend

114
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,440
who had Force of Spirit Lock.

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,910
Is he called

116
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,510
Ping’er?

117
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,990
Father.

118
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
How could you know my boss?

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,080
You didn’t stay in the valley.

120
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,280
Why should I tell you?

121
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,230
I won’t tell you. I won’t.

122
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,200
Isn’t this the old man’s favorite parrot?

123
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,790
Master.

124
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,270
Why did you

125
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,310
save it?

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,110
It’s a life.

127
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,670
I hadn’t thought much.

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:52,950
Fine.

129
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,310
I’ll tell you for the sake of

130
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,840
you saving Little Mo.

131
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,990
I once saved a child.

132
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,270
I gave him the Force of Spirit Lock.

133
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,670
It’s the reason why I know it.

134
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,990
Father.

135
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,600
Why did you say it earlier?

136
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
Did you come back home?

137
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,590
Have you written one letter home?

138
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Could you unlock the Force of Spirit Lock

139
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,830
if I bring my brother here?

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,770
I don’t think so.

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,590
But I can have a try.

142
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,910
Great.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,400
It’s worth coming to Wuyou Valley

144
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,460
with you this time.

145
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,360
Let’s go and find my brother.

146
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,670
Master. It’s time to go.

147
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,150
Disciple, let’s go.

148
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,070
I am still your disciple.

149
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,090
Why are you standing still?

150
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,030
Younger master is allergic

151
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,240
to Osmanthus pollen.

152
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,570
He picked many blossoms

153
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,790
yesterday.

154
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,670
No one knows what he is doing.

155
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,030
Master.

156
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,470
Do you promise me?

157
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,630
I promise you,

158
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,830
from now on,

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,510
I will never give sugar to anyone except you.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,860
About the rest,

161
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,340
just wait for my brother to come back.

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,870
Master.

163
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,950
Don’t worry.

164
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,350
I have patience.

165
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,710
But,

166
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,300
could you give me a hug?

167
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,550
One hug.

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,310
Let’s go.

169
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,910
I might hit you if you delay my trip.

170
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,990
Master.

171
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,150
Wait for me.

172
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,430
Hya.

173
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,940
[Wuji Manor]

174
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,680
Whoa.

175
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,910
Whoa.

176
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
-Younger master.
-Younger master.

177
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,100
You’re not as good as me on horseback.

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
As for the courtesy and prudence,

179
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,500
I’m afraid the whole Big Dipper can’t match you.

180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,340
My father has told me that,

181
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,440
self-discipline is based on behavior.

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,040
There must be no disrespect in one’s behavior.

183
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,550
I indulged myself

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,910
after I entered Zhaifeng.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,620
Do you mean Zhaifeng is poor and untamed?

186
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,210
You are from a noble family.

187
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,170
You should show your hospitality.

188
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,040
Younger master.

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,560
Master has got your letter.

190
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,760
He is waiting for you.

191
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,690
Let’s go.

192
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,480
After you.

193
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,870
It’s Wuji Manor.

194
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,570
It is more magnificent than I thought.

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,310
Mr. Xifan.

196
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,670
Xifan.

197
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,560
Younger Master.

198
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,670
You are back.

199
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,230
Lu Ping?

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,990
You came.

201
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,410
Nice to meet you. Uncle Yan.

202
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,040
I came without your invitation.

203
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,970
Sorry to bother.

204
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,230
Father.

205
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Lu Ping knows Shanhai Gang well.

206
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,280
I asked him to come with me

207
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
and to assist you.

208
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,510
Since you come,

209
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,450
You can stay in Manor for a few days.

210
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,840
We can discuss how to fight against Shanhai Gang later.

211
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,300
I’ve got the dinner ready.

212
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,950
Have a good drink with me tonight.

213
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,500
[Wuji Manor]

214
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,910
Come in.

215
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,690
Ping’er.

216
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,360
Aren’t you tired

217
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,820
after a day’s journey?

218
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,860
I come here to thank

219
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,750
your hospitality today.

220
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,070
You’re welcome.

221
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,160
I have a question to ask you

222
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,950
this time.

223
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,450
Event of Seven Star is settled.

224
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,670
But I can’t get the words

225
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,580
left by Liu Song in Big Dipper.

226
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,920
It’s the account book of my master in Zhaifeng.

227
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,120
It seems that he had searched for years.

228
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,850
But the last pages are missing.

229
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,310
I don’t know if he told you anything

230
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,910
in Wuji Manor.

231
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,030
We couldn’t rescue my eldest brother that year,

232
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,900
which has always been a problem for all of us,

233
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,310
especially Youdao.

234
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,030
He came to Wuji Manor to drink with me that day.

235
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,830
He scolded himself

236
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,110
for not knowing people.

237
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,400
He could had known the identity of Liu Song

238
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,630
at that time.

239
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,710
Did he say something else?

240
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,750
I told him,

241
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,220
the past couldn’t be changed.

242
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
We could look forward to the future.

243
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,150
He took you out of Shanhai Gang

244
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,430
after that.

245
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,270
Sometimes

246
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,430
it doesn’t matter what the truth is.

247
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,610
What’s important is that your parents sacrificed their lives for you.

248
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,550
You become brothers with Xifan

249
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,750
and go back to Big Dipper

250
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,060
to inherit your father’s career.

251
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,390
It’s all meant to be.

252
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,110
The dead are dead.

253
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,950
You should cherish the present.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,070
You’re right.

255
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,050
It’s a pity that as a son,

256
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,010
I can’t be filial to my parents.

257
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,230
I feel very guilty.

258
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,470
I envy Xifan.

259
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,030
It’s good to have a father.

260
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,430
You’re the brother of Xifan.

261
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,830
I like you very much.

262
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,520
You can take this as your home

263
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,790
and treat me as your father.

264
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,900
Uncle Yan, thanks.

265
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,230
I am Xifan’s brother.

266
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,910
I regard you as my father as well.

267
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,200
After I rescue Master Chu Min

268
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,890
and get rid of Shanhai Gang,

269
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,870
I will always go back to Wuji Manor

270
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,630
to accompany you.

271
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,670
Okay.

272
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,620
It’s a deal.

273
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,130
Liu Song doesn’t have any special move recently.

274
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,130
He should know the secret of Thousand Pine Ruler.

275
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,470
We are watching them.

276
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,370
If there is any news,

277
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,990
we will take it.

278
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,410
Don’t worry.

279
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,710
Wuji Manor and I

280
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,110
will avenge your parents’ death

281
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,750
for you.

282
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,230
Thanks. Uncle Yan.

283
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,830
Mr. Xifan.

284
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,150
You had a few drinks.

285
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,590
There is tea

286
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,950
for you to sober up.

287
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,780
How about your injury?

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,070
Thanks to master,

289
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,190
I am fine, now.

290
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,750
You don’t have to do that.

291
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,120
I am used to take care of that.

292
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,910
I am okay.

293
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,310
Ziyan.

294
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,310
In Wuji Manor.

295
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
You are not a maid,

296
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,540
and I am not your owner.

297
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,230
We’re equal.

298
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,360
The scenery here is quite different from that in Kaifeng.

299
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,960
After I get rid of the chaos of Shanhai Gang.

300
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,550
I will give you a tour.

301
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,890
Is that okay?

302
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,570
Yes. I’d love to.

303
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,120
Your parents sacrificed lives for you.

304
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,230
You become brothers with Xifan

305
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,990
and go back to Big Dipper

306
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,180
to inherit your father’s career.

307
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,230
It’s all meant to be.

308
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,300
The dead are dead.

309
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,300
You should cherish the present.

310
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,030
You’re the brother of Xifan.

311
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,750
I like you very much.

312
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,390
You can take this as your home

313
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,750
and treat me as your father.

314
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,110
Here comes the imperial edict.

315
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,110
Yan Qiuci and Yan Xifan of Wuji Manor.

316
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,920
Receive the imperial edict.

317
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,660
According to his majesty,

318
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,860
Princess Xining has been escorted to Wuji Manor

319
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,710
by Longie Army.

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,630
She will arrive in a few days.

321
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,010
Younger master.

322
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,590
Congratulations.

323
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,760
I’m sorry I can’t accept

324
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,220
the favor of his majesty.

325
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,270
Say that again?

326
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,510
I

327
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,790
can’t get married.

328
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,030
How dare you to resist!

329
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,740
Don’t be angry.

330
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,950
Xifan is rude.

331
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,550
Please forgive him.

332
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,280
Could we speak in another place?

333
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,550
After you.

334
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,040
How could such a good thing happen?

335
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,070
A wife for you.

336
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,070
Ziyan.

337
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,270
Who is Princess Xining?

338
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,270
She is…

339
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,750
She is Miss.

340
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,390
Don’t go.

341
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,470
Lu Ping.

342
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,370
That’s imperial edict.

343
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,790
I don’t care.

344
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,950
Do you know Lu Ping?

345
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,190
I heard that he made contributions in E’zhou.

346
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,670
Yes.

347
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,160
I believe that his majesty has known that

348
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,310
Lu Ping and Princess Xining are in love

349
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,470
after the battle of E’zhou.

350
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,110
Lu Ping is the son of my eldest brother.

351
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,270
He is the brother of my son.

352
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,040
We will lose our loyalty to friends if we accept

353
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,910
the grant marriage by his majesty.

354
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,520
We will lose our loyalty to his majesty

355
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,670
if we don’t accept.

356
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,830
May I ask,

357
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,000
what’s the meaning of his majesty’s arrangement?

358
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,180
His majesty has only one word for you.

359
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,990
Master Yan is the Master of Jianghu.

360
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,550
Who is the owner of Jianghu?

361
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,310
Wuji Manor is located in Northwest.

362
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,390
Who are you protecting?

363
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,160
Nowadays, the Shanhai Gang is powerful,

364
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,190
and it is evil.

365
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,150
His majesty

366
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,700
married the Princess to the Younger master.

367
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,040
It’s a hope that the aristocratic family and the Jianghu

368
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,990
will join hands to fight against enemies.

369
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,840
We are facing a formidable enemy.

370
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,750
The romantic love is nothing.

371
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,510
Minister.

372
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,750
I am in Jianghu,

373
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
and I stand with Shuo.

374
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,400
I would fight bravely when the country is in trouble.

375
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,200
It’s no joke about the marriage.

376
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,230
This edict will make me betray my friends,

377
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,670
and myself.

378
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,160
I’m sorry I can’t obey the order.

379
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,990
You…

380
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,390
Who is he?

381
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,110
Careful.

382
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,840
The imperial edict!

383
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,960
Yan Xifan. What’s wrong with you?

384
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,280
Why do you take my Qin Sang?

385
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,360
Lu Ping. What do you mean?

386
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,040
There’s something wrong with it. Cooperate with me.

387
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,640
Minister.

388
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,240
Lu Ping. Enough.

389
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,720
Minister.

390
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,320
-You’d better take care of your girl.
-Minister.

391
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,920
Why are you fighting with me?

392
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,080
You must feel angry. I’m still in bad mood.

393
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
You want to fight?

394
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,230
Come with me.

395
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,320
-Fine, I am not afraid.
-Minister. -How dare you!

396
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,910
How dare you!

397
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,190
It’s the imperial edict.

398
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,700
[Grant Qin Sang as the Princess Xining to marry Yan Xifan]

399
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,410
What’s going on?

400
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,050
His majesty is serious.

401
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,540
It’s not a normal grant marriage.

402
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,200
It’s an alliance agreement between the Jianghu and court.

403
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,910
But I don’t get it

404
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,290
why his majesty chose Qin Sang.

405
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,550
Why?

406
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,120
I contradicted his majesty in E’zhou.

407
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,580
He retaliated against me.

408
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,050
Qin Sang must have been forced.

409
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,860
Now she’s tied to the bridal sedan chair.

410
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,130
His majesty is not a man of narrow mind.

411
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,310
As for Miss Qin,

412
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,670
who can force her?

413
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,750
Don’t stare blankly. Think of a way.

414
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,750
I need to find her

415
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
and ask her in person.

416
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,980
Calm down.

417
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,830
We are rivals in love now.

418
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,190
It’s true.

419
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,750
How about you and Miss Ling?

420
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,980
You have to figure it out by yourself.

421
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,050
Yan Xifan.

422
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,960
I’m not finished with you!

423
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,420
Lu Ping.

424
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,350
Xifan.

425
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,650
Younger Master.

426
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,950
What can I do now?

427
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,080
The edict was destroyed and he ran away.

428
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,510
How…

429
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,030
How can I go back to palace?

430
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,880
Younger Master. Are you okay?

431
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,610
I am alright.

432
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,100
Minister.

433
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,870
There are rules in Jianghu.

434
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,590
If you want to force,

435
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,140
there will be trouble.

436
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,710
You can rest in Manor for a few days.

437
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,090
I guarantee that

438
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,830
this matter will be settled properly.

439
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,240
Father. Thank you for your indulgence.

440
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,110
Rise.

441
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,670
Yes.

442
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,110
You’re not vain.

443
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,120
And you are not afraid of the imperial power.

444
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,470
I know your personality.

445
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,980
It happened suddenly,

446
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,080
I believe there must be some hidden information.

447
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,390
Lu Ping is heading to find Qin Sang.

448
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
Hope he could find out the truth.

449
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,760
Don’t do anything that officers can hold against you.

450
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
I will take care of

451
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,630
the rest.

452
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,370
Thanks, father.

453
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,550
Fan’er.

454
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,910
Prepare well.

455
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,990
If something goes wrong,

456
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,940
you can’t resist the order from the emperor.

457
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,230
Wuji Manor could delay a while,

458
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,010
but we can’t defer forever.

459
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,190
Father.

460
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,030
I…

461
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,360
All the land under heaven

462
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,690
belongs to the king.

463
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,180
You can indulge yourself in the Jianghu.

464
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,900
But you can’t be against the emperor.

465
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Understand that?

466
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,110
I see.

467
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,390
Ziyan.

468
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,230
Ziyan.

469
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,460
Master.

470
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,140
Minister and his party are all arranged.

471
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,120
I don’t understand.

472
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Why you indulge younger master and Lu Ping

473
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,910
being mischievous?

474
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,590
He is my son.

475
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,750
I know what is in his mind.

476
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,950
The marriages in the court

477
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,690
always have more than one meaning.

478
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,090
I’m afraid his majesty wants to

479
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,180
lead the snake out of the hole by this way.

480
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,310
Master. What do you mean?

481
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,040
Eldest brother let Chenfeng seal

482
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,070
the commander’s seal in Thousand Pine Ruler.

483
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,630
Now Liu Song has the Ruler.

484
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,280
He couldn’t get the commander’s seal out.

485
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,910
He is looking for Chenfeng.

486
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,670
His majesty is pushing me.

487
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,710
A Ze.

488
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,750
Spread the news that

489
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Lyu Chenfeng has recently returned from a trip

490
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,240
to Wuji Manor.

491
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,940
Master.

492
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,120
Do you really want to let the man…

493
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,030
I won’t until I really have to.

494
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,740
We have to speed up our actions

495
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,590
and seize the Thousand Pine Ruler back.

496
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,350
Hya.

497
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,960
Hya.

498
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,250
Qin Sang.

499
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,110
What’s going on?

500
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,010
Hya.

501
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,920
Princess.

502
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,960
There are still forty miles to go to Wuji Manor.

503
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,350
We’ll arrive at dusk.

504
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,710
It’s a grant marriage. Show our courtesy.

505
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,910
As usual.

506
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,670
Yes.

507
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Where is my sword?

508
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,160
Princess.

509
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,760
I am from Qin Family.

510
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,290
I will never betray my sword

511
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,750
even if I get married.

512
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,470
It is

513
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,910
a bodhi fruit.

514
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,230
It will bless you.

515
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,830
Qin Sang.

516
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,060
No matter what happens in the future,

517
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,830
I just want you to be safe.

518
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,390
Hya.

519
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,340
Protect the princess.

520
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,290
Hya.

521
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,300
Hya.

522
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,220
Hya.

523
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,230
You know that’s a terrible sin?

524
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,990
I am not afraid of death.

525
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,350
You looked nice

526
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,110
in it today.

527
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,690
You know I don’t want to see you.

528
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,510
Why do you come here?

529
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,810
I think you have the answer.

530
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,870
Otherwise you’ve stabbed me.

531
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,360
I came to remind you of

532
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,190
our promise that day.

533
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,970
I don’t want you to marry Xifan.

534
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,080
I know you don’t want it, either.

535
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,020
It’s a grant marriage.

536
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,840
And it’s Qin Family’s honor.

537
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,310
I am willing to do it.

538
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,380
My brother is gone.

539
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,750
Our Qin Family needs a backer.

540
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,910
Wuji Manor is my best choice.

541
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,150
Qin Sang.

542
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,170
It’s tiring to be duplicitous.

543
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,900
If you really have no feelings for me,

544
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,790
why do you keep the sword I gave you?

545
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,950
Only a sword.

546
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,910
I can leave it.

547
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,470
Qin Sang.

548
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,260
Do you have any difficulties?

549
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,130
Could you share with me?

550
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,760
We conquered many difficulties together.

551
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,620
Am I so unreliable in your mind?

552
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,330
The senior has a crush on Miss Ling.

553
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,270
Do you want to part them?

554
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,790
Qin Sang.

555
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,270
Miss Ling chose her way.

556
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,170
Why don’t you choose one for yourself?

557
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,139
The honor of Qin Family.

558
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,699
I can win it with you.

559
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,219
Qin Sang.

560
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,750
Be with me.

561
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,230
Lu Ping.

562
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,870
I am sorry.

563
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,270
Qin Sang,

564
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,550
Hya.

565
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,460
Whoa.

566
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,790
Lu Ping.

567
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,430
Sorry.

568
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,550
Have a sleep.

569
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,110
When you are awake.

570
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,230
Everything will be fine.

571
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,810
If he shows signs of awakening,

572
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,180
give him this medicine again.

573
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,570
Princess. Don’t worry.

574
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
The Force Lock can’t even be unlocked

575
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,470
by Force of Heft.

576
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:28,590
Lu Ping

577
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,260
couldn’t get rid of it.

578
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,900
Wen Rui.

579
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,510
Escort him to Big Dipper.

580
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,160
He’s not allowed to leave until Shanhai Gang is destroyed.

581
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,870
What?

582
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,210
How about the Shanhai Gang?

583
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,790
I can deal the gang with Master Yan.

584
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,590
I see.

585
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,070
You’ve planned it well.

586
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,110
Right?

587
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,280
It’s my personal affair.

588
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,910
None of your business.

589
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,270
Yes.

590
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,830
Go now.

591
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,310
The rest. Head to Wuji Manor.

592
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,390
Yes.

593
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,600
His majesty wants to lure Liu Song to appear

594
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,150
with Lyu Chenfeng as a bait.

595
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,470
Yes.

596
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,590
There’s no news about Liu Song.

597
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,200
He hasn’t taken the commander’s seal

598
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,860
from Thousand Pine Ruler yet.

599
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,180
We have to take the dangerous move

600
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,660
in order to get rid of the future trouble.

601
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,020
We need to discuss about it later.

602
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,600
It’s a long journey for princess to get here.

603
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,670
Now it’s late.

604
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,230
You can rest in the mansion.

605
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,550
Master Yan.

606
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,590
I’ve heard Lyu Chenfeng is here now.

607
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,150
Can I meet him?

608
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,230
He is not in Wuji Manor.

609
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,590
He is not here?

610
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,730
Chenfeng is eccentric.

611
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,490
I’ve been worried about his safety for years.

612
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,840
He came back from his travels

613
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,240
and visiting Wuji Manor.

614
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,710
I arranged him in a secret place.

615
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,030
He is safe.

616
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,080
Please rest assured, Princess.

617
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,830
Master Yan.

618
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,310
I know.

619
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,640
His majesty has a foresight.

620
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,830
But Chenfeng is my junior.

621
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,550
There are spies from Shanhai Gang

622
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,670
around Wuji Manor.

623
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,790
I know the terrain of Jin City.

624
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,330
I hope Longjie Army will cooperate with me in future.

625
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,190
How about that?

626
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,920
Princess.

627
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,530
Anything else. Master Yan?

628
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,670
Did you meet Lu Ping on the way here?

629
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,430
What?

630
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,550
Nothing.

631
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,680
Two kids argued with each other for the marriage.

632
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,030
Lu Ping hurt

633
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,670
Xifan

634
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,310
and went to you.

635
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,820
I’m afraid that he’s sentimental

636
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,410
and has ruined his majesty’s plan.

637
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,590
Master Yan. Don’t worry.

638
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,270
I’ve dealt with it.

639
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,450
Lu Ping is no longer in the plan.

640
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,790
I’ve sent him back to

641
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,270
Big Dipper.

642
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,600
Princess.

643
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,550
You don’t know how arrogant the Wuji Manor is.

644
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,120
The younger master resisted the order.

645
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,590
Now they shirk again.

646
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,830
I think they are

647
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,270
playing tricks.

648
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,910
What tricks?

649
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,480
Are you afraid I can’t get married?

650
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,880
I will keep my mouth shut.

651
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,070
Leave.

652
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,950
Yes.

653
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,150
Anyone.

654
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,360
Princess.

655
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,710
An order from me.

656
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,710
Guard around Wuji Manor.

657
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,560
The Army gets ready to fight.

658
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,310
Yes.

659
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,590
Where is Yan Qiuci

660
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,430
hiding Lyu Chenfeng?

661
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,650
Younger master.

662
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,540
The Princess is in Wuji Manor now.

663
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,070
Mr. Lu is not with her.

664
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,070
I see.

665
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,590
Master arranged Princess in mansion.

666
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,440
The message from master is that

667
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,710
he knows you need time.

668
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,310
You need to show up tomorrow.

669
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,360
The younger master of Wuji Manor can’t escape.

670
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,300
[From Ling Ziyan]

671
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,350
I want to follow you all my life

672
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,550
after being saved by you many times.

673
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,760
But his majesty grants marriage to you.

674
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,180
I don’t want you to get involved in it,

675
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,060
and become enemies with Lu Ping.

676
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,110
Be selfish.

677
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,230
I don’t want to see you marry someone else

678
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
and are not happy.

679
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,430
I will see you outside the Manor

680
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,830
at midnight,

681
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,240
if you are willing to get out of the trouble.

682
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,410
Since then, I’ll follow you wherever you go

683
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,430
and stay with you forever.

684
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,350
You don’t stay well in the tree.

685
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,750
Why are you here?

686
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,510
Are you as helpless as I am?

687
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,860
I am the extra one everywhere.

688
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,750
So we are here.

689
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,430
But

690
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,710
why aren’t you as brave as Lu Ping?

691
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,730
You need to fight for

692
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,070
whatever you want.

693
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,100
Do you understand?

694
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:11,870
Qin Sang.

695
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,190
Qin Sang.

696
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,310
Qin Sang.

697
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,070
Qin Sang cares about me.

698
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,480
You don’t deserve to mention the name of the princess.

699
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,880
If she doesn’t care about me,

700
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,430
why did she scold me

701
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,790
and send you to protect me?
