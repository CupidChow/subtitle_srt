Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 16

4
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,180
Lu Ping!

5
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,730
Go back to the front hall. Hurry up!

6
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,030
Go. Hurry!

7
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,670
Go!

8
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,640
Do you think that I can’t recognize

9
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,240
you when your face is covered?

10
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,950
Guo Youdao!

11
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,470
I know it’s you!

12
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,829
Master.

13
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,360
When did you discover?

14
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,960
I lived with you for three years.

15
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,470
How can I not see it?

16
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,350
Little fox.

17
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,590
You finally grow up.

18
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,120
You have hidden from me for three years.

19
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,070
Is it funny?

20
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,870
Is it interesting

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,930
to see me looking for you all around

22
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,950
without saying anything to me?

23
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,850
Guo Youdao,

24
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,170
who are you?

25
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,750
Do you know my parents?

26
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,440
Why did you save me at Shanhai Gang?

27
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,750
What did Wen Gecheng mean?

28
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,590
Are you hurt?

29
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,710
It’s nothing.

30
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,850
Not a big deal.

31
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,570
Who are you?

32
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,820
After handling the situation,

33
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,020
I’ll tell you one by one.

34
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,650
Running for life is the most important.

35
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,810
Run!

36
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,090
To where?

37
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,320
Is it Master Guo who swore to surpass Big Dipper?

38
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,390
Nice to meet you!

39
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,240
Master!

40
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,850
Why are you in such a mess?

41
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,170
You visit me without taking gifts or wine.

42
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,170
How rude you are, Master Zhou!

43
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,530
Shut up, old man.

44
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,890
You may not win in a straight fight.

45
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,650
Let along you have lost one hand.

46
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,890
I am so honored to pick

47
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,410
one of the master’s teeth today.

48
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,760
Do you want to beat him?

49
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,570
Can we?

50
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,590
Can’t you trust me for one time?

51
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,550
Do you know why I always say “surpass Big Dipper”?

52
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,570
I can defeat such a waste

53
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,730
with only one hand.

54
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,860
“Disguise from God”!

55
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,770
Old man,

56
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,210
how dare you?

57
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,060
I will beat you as I please.

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
I don’t care about the skill.

59
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,680
Master.

60
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,630
It’s just the lightning before death.

61
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,190
You can’t survive.

62
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,590
You just behaved proud.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,110
Continue that!

64
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,590
You finally are a total loser.

65
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,470
However,

66
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,470
I won’t kill you today.

67
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,950
You will wait to be

68
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,990
tortured back in the gang.

69
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,910
Can we escape today?

70
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,710
If I let you be captured again,

71
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,380
I would rather die.

72
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,790
It’s much better.

73
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:08,910
Go.

74
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,110
Lu Ping.

75
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,390
Master!

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,790
Lu Ping!

77
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,390
Master!

78
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,880
You have mastered the five forces.

79
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,270
Who,

80
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,670
who are you?

81
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,190
Wuji Manor,

82
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,309
Yan Qiuci.

83
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,150
Wild Sword in the Northwest.

84
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,320
Don’t press an enemy at bay.

85
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,030
Mr. Yan,

86
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,240
did you come here especially

87
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,830
to help us?

88
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,590
My son has

89
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,670
disturbed you.

90
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,590
Please forgive me.

91
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,850
So that is what it is.

92
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,200
Forgive me that I didn’t recognize.

93
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,330
I always respect people from Jianghu.

94
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,900
Since you, the Leader of martial arts, came,

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,510
I must let them go.

96
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,070
I have to handle the things left.

97
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,890
Good bye.

98
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,030
Please.

99
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,620
Please.

100
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,240
People without level lower than four forces

101
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,840
may break their whole bodies

102
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,870
if falling from that height.

103
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,170
I always say that no one in Zhaifeng shall be left behind.

104
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,540
But I didn’t keep my words.

105
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,110
Xifan,

106
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,630
stand up. Be a man.

107
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,830
An eye for an eye

108
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,160
and a tooth for tooth.

109
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,630
I will send people to search them.

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,230
Many things are left

111
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,870
for you to do.

112
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
I want to go back to Zhaifeng.

113
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Don’t bother.

114
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,710
Shanhai Gang has left.

115
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,310
Qin Qi won’t make them difficult.

116
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,590
The less the kids know,

117
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,230
the better for them.

118
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,750
It is time to go home

119
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,570
after so many years.

120
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,210
I listen to you, father.

121
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,470
Help…

122
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,360
Help.

123
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
You two just follow me in the future.

124
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,160
Take the clothes.

125
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,600
Remember.

126
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,490
You have to pay.

127
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,360
Kneel down, you brat!

128
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,100
Apologize to Senior Brother.

129
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,900
[Zhaifeng Heroes]

130
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,250
The brat owes me a lot.

131
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,880
If you kill him,

132
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,810
who will give me the payment?

133
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,360
You almost kill your teacher!

134
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,650
Who threw it?

135
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,590
Real gold?

136
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,650
More than two taels!

137
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,470
When did you get it?

138
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,590
Take it!

139
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,710
We can win over Big Dipper!

140
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,790
Go!

141
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,390
Lu Ping, push!

142
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,910
Haven’t you eaten?

143
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,990
You have no relation to Zhaifeng Institute.

144
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,830
Return the money and

145
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,790
we will call it even!

146
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,900
I’m going to Chan Province for Township Test.

147
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,100
You can stop worrying about me forever.

148
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,650
I don’t want to be related

149
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,970
to Zhaifeng Institute.

150
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,930
It’s good for all.

151
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,050
Master.

152
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,770
Be quiet.

153
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,210
If you attract troops of Qin Qi,

154
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,510
even I can’t protect you.

155
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,360
Surprisingly, we are alive.

156
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,270
Why can’t I move?

157
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,630
My “Disguise from God”

158
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,270
is not easy to bear.

159
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,430
The secret power of force:

160
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,590
Disguise from God.

161
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,650
You can put your force into my body.

162
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,190
Am I clever?

163
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,750
That’s why I am called “God of Bandits”.

164
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,950
You look pitiful

165
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,329
with your poor skills.

166
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,030
So I send you some

167
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,390
to make you look better.

168
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,579
Why is it so cold?

169
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,270
No,

170
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,550
I have to drink to warm myself.

171
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,510
The cliff is so high.

172
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,020
Did you endure all the concussion

173
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,070
made by our falling?

174
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,750
As I said,

175
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,630
you as a disciple

176
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,270
are a big problem.

The truth shows that

353
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,750
Force Combat Convention is a disaster.

354
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,870
Qin Qi, commander of Longjie Army, asks to go in.

355
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,040
Your Majesty.

356
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,870
I have sin.

357
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,630
What kind of sin?

358
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,840
Your Majesty.

359
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,430
I discovered that Lu Ping was from Shanhai Gang.

360
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,800
I wanted to attract his associates

361
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,750
and made a trap on the convention.

362
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Although we have badly hurt the gang,

363
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,350
and captured most

364
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,780
of the spies in the country,

365
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,570
Mr. Wen was killed

366
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,050
by Lu in this way.

367
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,840
Besides, afraid of leaking information,

368
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,230
I didn’t tell you the truth.

369
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,280
Please forgive me for my hiding.

370
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,510
Please punish me.

371
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
You have killed numerous enemies on battlefield.

372
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,750
I never thought you could also

373
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,030
surprise me by making stories.

374
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,030
Do you have evidence

375
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,920
for saying like that?

376
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,470
I have evidence that

377
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,040
I have captured the spies.

378
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,990
If I lied, I am willing

379
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,660
to resign from my position

380
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,330
and be punished willingly.

381
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,700
Which evidence can you

382
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,550
give to prove

383
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,070
you accusation on me?

384
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,910
You!

385
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,550
In fact,

386
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,390
General Qin always thinks about the country.

387
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,510
Mr. Xia should not be so severe.

388
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,520
It is just that the influence is so big

389
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,150
that we have to be low-key.

390
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,280
Your Majesty. How generous!

391
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,710
Thank for Your Majesty.

392
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,320
-Your Majesty. -Mr. Xia,

393
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,630
I have to talk with General Qin.

394
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,070
You can go first.

395
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,270
Yes.

396
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,030
What have you got

397
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,120
after investigating Shanhai Gang for so long?

398
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,470
Your Majesty.

399
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,560
I have investigated in many ways

400
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,690
but I got few things.

401
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,750
I only knew that 19 years ago,

402
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,280
Shanhai Gang went to Big Dipper for competition

403
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,030
and disappeared even since.

404
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,090
Now they suddenly appear in the north.

405
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,640
There must be something.

406
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,470
I will go on investigating.

407
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,590
Never mind.

408
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,150
It’s no use caring about old things.

409
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,220
I’m most afraid of the past Shanhai Gang.

410
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,830
Now they are not satisfied with Jianghu.

411
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
They even want to control the court.

412
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,790
Your Majesty means…

413
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,550
These days, I got news from City Jin.

414
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,110
The Liu’s from Hedong are taking moves.

415
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,910
They contacted with Xidan.

416
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,860
Their ambition is obvious.

417
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,010
Since the building of the country,

418
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,390
the Liu’s retrieved to the north of City Jin

419
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,190
but they never give up our land.

420
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,150
Many of the spies you have discovered

421
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,510
are former residents of the Dan Country.

422
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,670
If I say they are not related,

423
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,270
do you believe in me?

424
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,270
If you put it this way,

425
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,560
what Shanhai Gang did in the past

426
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,500
seems ridiculous and disorderly

427
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,710
but it actually benefits the Liu’s.

428
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,510
The Liu’s must be behind the gang.

429
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,520
Your Majesty is so clever.

430
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,070
I am nothing near you.

431
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,190
That’s why I told you to be careful.

432
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,220
You must destroy them totally

433
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,090
and strengthen the garrison at the border

434
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,310
in case they invade us.

435
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,470
I think about cooperating with other countries.

436
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,100
[Map of the Country]

437
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,050
I will send ambassador to them.

438
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,950
It is very important

439
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,910
and I hope you can take charge.

440
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,710
I am willing to sacrifice my life for you!

441
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,730
I won’t disappoint you.

442
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,660
[Dan]

443
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:09,940
[Shuo]

444
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,420
[Wuji Manor]

445
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,950
Lu Ping.

446
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,510
Young Master, you finally wake up.

447
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
After you came back,

448
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
you ate and drank nothing.

449
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,710
Just slept.

450
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,230
How can you endure with such a body?

451
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,920
I will fetch you something to eat.

452
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,320
Don’t bother, Uncle Wei.

453
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,150
I’m OK.

454
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,590
Young Master, you have

455
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,620
been away for more than four years

456
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,010
without any news.

457
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,170
Had it not been for

458
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,470
the jade you pawned,

459
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,970
Master could hardly save you.

460
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,440
Where’s my father?

461
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,240
There’s something at the border of City Jin.

462
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,090
Master has been busy all the time.

463
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,850
He asked me to take care of you.

464
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,060
He said that you don’t have to think

465
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,450
about the past since you have returned.

466
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,330
What can I do for you?

467
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,420
That guy came here just a few days ago.

468
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,750
He fights only once a day

469
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,730
but he has the highest odds.

470
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,210
He can use all six forces

471
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,450
but he uses no more than two once.

472
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,200
We ordinary people

473
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,130
can only use one kind of force.

474
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,610
He can transform among the six.

475
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,140
Except for the hardest Force of Spirit,

476
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,660
which he is not that good at,

477
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,970
he can use other five smoothly.

478
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,860
Therefore, up to now,

479
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,850
he always wins.

480
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,340
No matter he fights one person, a group of people,

481
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,670
or even against beasts.

482
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,290
What’s his name?

483
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,450
Lu Ping.

484
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,290
Good!

485
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,290
Good!

486
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,520
Good!

487
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,240
I just want to beat you!
