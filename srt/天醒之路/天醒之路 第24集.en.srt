00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,320
the peace talks because of any misunderstanding.

177
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,400
General Qin has a point.

178
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
I will take him with me.

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
You have my promise.

180
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,520
This matter will be handled carefully.

181
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,960
That’s a deal.

182
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,240
Sang’er.

183
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,600
Sang’er.

184
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,480
It’s all Shanhai Gang’s plan.

185
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,680
Xu Tianbing has high prestige in the army.

186
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
And I’m a special envoy

187
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,840
of Shuo.

188
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
If I had killed Xu Tianbing,

189
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,480
then Tan’s army

190
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,160
would have mutinied.

191
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,280
Peace talks are bound to collapse.

192
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,280
The war is about to start.

193
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,800
At that time,

194
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
I had to hide first.

195
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,880
Yan Xifan escaped.

196
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,320
Lu Ping took the blame for me,

197
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,960
so as to turn this matter from

198
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,520
political action to personal resentment.

199
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,640
He bought time for Shuo.

200
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
Lu Ping.

201
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,880
It’s Lu Ping who broke the puzzle for me.

202
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
The brat,

203
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,520
even Shanhai Gang was tricked by him.

204
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,840
Miss.

205
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,840
Don’t blame the General.

206
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,880
He did it for our country.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,680
Sang’er.

208
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,160
What kind of person is Lu Ping?

209
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,920
I remembered he was a young man

210
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,200
acting on impulse when in Kaifeng.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,080
But I was really impressed

212
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,680
today.

213
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,440
He is not like you.

214
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,160
He has no ambition about the country.

215
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,960
He is timid

216
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,160
sometimes.

217
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,160
He is afraid of pain.

218
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,920
But he has responsibilities.

219
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
He never flinches when it’s necessary.

220
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,520
I knew he made a choice

221
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,440
when he asked you to leave.

222
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
He is a brave man.

223
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,200
I respect him.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,480
Brother.

225
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,200
Is there anything we can do to help him?

226
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,640
This matter is well planned

227
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,040
and closely linked.

228
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,840
Shanhai Gang must have

229
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
someone inside to help.

230
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,080
Wen Rui.

231
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,320
Help me to investigate someone.

232
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
Who?

233
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,240
When was Xu Tianbing’s body moved into the post?

234
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,680
Who is the person Yan Xifan pretended to be that

235
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,240
he could sneak into the post without suspicion?

236
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Xu Family.

237
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,560
Master.

238
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Who are they?

239
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,480
They are from Longjie Army.

240
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,280
It seems that Mr. Xu has been doubted.

241
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,100
[Tingsong Villa]

242
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,520
What are you doing with Zhou Youlong?

243
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,520
You came with empty hands.

244
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,360
How could you say that?

245
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,120
Lu Ping came all of a sudden.

246
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,880
He messed up with my plan.

247
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,000
If I hadn’t left in time,

248
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,960
master would have been in a bad time now.

249
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
You couldn’t complete the simple division.

250
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,040
Where is Zhou Youlong now?

251
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,120
No idea?

252
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,160
Master.

253
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Shanhai Gang doesn’t need the loser.

254
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,440
We lost today.

255
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,000
I can’t bear it.

256
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,960
What if

257
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,200
I kill him for our gang?

258
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,480
Master.

259
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,200
Enough.

260
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,109
Enough.

261
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,589
Even if he deserves death,

262
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,480
it’s not your turn to kill him.

263
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
Master. Thanks.

264
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,760
Xu Weifeng.

265
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,560
When you came to us,

266
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,920
you should know

267
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,560
you must be useful

268
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
to Shanhai Gang.

269
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,840
If you are useless,

270
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,360
you and Tan are not worth mentioning

271
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,680
in the Shanhai Gang.

272
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Master.

273
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,480
It’s not a complete failure.

274
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,840
Xu Tianbing has great prestige in Tan Army.

275
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,240
My father controlled the news of his assassination

276
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,240
in order to make the peace talks go smoothly.

277
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,640
But rumors are invisible swords.

278
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,920
If I let out the news that Lu Ping

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
was instructed by Qin Qi,

280
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,640
the army will never forgive them.

281
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,360
If there is a mutiny in the army,

282
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,880
the country will have to fight.

283
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
As for Lu Ping.

284
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,400
I’ll try to make him admit it.

285
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
You thought too much.

286
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,120
My brother won’t talk so easily.

287
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,040
Mr. Yan refuses to try.

288
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,680
Are you afraid of your brother’s suffering?

289
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
Whatever.

290
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I will give you a second chance.

291
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
Remember.

292
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,080
You won’t have the third one.

293
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,560
Yes.

294
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
I will live up to your trust.

295
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,160
Lu Ping is still useful to us.

296
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,760
Bring him alive to me

297
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,280
when the war begins.

298
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,760
Yes.

299
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,480
Mr. Xu.

300
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,920
It’s been a day.

301
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,440
Several of our brothers are tired.

302
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,440
He didn’t say a word

303
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,680
about Qin Qi.

304
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,680
He…

305
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,160
He fell asleep.

306
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,960
Senior Xu.

307
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,200
Were you disappointed

308
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,720
when you learned that it’s me, not Qin Qi,

309
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
who killed people?

310
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,840
Have some rest.

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,760
Yes.

312
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
You knew.

313
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,920
Qin Qi was led in by Yan Xifan.

314
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,160
In the whole E’zhou, the one who knows

315
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,520
the relationship among us, and has time to act is you.

316
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,080
I figured it out

317
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
when Mo Lin told me.

318
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,080
I was late.

319
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,800
Or I’ll make you lose even worse.

320
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,520
I don't understand

321
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,720
why you should take the blame for Qin Qi.

322
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,680
He showed no mercy

323
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
to you before.

324
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,080
I just don't like Shanhai Gang.

325
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,240
I just want to fight against Shanhai Gang.

326
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
Is that okay?

327
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,840
Lu Ping.

328
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
You’re now guilty of a capital offense.

329
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
Qin Qi couldn’t save you.

330
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
Qin Sang couldn’t save you, either.

331
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,320
I am the only one

332
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,320
who could save you.

333
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
I didn’t expect you to

334
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,240
sacrifice yourself.

335
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,000
I respect you.

336
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
My gratitude to you was true

337
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,080
in Qisha Institute

338
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,040
and at the gate of E’zhou.

339
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,680
We can be friends

340
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,360
as long as you’re willing to give us the truth.

341
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,440
Senior Xu.

342
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,000
I was wrong.

343
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,200
You are not like our senior.

344
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,440
He is firm in speech but soft in heart.

345
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,200
You?

346
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,080
A hypocrite.

347
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,640
You are just like the Shanhai Gang.

348
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,400
You want to know the truth?

349
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,040
I told you.

350
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,080
I killed him.

351
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
If you want to know other things,

352
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
get off.

353
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
How about Su Tang?

354
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,320
Don’t you care about her?

355
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,120
You have Shanhai Gang as your back.

356
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,680
I am not alone, either.

357
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,680
I promise you,

358
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,400
if you dare do Su Tang the slightest harm,

359
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,600
you will die.

360
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,360
And

361
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,680
if you fail this mission,

362
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,240
do you think Shanhai Gang will let you go easily?

363
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,200
Senior Xu, you will know

364
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,280
how I practice

365
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,800
this ability of being beaten.

366
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,600
Dealing with demon,

367
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,240
aren’t you afraid?

368
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,480
Those two who were sent to track

369
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,320
Xu Weifeng have no further information.

370
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,240
They might have been killed.

371
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,000
There is something wrong with Xu Weifeng.

372
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,360
Now that we have found out,

373
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,360
should we report it to Tan

374
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,640
and save Lu Ping?

375
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,360
No.

376
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,400
Verbal statements cannot be taken as evidence.

377
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,120
Now the peace talks can continue

378
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,560
because Minister Xu suppressed the news

379
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,080
that Xu Tianbing is dead.

380
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,800
But Xu Weifeng is the son of Xu Yanling.

381
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,440
Words alone are no proof.

382
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,680
If we open mouth rashly,

383
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,600
it will only make Mr. Xu unfair.

384
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,480
Now we’ve to get the evidence and give it to Tan's emperor..

385
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,800
Then we can control the damage.

Now

390
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,920
the army knew

391
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Xu Tianbing was dead.

392
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,840
Now the soldiers are angry.

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,080
They want to fight.

394
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,040
I can’t control them.

396
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,240
Why are you putting off?

397
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,360
What do you want, Minister Xia?

398
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,480
Lu Ping comes from our country.

399
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,960
But he is the murderer.

400
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,360
His execution

401
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,160
would calm the army.

402
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,640
What do you want to do with his life

403

after all this?

405
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,200
I have my own opinion on this.

406
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,240
The conflict may break out at any moment.

407
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,760
What’s the point of your opinion?

408
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,040
Do you want to wait until the mutiny

409
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,240
and those soldier come to fight against Shuo?

Do you have to kill Lu Ping?

Brother.

414
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,720
Lu Ping didn’t kill anyone.

415
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,480
He is a scapegoat for you,

416
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,560
and Shuo.

417
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,480
The current situation is in chaos.

418
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
I can only do my best to buy time for him.

419
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,240
But I can’t guarantee.

420
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,960
I can’t decide.

421
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,000
Would you kill him

422
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,360
if you had to?

Sang’er.

424
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,520
I thought that Lu Ping was convicted for Shuo,

425
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,240
and Shuo would save him.

426
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
As a result, you don’t care about his life.

427
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:03,960
Fine.

428
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,680
I won’t put you in a dilemma.

429
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,480
If you won’t save him,

430
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,800

I won’t get you involved.

I know that being an official is restricted.

But there is Jianghu.

437
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,640
There must be a way to save Lu Ping.

438

After the spreading news of Xu Tianbing’s death,

693
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,640
and the country?

694
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,720
Wen Rui.

695
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,520
Let’s search the mountain.

696
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,200
Wait.

697
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,400
Brother.

698
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,840
I know the general principle

699
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
but I also know

700
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
innocent people shouldn’t be sacrificed

701
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
for your faith.

702
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,720
Take Miss away

703
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,840
so that she doesn’t cause any trouble.

704
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,280
General Qin.

705
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,200
I am willing to go with you.

706
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,320
I was ready when

707
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,680
I turned myself in at the post that day.

708
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,000
I got a few more days.

709
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,440
I am satisfied.

710
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,960
How could you come out?

711
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,720
You can’t go with my brother.

712
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,520
Don’t lock the door only

713
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,760
and lock the window in the future.

714
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,960
Lu Ping.

715
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,920
Master.

716
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,360
Guo Youdao is good at demanding a life for a life.

717
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
I am better than him.

718
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,560
Lu Ping.

719
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,120
You don’t have to.

720
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,800
You are one of Big Dipper.

721
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
Big Dipper will keep you safe.

722
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,640
Since Zhaifeng was destroyed,

723
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,320
I thought I have no roots and no home.

724
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,640
I would wander for a life.

725
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,200
But I didn’t find my place of peace

726
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,160
until the master rescued me to Big Dipper.

727
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
So

728
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
I won’t let Big Dipper go the same way.

729
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,000
General Qin.

730
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,920
I am going with you.

731
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,280
Can I talk to your sister before I go?

732
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,640
What’s wrong?

733
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,560
One slap by your brother.

734
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,520
Why are you so angry?

735
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,280
I am upset with myself.

736
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,000
I want to save your life.

737
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,080
But I messed it up.

738
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,440
Silly girl.

739
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
You didn’t mess it up.

740
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,080
It’s my choice.

741
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,760
But there’s one thing I can’t rest assured of.

742
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,400
Now it seems

743
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,440
I can only entrust it to you.

744
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,520
Entrust?

745
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,200
What’s your unfulfilled wish?

746
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,640
Go and do it yourself.

747
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,440
I’m not saying my last wishes.

748
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,960
I am talking about Su Tang.

749
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,920
She is under the control of Xu Weifeng.

750
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,440
Find her for me.

751
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,200
Save her.

752
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,280
How about you?

753
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,480
What about you?

754
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,760
Don’t worry.

755
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,360
I am the bandit.

756
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,280
No one could take

757
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
my life.

758
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,040
You save Su Tang for me.

759
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,680
I can save myself with confidence.

760
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,880
Okay?

761
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,640
Okay.

762
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,960
I promise you.

763
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,160
Mr. Lu.

764
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,120
Mr. Lu.

765
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,360
Miss.

766
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,880
I’d like to go with you to rescue Miss Su Tang.

767
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
I will do everything.

768
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,640
Ziyan.

769
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,480
You…

770
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,160
You are taking care of me.

771
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,360
I’ve long regarded you as my family.

772
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,040
Mr. Lu. If you still regard me as a friend,

773
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,480
don’t keep me out of this.

774
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,120
Fine.

775
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,000
More people, more assurance.

776
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,000
Okay.

777
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,240
I’ll entrust Su Tang’s life to you.
