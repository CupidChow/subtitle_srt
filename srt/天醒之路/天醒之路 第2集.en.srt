Let's be reasonable.

so she sent me instead.

173
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,840
This is my family heirloom.

174
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,660
It's a gift for my husband.

175
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,200
Let's see how I deal with you today.

176
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,000
Come!

177
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,120
Bring her down.

178
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,200
Wei Ming!

179
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Wei Ming!

180
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,080
Where on earth is he?

181
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
I can't walk anymore!

182
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,160
[Help!]

183
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
[Help!]

184
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,240
Hold on!

185
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Let me take a look.

186
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,360
I dare you to touch me.

187
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,280
Touch you?

188
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
I'll touch you if I want.

189
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,440
Get lost!

190
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,640
Get lost!

191
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,960
-Don't touch me.
-Madam Jin said she wanted

192
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,840
-to put on an act with me.
-Get lost!

193
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,160
It ended up getting my Chuanyun Fort

194
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
-destroyed by Zhaifeng Institute.
-Get lost!

195
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,360
-Put me down!
-The few of us will vent it out on you.

196
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Let me take a look.

197
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,240
Leader.

198
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,320
You'd better behave when I play nice.

199
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,520
Tie her legs together.

200
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,880
You...

201
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,480
Who exactly are you?

202
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,850
Miss, are you all right?

203
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm the first disciple
of Chan State's martial arts academy,

204
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,440
Wei Tianqi.

205
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,240
Who are you?

206
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,530
In broad daylight, how dare you...

207
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,440
Who is it?

208
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,040
Beat him up!

209
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,080
Who is hitting me?

210
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,930
Do you know who my father is?

211
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,360
Who cares who your father is?

212
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm your grandfather!

213
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,960
Beat him up!

214
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,160
Wei Ming!

215
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,160
Beat him up!

216
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,040
Darn you!

217
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
-Kick him!
-Wei Ming!

218
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,720
Leader.

219
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,800
Leader.

220
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,000
Ziyan.

221
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,930
Miss, are you all right?

222
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,410
Where have you been?

223
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,380
Where did all of you go?

224
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,540
Although I can take on ten men,

225
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,920
I can't fend off scoundrels
who sneaked up on me.

226
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,760
Sir.

227
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,410
-Didn't you tell us not to follow you?
-You...

228
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,240
Mr. Wei.

229
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Are you all right?

230
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,520
Don't worry, miss.

231
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,600
I am fine.

232
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,120
I wonder if you're hurt?

233
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,160
We'll take our leave.

234
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,840
Hold on.

235
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,640
Miss.

236
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
We just met for the first time today,

237
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,320
but we overcame a threat to our lives.

238
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,250
This isn't just any ordinary fate.

239
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
Chan State is not far from here.

240
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,280
I wonder if you'll come with me

241
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,160
to rest for a few days at my residence?

242
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,600
We have deer antlers, ginseng,
and all sorts of medicine.

243
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
We'll take great care of you.

244
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,800
Chan State?

245
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,960
Wei Tianqi?

246
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,560
You're from Wei Zhong's family?

247
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,520
You know my father?

248
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,880
Since Mr. Wei has invited me
with such hospitality,

249
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
I'll accept it graciously.

250
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,640
I'll arrange for a carriage.

251
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,220
You two, get a carriage ready.

252
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,200
-Miss.
- Go.

253
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,600
-You're hurt.
-Prepare some food.

254
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,160
Why don't you report to the General
back in Kaifeng?

255
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,920
Let's not trouble my brother
with such trivialities.

256
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,000
I can handle it.

257
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Besides,

258
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,760
as for that rascal from Shanhai Gang
who humiliated me,

259
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,120
I have to catch him and skin him myself,

260
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,440
to vent my anger.

261
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,080
Lu Ping.

262
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,240
Xifan cares the most about his dignity.

263
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,880
He treats you kindly as well.

264
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,600
What you did to him...

265
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
He's quite pitiful.

266
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,120
What is it?

267
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,370
Are you worried?

268
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,560
Are you upset?

269
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,960
I knew it.

270
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,880
You're at the age to fall in love.

271
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,090
Although Zhao Xifan often picks on me,

272
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,600
luckily he's good-looking.

273
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
He's not a bad person either.

274
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,250
He might not be good enough for you,

275
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,760
but he can get by.

276
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
When I'm gone,

277
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,770
you'll have someone to rely on.

278
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,080
No way! I'll follow you wherever you go.

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,930
My silly Su Tang.

280
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,420
You're not my real sister.

281
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,050
How can I make you waste away your life?

282
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,400
You'll get married someday.

283
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,119
As for me,

284
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,369
once I unlock these chains,

285
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,500
-I'll...
-Lu Ping.

286
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Osmanthus candy?

287
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,690
Don't change the topic.

288
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,810
We'll talk about the future later.

289
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,520
We've been busy all day.

290
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,170
Get some sleep soon.

291
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,880
[What's so bad about being like a turtle?]

292
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,440
If we learn to hide like it does,

293
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,240
we might even get to live longer.

294
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,650
[Didn't he leave earlier?]

295
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,000
[How did he know that]

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,460
[the God of Bandits
drew a turtle on my face?]

297
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,760
[Could he be...]

298
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,040
[But that fellow
can't even walk straight.]

299
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,250
[How can he possibly be...]

300
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,010
[The valiance of Zhaifeng]

301
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,360
I'm really down on luck today.

302
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,480
I'm nearly half dead.

303
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,800
Shanhai Gang...

304
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,480
They still found their way here.

305
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,080
Little one.

306
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,920
Come with me.

307
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,840
No.

308
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,240
No...

309
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,160
No!

310
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,690
You're injured.

311
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,140
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

312
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,410
It's harder to keep you in the dark now.

313
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,200
Lu Ping.

314
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,900
You should have the osmanthus candy.

315
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
When I came in,

316
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,680
you were trembling all over.

317
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,680
You shouldn't have fled with me.

318
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,810
I got you into this mess.

319
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,240
You didn't.

320
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,600
Everyone thinks I'm protecting you.

321
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,160
But I know that...

322
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,960
you've always protected me.

323
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,280
Save Su Tang.

324
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,770
I've enjoyed the past three years.

325
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,520
A girl in her teens

326
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,460
doesn't even tremble
upon hearing about killing someone.

327
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,720
How is that any good?

328
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,540
You shouldn't be leading such a life.

329
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,420
All the more, you shouldn't let
a monster like me drag you down.

330
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,120
You're not a monster.

331
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,460
You're my godbrother.

332
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,940
Master Guo sounds harsh,
but he's kind at heart.

333
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,660
Zhao Xifan isn't a bad person either.

334
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,340
It's pretty good for you here.

335
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,800
You don't have to spend your life
on the run with me.

336
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,680
No way.

337
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,440
When you carried me on your back

338
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,600
out of Shanhai Gang that year,

339
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,800
you have become my real brother.

340
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,160
I'll stick to you anywhere forever

341
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,020
Don't dream of leaving me behind.

342
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,000
Silly girl.

343
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,720
It hurts so much...

344
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,680
You're so ungrateful.

345
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,560
Are you trying to break my old bones?

346
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,000
You've deceived your mentor
and betrayed your ancestors.

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,400
Master, as our mentor,

348
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,360
you are eavesdropping on us.

349
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,140
You're the one to talk.

350
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,120
Answer me.

351
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,300
Did you offend anyone from Shanhai Gang?

352
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,120
Master, you drink every day.

353
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,520
You must have had too much to drink.

354
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,450
You got it wrong.

355
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm very sober.

356
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,450
Are you still trying to fool me?

357
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,200
If I were to know
that you're a troublemaker,

358
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
I wouldn't bring you back
so easily back then.

359
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,840
Listen up.

360
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
You're not welcome here anymore.

361
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,360
Move out quickly.

362
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,440
Move all of these out.

363
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,280
Get going.

364
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Get lost.

365
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Scram.

366
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,920
You have the cheek to tell me that?

367
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,480
If you didn't ask me for so much money,

368
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
I could have bought Zhaifeng Institute
with what I paid you.

369
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,120
You're haggling with me?

370
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
You're getting even with me?

371
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,450
Fine, answer me.

372
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,760
Everything you ate
and used in the past three years.

373
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,040
And your expenses. Are those included?

374
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,000
Also, there are the renovation fees
for Zhaifeng Institute.

375
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,160
The repair fees of walls
at the entrance...

376
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,400
I didn't even pin that on you.

377
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,280
How dare you haggle with me?

378
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
Are you joking?

379
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,480
Seriously.

380
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,410
Who threw that at me?

381
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,280
It's real gold.

382
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,880
It weighs at least two taels.

383
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,240
When did you get this?

384
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,160
During the fight at Chuanyun Fort,

385
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,420
I took it on the way out.

386
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,320
Su Tang.

387
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,840
Come here.

388
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,840
If only your godbrother

389
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,320
is a bit more diligent,

390
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,040
he could have paid off his debts sooner.

391
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,210
Then you won't have to work so hard.

392
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,400
If I take too much with me,

393
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,060
won't Xifan hate me even more?

394
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,220
You're overthinking.

395
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,120
Listen.

396
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
Pay off your debts sooner

397
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
and get out of here sooner.

398
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,280
Stop getting me into trouble.

399
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,800
Lu Ping.

400
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
Why is Master always like this?

401
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,480
He's always seizing
the chance to drive you out,

402
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,160
but he never really did.

403
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,440
Even if he doesn't drive me away,

404
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,040
won't I have to leave as well?

405
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,200
When that man in black
barged into Shanhai Gang

406
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,330
[and rescued us...]

407
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,020
[He even opened up a crack]

408
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,810
[in my Soul Confinement with his powers.]

409
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,280
Leave quickly.

410
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,650
You're the God of...

411
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,720
[The God of...]

412
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,280
Leave now!

413
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,520
Go!

414
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Since we fled from Shanhai Gang,

415
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,060
[in the past three years,]

416
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
[I've pretended to be a bandit.]

417
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,320
[While I tackled those thieves
for Zhaifeng Institute,]

418
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,480
[I also wanted to lure him out
by using his namesake.]

419
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,040
During my investigation,
I found out about someone

420
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,160
who was complimented as
Inseparable Manifestation and Obscurity.

421
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,720
He knows everything about martial arts.

422
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,680
Three years ago, he had been to the north.

423
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,760
He lost all his powers
after a battle with Shanhai Gang

424
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,420
and he's still wanted by them.

425
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,370
This man is Wen Gecheng.

426
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Wen Gecheng.

427
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,620
He is very likely to be the bandit.

428
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
Are you sure

429
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,380
he can unlock your Soul Confinement?

430
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Back then, he only opened up a crack

431
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,000
and I already managed
to get a bit of the power of six souls.

432
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,500
Even if the chances
of unlocking it are slim,

433
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,560
I have to give it a try.

434
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,300
Once these chains are broken off,

435
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,520
I will be free.

436
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Lu Ping.

437
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,600
We've missed the opportunity.

438
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,860
Where will we go looking for Wen Gecheng?

439
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,800
On Wen Gecheng's carriage,

440
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,180
there's the same symbol
in the front and at the back.

441
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,810
[That's not the emblem
of Victorious Dragon Troop.]

442
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,170
I think I've seen it somewhere.

443
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
I remember it now.

444
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,250
It was on the fake Ruyu's sword.

445
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,800
That fake Ruyu spoke and acted

446
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,460
like someone
from an aristocratic background.

447
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,440
Perhaps, through her,

448
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,020
we might find Wen Gecheng.

449
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,480
Where is she now?

450
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
She nearly took my pants off.

451
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,410
I left her hanging from a tree
in a fit of anger.

452
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,680
There is many a slip
between the cup and the lip.

453
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,160
It's all my fault. I panicked.

454
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,290
I acted carelessly.

455
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,760
Lu Ping.

456
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
Who exactly is that fake Ruyu?

457
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,730
Since she is of an aristocracy,

458
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,560
why is she in pursuit
of Shanhai Gang on her own?

459
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Who knows?

460
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,040
Even the Queen Mother of the West

461
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,610
has to tend to her injuries.

462
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,560
She couldn't have gone far.

463
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,890
She would have walked faster than you did.

464
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Lu Ping.

465
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,680
If you wish to use your souls power again,

466
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,140
you'll have to wait
for another half a month.

467
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,800
Who said I'll need to use
the souls power to search for her?

468
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,930
I think that the badger game will work.

469
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,000
Su Tang.

470
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,280
When you can, ask Xifan out tomorrow

471
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,530
to the woods at the back of the hill.

472
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,840
Lu Ping.

473
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,400
Is this even the time to play matchmaker?

474
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,960
It's hard to search for someone,

475
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,220
but not a renown sword.

476
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,120
That young lady's sword
is no ordinary sword.

477
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,520
I can't figure it out,

478
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
but Xifan is very knowledgeable.

479
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,260
He might recognize it.

480
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,120
Whether we can get him to tell us,

481
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,450
it's entirely up to you.

482
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,520
No way.

483
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,680
Su Tang.

484
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,040
If it works,

485
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,210
I'll buy all the osmanthus candies
in the entire Chenqiao Town for you.

486
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
If so, I...

487
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,570
I'll think about it.

488
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,320
Xifan.

489
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,040
Sparring?

490
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
This way, please.

491
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,480
My son.

492
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
I've missed you.

493
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,130
Where are you hurt? Show me.

494
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,000
Father, that's enough.

495
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,080
Everyone is watching.

496
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,160
Don't make a fuss.

497
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
Did someone bully you?

498
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,280
Don't worry.

499
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,120
I'll send Wei Ming and the others
to wipe them out.

500
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Father.

501
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,720
I'm the first disciple
of Chan State's martial arts academy.

502
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,880
You don't have to avenge me.

503
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
Besides,

504
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
Ms. Qin is still watching us.

505
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,480
Master Wei.

506
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,960
It has been a while.

507
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,240
Xifan.

508
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,080
Your gestures seem like this is
your first time training with a blade.

509
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,740
Why haven't I seen you use one?

510
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,220
Blades don't suit me well.

511
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,740
Why do you suddenly want
to practice swordplay?

512
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,280
I saw the fake Ruyu's swordplay,

513
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,020
so I practiced it from memory.

514
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,080
That woman was an imposter

515
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,560
and she was highly skilled.

516
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,220
Her whereabouts are unknown.

517
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,440
Xifan.

518
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,000
Aren't you curious about her identity?

519
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,040
Qin family's Sun Streamer Swordplay.

520
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,520
Although that young lady
isn't at the highest level,

521
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,720
judging by her skills,

522
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,320
she would have to be Ms. Qin
to get to that standard.

523
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,720
I can't be wrong about it.

524
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,200
Ms. Qin?

525
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,960
We're in trouble.

526
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,040
Chan State is remotely located.

527
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,360
There aren't many
martial arts practitioners.

528
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,890
Please forgive us, Ms. Qin.

529
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,760
Ling Ziyan.

530
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,520
What's the punishment
for withholding military information?

531
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,600
The general has given orders

532
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,280
that anyone who withholds
military information

533
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,810
is to be beheaded in public.

534
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,240
Ms. Qin, please spare me!

535
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,600
I still have a young son to raise.

536
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,090
I'm willing to make it up to you
at whatever the price.

537
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,840
Master Wei.

538
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,050
You should thank Shanhai Gang.

539
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
If it weren't that they have planted
a mole in Chan State,

540
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,520
I wouldn't ask for your assistance.

541
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,650
By now, you should have been executed.

542
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,240
Shanhai Gang?

543
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
This man was in a mask.

544
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,560
He is extremely skilled in martial arts.

545
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,360
I suspect that the purpose
of the man from Shanhai Gang

546
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,960
who infiltrated Fengling Gang,

547
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,440
is to meet up with him here.

548
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,680
Before I find him,

549
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,320
I won't leave Chan State.

550
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,320
[Three years ago]

551
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,280
Lu Ping. Stop trying.

552
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
Su Tang.

553
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,970
I managed to sneak out
some souls power again.

554
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,570
It doesn't work.

555
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,120
It's not enough.

556
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,409
Since a crack was made
in my Soul Confinement,

557
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,400
the more I suffocate and suffer,

558
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,690
the more souls power I get to sneak out.

559
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,719
As long as I practice every day,

560
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,159
I'll get enough power.

561
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,170
You'll die from the pain first.

562
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,489
Fleeing for my life every day
like an invalid?

563
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,179
How is that any different from dying?

564
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,480
[No...]

565
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,040
[If I don't break off
my Soul Confinement,]

566
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,969
[I can never defeat Shanhai Gang.]

567
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,520
[The souls power he sneaks out each time]

568
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,780
[last only until a joss stick burns out.]

569
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,560
Lu Ping.

570
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,600
[Lu Ping.]

571
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,920
Lu Ping.

572
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,720
Lu Ping!

573
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,680
Lu Ping!

574
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
Lu Ping, wake up!

575
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,000
Lu Ping, you have woken up.

576
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,040
Sit up.

577
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,200
Sit up.

578
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,600
Lu Ping!

579
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,560
Lu Ping.

580
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Are you all right?

581
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,920
What were you doing?

582
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,040
Xifan.

583
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,340
Why were you so close to me?

584
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,120
You kept diving in while you were chained.

585
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Do you want to die?

586
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,880
I came to take a bath.

587
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,720
What rule did I violate this time?

588
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,520
Take a bath?

589
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
You're taking a bath chained?

590
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,250
Is it fun to joke around with your life?

591
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,410
Xifan, since you care so much about me,

592
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,680
fine.

593
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,730
You saved my life after all,

594
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,320
so you get to slap me.

595
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,000
Lu Ping.

596
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,880
Are you done fooling around?

597
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,640
No one should take life for granted.

598
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
As long as I'm in Zhaifeng Institute,

599
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,880
I won't allow that to happen.

600
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,000
Lu Ping.

601
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,220
Lu Ping, are you all right?

602
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,850
What's the matter with him?

603
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Xifan.

604
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,300
-What's wrong with you?
-Master.

605
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,680
What have you done again

606
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,180
that nearly killed all the fishes
in my pond at the back of the hill?

607
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,280
Lu Ping, he...

608
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,120
When you saved him back then,

609
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,330
do you know of his identity?

610
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,400
What identity can he have?

611
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,480
He's just a starving beggar
who was dying of hunger,

612
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,840
so I brought him back.

613
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,000
I felt bad for him.

614
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,600
Who knew?

615
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,980
Zhaifeng Institute's whole fortune
is nearly used up.

616
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,120
He's always such a scum.

617
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,620
Don't hold it against him.

618
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,100
I didn't blame him.

619
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,960
I blame myself.

620
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,680
Master.

621
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,520
Master.

622
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,840
You're too nervous.

623
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,600
Have a drink.

624
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,080
Relax.

625
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,280
Master.

626
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,200
It's against the rules
to drink in the day.

627
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,730
You should also drink less.

628
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,000
The money you spend on alcohol

629
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,040
is enough to repair our walls three times.

630
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,200
Xifan.

631
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,640
Although we don't look
into people's true identities here,

632
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,800
I can very well guess

633
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,640
that you've concealed your true identity.

634
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,040
You even practiced
the soul of Sound midway.

635
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,770
It wasn't your original skill.

636
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,880
You've been in Zhaifeng Institute
for so long

637
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,340
and you still can't relax?

638
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,680
Don't bear the weight of everyone's life

639
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,360
on your shoulders.

640
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Master.

641
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,890
Back then,
if I didn't take a risk recklessly,

642
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,420
I wouldn't have gotten my friend killed.

643
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,570
Since I owe him his life,

644
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,240
I should repay the debt.

645
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,440
Then you should be a good disciple.

646
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,720
Xifan.

647
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Bear this in mind.

648
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,960
Wearing the badge
of the eldest disciple means

649
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,760
that the entire Zhaifeng Institute,

650
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,290
including me, your master,

651
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
look to you for our future.

652
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,640
Hold it.

653
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,980
Let's have a serious talk.

654
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,000
It's not very safe out there recently.

655
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,160
There are searches going on.

656
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,200
I suspect that some murderous thief

657
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,480
might have come here.

658
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,660
Therefore, I need to head to Kaifeng.

659
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,600
While I am away,

660
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,160
Zhaifeng Institute
has to be closed to the public.

661
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,680
All disciples are banned
from leaving the premises.

662
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,480
You...

663
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,840
Keep a close eye on those rascals.

664
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,970
Especially Lu Ping.

665
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,250
Don't let him get into any trouble.

666
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,920
Master.

667
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,380
You're going to visit
your old friend again?

668
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,560
You rascal!

669
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,040
How can you joke about this?

670
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,000
Master.

671
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,840
Forgive me for being honest with you.

672
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,720
Your old friend's temper is really...

673
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,120
Special.

674
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,250
You always get bruised all over

675
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,880
whenever you're there.

676
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,840
Why do you still visit every year?

677
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,720
Kid.

678
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,800
You won't understand.

679
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,320
I'm also atoning for my sins.

680
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,480
Miss.

681
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,160
We've been searching
for four to five days.

682
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,480
The entire Chan State

683
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,240
and dozens of towns around it

684
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,050
were all searched thoroughly.

685
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,240
There is no one

686
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,980
that meets your description.

687
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,360
Forget it.

688
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,360
Tell the guards of Wei family to get back.

689
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,080
If we keep searching so indiscreetly,

690
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,880
I'm afraid I'll alert the enemy.

691
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,240
What should we do?

692
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,100
Should we keep searching?

693
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,320
Keep going.

694
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,520
Why not?

695
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,780
But we're not going to look
for a needle in the haystack.

696
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,160
What's your opinion, Mr. Wei?

697
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,400
Sangsang, don't be so distant.

698
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,720
You can call me Tianqi.

699
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,720
Tianqi, what's your opinion?

700
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,240
Mr. Changli once said,

701
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,080
"Every skill and profession
has its specialties."

702
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,400
Since we're tracking someone down,

703
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,480
we'll need specific professionals

704
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,520
in that field.

705
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,330
How should we find
such a specific professional?

706
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,720
I've already put up posters in the city.

707
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,960
There are wanted posters
of my "Wanted Intellectuals"

708
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,480
in the entire Chan State.

709
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,720
From the east to the west,

710
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,800
there's no fear
that the gifted won't notice it.

711
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,840
Sangsang.

712
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,520
Just stay in comfortably

713
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,100
and await the arrival
of the professionals.

714
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
Mr. Wei is really...

715
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,960
creative.

716
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,920
[Sangsang.]

717
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,360
[Just you wait and see.]

718
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,620
[I'll definitely seek out that person.]

719
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Miss.

720
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,320
Mr. Wei said he has posted wanted posters

721
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,440
from the east to the west of the city.

722
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,320
Perhaps,

723
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,460
offering a reward might really work?

724
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,480
Wei Tianqi is fooling around.

725
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,080
Are you going to follow suit?

726
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,400
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,640
Who is it?

728
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,840
Please spare me, heroine.

729
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,760
I am Mo Lin.

730
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,560
I came here because of the poster.
