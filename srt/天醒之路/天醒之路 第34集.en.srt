00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,820
The Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 34

4
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,720
Qin Sang.

5
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,640
Qin Sang.

6
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
You are not qualified to mention her name.

7
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
If she doesn’t care about me,

8
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,520
she won’t curse me while

9
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,240
asking you to protect me.

10
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,160
All she thinks is you.

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,000
But what did you do for her?

12
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
If it weren’t for you,

13
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,240
General Qin wouldn’t die.

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Had it not been for you,

15
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,880
Princess wouldn’t put herself in danger.

16
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,320
I should have you killed in Kaifeng

17
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,040
if I had known it.

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,880
You deserve dying for

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
what you have done.

20
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,080
Why don’t you kill me?

21
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,320
We only kill enemies.

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,329
We don’t kill innocent people.

23
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,730
I will not let your blood

24
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,640
ruin our reputation.

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,930
You are really a soldier following Qin Qi.

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Tell me.

27
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,810
What did Princess ask you to do?

28
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
She asked me

29
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,640
to escort you to Big Dipper at night

30
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,440
and stop you from coming back.

31
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,640
She is putting fine timber to petty use.

32
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,640
You know you are petty.

33
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,680
I should stay with Princess

34
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,240
to fight against Shanhai Gang.

35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,960
But now.

36
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,170
What did you say?

37
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,579
Qin Sang is framing Shanhai Gang?

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,079
Yes.

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,540
She would not have been a princess

40
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
but for the elimination of the gang.

41
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,700
She wouldn’t marry Yan Xifan.

42
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,400
Wen Rui,

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,170
you are worried about Qin Sang.

44
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,090
What about letting me go

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,180
and we are going to find her together?

46
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,600
No.

47
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,680
I must obey the military order.

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,580
Otherwise,

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
I can’t fulfill my responsibility later.

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,950
You are silly.

51
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,200
She is pushing me away.

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,260
It proves that she is in great danger.

53
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,080
If we don’t come for help,

54
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
you wouldn’t see her again

55
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,960
in case she got killed.

56
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Wen Rui,

57
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,080
I beg you.

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,640
How can we let

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,600
a girl to fight

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,930
against the enemy while

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
staying back ourselves?

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,400
Hurry up.

63
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,960
Arrows.

64
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,320
Lu Ping.

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,440
Stop.

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,159
Princess.

67
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,360
What?

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,320
Yan Qiuci left the manor at dusk.

69
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
He just came back.

70
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
We saw Ling Ziyan in the manor.

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,320
She was packing up.

72
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,730
She seemed to leave.

73
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,480
OK.

74
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
Ziyan was always in Wuji Manor.

75
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,680
I have to bet on

76
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,200
his love for me.

77
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,640
Ziyan.

78
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,280
Miss.

79
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
I will wait for you

80
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,690
at midnight outside the manor.

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,760
I will be with you

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,880
wherever you go.

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,840
Ziyan,

84
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,360
can you stay?

85
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Why?

86
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,920
Why don’t you let me go?

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
Lu Ping and Xifan.

88
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,560
Why do you always take

89
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
my only precious easily?

90
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,000
Why do you always stand in front of me?

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,600
If it is for Xifan,

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
you can’t go either.

93
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I didn’t know that

94
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,640
you loved each other.

95
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,720
I didn’t imagine that I would meet you here.

96
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,400
I have to obey the marriage

97
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,730
offered by his majesty.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,040
But I aim to kill Liu Song

99
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,780
and destroy the seal in Thousand Pine Ruler.

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,480
So what?

101
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,040
Ziyan,

102
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,560
we didn’t treat you well.

103
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,409
But I hope you can think of the country.

104
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,920
Please hold it back.

105
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
If we succeed,

106
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,400
I will marry you to Xifan.

107
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,540
What about your

108
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,680
own reputation?

109
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,410
It is Xining Princess who marries.

110
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,180
No one knows if she is Qin Sang.

111
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,160
You can be her.

112
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,370
You are really upright.

113
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,920
I can hardly match you.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Ziyan.

115
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,240
Princess is also here.

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,030
Go.

117
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,669
He hopes to answer you.

118
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,380
[Wuji Manor]

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,250
Younger master.

120
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,890
Before Lu Ping left,

121
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,120
he asked me to be more brave

122
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
and follow my heart.

123
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,520
But I have something to do.

124
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,680
I have to help my father in Wuji Manor.

125
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,240
I have to cooperate with others against Shanhai Gang.

126
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,000
Lu Ping is an enemy of the gang.

127
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,770
He needs company

128
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,600
in the battle.

129
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
So you want to go

130
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,930
but you have to stay.

131
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,730
I promise you that after the

132
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,760
war against the gang,

133
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,200
I will marry you.

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,560
You haven’t asked me.

135
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,080
You are so impulsive.

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,520
I…

137
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,240
Ziyan,

138
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,600
I was too impulsive.

139
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,880
If you stay,

140
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,240
I will stay.

141
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,960
I know your ambition

142
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,160
and your goal.

143
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,360
I know that Miss would make it hard for you.

144
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,320
I can’t escape.

145
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,400
I will fight together with you

146
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,960
with all my strength.

147
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,050
I will be with you with dignity.

148
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,920
That is the meaning of my life.

149
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,240
And other…

150
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I will take care of the other things.

151
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
Ziyan,

152
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,720
thank you.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Lu Ping,

154
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,120
I didn’t let you down.

155
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,840
Princess.

156
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,360
What’s up?

157
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,480
We were attacked by people from Shanhai Gang.

158
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,720
Lu Ping…

159
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
What happened to him?

160
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,240
Where is he?

161
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,200
He is missing.

162
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,440
We have searched nearby

163
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,120
but we failed to find him.

164
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
It is my fault.

165
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,120
Lu Ping.

166
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,040
Lu Ping.

167
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,640
Lu Ping.

168
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,840
Where are you?

169
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,760
Lu Ping.

170
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,600
Lu Ping.

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,880
Lu Ping.

172
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Lu Ping.

173
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,920
Lu Ping.

174
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,520
It is my fault.

175
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Please punish me.

176
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,760
Search.

177
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,090
Let all the soldiers to search for him.

178
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,200
Princess.

179
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,240
We are here for the gang.

180
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
Now that they have appeared,

181
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,960
we should discuss with

182
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,840
Master Yan as soon as possible.

183
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,960
Then will I just let Lu Ping die?

184
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
I am a person.

185
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
I can’t be selfless now.

186
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
Leave a team of soldiers for searching.

187
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Others go back to the manor.

188
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Yes.

189
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,240
Do you know you would be beheaded?

190
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,720
Am I afraid of dying now?

191
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
It is just the glory of Qin Family.

192
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,720
I can help you, too.

193
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,000
Lu Ping.

194
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
Are you alive or dead?

195
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,160
Where are you?

196
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,980
[Wuji Manor]

197
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,040
You stayed up all night.

198
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,280
Have a rest.

199
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,490
Miss is searching for Lu Ping by all means.

200
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
Longjie Army isn’t familiar with the place.

201
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,840
I can serve as a guide.

202
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,080
I am responsible for it, too.

203
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,120
If I went together,

204
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,240
he would not be missing.

205
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,680
I just don’t understand.

206
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,120
How did Shanhai Gang sneaked into

207
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,640
and despite of the defense of the manor?

208
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,720
They are now trying to

209
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,240
break the Thousand Pine Ruler.

210
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,200
Why did they capture Lu Ping?

211
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
It is really strange.

212
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
Ziyan.

213
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,240
Please check the forest nearby.

214
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,480
I will search the lake where he disappeared.

215
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,010
Maybe I will find some clue.

216
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,260
[Wuji]

217
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,720
Princess.

218
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,340
Master Yan.

219
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,210
It has been a night since

220
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,080
Longjie Army was attacked and Lu Ping disappeared.

221
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,610
Shouldn’t we do something?

222
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,100
I have checked.

223
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,000
It is a blessing day after seven days.

224
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
We will hold the wedding on that day.

225
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,480
Master Yan.

226
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,560
I am not talking about the wedding

227
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,600
but Shanhai Gang.

228
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,000
The marriage is offered by his majesty.

229
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,000
We have sent the invitations.

230
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,960
How can it be canceled?

231
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,800
Are you checkmating me now?

232
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I dare not.

233
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,470
The wedding is a fake one.

234
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,280
Please give me Lyu Chenfeng soon.

235
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,520
His majesty ordered that…

236
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,400
Princess,

237
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,349
it is Wuji Manor here,

238
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,400
not Kaifeng.

239
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
I know how to do it better than you.

240
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,240
A Ze,

241
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,020
escort the Princess back.

242
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,060
Get prepared for the wedding.

243
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,760
Yes.

244
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,070
Princess.

245
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,900
Please.

246
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,160
The manor is strange.

247
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,970
We’d better be careful.

248
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,680
Have you made an agreement with Master Yan?

249
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,480
They have defended the manor well.

250
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,380
We can’t send message out.

251
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,320
We can neither organize our men.

252
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,930
Don’t you think that we have been imprisoned?

253
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
You mean…

254
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
Yan Qiuci delayed the wedding

255
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,720
as well we delayed the attack

256
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,980
towards Shanhai Gang.

257
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,560
He didn’t let me meet Lyu Chenfeng.

258
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,800
Why did he do that?

259
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Princess.

260
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,560
I found a thing by the lake

261
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,020
which I have to report.

262
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,060
Please have a look.

263
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
An eagle feather of iron?

264
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,720
Yes.

265
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,620
I learned from the general

266
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,800
and put my Force of Color into my arrows.

267
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,330
They can be extremely fast.

268
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
This is the arrow I shot

269
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,800
when I was attacked that day.

270
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,880
The one who broke it must be

271
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
learning Force of Color.

272
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,520
He may be more powerful than you.

273
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,000
I have fought with Shanhai Gang several times.

274
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,920
They used strange weapons like silver hooks.

275
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,720
But yesterday, those people used

276
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,480
swords.

277
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Do you mean they are from Wuji Manor?

278
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,680
Impossible.

279
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,520
You eavesdrop even at your home.

280
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,960
Qin Sang.

281
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,520
You persuaded Ziyan to stay.

282
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
You took Lu Ping and made him missing.

283
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,840
Now you suspect my father.

284
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,980
Do you cooperate with people in this way?

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
What are you doing?

286
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,840
We don’t fight with our companions.

287
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,440
We only prove it by evidence.

288
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,880
Don’t you want to end it fast

289
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,200
and be with Ziyan?

290
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,640
We have come to the manor for two days

291
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
and your father is delaying all the time.

292
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,700
Lu Ping is missing.

293
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,960
He is still delaying.

294
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,040
Didn’t you think why he did that?

295
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,640
Since the first year of Shuo,

296
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,400
my father has protected

297
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
the border in Jin.

298
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,160
It is important.

299
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,980
He has to think deeper than you and me.

300
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Younger master,

301
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
do you know that your father

302
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,600
hid an important person

303
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,120
from me all the time?

304
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,980
Do you know what your father is doing?

305
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,760
He tells you nothing.

306
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,920
Do you know why?

307
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,500
Important person?

308
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,810
What important person?

309
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,640
The Seven of Big Dipper,

310
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,210
including your father,

311
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,840
are famous for their power

312
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,400
except for one.

313
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,920
Do you mean the last Master of Tianquan Peak.

314
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,920
Lyu Chenfeng?

315
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,080
Yes.

316
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,680
Lyu Chenfeng.

317
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,600
I know that he isn’t good at martial arts

318
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,920
but at forging machines and weapons.

319
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,000
But he travelled around Jianghu

320
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,170
after the Event of Seven Stars.

321
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,600
No one knows where he is.

322
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,760
He is here.

323
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,160
Your father didn’t tell you.

324
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,160
Liu Song got Thousand Pine Ruler

325
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,000
but he couldn’t break the lock

326
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
and take the seal.

327
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,440
The aim of his majesty

328
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,090
is to get Liu Song using Lyu Chenfeng as a bait.

329
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,920
We can destroy Liu Song and the seal.

330
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,690
I have left home for several years.

331
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,850
I am not familiar with the things here.

332
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,880
Father is sensible not to

333
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,680
tell me such

334
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,240
important information.

335
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,600
Qin Sang,

336
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,280
we are friends who

337
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,120
went through the convention together.

338
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,160
We should believe our friends

339
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,720
at such times.

340
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,730
We can’t suspect ourselves

341
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,520
before defeating Shanhai Gang.

342
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,280
You believe your father.

343
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,680
And I don’t have to force you to suspect.

344
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,160
Please decide on yourself.

345
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,840
I will not ask you to stay.

346
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,160
Princess.

347
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,360
Mr. Yan is from Wuji Manor.

348
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,010
We can’t believe in him.

349
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,000
How did you tell him such secrets?

350
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,760
Xifan is a good example of

351
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,640
filial piety but he is not silly.

352
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,170
I made him angry on purpose.

353
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,560
I hope he can investigate it.

354
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,840
I wish I thought too much.

355
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,200
What should we do?

356
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,720
Shall we just wait?

357
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,000
You go first.

358
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,680
I want to be alone.

359
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,000
Yes.

360
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,200
Lu Ping.

361
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,920
Where are you?

362
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,560
Elder.

363
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,080
Where am I?

364
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Why is there a prison under the lake?

365
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,240
Did you know the direction of the tide

366
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,280
and that we can only swim in

367
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,520
not out?

368
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,690
I am speaking to you.

369
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,210
I am speaking to you.

370
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,180
Can you hear me?

371
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,760
What are you doing?

372
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Are you insane?

373
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,200
You have white hair.

374
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
I will call you Old White.

375
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,480
Old White,

376
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,480
how long have you been here?

377
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,200
One year?

378
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,160
Three years?

379
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,520
Draw the line.

380
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,040
I have to draw the line.

381
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,760
If one line means one day,

382
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,720
you have really been here for long.

383
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,160
Let me out.

384
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,560
Let me out.

385
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
Who are you?

386
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
You are still eating.

387
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,960
Are you happy here?

388
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,660
I’m hungry.

389
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,400
I am eating.

390
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,460
What are you doing?

391
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,930
It is my valuable thing. Don’t ruin it.

392
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,040
You have Force of Air.

393
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,360
The…the Horn

394
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
has been updated.

395
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,800
You know it?

396
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,280
The Horn.

397
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,090
Eldest brother.

398
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,810
Eldest brother.

399
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,490
Eldest brother.

400
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,260
I am much younger than you.

401
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,880
Would you like to be my younger brother?

402
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,480
It’s you, right?

403
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
You are alive.

404
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,320
Are you here?

405
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,680
Lu Ping.

406
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,240
It’s her.

407
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
She is nearby.

408
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,680
Old White.

409
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,240
Well done.

410
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,080
Lu Ping.

411
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,480
You are here.

412
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,040
Wait for me.

413
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,210
I will ask for help from Wuji Manor.

414
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,760
Princess.

415
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,400
Don’t blame me.

416
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,720
You are

417
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,600
too clever.

418
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Is there any news?

419
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,240
I have searched for nearby places

420
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,080
besides the search of Longjie Army and Master Yan.

421
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
We can’t find Lu Ping.

422
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,520
I have to discuss with father

423
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,800
in person about something.

424
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Father.

425
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,760
Have a look.

426
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
Is it reliable?

427
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
Yes.

428
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,600
They disguised as business mission

429
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,320
and marched to Wuji Manor.

430
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,600
I have arranged it.

431
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,010
We set off tomorrow.

432
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,600
Tell others that I am preparing for the wedding.

433
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,020
Remember not to

434
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,840
let anyone discover the truth.

435
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,240
What about young master?

436
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,200
I said,

437
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,040
anyone.

438
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,960
Yes.

439
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,360
What do you think?

440
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Qin Sang is right.

441
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,520
Shanhai Gang may send skilled people here.

442
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,120
But only father can

443
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,280
make such arrangements

444
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,400
in Wuji Manor.

445
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
What is he hiding?

446
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,480
I don’t know.

447
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,680
But I would rather believe that he has his plan.

448
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,960
I only hope Lu Ping

449
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,400
was not caught by Shanhai Gang.

450
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,040
Master.

451
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,120
Younger master has gone.

452
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
He is still young.

453
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,760
Princess Xining must

454
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,760
have told him something.

455
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,400
He is suspecting.

456
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,920
Never mind.

457
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,560
I will make him not related to

458
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,880
the things in the eyes of others.

459
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,120
When he inherit Wuji Manor,

460
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,480
he will understand me.

461
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,280
I imprison Qin Sang

462
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
in the water prison temporarily.

463
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,280
Isn’t it dangerous?

464
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,010
The prison is hard to break.

465
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,840
Lyu has been insane for years.

466
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,920
We just leave them there.

467
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,960
She and Lu Ping love each other.

468
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,699
Let’s leave the miserable couple

469
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,150
there to suffer.

470
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,080
Qin Sang. Qin Sang.

471
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,639
I’m sorry.

472
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,520
I do this for saving you.

473
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,850
Qin Sang.

474
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,800
Great. You wake up.

475
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,280
Great.

476
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,760
Great.

477
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,850
How dare you?

478
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,400
Are you coming to save me?

479
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,960
You miss me.

480
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,800
Impossible.

481
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,720
Then why are your ears red?

482
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,240
You still keep it.

483
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,560
When can you stop

484
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,160
stealing things from others?

485
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,360
You are also lying

486
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,840
to yourself.

487
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,240
It is related to life.

488
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Don’t be kidding.

489
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,200
Where are we?

490
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,820
Under the lake.

491
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,320
How is there such a place under the lake?

492
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
How did you come here?

493
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
I had nowhere to go

494
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
but to jump into the lake.

495
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,120
I thought of swimming out

496
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,960
but I almost got drowned.

497
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,720
Can’t you fight?

498
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,090
The drugs you gave me

499
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,650
can prison a horse to death.

500
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,840
It was good for me to get out alive.

501
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,360
You deserve it.

502
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,400
But for it,

503
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,680
I would not know that

504
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,340
you sent Wen Rui to protect me.

505
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,760
I don’t want to see you again.

506
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,340
Don’t bother me again.

507
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,680
You came at last.

508
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,200
By the way,

509
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,240
if you came first,

510
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,850
you would be afraid.

511
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,920
You…

512
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,920
Have you recognized the person attacking you?

513
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
He was in the uniform of Shanhai Gang

514
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,060
but he wasn’t like one.

515
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,920
Why do you ask?

516
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,530
I was also attacked from the back
and then jumped into the water.

517
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,400
Master.

518
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,360
They are here.

519
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,400
Ask our disciples to be prepared.

520
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,080
Yes.

521
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,840
Father hid it from me and Qin Sang

522
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
to rob people.

523
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,720
Stop.

524
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,800
Stop.

525
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,280
You…

526
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,880
Who are you?

527
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,640
We are from Wuji Manor.

528
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,760
I’m sorry.

529
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
This…This…

530
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,620
Search.

531
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,200
Yes.

532
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,760
Don’t.

533
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,340
Don’t move.

534
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,480
Father.

535
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,890
When did you know

536
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,450
about Thousand Pine Ruler?

537
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,280
Why did you hide it from me?

538
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
Qin Sang was right.

539
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,400
She told the secret order

540
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,000
of his majesty to you.

541
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,840
Is Lyu Chenfeng in Wuji Manor?

542
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,520
Yes.

543
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,890
Eldest brother and sister-in-law

544
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,720
died in the Event of Seven Stars.

545
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,680
Chenfeng was ordered by brother

546
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,960
to seal Liu Song’s Commander’s seal

547
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,960
in the ruler.

548
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
But he lost his mind

549
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,600
and was frightened that day.

550
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,800
I was worried about him

551
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,800
so I keep him here.

552
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,280
Do you blame me?

553
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,040
I am just confused.

554
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,000
Why wouldn’t you cooperate with Longjie Army?

555
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,260
Why didn’t you tell me?

556
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,760
Chenfeng is my junior.

557
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
If the plan failed,

558
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,440
how can I face brother and sister-in-law?

559
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,760
Moreover,

560
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,280
you are good friend to Qin Sang and Lu Ping.

561
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,640
If I told you,

562
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,520
I would make you hard.

563
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,800
And,

564
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,240
what about you and Ziyan

565
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,360
if you get married?

566
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,960
Father.

567
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,720
I…

568
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,080
I delayed the cooperation with Qin Sang

569
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,920
and lured Shanhai Gang.

570
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,640
I have observed them

571
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,240
after they came to the central plains.

572
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,040
I am old.

573
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
But if it weren’t for you today,

574
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,120
I would have failed.

575
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,370
What about Qin Sang and Lu Ping?

576
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,820
How come you were attacked

577
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
by others and jumped into the water?

578
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,840
It’s hard to say.

579
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,720
Let’s get out first.

580
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,560
Brother.

581
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,520
Brother.

582
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,520
Brother.

583
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,930
Don’t be afraid.

584
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,760
Who is he?

585
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,000
Old White.

586
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,820
He’s also a poor guy imprisoned here.

587
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,580
Unfortunately, he is insane.

588
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,960
He remembered nothing

589
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,640
in the past more than ten years.

590
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,170
Old White forged iron here.

591
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,660
He changed the direction of the water

592
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,140
so that I could come in.

593
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,520
Don’t bother.

594
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,940
We can’t go out.

595
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,210
I don’t believe.

596
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,960
The sword…

597
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
is a waste.

598
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,800
Mine is good.

599
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,480
Yes, yours is good.

600
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
He can make swords

601
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,380
and calls you brother.

602
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,200
He has been here for more than ten years.

603
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,440
Isn’t he…

604
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,730
Lu Ping, what’s wrong with you?

605
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,480
Mo Lin left me some drugs

606
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,560
which will be rejected by my body

607
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,560
if I am poisoned.

608
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,060
It’s dirty.

609
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,680
Snowy weed.

610
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,640
Do you know it?

611
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,280
That’s OK.

612
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,140
It just causes stomachache.

613
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,600
You will be OK in a few days.

614
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,360
It is not fatal.

615
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,560
If we want to stop those

616
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,240
who know the secret from telling it out,

617
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,640
we will give them the weed

618
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,520
in case it is not appropriate to kill them.

619
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,280
They will lose their mind if taking it for long.

620
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,040
They will forget their past.

621
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,200
Even forget who they are.

622
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,960
I have eaten

623
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,000
the food served

624
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,490
to Old White since I have been here.

625
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,680
If I am right,

626
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,000
he is

627
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,240
Lyu Chenfeng.

628
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,520
What?

629
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,820
He is Lyu Chenfeng, Master of Tianquan Peak.

630
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,520
He is the reason

631
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,360
why I came to Wuji Manor.
