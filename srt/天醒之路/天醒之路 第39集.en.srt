2
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,820
Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 39

4
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,270
Go.

5
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,890
Tell your master that I want to see him.

6
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,110
Master. She has evil designs.

7
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,310
I am afraid…

8
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,950
I want to talk to Chu Min. Leave us.

9
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,829
Yes.

10
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,550
Ice Chrysanthemum Wine is

11
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,250
our favorite in Big Dipper.

12
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,160
Guo Youdao and I went down the mountain to practice.

13
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,710
I received the news at the critical moment of

14
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,920
breaking through the use of five forces.

15
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,550
I was too late when I went back.

16
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,430
I thought you were dead.

17
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,910
I was so sad

18
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,310
that I dropped from five forces to three forces.

19
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,149
I am no longer

20
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,150
the talented senior.

21
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,920
Guo Youdao was afraid that
I would recall old memories at familiar sights.

22
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,590
He sent me to Tianzhao.

23
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,550
I didn’t remember

24
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,850
the days after that.

25
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,590
I seem to be getting drunk every day.

26
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,750
I haven’t been sober.

27
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,140
If you feel better when you’re drunk,

28
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,950
you can get drunk here in Shanhai Gang.

29
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,510
I was drunk

30
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,990
so I could dream back to Big Dipper.

31
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,790
Song.

32
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,370
Don’t you want to go back to Big Dipper?

33
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,070
Song.

34
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,110
When I was drunk,

35
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,990
I hoped you were not dead.

36
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
The words you didn’t say to me

37
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,950
before I went down the mountain.

38
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,990
Now I say it for you.

39
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,230
Can we go back together?

40
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,080
Stay in Shanhai Gang with me.

41
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,490
Accompany me to see the ending of Zhai.

42
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,070
I will treat you well.

43
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,110
Guo Youdao was right.

44
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,990
We’ve been apart for so long

45
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,230
that no one can turn back.

46
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,150
I’ve been drunk for nineteen years.

47
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,430
I have to wake up now.

48
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,350
Master.

49
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,790
I have some words to share with you

50
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,350
before I die.

51
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,210
I don’t want to call you master all my life.

52
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,150
Actually, I want to…

53
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,430
I want…

54
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,910
Master, you’ve escaped.

55
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,870
Move.

56
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
Su Tang, I haven’t finished my words.

57
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,320
You can’t die that early.

58
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,990
Save your words.

59
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,240
Take this.

60
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
You take the Thousand Pine Ruler,

61
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,080
steal a carriage and wait for me.

62
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,040
How about my brother?

63
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,510
I am going to save him.

64
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,070
Let’s go.

65
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,030
Master.

66
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,610
Brother.

67
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,910
Brother.

68
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Are you all right?

69
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,830
Master. Don’t cry.

70
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,420
Let’s get to the real work.

71
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,680
Yan Jin has gone out to escort the mission of Dan.

72
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,870
Let’s go now.

73
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,580
Come on.

74
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,710
Master.

75
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,070
Hurry.

76
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:23,950
Hurry.

77
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,110
Guo Youdao and I weren’t fair to you.

78
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,950
We could have found the truth out earlier.

79
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,010
But we didn’t want to

80
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,500
and we dared not to do that.

81
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,050
The misunderstanding got deeper,

82
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,350
which leads to today’s consequences.

83
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
Master Chu Min.

84
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,110
They found us.

85
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,430
Master. Let’s talk about it later.

86
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,960
In the plays I’ve seen,

87
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,230
usually it’s only said

88
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,120
before the death of a great hero.

89
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,250
Get on the carriage.

90
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,510
I can only accompany you here.

91
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Where should I go?

92
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,140
Go to Wuyou Valley.

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
You can find the truth there.

94
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
Chu Min, how dare you assassinate the master?

95
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,350
I will kill you.

96
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,830
Master.

97
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,810
You can’t deal with them alone.

98
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,350
Master.

99
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,670
Master.

100
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,350
Go.

101
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,590
I am lucky to see Chu Min,

102
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,830
the master of Yaoguang Peak,

103
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,190
regain the five forces.

104
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,670
Five forces?

105
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,040
When she left Big Dipper that day,

106
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,370
didn’t she drop from four forces to three?

107
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,350
I lost one force

108
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
because I thought Liu Song was dead.

109
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,830
I felt anxious.

110
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,310
Now Liu Song is dead in my heart.

111
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,310
I am relieved from anxiety.

112
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I don’t need the help of my disciples

113
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,470
to deal with you.

114
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,590
Come on.

115
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,100
Hya.

116
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,830
Hya.

117
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,710
Mo Lin. Go back to save the master.

118
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,470
Hurry.

119
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,310
Brother.

120
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,070
It’s no use going back now.

121
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,460
For the sake of master,

122
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,520
do not let anything happen to you.

123
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,180
Let go of me.

124
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,300
Don’t you want to save our master?

125
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,630
Be at ease.

126
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,750
I am clever.

127
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,200
I have left a code for master along the road.

128
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,390
She could find us later.

129
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,600
Sit tight.

130
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,540
Hya.

131
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,780
Hya.

132
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,650
Hya.

133
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,350
Stop.

134
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,080
Hya.

135
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,810
Stop.

136
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,180
Shanhai Gang is coming for us. Sit tight.

137
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,970
Hya.

138
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,670
Hya.

139
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,880
Hya.

140
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,670
Stop.

141
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,960
Hya.

142
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,870
Don’t run.

143
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:09,100
Hya.

144
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,130
Hya.

145
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,750
Stop.

146
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,600
Hya.

147
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,590
Hya.

148
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,270
Hya.

149
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,010
Hya.

150
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,350
Hya.

151
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,800
Whoa.

152
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,850
Brother. Are you all right?

153
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,290
Brother.

154
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,050
Our senior is coming to save us.

155
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,030
Senior.

156
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,560
Hya.

157
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,810
Why are you here?

158
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,870
I will be with you wherever you are.

159
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,910
Xifan joined the court

160
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,480
and was loyal to his majesty.

161
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,360
He just wants to be able to bring army to save me.

162
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,040
He was afraid you would hold a grudge against him.

163
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,100
So he didn’t dare to see you directly.

164
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,470
He chose to station outside the gang

165
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,950
and cover for you.

166
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,750
In fact, I think Xifan

167
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,520
is very righteous this time.

168
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,510
His father and he

169
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,620
are different.

170
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,230
You shouldn’t blame him for that thing.

171
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,850
Brother.

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,430
Xifan said that we can meet here,

173
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,470
if you want to see him again.

174
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,550
You can leave

175
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,610
if you don’t want to see him.

176
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,110
It’s up to you.

177
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,670
Master.

178
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,579
What does he mean?

179
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,300
Stay or leave?

180
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,230
Silly.

181
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,060
Can’t you see that?

182
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
There’s a chance.

183
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,720
Did I tell you to stay in manor

184
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,910
and not to risk?

185
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,230
I am not a lady who could only stay at home.

186
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,590
I have martial arts.

187
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
No matter you are in the court or Jianghu.

188
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,310
I want to stand by your side.

189
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,630
Do you want to find Lu Ping?

190
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,130
Will he go back to Kaifeng with you?

191
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,210
If you keep a thing in heart for a long time,

192
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,170
it will become a knot in your heart.

193
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,450
It’s better for us to face it now

194
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,750
than to be strangers later.

195
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,350
As for Lu Ping,

196
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,720
he could decide where to go by himself.

197
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,470
News.

198
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
Mr. Yan, General Wen.

199
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,790
The troop we sent to track down

200
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,220
the mission of Dan hasn’t reply.

201
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,020
I’m afraid something happened.

202
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,770
General Wen.

203
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,160
To avoid any problems,

204
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,400
you stay here with others.

205
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Do not act rashly.

206
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,400
I will go and have a look.

207
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,460
Xifan. Be careful.

208
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I will go with you.

209
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,110
How did they die?

210
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
The wounds of the Army and the mission are similar.

211
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
They were killed by the same person.

212
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,010
The box is empty.

213
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,590
What were they carrying?

214
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,030
He could use five forces.

215
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,160
Fortunately, his forces are

216
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,070
extremely unstable.

217
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,860
He is the master of Fengling Gang.

218
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
He can only use three forces before.

219
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,040
How can he use five forces

220
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,270
in such a short time?

221
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,670
Xifan.

222
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,950
What can we do?

223
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,950
Shall we meet Lu Ping?

224
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Dan is not better than Shuo in military power.

225
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,030
Shanhai Gang is just a sect

226
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,270
even if it is powerful.

227
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,270
With Lu Ping,

228
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,550
they just have one more awakening.

229
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,070
Can they conquer the army

230
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,150
and change the situation

231
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,710
with just a man?

232
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,830
That’s the reason why

233
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,440
they want to get Lu Ping back.

234
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,790
He would feel guilty

235
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,590
if he knew it.

236
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,100
He would get in deeper.

237
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,490
It’s about the fate of Shuo.

238
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,660
We have to go back to Kaifeng as soon as possible.

239
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,030
Brother.

240
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,550
He dares not to meet me at last.

241
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,110
Master.

242
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,070
Maybe senior was delayed by something.

243
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,020
His injury is serious now.

244
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,710
Let’s go to Wuyou Valley now.

245
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,310
How about Xifan?

246
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,480
Actually, I already have

247
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,190
given the map to him.

248
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,710
Let’s go.

249
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
You used the Force of Spirit on me.

250
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,270
You were really tough

251
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,740
when you made up your mind.

252
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,190
But I was betrayed once.

253
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,980
There is no second chance.

254
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,470
Master.

255
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,990
Lu Ping and Yan Xifan have gone

256
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,630
as your plan.

257
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,950
You let me steal the Thousand Pine Ruler,

258
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,250
and save Lu Ping.

259
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,550
It was in your plan.

260
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,520
How far do you think Lu Ping can escape?

261
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,120
I will get

262
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,040
his force of awakening.

263
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,750
I’ll upset him wherever he goes.

264
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,350
Stop.

265
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,430
Boss. Why stop suddenly?

266
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,790
It won’t be far away.

267
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,170
I want to take a walk.

268
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,470
Master.

269
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,390
He didn’t seem to talk much

270
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,830
along the way.

271
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,180
He won’t be thinking about that, will he?

272
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,070
I am not a good master.

273
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,390
I don’t know the answer

274
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:02,110
to some of your questions.

275
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,750
I know the answers

276
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,790
to some of them,

277
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,230
but I can’t go into them.

278
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,990
Zhai destroyed my country,

279
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,320
and disordered Big Dipper.

280
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,150
This hatred must be avenged.

281
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,110
If Big Dipper is used by Zhai,

282
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I am no longer a member of Big Dipper.

283
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,710
Brother. Forget it.

284
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
When Master Mo unties your Force of Spirit Lock,

285
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,510
it is all over.

286
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,030
Is it?

287
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,800
Do you think Guo Youdao and Chu Min

288
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,870
haven’t noticed?

289
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,230
They were cheating you to protect Yan Qiuci.

290
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,030
You and I are the same.

291
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,110
Master.

292
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
The sixth lock of boss seems to be breaking.

293
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,810
Brother.

294
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,180
If you want him to live,

295
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,830
get him into the valley.

296
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,880
Isn’t it good to untie the Force of Spirit Lock?

297
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,350
Why does he look like he’s going to die?

298
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,230
Brother.

299
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,830
Don’t think too much about the past.

300
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,550
The enemy killed my family.

301
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,760
How could I not think about it?

302
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,110
Your parents begged me to tie

303
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,110
the Force of Spirit Lock on you.

304
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,030
They hoped you could live a good life.

305
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,960
They didn’t want you to be indulged in hatred

306
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,710
and die.

307
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,090
What do you mean, Master Mo?

308
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,830
Your parents saved me once.

309
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,670
I owed them that.

310
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,670
So I made a promise that

311
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,270
I’d pay them back in my lifetime.

312
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,110
One day.

313
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,990
They came to Wuyou Valley with a baby.

314
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,430
That was you who were dying.

315
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,630
Why was he dying?

316
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,050
Ordinary people can’t bear

317
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,430
the power of six forces.

318
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,510
You gained one force

319
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,670
every month.

320
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,610
Your whole body would burst and die

321
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,550
when you gained six forces.

322
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,310
You can lock the six forces

323
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,120
only with the Force of Spirit Lock.

324
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,270
Only in this way could you live.

325
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,830
The lock is to

326
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,950
save my life.

327
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,830
It’s not easy to tie the locks up.

328
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,750
In order to save you,

329
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,060
they’d rather spend the skills of half their lives.

330
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,190
But you only wanted to untie the locks.

331
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,630
Father.

332
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,830
If the boss didn’t untie the locks,

333
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,720
he won’t live to this day.

334
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,790
I don’t care about your mess.

335
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,110
Now you’ve untied five locks,

336
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,070
and the one left is extremely vulnerable.

337
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,000
Once your body and mind are shaken,

338
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,150
the power of force overruns,

339
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,050
and the lock will be untied.

340
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,270
You will die

341
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,070
by that time.

342
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,270
Master.

343
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,270
Is there a way to untie the lock

344
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,970
and save my brother’s life?

345
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,110
No way.

346
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,270
Am I doomed to die?

347
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,870
The Awakening has supreme force.

348
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,560
He is powerful and domineering.

349
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,350
You should have no worries

350
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,320
that you have the last Force of Spirit Lock.

351
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,070
For the sake of your parents,

352
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,270
Wuyou Valley can protect you.

353
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,990
That’s all I want to say.

354
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,060
You can decide to live or to die

355
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,270
by yourself.

356
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,070
Mo Lin.

357
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Does your father dislike my brother?

358
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,650
He didn’t want to treat him on purpose.

359
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,070
He doesn’t like

360
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,750
all the strangers.

361
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,280
But he wouldn’t leave people in the lurch.

362
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,150
He was weird this time.

363
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,710
Small tricks.

364
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,840
You’ve been an assassin for many years,

365
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,090
and you’ve only learned these skills.

366
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,710
Liar.

367
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,790
You haven’t learned anything

368
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,990
better than me.

369
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,790
When did I lie?

370
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,360
How could I become a liar?

371
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,910
Observation is the basic quality of top assassins.

372
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,960
If you encounter a disease that you can’t cure,

373
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,120
you will only study hard to find a solution.

374
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,670
You won’t say no to it.

375
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,830
Why did you lie?

376
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,750
I…

377
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,900
Father.

378
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,080
You have the solution, right?

379
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,630
Can you help Lu Ping?

380
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,190
I can’t untie it.

381
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,580
Why do you care so much?

382
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,150
Can’t you unite it

383
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,960
or are you afraid of Shanhai Gang?

384
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,390
You…

385
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,590
Father.

386
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,670
Do you know why for so many years,

387
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,870
I would rather be an assassin in Jianghu

388
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,580
than stay in the Wuyou Valley?

389
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,680
I don’t want to see you like this.

390
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,160
You have medical skill

391
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
since I was young.

392
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,160
But you never want to go out of the valley to cure others.

393
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,560
You’d rather stay here and make medicines.

394
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
You’re afraid of getting involved in troubles.

395
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
You don’t want to be a hero

396
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,360
and do something big

397
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,000
all your life.

398
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You know nothing.

399
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,310
Stay out of these.

400
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,280
You and Lu Ping

401
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,110
just stay in Wuyou Valley.

402
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,900
Don’t mess with Shanhai Gang.

403
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,440
If anything happens to him again.

404
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,350
I can’t save him. Understand?

405
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,950
I wouldn’t stay here

406
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,880
if it wasn’t for saving Lu Ping.

407
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,630
I am a hero.

408
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,870
I am not

409
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,110
as timid as you.

410
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,470
Yes.

411
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,790
My son wants to be a hero.

412
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,830
But I am a coward.

413
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,190
The old man doesn’t help

414
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,990
nor untie Lu Ping’s lock.

415
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,560
In that case,

416
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,870
how can I tell him

417
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,870
the cold toxin of Qin Sang?

418
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,200
If the boss rushes out of the valley

419
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,530
and something happens,

420
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,630
Su Tang will beat me to die.

421
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,270
Why will I beat you?

422
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,790
Master.

423
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,990
I am here to entertain you.

424
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,180
You can beat me whenever you want.

425
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,270
Well, how about the boss?

426
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,110
I asked him to have a rest.

427
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,030
But he is anxious.

428
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,470
How about I write to Miss Qin

429
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,440
and ask her to accompany Lu Ping?

430
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,460
Master. Don’t.

431
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,550
Mo Lin.

432
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,910
What are you hiding?

433
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,720
Don’t think this is your home and

434
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,870
I dare not beat you.

435
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,390
Master.

436
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Here is the thing.

437
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,510
I have a friend who is very sick.

438
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,080
But she doesn’t want to be a burden to others.

439
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,880
So she asks me to hide the secret.

440
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,030
It you were me,

441
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,630
would you agree?

442
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,430
Aren’t your friends just us?

443
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,590
Who is sick?

444
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,710
Mo Lin.

445
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,260
Are you hiding something from me?

446
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,320
By the way,

447
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
master, you haven’t answered me yet.

448
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,580
I asked you if you would like to be my wife.

449
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,560
You said you’d give me an answer

450
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,550
after we rescued the boss.

451
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,239
Now it’s time to live up to your promise.

452
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,870
I…

453
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,760
Until my brother unties the Force of Spirit Lock.

454
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,389
Master.

455
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,710
You are my master.

456
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,790
You’d better keep your promise.

457
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,699
It’s late.

458
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
I have to take care of my brother now.

459
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,429
Master.

460
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,030
Take care of boss.

461
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,270
I will figure the rest out.

462
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,199
Don’t forget.

463
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,889
I am not only your disciple,

464
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,639
but also a man of his word.

465
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,290
Younger master.

466
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,120
They are the best medicines in the valley

467
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,450
to treat the cold toxin.

468
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,470
I need more.

469
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,150
Find more.

470
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,400
The more, the better.

471
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,120
At that time,

472
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,600
if I can’t cure the cold toxin,

473
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,460
it’s good to buy some time for her.

474
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,860
When Lu Ping unties the locks,

475
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,430
he will be powerful.

476
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,120
How can’t we find a way to cure cold toxin?

477
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,830
Who has the cold toxin?

478
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,200
Younger master. What are you talking about?

479
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,800
Why are we talking like this?

480
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,070
No one is here.

481
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,310
We…

482
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,910
Just in case.

483
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,950
You can’t tell anyone about this,

484
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,250
including my father.

485
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,300
If you dare to say a word,

486
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,100
I will poison you into a mute now.

487
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,270
I will do whatever you ask me to do.

488
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,990
Good.

489
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
You are better than my two brothers.

490
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,080
They are not obedient at all.

491
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,470
What can they do

492
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,750
without me?

493
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,270
Yes.

494
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,370
What can they do?

495
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,990
Liu Song!

496
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,720
Your majesty, calm down.

497
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,050
They are applying just crooked means.

498
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,240
Your majesty has the majesty of the emperor.

499
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,310
We have no fear.

500
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,950
Is it the majesty that

501
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,680
the two armies rely on in battle?

502
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,150
It depends on the soldiers,

503
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,070
and the swords.

504
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,270
Using five forces

505
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,520
is the strength of an expert like Yan Qiuci.

506
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,720
If these experts gather to form an army,

507
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,750
the ordinary soldiers can’t resist.

508
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,400
Your Majesty.

509
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,790
in my opinion,

510
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,110
it’s not a bad thing that General Wen has

511
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,200
discovered the secret of Shanhai Gang.

512
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,710
Lu Ping is under our control.

513
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,630
Why not treat people in their own way?

514
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,160
Lu Ping is the awakening who can use six forces.

515
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,600
We are not afraid of the Shanhai Gang

516
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,110
with his help.

517
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,310
It’s emergency.

518
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,080
I hope Your Majesty will make a decision.

519
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,990
Lu Ping can’t be controlled by others.

520
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,470
My order to Wen Rui and Yan Xifan.

521
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,550
Bring Lu Ping to me.

522
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,900
Don’t let him be controlled by Shanhai Gang.

523
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,670
I will obey the order.

524
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,630
Xifan.

525
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,120
I’ve asked the military physicians to do their best.

526
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,380
But the master of Fengling Gang was dead.

527
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,990
Xifan. Don’t do this.

528
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,610
You’ve tried your best.

529
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,640
In order to create the Force Eaters,

530
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,800
Shanhai Gang disregards other’s life.

531
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,910
If it succeeds,

532
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,120
Dan will take this opportunity to invade south.

533
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,400
I don’t know how many civilians

534
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,550
will suffer.

535
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,240
You can’t deal with them

536
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,950
by yourself.

537
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,230
Ask Lu Ping for help.

538
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,760
He has been tortured for years.

539
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,490
Now he can hide in Wuyou Valley.

540
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,510
Ziyan.

541
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,670
Let him live in peace.

542
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,270
General Wen. Are we going now?

543
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,390
Mr. Yan.

544
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,820
There is the order of His Majesty.

545
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,260
His Majesty let you go to Wuyou Valley

546
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,320
and take Lu Ping back to Kaifeng.

547
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
His Majesty wants to deal with the Force Eater.

548
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,640
He can just call the Longjie Army back.

549
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,040
What’s the use of Lu Ping?

550
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,110
Soldiers can only listen to orders

551
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,280
and do not need to ask questions.

552
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,640
His Majesty knows that Lu Ping doesn’t want to be an official.

553
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,910
He couldn’t hire him.

554
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,600
Is His Majesty going to follow the Xi Sui of Shanhai Gang?

555
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,860
His Majesty also said,

556
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,820
Wuji Manor deceived the emperor.

557
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,400
According to the law,
the whole family should be beheaded.

558
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,920
But His Majesty is merciful.

559
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,230
He valued your talent,

560
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,880
and didn’t hold your family to account.

561
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,440
His Majesty hopes you won’t act on impulse,

562
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,950
and hurt his heart.

563
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,500
Is His Majesty going to take Wuji Manor hostage?

564
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,670
Xifan.

565
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,630
I beg you.

566
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,870
We witnessed the power of

567
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,640
the master of Fengling Gang.

568
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,390
If we don’t do something,

569
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,080
when the brothers of Longjie Army are in battle,

570
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,610
we can only be slaughtered.

571
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,320
The soldiers are humans.

572
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,160
They are brothers who had accompanied you

573
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,020
to Shanhai Gang and saved Lu Ping.

574
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,270
Can you stand watching them die?

575
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,270
I will obey the order.

576
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,550
Miss Ling. Wait.

577
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,560
His majesty has the second secret order.

578
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,710
It is for you.

579
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,910
Xifan.

580
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,000
Are you going to Wuyou Valley
and bring Lu Ping back?

581
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,400
Mo Lin was afraid to apart from us that day
outside Shanhai Gang,

582
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,670
He gave me the map.

583
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,360
If Liu Song used Lu Ping to create

584
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,560
the Force Eaters who can use six forces.

585
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,120
The situation is even more difficult to deal with.

586
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,870
I have to bring Lu Ping back.

587
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,160
And I will talk to his majesty after that.

588
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,820
But Lu Ping has deep blood feud with his majesty.

589
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,920
What if he won’t go back with you?

590
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,360
Will you be against the order of his majesty for him?

591
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,310
I will try my best to balance both.

592
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,540
Have a rest. I am going to check the horse.

593
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,100
Lu Ping can’t be controlled by Shanhai Gang.

594
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,530
You must bring him back.

595
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,790
If he resists,

596
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,030
get rid of him.

597
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,870
If Yan Xifan is soft with Lu Ping,

598
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,080
you can finish the task for him.

599
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,910
Otherwise, I won’t spare Yan Xifan’s life.

600
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,710
Xifan.

601
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,560
I won’t let you commit the crime of
deceiving the emperor.

602
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,690
I hope the thing to be solved smoothly.

603
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,720
Master Mo, why are you bringing me here?

604
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,820
Enjoy the flowers?

605
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
You can recuperate in Wuyou Valley.

606
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,440
But you can’t eat and drink for nothing.

607
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,370
You have to work.

608
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,810
Water and plant the flowers

609
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,720
I remember when I was young,
there was a flower field in my hometown,

610
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,450
which was different from the scenery of Kaifeng.

611
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,000
I will go back to my hometown and plant flowers,

612
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,950
after I untie the Force of Spirit Lock.

613
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,580
I will invite you to go with me.

614
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,660
How about that?

615
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,550
Countryside.

616
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,200
What’s good about it?

617
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,370
Never mind.

618
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,590
Brother.

619
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,760
Did you remember something?

620
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,010
Open your mouth.

621
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,950
I took it from Master Mo.

622
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,940
Is it sweet?

623
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,230
Su Tang. Do you find that?

624
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,190
I have you,

625
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
and flowers here,

626
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,860
and the life I wanted when I was young.

627
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,860
All here in front of me.

628
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,150
Brother.

629
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,800
I have figured it out.

630
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,860
Instead of being used by Liu Song,

631
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,720
it’s better to be locked.

632
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,470
If I stay in this isolated Wuyou Valley,

633
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,360
I can let everyone lives in peace

634
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,510
and live for a few more days.

635
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,510
Why don’t I stay?

636
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,030
I have never

637
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,070
lived in peace before.

638
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,510
Brother. How about older sister Qin?

639
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,590
Won’t you look for her?
