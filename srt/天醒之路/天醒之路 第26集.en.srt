After the peace talks,

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,020
Minister Xu will hold many

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,840
activities for celebration in the city.

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
I advise you to

8
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
have a look.

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,520
I would be lonely

10
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,120
if I go by myself.

11
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
What about I go with Qin Sang?

12
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
She loves such activities.

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
She must be happy.

14
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
You can go as you like.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,280
Qin Sang can’t.

16
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,360
I will take Qin Sang with me

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
in exchange for my previous contribution.

18
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,480
OK.

19
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,370
Since you have made contribution,

20
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
you can take her. But just this time.

21
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Great.

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
Thank you.

He agreed.

25
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,600
I have the best brother in the world.

Oh,

I saw Su Tang go out by herself.

30
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,800
She didn’t look happy.

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,960
Would you go to have a look?

32
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
I will see you later.

Why he went out secretly at midnight?

What was he up to?

were searching for Mr. Yan.

feel pity for him.

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,760
How do they look like?

179
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,320
Hey,

180
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,580
I heard others say.

181
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
One of them looks like a devil.

182
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,420
He is fierce-looking.

183
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,920
And the other has three heads

184
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,080
and six arms with a big mouth.

185
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,680
Bad people are like seeing Satan

186
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,920
when meeting them.

187
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,760
What do you say?

188
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,520
Hey, you.

189
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,530
Impossible.

190
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,800
You are telling lies.

191
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
They are handsome young boys.

192
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,180
You are talking about door-gods.

193
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,970
Without them

194
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,640
I would not sit here selling porridge.

195
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,080
You would not sit here talking.

196
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,480
-Yes. That’s true.
-Yes.

197
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,160
We must thank them

198
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,000
for having a home.

199
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,840
Yes.

200
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,960
That is Mr. Lu.

201
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,040
Look. Mr. Lu.

202
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,760
Mr. Lu.

203
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,680
That is Mr. Lu.

204
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,960
And there. Mr. Xifan.

205
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,720
-Xifan.
-Mr. Xifan.

206
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,450
Why did you come?

207
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,800
It was you who told me to come.

208
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,160
Mr. Lu.

209
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,490
-Mr. Lu.
-That is Mr. Lu.

210
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,200
Mr. Lu.

211
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:43,920
Mr. Lu.

212
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,800
Thank you.

213
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,480
You saved us.

214
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Thanks to you.

215
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,400
You saved us.

216
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I was tired.

217
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,560
How does it feel like, heroes?

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,860
Don’t mention.

219
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,360
I feel uneasy.

220
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,800
Be honest. Don’t learn from Mo Lin.

221
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,280
It is alright.

222
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I am happy.

223
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,050
I am coming. I am coming.

224
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
Why am I late?

225
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,120
Someone has to praise

226
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,680
my contribution as the No. 1 assassin.

227
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,960
You didn’t save those people.

228
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,520
It is none of your business.

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
Senior said that no one in Zhaifeng

230
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,000
would be left behind.

231
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,970
It seems that the convention ended for a long time

232
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,090
while it actually ended not that long.

233
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,900
Everything is different.

234
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
Fortunately, you are

235
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,160
still with me.

236
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,760
Congratulations, brother.

237
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,760
Without Shanhai Gang, you will have

238
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,240
no harm or darkness.

239
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,840
You are free.

240
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,170
We have all arrived.

241
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,200
It is the time.

242
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
What do you want to do?

243
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,160
I prepared you a surprise.

244
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,460
Look at the sky.

245
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,720
If it is still the starry sky,

246
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,400
it may be too boring.

247
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,400
Not only you can bring

248
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,200
others surprises.

249
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,170
Remember this feeling.

250
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,960
It is the happiness after

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,360
helping the poor and saving others’ life.

252
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,280
Yes, Lu Ping.

253
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,800
Create your new life with it.

254
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
It is good to

255
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
go with you.

256
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,520
The same to me.

257
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,520
The same to me.

258
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,680
Minister Xia,

259
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,640
it is obvious that Shanhai Gang is

260
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,570
related to the Liu’s in Hedong.

261
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,600
His Majesty asked me to take
Yan Jin to Kaifeng.

262
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,640
We can plan well to defeat the Liu’s

263
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,760
when we make Yan Jin confess.

264
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,720
With many escaped criminals from the gang,

265
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,040
it would not be easy

266
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,260
to escort Yan Jin back to Kaifeng.

267
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,520
Please leave with other people

268
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,320
from the same way you came.

269
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,450
I and Wen Rui will

270
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,840
escort Yan Jin.

271
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,720
We will go by the path.

272
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,620
[Chenzhou  Kaifeng]

273
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It would be sound.

274
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,440
You are professional in

275
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
escorting and interrogation.

276
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,890
I don’t have much to say.

277
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,520
But we have to go back quickly

278
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,720
without anything happening.

279
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,180
It would be good for us.

280
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,960
I have something important to
talk with General Qin.

281
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,920
What you doing here?

282
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
General Qin,

283
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,840
I want to see Yan Jin.

284
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,840
No.

285
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,490
He is a severe criminal.

286
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
You can’t see him easily.

287
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,280
Lu Ping,

288
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,460
you have made some contributions

289
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,560
but you can’t ask for too much.

290
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,240
It is essential affairs.

291
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,140
It has nothing to do with you, a man from Jianghu.

292
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,210
General Qin,

293
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Lu Ping has been tortured by them
for around ten years.

294
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,440
I think he must figure out his past

295
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
in order to move on.

296
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,120
Please forgive him.

297
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,360
Now my father is helping

298
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,720
you to search for the escaped criminals.

299
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,240
Would you do us a favor…

300
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,440
I understand.

301
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,440
Wen Rui,

302
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,960
get to it.

303
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,720
I will take Lu to Yan Jin.

304
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,520
Yes.

305
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,800
General Qin.

306
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,880
Minister Xia,

307
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
Yan Jindidn’t eat or talk

308
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,360
during his custody.

309
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,840
Just let him go.

310
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,320
Maybe we can get some details.

311
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,360
And,

312
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,720
you have said that

313
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,560
it is better for you and me

314
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,760
to make it clear

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,120
and finish our task well.

316
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,440
You have come?

317
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,720
I have two questions for you.

318
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,720
First,

319
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,760
how did you kill my parents?

320
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,800
Second,

321
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
why did you imprison me?

322
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,400
It is easy to answer the first.

323
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,600
You know it as

324
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,370
you have gone through them.

325
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,920
The tortures you have had

326
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,840
were also applied to your parents.

327
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,240
Why?

328
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Because

329
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,160
it is interesting.

330
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Only the endless mountains and seas

331
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,240
can make you go to heaven.

332
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,080
We have more ways to torture two

333
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,880
people than one person.

334
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,690
And it is more interesting.

335
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,960
Leng Xiutan, the master of Big Dipper,

336
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
lied like a dog in front of me

337
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,660
and pled me to free him.

338
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Wonderful!

339
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,480
It is amazing!

340
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,680
You have already known

341
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,210
the answer to the second question.

342
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,720
Lu Ping,

343
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,090
just think about it.

344
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,920
How was Zhaifeng destroyed?

345
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,240
How did Guo Youdao die?

346
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,960
Lu Ping,

347
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,210
I have warned you that human

348
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,120
can’t stand the power of Awakening.

349
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,160
Therefore, it brings about disasters.

350
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,320
In order to save you,

351
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,960
your parents died first.

352
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,800
Next was Zhaifeng Institute.

353
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,400
Who will be the next?

354
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,720
Yan Xifan?

355
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,440
Mo Lin?

356
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,600
Su Tang?

357
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,840
Oh yes,

358
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,000
Qin Sang?

359
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,920
Lu Ping.

360
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,120
Come on!

361
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,040
-Kill me.
-Lu Ping. Calm down.

362
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
What he said may not be true.

363
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,680
He is irritating you. Don’t be cheated.

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,480
Lu Ping.

365
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,520
You don’t listen to your senior?

366
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,290
Brother,

367
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,080
stop torturing him.

368
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,050
Brother…

369
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,000
Stop.

370
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,410
Listen to me.

371
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,760
Lu Ping,

372
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,480
I have heard about your past.

373
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,130
Everyone would be angry

374
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,160
at that situation.

375
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,120
Don’t think too much.

376
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,840
I was too impulsive.

377
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,700
I almost caused you some trouble.

378
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,040
But you have to promise me

379
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,360
that he would be punished.

380
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,120
I didn’t want to let you go before.

381
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,840
How can I set him free?

382
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,420
I felt somehow annoyed

383
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,720
when I think

384
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,480
about things in the past.

385
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,620
Considering your situation,

386
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,520
it is better

387
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,530
to live in a different place

388
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,340
and do something meaningful.

389
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,760
You may forget it soon.

390
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,730
I have written to Big Dipper

391
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,250
to ask for a room for Su and Mo
in the Fifth College.

392
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,370
Zhaifeng disappeared.

393
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
I have to give them a new home.

394
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,520
Have you thought of a new place?

395
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,770
For example,

396
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,330
Kaifeng.

397
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,080
You are

398
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,400
admiring me?

399
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,400
At the convention in Kaifeng,

400
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,640
you were just a boy acting on impulse.

401
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,720
I won’t pick you even if you are skilled.

402
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,920
But now you

403
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,400
just meet my standard.

404
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,720
Remember.

405
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,760
Many people learning martial arts

406
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,480
but kill people in Jianghu

407
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,840
all their lives although they always

408
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,040
say they are fighting for justice.

409
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,280
But when you are in court,

410
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,280
you will find that your skill

411
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
can be useful

412
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,920
in a better way.

413
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,680
I just want

414
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,920
to be an ordinary man.

415
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,570
I can’t deal with things

416
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,200
related to official circles.

417
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,040
Don’t worry.

418
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,120
I won’t force you.

419
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,180
Please come to Kaifeng

420
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,570
if you have decided.

421
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,680
And,

422
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Sang’re is going to Kaifeng with me.

423
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,530
She has been out for so long.

424
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,840
She must behave herself.

425
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,280
Brother,

426
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:45,920
I…

427
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,580
Are you still bargaining?

428
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,240
Listen to your brother.

429
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,520
Interesting.

430
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,410
Longjie Army and Big Dipper are fighting over me.

431
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,160
Guo,

432
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,680
your disciple is finally

433
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,520
making some achievements.

434
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,440
Boss,

435
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,680
letter from Master Chu Min.

436
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,800
She asked you to go back to Big Dipper.

437
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,800
Don’t think you can forget master

438
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,460
after acting like a hero once.

439
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,970
Brother.

440
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,020
Is Big Dipper good?

441
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,960
Is it like Zhaifeng?

442
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,370
It is beautiful.

443
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,840
There is also a man

444
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,570
who looks just like our master.

445
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,320
You must be surprised.

446
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,500
I will take you back

447
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,240
tomorrow morning.

448
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,880
Father.

449
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,440
Xifan.

450
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,120
You have recovered from your injury?

451
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,800
I am OK.

452
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,240
Father,

453
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,960
didn’t you say that you

454
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
are going to search for escaped criminals?

455
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Why are you here?

456
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,200
Xifan,

457
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,900
have you seen the master of Shanhai Gang?

458
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,120
I mean Yan Jin.

459
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,960
Is he strange?

460
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,560
Come on.

461
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,320
Kill me!

462
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,960
Today, in the prison,

463
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,610
he somehow seemed to

464
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,840
irritate Lu Ping to pursue his death.

465
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,920
As I expected,

466
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,940
he is looking for life in despair.

467
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,600
I’m afraid he has someone to protect.

468
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Do you mean that

469
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,520
someone is behind him?

470
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,160
I’m afraid there is.

471
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:23,820
[E'zhou Post]

472
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,650
General,

473
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,650
Miss has run away again.

474
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,010
She left you a letter

475
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,160
saying that since she has come,

476
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,760
she must have a competition in Big Dipper.

477
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,000
She asks you not to worry.

478
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,330
She will come back soon.

479
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,260
Do we have to send people looking for her?

480
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,240
What if she makes trouble again?

481
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,040
She has grown up.

482
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,800
I can’t restrain her.

483
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,120
Alright.

484
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
It will be hard for her to escort criminals.

485
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
She doesn’t have to bear it.

486
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
I know.

487
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,640
Wait.

488
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,680
Check the criminal cart later

489
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,800
in case of anything happens.

490
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,600
Yes.

491
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,120
Qin Sang must be angry with her brother.

492
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,940
She hates boring life.

493
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,320
It would be terrible for her

494
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,400
to be a lady living in the castle.

495
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,840
It is true that

496
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,240
men in love would be

497
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,800
so stupid.

498
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,520
It is not like being in a prison.

499
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,090
You don’t have to worry.

500
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,600
And senior left

501
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,580
without saying ahead of time.

502
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,930
No one knows where he is.

503
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,280
Senior has Miss Ling.

504
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,560
Just care about your master.

505
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,640
Master.

506
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,840
Master.

507
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,640
Who is it?

508
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,090
You have sharp ears.

509
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
Boring.

510
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,760
How did you come?

511
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,450
My brother escorts Yan Jin.

512
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,160
I can do nothing to help.

513
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,760
I can escort you to Big Dipper.

514
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,000
And I can have a competition there.

515
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,440
And then

516
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,880
Lu Ping can escort you to Kaifeng.

517
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,480
Can you stop?

518
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,680
We can do that.

519
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,000
I will escort you

520
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,850
to make your brother angry.

521
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,640
What a bad fortune.

522
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,920
I met you, such a mad woman,

523
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
on such a bad day.

524
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
I’d rather die.

525
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,590
How can I let you die

526
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,760
before I’m tired of ridiculing you.

527
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,300
Pah!

528
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Now that Shanhai Gang has been over.

529
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,340
We are both like homeless people.

530
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,080
How can the marvelous empire

531
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,970
of Shanhai be over that easily?

532
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,620
Where are you taking me to?

533
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,360
We are here.

534
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,800
Come on.

535
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,880
-Kill me.
-Lu Ping, calm down.

536
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,240
What he said may not be true.

537
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,440
He is irritating you. Don’t be cheated.

538
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,280
I have come

539
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,250
but you don’t care about me.

540
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,800
Brother.

541
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,220
Do you have anything in your mind?

542
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
I just don’t understand.

543
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,680
Why did Yan Jin insist to

544
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,010
take me to Shanhai Gang?

545
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,290
He was in E’zhou.

546
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
Why did he take me back?

547
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,570
He irritated me that day in the prison.

548
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,220
He seemed to protect someone.

549
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,520
Someone more important.

550
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
It is over.

551
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,200
Are you thinking too much?

552
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,560
If you still feel it strange,

553
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,930
I will go back to investigate with you.

554
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,160
Let’s go.

555
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,580
Master Yan.

556
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,800
I don’t understand why

557
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,410
you left and back again.

558
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,400
I will say it clearly.

559
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,440
I suspect that Yan Jin was

560
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,920
not in charge of Shanhai Gang.

561
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,600
Someone is behind him.

562
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,800
Things in Jianghu should be dealt with in Jianghu.

563
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,600
Please hand over Yan Jin

564
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,260
to Wuji Manor to investigate.

565
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,400
I will escort him to Kaifeng

566
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,240
after I figure out who is behind him.

567
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,360
A sect can block a criminal cart.

568
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,280
The emperor here seems

569
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,560
to have little authority.

570
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,760
Master Yan,

571
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,440
it is not a small thing.

572
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,840
Please don’t fight against his majesty.

573
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,760
General Qin,

574
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,720
I want Yan Jin

575
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,720
for the sake of his majesty.

576
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
I have got my order.

577
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,200
I can’t agree.

578
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,120
But I will think about

579
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,280
what you said.

580
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,320
Now please don’t hinder me.

581
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,280
Do you think you can stop me?

582
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,960
Listen, Longjie Army.

583
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,630
Wuji Manor is stealing the criminal.

584
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,000
Catch them all!

585
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,960
Yes.

586
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,600
Wen Rui.

587
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,830
Be careful. Force of Spirit.

588
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,360
Master.

589
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,880
You are just like this. The best general in Shuo.

590
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,440
Exactly. It’s you.

591
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,600
Father.

592
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,890
Second senior, how are you?

593
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,320
Liu Song.

594
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,880
You didn’t die.

595
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,920
You have known much.

596
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,860
Your son is brave and skilled.

597
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,610
But it is a pity that we are not the same.

598
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,440
I will kill you,

599
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,970
betrayer of Big Dipper.

600
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,580
Father.

601
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,360
Father.

602
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,520
Loser.

603
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,680
I will kill you today.

604
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,560
Stop.

605
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
Rescue my teacher.

606
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,860
Master Yan.

607
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,840
Our master is coming for you.

608
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,440
Master.

609
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,440
Teacher.

610
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Let’s talk later.

611
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,440
What about these people?

612
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,160
They like to fight against each other.

613
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,040
Then just let them.

614
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,520
Yes.

615
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,160
Father.

616
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,880
Lu Ping.

617
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
You have grown up.

618
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
See you next time.

619
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,160
Sang’re.

620
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,240
Go.

621
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,760
Qin Sang.

622
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,890
Sang’re.

623
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,720
Qin Sang.

624
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,640
What’s going on?

625
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,420
Why are you fighting against each other?

626
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,760
Senior.

627
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,520
Why are you here with Master Yan?

628
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,240
Qin Sang.

629
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,560
Sang’re.

630
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,000
Qin Sang.

631
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,840
Go. Go. Go away.

632
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,760
Why hasn’t she woken up?

633
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,300
-Wen Rui.
-Yes.

634
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,960
Go fetching Minister Xu.

635
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,520
Find the best doctor in the city.

636
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:17,920
Yes.

637
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,280
Come back. Come back.

638
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,120
I say.

639
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,640
Don’t worry.

640
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,560
I am better than ordinary doctors

641
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,920
even if I didn’t study well.

642
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,280
She will wake up soon.

643
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,760
Sang’er,

644
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,820
you are daughter from Qin Family.

645
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,080
You must get through.

646
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,040
Nonsense.

647
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,240
She just needs rest.

648
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,580
Remember to give her more nutrients.

649
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,560
She would be healthy.

650
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,700
Is she really well?

651
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,440
Boss,

652
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,480
just don’t worry.

653
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,560
She’s OK.

654
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,740
[Abundance and Peace]

655
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,040
Mr. Xifan.

656
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,840
Miss must be alright

657
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,240
with Mr. Mo Lin.

658
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,000
Lu Ping.

659
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,200
I come to visit Qin Sang.

660
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,060
Is she alright?

661
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,810
Don’t you think you owe me an explanation?

662
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,420
Why did you leave without saying?

663
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,660
Why did you come on the way for Yan Jin?

664
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,050
There is someone behind Shanhai Gang.

665
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,200
I don’t want to startle them.

666
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,730
Why didn’t you talk with me?

667
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,840
If you talked with me,

668
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,600
even if you used me as the bait

669
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,920
or anything,

670
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,680
it wouldn’t be like this.

671
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,760
Lu Ping.

672
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,360
It was so urgent. I had to do it.

673
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,080
I have my responsibility.

674
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,760
Yes.

675
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,720
Yan Xifan,

676
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,080
you changed your family name.

677
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,600
You are young master of Wuji Manor.

678
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,800
You are noble.

679
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,840
You just do what you think is important.

680
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,320
You don’t value the relationship

681
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,520
with your ordinary brother.

682
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,360
Lu Ping, how can you think like this?

683
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,040
I’m sorry for Qin Sang.

684
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
But I hid the information from you

685
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
for the sake of you.

686
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,620
I don’t regret.

687
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,040
For the sake of me?

688
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,360
It is not the first time.

689
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,210
In the boxing casino in Jin,

690
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,560
you spied for me without talking with me.

691
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,920
You almost died.

692
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,880
You have no idea how I worried.

693
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,720
You did that again.

694
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,720
You act on your own without discussion.

695
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,640
You said we are good brothers.

696
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,360
But you leave me away whenever something happens.

697
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,840
Do you think I

698
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,440
am just a waste

699
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,720
who needs help all the time?

700
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,760
We are brothers.

701
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,160
Can’t we fight together,

702
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
rely on each other

703
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,680
and trust each other?

704
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,800
Lu Ping,

705
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,760
I…

706
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,080
Now, please

707
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,640
remember.

708
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,600
Shanhai Gang is my enemy.

709
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,760
It is none of your business.

710
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,960
Lu Ping.

711
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,440
Mr. Xifan.

712
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,120
He is just angry.

713
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,720
Don’t…

714
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,450
It is between me and Lu Ping.

715
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,300
Other people don’t have a say.

716
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,800
I’m sorry.

717
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,400
I shouldn’t have done that.
