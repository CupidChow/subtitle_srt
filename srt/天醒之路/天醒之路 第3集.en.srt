Since we're tracking someone down,

4
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,560
we'll need specific professionals
in that field.

Miss.

6
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,000
Mr. Wei said he posted wanted posters

7
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,040
from the east to the west of the city.

8
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
Perhaps,

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,200
offering a reward might really work?

10
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,079
Who is it?

11
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,320
Please spare me, heroine.

12

I am Mo Lin.

13
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
I came here because of the poster.

14
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,680
The wanted poster

15
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
is exceptional.

16
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,200
They're all over the town.

17
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,720
The words written are extremely big.

18
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,040
Reading it makes me stressed out.

19
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
It took me a good half of the day

20
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,880
to tear all the posters down.

21
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,720
I couldn't let anyone else benefit...

22
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,880
No. I couldn't let anyone take the reward.

23
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,440
Heroine.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
You possess no soul of Strength at all.

25
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,360
Do what you're capable of.

26
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,120
Do not take this poster seriously.

27
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,200
It's beyond your power.

28
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,880
You can't question my talent,

29
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,680
just because I'm imperfect.

30
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,760
My poor situation

31
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
and poverty are temporary.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,280
But I'm excellent at finding people
in a haystack.

33
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,079
Ling Ziyan.

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,040
Take him hostage

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,320
and take him to the officials.

36
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes, miss.

37
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,520
Get up.

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,800
You woke up
and refreshed yourself at dawn.

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
You didn't use willow to brush your mouth
like everyone does.

40
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
Instead, you used peach blossom stem.

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
You went out in the morning.

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,399
Besides being accompanied by this lady,

43
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,600
four other men were with you.

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,920
First, you went to an iron forge,

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,480
then traveled across half of Chan State

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,440
from south to north.

47
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,600

48
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,400
You excel in the soul of Pivot.

49
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
You had lunch at Pinxian Restaurant.

50
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,960
The dishes were sea bass sashimi,
glazed crab,

51
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,400
Tilu chicken, black rice,
almond panna cotta, and shredded pickles.

52
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,840
It seems like you had a bad appetite.

53
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,600
You gave each dish less than three bites.

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
But you did have a bowl
of cold noodles with pagoda leaves.

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
You went out of town in the afternoon.

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,320
About two<span tts:fontStyle="italic"> li</span> out,

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,080
you passed by a flower field
of common peonies.

58
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,640
You stood in front of a white common peony

59
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,040
for around 15 minutes.

60
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
Then you passed by a purple one,

61
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,680
and you went...

62
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,760
east!

63
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,760
You only come back to Chan State
in the evening.

64
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,080
What else?

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,840
There's something in your waistband

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,200
that doesn't belong to you.

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm looking for the best of the best.

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,840
Even if you smelled something,
but had yourself killed,

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
what does that benefit me?

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
You get to keep her alive.

71
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
When did you poison her?

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
When I came to the residence at midnight.

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
I told you.

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
I am an assassin.

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
If you hire me now,

76
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
I'll be at your command.

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,080
So I will have to save your servant.

78

How's that?

79

-It hurts!
-Do you know who I am?

81

who guards my sword.

We couldn't tell
because his Shanhai Badge was taken.

94
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
Why did Ms. Qin say

95
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,720
the one who tried to kill her
is undercover of Shanhai Gang?

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,480
Could it be that Lord set

97
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
another undercover in Chan State?

98
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,720
Sir, you've been in Chan State
for years under our lord's order,

in the name of doing business.

100
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
Even if he sent other men from our gang,

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,280
I'm certain they would've informed you.

102
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,280
Besides, if he really is a part
of the gang,

103
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,400
why would he kill one of us?

104
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,600
This is too suspicious.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
We have to report to Lord immediately.

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
The Wei family will cease to exist

107

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,120
You're right.

173
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,360
It is rather odd.

174
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,720
Even though the God of Bandits
isn't a man with good morals,

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
but he is always willing

176
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,920
to help Zhaifeng Institute.

177
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,320
Because of that,

178
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,880
he has my gratitude.

179
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
What a funny guy you are!

180
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,600
This is the first time

181
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
I hear someone praising a bad man!

182
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,040
All right. I'll stop teasing you now.

183
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm leaving.

184
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,920
By the way,

185
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,120
don't forget to bring your master

186
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,960
over to Ruyu Restaurant when he's free.

187
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,000
[God of Bandits?]

188
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,480
Ruyu Restaurant?

189
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,560
[Ms. Qin.]

190
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,000
[I have found the culprit's hiding place.]

191

[All you need to do is send me
20 strong men]

192
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,680
[and I have my own way to capture him.]

193
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,080
[Please wait for my good news
at Ruyu Restaurant]

194
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,600
[of Chenqiao Town.]

195
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,920
He's asking you for 20 strong men?

196
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Is Mo Lin going to break in forcefully?

197
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
Qin Qi once told me,

198
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,480
"Don't hire doubtful men,
but don't doubt your men."

199
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,120
If he wants 20 men, we'll give him 20 men.

200
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,320
But we're not in Kaifeng.

201
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,080
Where can we find that many men?

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,040
Speak of the devil.

203
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,160
[Sangsang!]

204
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
I heard you're in need of something.

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm willing to do whatever it takes

206
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,560
to help you.

207
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,440
Lu Ping!

208
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,000
It hasn't been a month
since you beat that man of Shanhai Gang.

209
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,360
Your soul power has yet to recover.

210
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,880
And now you're going to see Ms. Qin?

211
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
Are you looking for a beating?

212
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
I missed her once.

213
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
If I wait longer,

214
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,760
I'll miss this second chance.

215
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,680
But you don't even know where she is.

216
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,920
What if she has gone?

217
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,040
Then who else made a scene

218
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,560
and pasted the reward all over town?

219
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,560
Only the Wei Family has the money

220
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,240
and the manpower to do that.

221
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,960
My guess is Ms. Qin

222
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,080
is giving out orders
in the Wei Residence right now.

223
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
Fortunately, Master is not around
these few days.

224
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,640
I'll sweet-talk or force her,
if necessary, into coming back with me,

225
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,600
and I'll ask her to bring us
to see Wen Gecheng.

226
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,640
Lu Ping!

227
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,640
Lu Ping!

228
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
Lu Ping.

229
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,120
Where are you going?

230
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,040
I admit I was too strict with you.

231
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
I promise I'll teach you well.

232
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
Even if afterward,
you don't get the soul of Strength,

233
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,280
it's still good
for strengthening your body.

234
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,560
Will you let me eat something first?

235
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,200
I'll eat with you.

236
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,480
I should go to the restroom.

237
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,840
That's good!

238
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,360
I can join you.

239
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,240
Xifan.

240
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,800
It's better if you keep ignoring me

241
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,800
like you always do.

242
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
A loser like me

243
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,960
isn't worth your time.

244
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,440
Master asked me to take care of you
before he left.

245
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,920
He wants me to start with your life,

246
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,760
to help you cultivate good habits.

247
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,080
That might help improve
your martial art skills as well.

248
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,200
Your place is too shabby.

249
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,880
Why don't I move over

250
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,240
and stay with you for the night?

251
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,040
All right.

252
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,480
Sure.

253
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,800
Allow me to introduce
the surroundings to you.

254
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,800

Something happened!

262
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,680
Jin Ruyu is really in trouble this time.

263
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,960
Those bandits went back for revenge
and took her away.

264

[Wei Residence]

265
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,600
Sir, miss.

266
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,920
Qin Sang has hired someone

267
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
to look for that mysterious man.

268
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
They should be at Ruyu Restaurant
of Chenqiao Town by now.

269
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,760
I was afraid my identity would be exposed.

270
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,960
Please handle the matter from here.

271
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,040
Forget it.

272
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,040
Your neck is too thick.

273
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm not interested.

274
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,160
Let's go.

275
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,880
Sir.

276
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,640
Why was I so greedy back in the days?

277
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
I took shelter from Shanhai Gang.

278
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
Now my business is thriving,

279
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,960
but I can never escape them!

280
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,000
But it's all right.

281
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,400
I can endure it as long as
Tianqi is safe and sound.

282
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,280
I would sacrifice my life's work
to the gang if necessary.

283
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,280
Sir.

284

Sir.

285
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,360
Mr. Wei hasn't returned for two days.

286
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,120
I'm afraid he's at Chenqiao Town
with Ms. Qin again.

287
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,760
I want everyone out there and find him!

288
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,880
Bring him back no matter what!

289

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,920
Let's remain here.

299
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,200
Let's see who he really is.

300
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
Wait.

301
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,240
God of Bandits.

302
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,080
I respect you for being a good man.

303
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,160
You were being chivalrous
to help the weak,

304
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,280
but you also robbed people.

305
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,839
You do good deeds,
but you never show who you are.

306
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,960
Is there a reason why you are hiding?

307
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,560
Who are you exactly?

308
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
It doesn't matter.

309
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,000
We both are like-minded,

310
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,079
why can't you show yourself?

311
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,840
How did you get hurt?

312
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,440
It's nothing serious.

313
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,520
The bandits did it.

314
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,400
I have no idea who I offended

315
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,720
to become wanted.

316
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,520
Then why did you show up to help?

317
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,160
If she was taken away because of me,

318
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,640
wouldn't I be a laughing stock?

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,840
Xifan.

320
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,080
It's true that someone is giving out

321
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,840
a reward for people
who capture the God of Bandits.

322
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,720
Xifan.

323
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
His brave deeds got him injured.

324
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,320
If we leave him like this,

325
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,440
it's injustice.

326
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,720
It's my first time meeting
the actual God of Bandits.

327
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,760
What a delicate young man!

328
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,200
Let me see.

329
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,520
He's beautiful as well!

330
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,440
By the way, Mr. Zhao,

331
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
didn't you tell me

332
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,000
you respect the God of Bandits a lot?

333
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,040
That you wouldn't mind
even if he drew a turtle on your face?

334
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,760
Now that he's right in front of us.

335
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,600
He really is a young man!

336
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,640
What a hero.

337
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,640
How about this?

338
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,920

It's fun to have him around.

507
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,960
I don't have the heart to expose him

508
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,720
and I'm going to meet him now.

509
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,200
Lu Ping.

510
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,040
Even if he's not that man of Shanhai Gang,

511
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,440
he can't be a good person.

512
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,680
Who else can he be?

513
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,840
I found this on the night
I trapped him in the quicksand.

514
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,480
I haven't found Ms. Qin,

515
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,400
but she already found me.

516
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,920
I think she is scheduled to meet
with Mo Lin at Ruyu Restaurant.

517
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,480
Why is Ms. Qin

518
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,200
so determined to find you?

519
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,320
No idea.

520
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,680
Perhaps, that night I impressed her

521
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,840
with my outstanding elegance.

522
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
I don't think it's safe.

523
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,680
What if she plotted against you
with Shanhai Gang?

524
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,120
The Qin family has always been
the generals of the emperors.

525
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,680
Shanhai Gang and them
can never be related.

526
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,680
To find Wen Gecheng,

527
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,840
the easiest way is through the Qins.

528
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,400
So...

529
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,880
You shouldn't keep going against her.

530
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,280
Why don't you just coax her

531
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,040
and ask her to take you to Wen Gecheng?

532
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,760
With the mark of Shanhai Gang,

533
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,920
if I tell them our background,

534
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,800
how many people will believe me?

535
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,120
And then there's Zhao Xifan.

536
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,680
He's guarding the gates all the time.

537
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,160
Then what should we do?

538
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,040
So this guy, Mo Lin,

539
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,600
is extremely useful.

540
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,880
How so?

541
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,000
Can we make use of the treasures

542
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,320
we found?

543
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,120
It has been so long.

544
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,880
Why hasn't he shown up?

545
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,960
What if he's too much of a coward?

546
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,520
That's weird.

547
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,920
He is not Lu Ping.

548
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,240
[I know who you are.]

549
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,520
[f you don't want to be exposed,]

550
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,160
[meet me at Zhaifeng Institute's pavilion]

551
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
[in the afternoon.]

552
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,920
It's you?

553
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,880
Who are you?

554
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,080
Say it!

555
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,760
Why would you know who I am?

556
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,720
It hurts!

557
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,680
It's a misunderstanding.

558
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,840
It's all a misunderstanding.

559
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,560
How could I know who you are?

560
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,240
Say it!

561
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,200
I'll say it.

562
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,360
I'll say it!

563
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,600
Who did this?

564
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,120
Why is this happening?

565
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,600
This is the pavilion of the back hillside.

566
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,160
The reason why Mo Lin chose this spot

567
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,040
is probably because he'd use
the terrain there.

568
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,920
He doesn't possess the soul of Strength.

569
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,720
Thus, he will not fight me head-on.

570
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,560
If I were him,

571
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,520
I would set traps in the pavilion.

572
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,360
With such a generous gift of his,

573
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,159
I surely have to give him something
in return.

574
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,960
And get rid of Zhao Xifan along the way.

575
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,600
Come on, Lu Ping.

576
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,600
It'll be too late
if we don't go to the restaurant now.

577
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,480
Su Tang.

578
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,560
You stay.

579
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,960
This is a matter of the imperial court
and the officials.

580
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,960
It's too dangerous.

581
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,400
You shouldn't be involved.

582
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,480
I'll come back to you once I discover

583
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,679
the whereabouts of Wen Gecheng.

584
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,159
-Lu Ping!
-Don't worry.

585
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,000
I'll buy some osmanthus candy for you.

586
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,639
You're not the God of Bandits.

587
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,880
Who on earth are you?

588
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm not God of Bandits,

589
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,679
but I'm an assassin.

590
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,199
Quit acting.

591
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,719
You don't possess the soul of Strength.

592
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,719
Yet your bag is full
of murderous mechanism.

593
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,679
From now on,

594
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
I'll take you to the officials

595
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,720
if you lie to me one more time.

596
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,160
Don't.

597
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,600
You can do whatever you want with me,

598
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,040
just don't take me to the officials.

599
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,640
No assassin goes to jail.

600
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,080
Assassin?

601
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,320
Who is your target?

602
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,280
Forget it.

603
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,400
I just want to survive.

604
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,280
I shouldn't have to sacrifice for this.

605
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,480
I really am an assassin.

606
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,720
"God of Bandits"?

607
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,840
Is he your target?

608
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
I'm here to kill Lu Ping.

609
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,040
What? Say that one more time.

610
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,480
[Ruyu Restaurant]

611
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,400
Sir, this way, please.

612
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,360
This way.

613
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,320
Sir.

614
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
The room on the second floor
is taken today.

615
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,200
Please don't mind.

616
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,360
Here.

617
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,120
Take care, sir.

618
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,280
All right.

619
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
So you're the man from Shanhai Gang!

620
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,360
Who knew that assassin's powder

621
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,600
actually works?

622
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,600
Cui Hua. Hurry!

623
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,400
Come greet the guests.

624
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,200
Come in, sirs.

625
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Ruyu Restaurant

626
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,000
has the best wine in Chenqiao Town.

627
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,880
You won't be disappointed.

628

Here.

629

Serve them well.

Right here, sir and miss.

Her neck is whiter than mine.

632
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,760
I like it.

633

Lord said

634
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,200
business comes first.

635
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
What's the rush?

636
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,080
Let's have a drink first.

637
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
Mr. Wei,

638
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,120
weren't we heading to Chan State?

639
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,640
Why did we circle back?

640
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,520
I'm fine with Wei Ming
messing around with authority,

641
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,760
but Wei Hu and others
even tried to imitate him.

642
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,800
I will not be at their mercy.

643
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
Ms. Qin specifically said

644
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,680
not to disturb her.

645
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,440
Please don't make this difficult for me.

646
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,760
Kid,

647
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,400
you don't want to help me? Fine.

648
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,000
But don't ruin my fun.

649
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,240
Otherwise, I'll tell on you to Sangsang.

650
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,520
Let's see if she'll protect you

651
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,280
or go along with it on my behalf.

652
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,600
Mr. Wei.

653
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,840
What exactly are you up to?

654
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,360
You'll see.

655
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,000
I've been planning this for so long.

656
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,840
I will definitely impress her.

657
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,520
Let me go!

658
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,520
I heard the Qins
has outstanding achievement in wars.

659
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,160
The emperor gave your family
three golden tokens.

660
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,680
You can do anything with it.

661
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,080
Of course, only you, Ms. Qin,

662
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,440
can possess such a token.

663
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,320
Your guy is good.

664
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,280
The powder works like magic.

665
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,800
What a shame.

666
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,840
You killed Mo Lin?

667
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,960
Mo Lin was going to kill me with it.

668
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,160
I heard one drop can kill
the entire Zhaifeng Institute.

669
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,080
Tell me.

670
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,760
And the antidote is yours.

671
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,400
What do you want to know?

672
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,320
Tell me where Wen Gecheng lives.

673
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,960
So is Shanhai Gang going for

674
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,520
Mr. Wei as well?

675
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,560
So you do know him.

676
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,400
Where can I find him?

677
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,200
I'd never make deals with Shanhai Gang.

678
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,560
I'd rather die

679
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
than embarrass my family.

680
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,800
Master, do you think our prey is here?

681
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,440
We'll find out upstairs.

682
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,760
Would you believe me if I say

683
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm not from Shanhai Gang

684
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,520
and that I just need your help?

685
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,960
Then why are you torturing me?

686
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,920
Didn't you try to kill me too?

687
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,840
Besides,

688
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,680
torture is the only way I know.

689
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,560
Hand me the antidote first

690
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,160
to show your sincerity.

691
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,280
You hit me!

692
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,200
Don't go!

693
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,480
You hit me!

694
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,640
[This is bad.]

695
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,040
[What is Xing Luo doing here?]

696
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,680
[No way.]

697
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,800
[My soul of Strength isn't activated.]

698
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,040
[I can't handle them.]

699
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,160
[I have to go.]

700
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,800
[If I leave now,]

701
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,200
[she will die.]

702
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm taking you with me.

703
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,200
They're here.

704
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,080
It's Xing Luo,

705
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,480
an assassin of Shanhai Gang.

706
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,760
You don't need to play nice.

707
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,040
I'm poisoned.

708
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,680
I can fight until the end with them.

709
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,360
I gave you the water
I used to wash my face.

710
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,640
You would have diarrhea,
but there's no need for an antidote.

711
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Su Tang?

712
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,600
Let's go.

713
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,960
You...

714
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,880
Are you two with those bandits?

715
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,640
A man and a woman

716
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,280
threatened me to hide them.

717
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,840
They looked like bandits to me.

718
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
I wouldn't budge,

719
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,800
so they left.

720
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,200
How much money do you want?

721
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,480
I'll give it all to you.

722
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,080
Please don't hurt me.

723
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,440
Girl.

724
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,840
If you dare lie to us,

725
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,280
you'll lose your life.
