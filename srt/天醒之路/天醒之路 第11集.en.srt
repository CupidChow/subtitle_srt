[Episode 11]

3
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,079
Su Tang and I

4
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,600
have been staying at Zhaifeng Institute
for the past three years.

5
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,260
Our master might be reckless,

6
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,960
lazy, greedy, and a drunk,

7
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,490
but he is very kind to us.

8
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,600
I'll take you to meet him if possible.

9
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,079
All right.

10
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,320
Lu Ping.

11
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
Lu Ping!

12
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,680
Lu Ping.

13
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,440
Lu Ping.

14
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
Lu Ping!

15
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,000
Lu Ping.

16
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,640
Mr. Wen...

17
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
The Soul Confinement...

18
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,440
It's getting more powerful.

19
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,210
It's strangling me even more tightly.

20
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,480
Have you undergone Soul Splitting?

21
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,680
Who helped you with it?

22
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
I begged my master for it.

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,860
I did it to attend the convention.

24
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
In order to see you.

25
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,920
This is foolish!

26
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,760
The Soul Confinement
is used by Shanhai Gang

27
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,960
as a barrier to control your soul power.

28
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,640
You've suppressed it all these years,
so it's calmed down gradually.

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,120
But now that you've used Soul Splitting,

30
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,680
the soul power within you have turned
to provoke the Soul Confinement.

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,760
If we don't break it soon,

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,020
it will only get worse.

33
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
Mr. Wen.

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,600
Can you break it?

35
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
I can't.

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,200
I've been stripped
of my martial arts skills.

37
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,130
If we are to break the confinement,

38
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,850
I have to seek help from my academy.

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
But tomorrow...

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,780
It's the second round of the convention.

41
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,220
Xifan will need me to get through
the second round with him.

42
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Lu Ping.

43
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,160
Lu Ping.

44
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,440
I know of your comradery.

45
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,399
But the longer you stall,

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
the worse you will get.

47
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll be sure to send my master
a letter tonight.

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll also do a handover
for the military affairs.

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,920
Tomorrow, I'll go with you.

50
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,200
This is the deadline.

51
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,650
If we don't break the confinement,

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
there's no chance in doing so again.

53
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,360
But...

54
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,120
No buts, Lu Ping.

55
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
All these years,

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,850
haven't you fought hard to survive

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,560
and to live like a human?

58
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
If they truly regard you as a friend,

59
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,960
they will understand.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Tomorrow at noon,

61
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,200
I'll be waiting for you
at Xinghua Restaurant.

62
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,970
[Tomorrow at noon,]

63
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,410
[ I'll be waiting for you
at Xinghua Restaurant.]

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,000
Hey!

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
You rascal.

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,040
What are you standing there for?

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,570
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you?

68
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,120
You only got to meet Mr. Wen
because of me.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,960
Shouldn't you thank me?

70
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,280
Sure.

71
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,000
We'll go to the best restaurant
in Kaifeng.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,200
This is the best restaurant in Kaifeng?

73
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,360
No.

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,130
But it has the best wine in Kaifeng.

75
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,200
But I only have...

76
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,520
Let's see...

77
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
Ten cash.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
We'll buy as much with this as we can.

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
Sir.

80
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,160
I want ten cash worth of wine.

81
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,880
Sir. Please come in.

82
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,700
This ten cash worth of wine

83
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,240
wasn't bought by putting a tab
on Qin family's golden badge.

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080
Look.

85
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,720
There's a shooting star.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,530
Since I was in Shanhai Gang,

87
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,520
all I ever had

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,260
was endless torture and pain.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Only when I saw these stars at night
from my cell,

90
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,680
could I feel a moment of peace.

91
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
Even when I fled,

92
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,160
they guided my path.

93
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,320
Su Tang once told me,

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,159
if you want to give someone a gift,

95
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,480
you have to be sincere.

96
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm sharing my most precious starry sky

97
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,560
with you.

98
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,130
Aren't we supposed to be looking at stars?

99
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
Why are you looking at me?

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
I...

101
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Thank you.

102
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't mention it.

103
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,020
It's not just because of Wen Gecheng.

104
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,530
It's also for everything that's happened

105
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,560
after I've met you.

106
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,360
Qin Sang.

107
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,890
I witnessed all sorts of wickedness
in Shanhai Gang.

108
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,490
You are the one who showed me

109
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,780
that in this world,

110
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,140
there are still wonderful things
just like the starry sky.

111
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,620
Sometimes, I think to myself,

112
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,800
why did I escape from Shanhai Gang?

113
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,720
Perhaps...

114
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,040
It's so that I can be with you,

115
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
to gaze upon a sky like this tonight.

116
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,200
Lu Ping.

117
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,100
You're really crafty.

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,560
You only spent ten cash

119
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,610
and you managed to buy
the most beautiful starry sky in Kaifeng.

120
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,380
There is wine tonight.

121
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,530
There are stars.

122
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,410
There is also you by my side.

123
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I'll accept your gift of gratitude.

124
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,520
Qin Sang.

125
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,970
I still wish to break the confinement.

126
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,130
I want to live like an ordinary man.

127
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,460
This is a wish
that I've had for ten years.

128
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,780
Is it too much to ask for it?

129
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
Let's treat this as a farewell.

130
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,360
Sir.

131
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,400
These are the four training outfits

132
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,730
that you told us to make.

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
They are made in the latest style
with the newest fabric.

134
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
Once you put them on,

135
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
you'll surely look gorgeous

136
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,360
at the Soul Combat Convention.

137
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,280
Take a look.

138
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,400
How is it?

139
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
Xifan.

140
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Are you in your right mind?

141
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,880
You can't even bear to have a good meal.

142
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,940
Where did you get so much money
to buy such nice clothes?

143
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Sir.

144
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,560
I'll pay for the remaining fees

145
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,890
with this jade pendant.

146
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,400
Do you think it's all right?

147
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Let me have a look.

148
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,400
We only accept taels,

149
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,840
not pawns.

150
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,960
But since you're both so sincere,

151
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,440
I'll reluctantly accept it.

152
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Give it back.

153
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Xifan.

154
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,610
I think this jade pendant is quite old.

155
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,560
You've always carried it on you.

156
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,320
Can this be your heirloom?

157
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
I really don't know what you're thinking.

158
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,960
It's not worth pawning your heirloom

159
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,320
for a few training outfits.

160
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,560
They are not some dragon robes.

161
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,400
Moreover,

162
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
it will be a tough fight tomorrow.

163
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,640
Who knows?

164
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,800
The outfits might get torn quickly.

165
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,640
Let's go.

166
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,360
I have yet to recover.

167
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,200
I've only managed to come this far

168
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,680
because of your help.

169
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,700
Tomorrow, we're going against Luo Ting.

170
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,360
It must be a tough fight.

171
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,090
I just want to do something
within my power

172
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
to boost everyone's morale.

173
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,020
Don't hold me back.

174
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,240
Gentlemen, take care.

175
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,480
If the Soul Combat Convention
awards the most obstinate person,

176
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,000
you can win with your eyes closed.

177
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,320
But don't you worry.

178
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
We might not be as skilled as Ms.Qin.

179
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Her opponent didn't even get to attack.

180
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,400
But we have Lu Ping.

181
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,560
Even if a great martial artist like me
doesn't take the stage,

182
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,220
he can defeat Luo Ting anyway.

183
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,400
Don't worry.

184
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,050
As for the jade pendant,

185
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,920
don't mention it to them.

186
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,520
All right.

187
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,600
I'll let you be the unsung hero.

188
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,360
Let's hurry back to show them.

189
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,760
Let's see if these training outfits

190
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,560
can bring out the valiance in me.

191
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,440
Let's go.

192
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,360
Let's go.

193
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,640
Lu Ping.

194
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Are you really leaving?

195
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,970
What about the second round tomorrow?

196
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,320
We came to the convention

197
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,650
in the first place
to look for Wen Gecheng.

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
Now that the purpose is served,

199
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,880
we don't have to go on with it.

200
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,760
Lu Ping.

201
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,200
Xifan hasn't fully recovered

202
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,440
and Luo Ting hates
Zhaifeng Institute to the core.

203
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,280
He won't go easy on us in combat.

204
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,120
If we both leave,

205
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,080
Mo Lin is all that Xifan has.

206
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,410
They will definitely lose to Luo Ting.

207
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,240
They can surrender
if they can't defeat him.

208
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,040
Lu Ping.

209
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,880
You know what Xifan is like.

210
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,680
This concerns the honor
of Zhaifeng Institute.

211
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,880
I'm afraid he won't surrender.

212
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,640
He might get himself killed.

213
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,180
If it ends up like that,

214
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,360
we'll get Assassin Boy
to poison him senseless

215
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,810
and drag him off-stage.

216
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,840
Lu Ping!

217
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
Lu Ping.

218
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,800
Are you in your right mind?

219
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,720
We've come this far.

220
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,800
You're going to abandon us?

221
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,130
So what if I abandon you?

222
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,080
You're a useless bum without any strength.

223
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,740
I find you a nuisance ages ago.

224
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,320
Lu Ping!

225
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,000
Lu Ping!

226
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,240
Lu Ping.

227
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,490
After all that we've been through,

228
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,880
I thought you've regarded yourself
as a disciple of Zhaifeng Institute.

229
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,720
I don't.

230
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,440
Zhaifeng Institute has always been

231
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,080
just a camouflage for me.

232
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,200
What if I'd like you to stay?

233
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,560
These are the training outfits
that were custom made.

234
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,600
Haven't you been complaining
that we didn't have a decent uniform?

235
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,440
I've told you.

236
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,720
We can't lose anyone
in Zhaifeng Institute.

237
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,600
As long as we fight alongside each other,

238
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,060
we can surely win the convention
and make our institute proud.

239
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,800
Zhao Xifan.

240
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,880
Why should I care if you can make
the institution proud?

241
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
I finally figured it out.

242
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,330
You're just a hypocrite
through and through.

243
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,960
Lu Ping.

244
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,920
What do you mean by that?

245
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
You want me to stay

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,120
because you are no match for them.

247
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,160
You needed me as God of Bandits
to help with your tasks.

248
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,040
Now, you need me on the team
in order to win the convention.

249
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,120
Don't keep up false appearances
if you're incompetent.

250
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,400
Weren't you going to give up
the badge of eldest disciple?

251
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,240
Sure.

252
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
Give it to me now.

253
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,560
I'm going to tell the judges now

254
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
that Zhaifeng Institute is disbanded.

255
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
We're quitting the contest.

256
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,920
Fine.

257
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,360
Lu Ping.

258
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,840
Leave.

259
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,600
Leave now!

260
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
Zhaifeng Institute

261
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,820
is no longer your concern.

262
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,900
Even if I'm the last one standing,

263
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,140
I'll keep fighting until the end.

264
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,480
Sure.

265
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,329
Then you better pray
a few more times tonight.

266
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,619
You're on your own now.

267
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,080
Lu Ping.

268
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,010
You really broke Xifan's heart this time.

269
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,920
Good.

270
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,880
He'll stop pestering me.

271
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,320
Lu Ping.

272
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,200
I know what you have in mind.

273
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,120
You deliberately spoke harshly

274
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,400
so that Xifan would make you leave.

275
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
Then you won't feel so bad.

276
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,520
Am I right?

277
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,280
Lu Ping.

278
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,800
You actually care
about Zhaifeng Institute, right?

279
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
Not at all.

280
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm not like him.

281
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,320
He wants to be a hero.

282
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,480
He wants to carry
Zhaifeng Institute forward.

283
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,250
But all I ever wanted

284
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
was to be an ordinary person.

285
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,320
If I keep competing,

286
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,320
my identity might be unraveled.

287
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,360
By then, Shanhai Gang
will come after me again.

288
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,940
Who will be able to protect me?

289
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,400
Su Tang.

290
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,660
Can you let me act selfishly for once?

291
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,160
I've thought of a way.

292
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,960
You can leave.

293
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,960
I'll stay.

294
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,880
Su Tang.

295
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,600
As a child, I lost my family.

296
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,840
All this while,

297
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,880
I knew you had been protecting me
in Shanhai Gang.

298
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,040
You are my brother.

299
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,640
Whatever decision you make,

300
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,640
as your sister,

301
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll always support you.

302
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,800
You'll go with Mr. Wen
to break your confinement.

303
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,320
I'll watch over Xifan for you.

304
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,580
Isn't that a good idea?

305
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,000
-But...
-Don't worry.

306
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,290
I won't let Xifan take any risk.

307
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,520
[Forget it.]

308
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,660
[My future is uncertain.]

309
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,800
[If you stay with him,]

310
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
[you'll have someone to depend on.]

311
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,960
Xifan.

312
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,980
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

313
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,200
If you're angry,

314
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,280
I'll drug Lu Ping with some laxatives.

315
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
It will definitely keep him from leaving.

316
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
What do you think?

317
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,880
Xifan.

318
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Is he meditating?

319
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,370
He just had a fight with Lu Ping.

320
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,600
Lu Ping is leaving with Wen Gecheng.

321
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
He's not competing
in the convention tomorrow.

322
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,880
Xifan has been meditating since.

323
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,680
He said he is going to recover quickly.

324
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,010
He won't talk to anyone.

325
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Xifan.

326
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,650
You rascal, you are making me worried.

327
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,640
Master.

328
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
I have some medicine
to dispel blood stasis.

329
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,680
Good. Give it to him quickly.

330
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
How are you feeling?

331
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,920
He is feeling better.

332
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,160
Xifan.

333
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,920
The process comes first.

334
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,200
The results come second.

335
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
It's the participation that matters.

336
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,450
Your health is more important.

337
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,760
Master.

338
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,410
I know you're just saying that
to make me feel better.

339
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,850
But I failed to keep Lu Ping with us.

340
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,120
As the eldest disciple,

341
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,120
that was my dereliction of duty.

342
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,770
I can't embarrass
Zhaifeng Institute again.

343
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,760
Mo Lin.

344
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,920
Step outside.

345
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,720
I have to speak with my disciple.

346
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,520
You're new here
so you have no right to listen in.

347
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,400
Step outside.

348
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,840
As your mentor,

349
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,650
I'll be honest with you.

350
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,280
I've sent you here

351
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,520
to protect Lu Ping.

352
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't care if you win or not.

353
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,760
Master, what did you say?

354
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,920
Protect Lu Ping.

355
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,600
Didn't he tell you?

356
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,360
He is not here to take part
in the convention either.

357
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,240
Then...

358
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,530
What about surpassing Beidou?

359
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,080
The crazier we seem, the safer we are.

360
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,300
This is a strategy.

361
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,200
Do you get it?

362
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,360
It's always about Lu Ping!

363
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,160
You taught us to punish evil,
promote the good,

364
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
get rid of bullies, and help the weak.

365
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,090
Is all that a lie?

366
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,840
You have nothing to do anyway.

367
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,820
Might as well make some money.

368
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,520
Xifan.

369
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
I know.

370
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,720
I'm not a competent mentor.

371
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,520
So you don't have to go all out
for Zhaifeng Institute either.

372
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,880
It's not worth it.

373
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,120
It is worth it.

374
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,720
Xifan.

375
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,440
I don't mean to disobey you.

376
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Since I joined Zhaifeng Institute,

377
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,610
since I was mentored by you,

378
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,500
it has been my ambition
to protect Zhaifeng Institute.

379
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,520
Even if no one is truly devoted

380
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,210
to Zhaifeng Institute now,

381
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,240
I will still choose to protect it.

382
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,210
Master, please agree to it.

383
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,400
As if I would.

384
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,120
I am your mentor.

385
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
You have to obey my decision.

386
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,920
I won't.

387
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,800
You're such a stubborn mule.

388
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,930
This is so annoying.

389
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,920
Must you compete?

390
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,640
I must.

391
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,560
Fine.

392
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
I'll make you a wager.

393
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,200
If you win, I'll let you compete.

394
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,040
If you lose,

395
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,450
you must return to Chenqiao immediately.

396
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,760
Why are you sneaking around?

397
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,640
Mo Lin.

398
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,330
What is going on?

399
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,880
It's complicated.

400
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,880
They seemed to have had an argument.

401
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,920
They are parting ways.

402
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,410
Say something nice.

403
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,480
Xifan.

404
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,320
Tomorrow, you'll be in grave danger.

405
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Just like this hand,

406
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,840
you'll be alone without any help.

407
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,320
If you can lift this table up
with the strength of your palm,

408
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,580
I will let you compete.

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,920
Go ahead.

410
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,760
Master.

411
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
This table is made of stone.

412
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Not to mention that Xifan
doesn't have any soul power now,

413
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,530
but even if he does,
he might not be able to lift it.

414
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,960
I have an idea.

415
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
If I succeed,

416
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,800
Su Tang and Mo Lin,

417
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,730
will you compete with me tomorrow?

418
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,600
I have come back to help you.

419
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,400
Since my disciple is staying,

420
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,960
as the greatest assassin in the world,

421
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,220
how can I get cold feet?

422
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,970
Later, the two of you...

423
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Great idea.

424
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,460
Xifan, you're really something.

425
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
You're too crafty.

426
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,560
Master.

427
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
You said we can't replace him,

428
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,640
but you didn't say we can't work together.

429
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
You said one palm,

430
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,480
but you didn't say
we can't use five fingers.

431
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,810
Xifan used two fingers,

432
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,960
I used two,

433
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,300
and Mo Lin used one.

434
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
That makes five fingers.

435
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,640
We've helped Xifan form one palm today.

436
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,800
We'll also fight alongside him tomorrow.

437
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,520
All right, whatever.

438
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,720
You've all grown up.

439
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
Bear this in mind.

440
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,680
Make sure to return alive tomorrow.

441
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,680
Yes.

442
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,840
Master.

443
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,720
You haven't seen the new outfit we made.

444
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,880
I'll show them to you.

445
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,680
Sure.

446
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,720
Su Tang.

447
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,300
Thank you for staying.

448
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,780
I've stayed behind

449
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,080
to help you,

450
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,560
but also to make Lu Ping worry less.

451
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,960
I hope he can return to Zhaifeng Institute

452
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,040
for my sake.

453
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,360
Let's hope so.

454
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,740
The second round is tomorrow.

455
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,120
Can you help me enhance

456
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,160
my soul power a bit more?

457
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,440
Young Master, Master gave orders

458
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,040
that you can't use the skills
of Marrow Washing in public.

459
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
I really can't help you again.

460
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,480
I don't care.

461
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,200
Anyway, for tomorrow's second round,

462
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,460
I must not be defeated.

463
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,880
Otherwise, how am I
to propose to Sangsang?

464
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
Mr. Wei.

465
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
Luo Ting.

466
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,210
Why did you ask to see me?

467
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm here to congratulate you
for making it past the first round.

468
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,520
But I heard that

469
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,840
you lost to Lu Ping and his gang
in Chan State.

470
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,000
Yet now, your soul power
suddenly improved.

471
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,240
You made it past
the first round with ease.

472
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,640
I would really like
to ask you for some tips.

473
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,120
What's your secret?

474
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,720
Why should I tell you?

475
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,920
You don't understand.

476
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
The aristocrats in the capital

477
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,610
have their own social circles.

478
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,120
It's the same for Qin Sang.

479
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,840
Although you're young and talented,

480
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,280
without a few local friends,

481
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
I'm afraid you'll still be shunned.

482
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,160
If you're willing

483
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,220
to share your tips with me,

484
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,920
I'll be your sworn brother.

485
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,200
By then, you'll have lots of chances

486
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,600
to approach Qin Sang.

487
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,640
Really?

488
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,400
Is there such a skill?

489
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,160
You can borrow power from others?

490
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,960
Luo Ting.

491
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,320
I think the champion
of this Soul Combat Convention

492
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,640
is definitely ours.

493
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,480
-Qiao Ying.
-Yes.

494
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
Go to one of the examiners.

495
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
Rat Wei Tianqi out.

496
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,160
Just say that

497
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,240
he has brought his personal guards
with him to the exam.

498
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,040
He even cheated.

499
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,520
Get him to scram sooner.

500
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,840
No one else must know

501
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,640
about Marrow Washing.

502
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,720
This person

503
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,200
mustn't remain in the convention.

504
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,530
I understand, Luo Ting.

505
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,040
A countryside parvenu

506
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,160
dares to dream of making friends with us?

507
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,120
What a fool.

508
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,480
Why are you short of one member?

509
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,880
One of us is injured and decided to quit.

510
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,540
The three of us can keep going.

511
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
Miss.

512
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Tianzhao Academy's male team
is in the East Group.

513
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,520
That saves us the trouble
of going against our peers.

514
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,920
But this year,
the West Group is also very competitive.

515
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
We'll have to be more careful later.

516
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,680
That's odd.

517
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,320
Why isn't Lu Ping here?

518
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,440
Today is the second round

519
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,000
of Soul Combat Convention.

520
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,920
This round,

521
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,440
it tests you on strategy and teamwork.

522
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,240
The venue is the woods below you.

523
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,760
The woods is divided
into half by the red rope

524
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,680
for the East and West groups.

525
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,240
Not only are you up against

526
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
complex terrains,

527
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,290
but also the attacks from other teams.

528
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,440
The last standing team of each group

529
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,810
is the winning team.

530
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,880
You'll go straight into the finals.

531
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,840
Although lives are taken on battlefields,

532
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,960
His Majesty is too kind.

533
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,760
Every team leader will receive

534
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,600
an emergency smoke bomb.

535
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,640
When your lives are in danger,

536
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,040
you can use it to seek aid.

537
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Once it is lit,

538
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,720
it's deemed that the team surrendered.

539
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,010
There are four hours in this round.

540
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,400
Now, every team will enter the venue

541
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,640
according to the order
of the lots were drawn.

542
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,560
You have time

543
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,040
until half a joss stick burns out

544
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,880
to select a spot that best you.

545
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,720
The competition will commence

546
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,760
at the sound of the drum.

547
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,440
We're in the same group as that bummer.

548
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,320
How unlucky.

549
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,000
You're still short of a person
right before the competition starts.

550
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,880
Was he too scared to wake up
after hearing that

551
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,220
you are up against Tianzhao Academy?

552
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,480
Tackling weasels like you?

553
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,410
The greatest assassin in the world
can handle it.

554
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,920
So you are Xifan?

555
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,960
You might as well gloat now when you can.

556
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm afraid you won't get another chance.

557
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,480
Xifan.

558
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,600
They seem so arrogant.

559
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
They must have some dirty tricks.

560
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,140
It will be a tough fight today.

561
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,560
I already guessed

562
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,960
that Luo Ting will resort to some tricks.

563
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,800
Later,

564
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,480
just follow me.

565
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,540
How about here?

566
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
Mo Lin.

567
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,440
Before the drum is sounded,

568
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,800
set a trap here

569
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,240
as our defense.

570
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,520
Xifan.

571
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,160
Instead of acting like cowards,

572
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,400
why don't we rush out and fight?

573
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,800
This is unlike you.

574
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,120
Su Tang.

575
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
You don't get it, do you?

576
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,700
This is called a strategy.

577
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,200
Su Tang.

578
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,560
We're outnumbered.

579
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
My soul of Sound is damaged.

580
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,480
It's hard to distinguish directions.

581
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,000
That's why we can't fight by soul power.

582
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,680
But it's very foggy in here today.

583
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,360
This will play to our advantage.

584
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,040
We just need to hold down our fort here

585
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,760
and wait for them
to fight each other first.

586
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,560
Then we'll find an opportunity.

587
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,080
Yes, Xifan.

588
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Well done, Xifan.

589
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,360
Who knew although you're injured,

590
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,480
your brains are still sharp.

591
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,760
You'll be good at leading an army.

592
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,520
As long as Zhaifeng Institute can win,

593
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,080
I don't care if they call me a coward.

594
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,920
Su Tang.

595
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,970
Come and help me.

596
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,960
We'll show them what I can do.

597
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,880
Let's go.

598
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,760
Hold on.

599
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,320
Su Tang.

600
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,020
You have another task.

601
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,280
Time's up.

602
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,340
Sound the drum.

603
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,800
Luo Ting.

604
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,280
It's foggy in the woods today.

605
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,560
It's harder to search for opponents.

606
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,440
Don't worry.

607
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,720
I've already talked to the other teams.

608
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,320
No one will interfere

609
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,200
with the fight
between Tianzhao and Zhaifeng.

610
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,960
Therefore, if anyone is moving around,

611
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,800
it has to be the Zhaifeng team.

612
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,880
Luo Ting, you're so smart.

613
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,640
Let's see where those weasels
from Zhaifeng Institute

614
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,600
can run off to.

615
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,360
We just have to keep waiting in here.

616
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,659
Someone is coming.

617
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,840
Let's go.

618
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,200
Over here.

619
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,880
What is this?

620
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,640
Gentlemen.

621
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,240
How are you?

622
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,720
Zhao Xifan.

623
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,860
How dare you play such tricks?

624
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,440
When we're up against villains,

625
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,770
who cares about being just and righteous?

626
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,160
Here is a word of advice.

627
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,640
Don't waste your strength.

628
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,900
Here in the worm grass,

629
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
the more you struggle,

630
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,050
the deeper you sink.

631
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,880
Unless you've mastered two souls power,
it's difficult to get out of it.

632
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,360
Why don't you light up

633
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,840
your smoke bomb to surrender?

634
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,960
I'll let you out if you do.

635
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,820
How about that?

636
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,560
Surrender?

637
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,800
The game has just started.

638
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,880
Has he already mastered two souls powers?

639
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,760
How is that possible in such a short time?

640
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,240
I've concealed my soul power

641
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,320
to see what you weasels

642
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,000
have up your sleeves.

643
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Enough nonsense.

644
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,360
Let's fight.

645
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,140
Stop whining like a woman.

646
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,960
Sure.

647
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,360
I'll show you countryside people

648
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,640
that the foundation
of a century-old prestigious family

649
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,000
can't be shaken by a few minions.

650
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,640
Beat them to death!

651
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,280
You had better light your smoke bomb.

652
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,720
If not, no one can survive

653
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,280
under the Sun Streamer Swordplay.

654
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,040
Since we're here in the convention,

655
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,440
we have no fear of death.

656
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,920
Ms. Qin.

657
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,440
Are you going to bully us

658
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
with your standing?

659
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,320
I'm bullying you with my swordplay.

660
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,000
You...

661
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,460
Don't get me wrong.

662
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,160
As for the competition,

663
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,440
I have to win.

664
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,960
Martial arts practitioners

665
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,560
should act more righteously

666
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,520
instead of pitting your lives
against mine here.

667
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,320
Don't worry.

668
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,660
Even if you lose the competition,

669
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,080
I'll still refer you to my brother.

670
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,760
Thank you, miss.

671
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,840
Let's go.

672
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,720
Let's go.

673
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,840
Ziyan.

674
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,490
We're almost done here.

675
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,530
Let's check out the East Group.

676
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,960
But according to the rules,

677
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,920
we can't leave our own venue.

678
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,840
Ms. Qin has been fighting alongside us.

679
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,700
She has never left the West Group.

680
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,160
See?

681
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,840
That's how you should abuse authority.

682
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,200
Miss.

683
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,320
The Zhaifeng Institute.

684
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,240
Look.

685
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,880
How did Luo Ting

686
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,490
improve so much overnight?

687
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,800
He must have used some dirty tricks.

688
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,320
What a bully.

689
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,120
That's odd.

690
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,200
Why isn't Lu Ping here yet?

691
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,780
Xifan and the others obviously
aren't a match for Luo Ting.

692
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,400
Could Mr. Lu be injured elsewhere?

693
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,560
[Qin Sang.]

694
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,850
I still wish to break the confinement.

695
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,800
I want to live like an ordinary man.

696
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,920
This is a wish
that I've had for ten years.

697
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,380
Is it too much to ask for it?

698
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,600
This is bad.

699
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,010
I'm afraid he is never coming back.

700
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,920
That rascal.

701
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,720
He has gone back on his word.

702
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
He said he would compete against me.

703
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,680
Ziyan.

704
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
Stay here.

705
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,450
I'll be away for a while.

706
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Miss.

707
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,680
What about the competition?

708
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,940
We have plenty of time.

709
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
We don't have any more opponents anyway.

710
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,260
I'll be right back.

711
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,240
You'll keep an eye on Zhaifeng Institute.

712
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,200
Xifan might not last much longer.

713
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,760
If anything goes wrong,

714
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,620
light a cloud of smoke to alert me.

715
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,600
I wonder which rascal

716
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,920
dares to rat me out?

717
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,040
Doesn't he know who my father is?

718
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,840
Soul Combat Convention?

719
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,280
How dare they disqualify a talent like me?

720
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,680
They are a mere fly on the wheel.

721
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,800
Young Master,

722
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,080
Master said that if you lose,

723
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,560
you should return to Chan State
as soon as possible.

724
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,400
Wei Ying.

725
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,440
Just because Wei Ming isn't here,

726
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,240
it doesn't mean you get to play boss
and preach at me.

727
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,170
How can there be so many accidents?

728
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,200
Listen.

729
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,440
When the examiner
get to see how gifted I am,

730
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,700
I'll definitely rise from desperation.

731
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,960
Isn't Sangsang competing
in the second round?

732
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,280
What is she doing here?

733
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
Stop right there!

734
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,040
Ms. Qin.

735
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,600
Instead of competing
at the venue this morning,

736
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,000
why are you here to see me?

737
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,000
Lu Ping.

738
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,580
Do you know what happens to deserters

739
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,680
in my brother's army?

740
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,320
[Xinghua Restaurant]

741
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,240
According to the martial law of Shuo,

742
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,900
deserters are to be executed.

743
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,360
It's because those who flee from danger

744
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,000
and disregard the safety of their country
are considered disloyal.

745
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,330
They are deemed unrighteous
for deserting their comrades.

746
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,680
But Lu Ping,

747
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,880
I know you're not like them.

748
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
But today, why did you...

Have you forgotten?

751
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,000
I only attended Soul Combat Convention

752
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,920
in order to find Mr. Wen.

753
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,720
I don't care about winning it.

754

He is now waiting for me
at Xinghua Restaurant.

755
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,040
He is going to get
my confinement unsealed.

756

I've been waiting for this day for years.

757

What did you say?

761
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,200
I said you're a coward.

762
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,520
We made a deal

763
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,460
to compete fair and just for once.

764
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,610
Yet now, you're getting cold feet.

765
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,080
You're clearly worried
about Xifan and others.

766

But you insist on saying you're not.
