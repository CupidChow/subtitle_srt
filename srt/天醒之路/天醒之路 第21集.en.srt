Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 21

4
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,079
Elder.

5
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
I know you miss him.

6
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
You don’t want to believe his death.

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,480
I don’t miss him.

8
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,440
He didn’t want to come back.

9
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
Before master died,

10
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
I've been told some obscure things.

11
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,579
He told Master Chu Min to take me here.

12
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,200
He knew I would meet you.

13
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,570
He used you to stimulate my competitive mind.

14
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
He led me to Qisha Institute.

15
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,800
He sealed my power of force temporarily

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,530
by connecting star to destiny.

17
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
So that I can practice the Force of Sound

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
to the extreme,

19
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,720
and get The Horn.

20
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,640
Guo Wushu,

21
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,240
your brother had his plan.

22
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,440
He wanted Lu Ping to gain perseverance.

23
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,640
He wanted me to take my responsibility.

24
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,680
He also wanted to make you understand

25
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,290
with the help of Lu Ping.

26
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,800
Elder,

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,650
in my opinion, years ago

28
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,579
when master made the bet with you,

29
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,010
he wanted you to train yourself

30
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
here without thinking too much.

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,320
Now he sent me here to meet you.

32
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,760
He may tell you that

33
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,480
you have to move on

34
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,170
since you have made achievements.

35
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,340
[Guo Youdao  Guo Wushu]

36
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,760
Elder,

37
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,840
if you still feel bad,

38
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,280
I can be your disciple from now on

39
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,680
and compete with you.

40
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,960
Don’t bother.

41
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,120
I already have a disciple.

42
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Let’s go back.

43
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,960
Master,

44
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,520
we can’t let Lu Ping go.

45
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,260
I must take revenge on him.

46
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,840
Why?

47
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Your parents were killed by Shanhai Gang.

48
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,720
You should avenge them.

49
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
Why seeking Lu Ping?

50
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,120
But, master…

51
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,680
Go back.

52
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,890
It’s time for training.

53
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,840
Training?

54
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,159
Why?

55
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,530
We still have competition.

56
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,080
I lost this time

57
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,960
but I won’t next time.

58
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,380
Do you understand?

59
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,360
Yes.

60
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,200
You seem a waste

61
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,640
but you are strong minded.

62
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Guo Youdao was a good teacher.

63
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,490
How can I lose to him?

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,720
I have to find a person

65
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,650
to inherit my skills as Master of Kaiyang.

66
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
Yes. Master.

67
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,580
Master Chu Min.

68
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,080
I have one more question.

69
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,040
Why do I remember the tune

70
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,010
made by the Horn?

71
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,640
How can the power of my lock

72
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,840
resonates with the Horn and broke itself?

73
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,560
Why did master ask me

74
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,420
to take the weapon of Master Leng,

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,680
not others’?

76
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,000
Why do I…

77
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,960
How come you have so many “whys”?

78
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,000
Sometimes,

79
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,320
fate would find

80
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
its own way.

81
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,760
Master,

82
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
what kind of person is Master Leng?

83
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,880
He was upright and honest.

84
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,890
He had the best martial skill in the world.

85
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,280
He deserved the name of hero

86
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,040
and the respect of millions of people.

87
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,080
Go.

88
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,480
Salute to

89
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,000
your master

90
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,770
and Master Leng.

91
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,600
Yes.

92
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,200
Master Leng, thank you for your weapon.

93
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
I will put it into good use

94
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,700
instead of ruining it.

95
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,740
Master Chu Min,

96
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,299
why are you crying?

97
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,240
None of your business.

98
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,720
You are sick.

99
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Go back to have a rest.

100
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,320
I won’t care about

101
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
what you do next.

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,330
But you have to remember

103
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,120
you have only one life.

104
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,760
Plan well

105
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,920
before you act.

106
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,530
What about you, master?

107
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,880
I am always lazy.

108
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,440
But I am at least the master of a peak.

109
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,920
I have to take

110
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,160
my responsibility.

111
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,660
[Leng Xiutan]
[Guo Youdao]

112
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
How about Elder Guo?

113
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
He may have moved on.

114
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
Something happened

115
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
in the Fifth College.

116
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,490
Senior Xu left Big Dipper just now.

117
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,800
Why did he

118
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,500
leave so suddenly?

119
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
He stole your skilled pace

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
but he still lost.

121
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,200
He was embarrassed to stay.

122
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
He indeed had no morality

123
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,280
but he has his own reason.

124
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,250
Read the letter left by senior.

125
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,560
Dear my fellow classmates,

126
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,520
I was not skilled enough to win.

127
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,160
I set a bad example for you

128
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,720
and don’t deserve the position of your senior.

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,920
Because of the war between Shuo and Tan,

130
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,760
there are refugees around the border.

131
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
I felt sad when I heard about it.

132
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
I made no achievements here.

133
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,930
So, I’d better join the army

134
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,800
to make my own contribution to the country.

135
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,280
I was honored to be one of you.

136
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
I will miss you all.

137
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Good bye.

138
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,240
Yours,

139
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,040
Xu Weifeng.

140
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
Senior was the only son in Xu Family in Jiangning.

141
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,210
He may be counted as a son of a noble family.

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
Xu Family in Jiangning?

143
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,920
Is he the son of Xu Yanling,

144
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,640
the Military Minister of Tan?

145
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,880
You are knowledgeable. Yes.

146
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,520
Why did he come here

147
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
instead of becoming an official?

148
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,340
You may not know the story.

149
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,280
Senior has always wanted to join the army.

150
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,760
But he can’t

151
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,000
because of his asthma.

152
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,760
Several years ago, he came here

153
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,660
and trained himself hard.

154
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,680
He always hoped to get the Horn

155
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,520
and improve himself.

156
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,740
In this way,

157
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,880
he can join the army by himself.

158
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,120
But who knows?

159
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,440
You got it first.

160
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,840
There are thousands of weapons in Qisha Institute.

161
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,920
Why do you want The Horn?

162
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,080
It is the best.

163
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,800
You should have a reason.

164
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Does that matter?

165
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,280
There is only one The Horn.

166
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,740
What is fair competition?

167
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,890
There is no morality but to win or lose.

168
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,860
That’s why he said that

169
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,480
there is no morality

170
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
but to win or lose.

171
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,120
Senior Huo,

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,040
you know all those trivial things

173
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,360
but you never said important things like that.

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,680
Senior keeps a low profile

175
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,140
and dislikes showing off.

By the way,

who knows there will be Junior Lu?

178
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,120
He just entered Qisha Institute

179
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,380

where are you going?

182
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,970
Although I didn’t know him before,

183
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,640
he was here before me.

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,880
And I, the latter, got the fruit.

185
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,680
I must care about him.

186

Do you want to go with me?

187

My father and brother also

188

I am not as good as that Mr. Xu.

Since you want to fetch him,

192

I will go with you.

do you also want to help?

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,640
You were punished to come here

196
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,420
because you helped refugees.

197
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,960
And Senior Zimu, Senior Jin Qi,

198

don’t we want to go out of here?

I have told you many times that
I’m not your master.

You can’t regret.

After all,

I can’t get a disciple of my own.

It’s equal for me to have a master.

Why don’t you eat?

Minister Xu stands for negotiation.

351
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,240
So do you.

352
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,720
People have nothing to do

353
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
with war or peace.

354
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,080
Please be kind when you can.

355
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,680
I will agree since

356
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
you have said like that.

357
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,400
But, you have to be responsible

358
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,100
in case anything happens.

359
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,210
Military Minister!

360
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,040
Lu Ping,

361
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,020
when did you find another backup?

362
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,200
Mr. Xu,

363
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,240
thank you for your help.

364
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,250
You are welcome.

365
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,520
When will you stop enduring?

366
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,280
Take care of yourself

367
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,770
after taking care of the refugees.

368
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
I have a mansion

369
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
at Qingfeng Alley in the west.

370
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,200
Let’s go there.

371
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,840
Senior Xu.

372
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,060
[Breeze Mansion]

373
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,680
Master, he’s alright.

374
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,200
Just superficial hurt.

375
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
He was born weak.

376
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,120
He ran so fast and fainted.

377
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,920
He will wake up after a while.

378
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,560
But we have waited for quite a while.

379
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,380
What are you doing, Mo Lin?

380
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,170
It’s you who want him to wake up.

381
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,320
Mr. Xu,

382
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,880
are you OK?

383
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,280
I’m OK. Don’t worry.

384
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,240
Are you silly?

385
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,690
I can keep away from that sword.

386
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,960
You almost broke your

387
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,810
arm because of falling.

388
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,760
Naturally, men have to stand out

389
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,200
in danger.

390
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,160
I won’t let women to suffer.

391
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,600
Men?

392
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,560
Stop kidding.

393
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,000
My master is powerful.

394
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,480
But for your falling down,

395
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,210
she could have broken the wall.

396
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
It’s my order.

397
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
After making your medicine,

398
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,280
just go to your leader

399
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
to see if you can help.

400
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Go.

401
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,360
I apologize for

402
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,730
my offense just now.

403
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,200
That’s OK.

404
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,680
What matters is that we saved refugees.

405
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,040
According to my master,

406
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,680
we learn martial arts to help others.

407
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,570
Although they can’t pay for us,

408
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,920
we, for most of the time, steal the rich

409
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,440
and give the money to the poor.

410
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,840
We can ask for nothing from the poor.

411
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,720
The remarks from your master

412
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,120
is very special.

413
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,040
Don’t be so formal.

414
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
Just call me Su Tang.

415
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,320
Have your medicine first.

416
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,040
It is the wonder drug made by Mo Lin.

417
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,000
Although he doesn’t do well in other things,

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,260
he is good at medicine.

419
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,440
I forgot your wound.

420
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Let me help you.

421
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,010
Isn’t it bitter?

422
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
I have some sugar.

423
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,320
Oh yes,

424
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,480
have those refugees been arranged?

425
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,530
Don’t worry.

426
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,480
My brother and Qin Sang have dealt with it.

427
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,410
Just have a rest.

428
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,530
Lu Ping is your brother.

429
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,970
What about Miss Qin?

430
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,840
She?

431
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,020
Just a follower of my brother.

432
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,800
Strange. Who is cursing me?

433
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,720
Are you OK?

434
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,520
I’m OK.

435
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
My brother used to help refugees.

436
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,120
I have learned a lot

437
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,920
by his side.

438
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,040
Mr. Lu and Miss Qin,

439
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,680
thank you for your help.

440
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,960
I thank you on behalf of us.

441
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,520
Bao Niang,

442
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,680
-Please get up.
-Please get up.

443
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,120
-Please get up.
-Please get up.

444
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,920
Please get up.

445
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,800
It is Senior Xu who saved you all.

446
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,320
I was just a passer-by.

447
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,200
It is our fortune to have

448
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,120
kind people like

449
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,640
you and Miss Qin.

450
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,480
You are welcome.

451
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,040
Are you embarrassed?

452
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,240
Bao Niang,

453
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,720
we have not been praised

454
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,520
for a long time in the Fifth College.

455
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,320
What about praising us?

456
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Come on! Come on!

457
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,840
Let’s go to thank them.

458
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,720
Thank you for your help.

459
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,250
Thank you for your help.

460
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,080
You didn’t care about

461
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,760
such things before.

462
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,400
I got the weapon of their master.

463
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,640
By the way,

464
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,720
I am homeless now.

465
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
It is good

466
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,880
to help others go home.

467
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,640
Lu Ping,

468
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,060
you have changed a little.

469
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,520
But I like you

470
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
as you are now.

471
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
I can’t stand it.

472
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,680
I can’t stand it.

473
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,960
I can’t stand it.

474
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,180
What again?

475
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,840
Master and I searched for you all the way.

476
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
She said she missed you

477
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,860
but now she stayed in the room of that toy boy.

478
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Ungrateful girl.

479
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,320
What?

480
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,010
What are you saying, Mo Lin?

481
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,720
Boss, see?

482
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,600
What?

483
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,880
Brother, hear what he just said?

484
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
She always hurts people using her beauty.

485
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,360
Bully me using her power.

486
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,800
You!

487
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,760
Wait a moment.

488
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,240
How did you come to E’zhou?

489
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,680
I was about to tell you.

490
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,880
We were told to by Xifan’s father.

491
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,090
It was like that.

492
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,880
We came near Big Dipper

493
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
and encountered the refugees.

494
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,640
We meet again.

495
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,660
Have you mentioned Shanhai Gang?

496
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
You may not know it.

497
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,680
Shanhai Gang used to be an evil gang

498
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,120
in the north, which always

499
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,760
mugs people in Jianghu.

500
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,600
Whoever received Shanhai Token

501
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,080
were missed or dead.

502
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,200
Lu Ping…

503
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,840
He was tortured there.

504
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,320
Forget it.

505
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,090
Not long before,

506
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,240
when I took part in the convention

507
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,200
with my fellow disciples in Zhaifeng,

508
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,000
I found that the gang has

509
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,200
spies in the court.

510
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,320
We destroyed their plan.

511
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,480
And my sect was destroyed

512
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,240
because of it.

513
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,800
My master also died.

514
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,840
It is said that Shanhai Gang

515
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,640
sends their spies around Shuo Country all along.

516
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,960
What are they doing here in E’zhou?

517
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
On my way to E’zhou,

518
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,720
I heard the two countries had exchanged
negotiation contracts.

519
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,880
They will negotiate in E’zhou.

520
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,240
The gang may have something

521
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,640
to do during the negotiation.

522
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,040
Shanhai Gang

523
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,000
either sends spies,

524
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,300
or does evil things at the border.

525
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,920
They never change!

526
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,730
Senior Huo Ying,

527
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,480
it is very important.

528
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,480
Would you go back to Big Dipper first

529
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
and tell Master Chu Min and Master Li?

530
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,940
People from Shanhai Gang are skilled fighters.

531
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,840
I’m afraid the army may fail to defend

532
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,040
and we need help from Big Dipper.

533
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,160
Qin Sang and I stay here

534
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
and search for information.

535
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,860
I should have been with you

536
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,850
but I have to arrange refugees.

537
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,850
That’s alright.

538
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,680
My assassin brother is good at medicine.

539
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,400
He can help you.

540
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,720
I…

541
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,720
Why me?

542
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
Brother, I will lend a hand.

543
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,480
Me, too.

544
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
Xu Family have some friends here.

545
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,240
I will help you if you need.

546
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,640
By the way, my father set off

547
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,880
from Jiangning with the negotiation team.

548
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,080
I will also tell him

549
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,440
to take care.

550
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,640
What a coincidence!

551
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,920
My brother will come to E’zhou.

552
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,160
With his help,

553
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,580
Shanhai Gang is bound to be captured.

554
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,400
Good.

555
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,050
Since we have all found our places,

556
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,440
let’s start in no time.

557
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,320
Yes.

558
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,160
Lu Ping,

559
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,120
I always want to say that…

560
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,160
What?

561
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,040
I actually want to speak for my brother.

562
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
He hopes to cooperate with you

563
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
in destroying Shanhai Gang.

564
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,920
You know that

565
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,680
I won’t agree.

566
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,160
I know.

567
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,720
It was wrong for him to arrest you.

568
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,320
But what he did was for the country.

569
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,360
I regarded you as a spy from the gang.

570
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,960
You forgave me.

571
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,560
Qin Sang,

572
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,520
I am a disciple of Big Dipper.

573
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,080
According to our rule, disciples are not

574
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,210
allowed to interfere in the politics.

575
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,320
I don’t want to interfere myself.

576
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,600
I just want to be an ordinary man.

577
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
I will deal with Shanhai Gang

578
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,640
by myself.

579
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Oh, Senior Xu said

580
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,530
that you can get the most

581
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,600
information in the teahouse.

582
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,880
Would you like to have

583
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
a cup of tea and investigate with me?

584
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,760
Thanks.

585
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,720
Thanks.

586
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,320
Thanks.

587
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,100
Thanks.

588
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,120
Thanks.

589
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,440
Toy boy!

590
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,840
Mr. Xu.

591
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,040
You all have!

592
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,820
Thanks.

593
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
Don’t hurry.

594
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,960
Can you really break the wall,

595
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
like what Mo Lin said?

596
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
You have helped so many people.

597
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,680
I am nothing compared with you.

598
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,960
Good.

599
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
After the negotiation,

600
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,800
refugees can go home.

601
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,720
They may not.

602
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,080
Why?

603
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,940
You don’t understand.

604
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,720
War or peace between two countries

605
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
is always related to profit.

606
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,920
They may negotiate today

607
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,320
but fight against each other tomorrow.

608
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,080
The ones who suffer…

609
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,960
Take it.

610
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,960
are always ordinary people.

611
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,100
They can do nothing

612
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,120
in such a society.

613
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,560
This world will separate after long time united.

614
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,490
It will also do the opposite
after long time plating.

615
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,240
But I always believe that

616
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
one day there will be an able man

617
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,440
who can unite the world.

618
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,040
He will reign the whole land.

619
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
People will not

620
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,160
suffer again.

621
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,800
Mr. Xu,

622
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,880
what you said is difficult to understand.

623
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,080
I still think that

624
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,760
temporary peace is better

625
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,440
than continuous war.

626
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,840
People can at least stay at their hometown.

627
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
They won’t separate with each other

628
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,340
and there will be less orphans

629
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,840
like my brother and I.

630
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,640
Believe in me.

631
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,130
They are bound to be.

632
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Mr. Xu,

633
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,440
can you do me a favor?

634
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,400
Please.

635
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,920
Come on.

636
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,400
Thanks.

637
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
Well…

638
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,120
Mr. Xu,

639
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,080
Bao Niang lost all her relatives during exile.

640
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,240
Can you give her

641
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,960
a job to do here?

642
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
I seldom live in this mansion

643
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,440
and I don’t need servants.

644
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,760
Since you and your brother are here,

645
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,840
I need a cook here.

646
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Would you like to be the cook?

647
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,280
That’s great.

648
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,200
Thanks.

649
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,840
I will not forget

650
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,640
what you did for me.

651
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,840
Mister,

652
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,140
Miss Su is beautiful and kind.

653
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,320
Don’t lose her.

654
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,240
What? Lose what?

655
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,400
Here.

656
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,760
Here you are.

657
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,520
What is it?

658
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Your reward.

659
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,180
You are beautiful, kind and help lots of people.

660
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,170
The refugees can’t pay you.

661
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,080
I will pay you.

662
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,719
Then I will give you half.

663
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,090
Good boy.

664
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,400
Stop crying.

665
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,120
That’s OK.

666
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,630
That’s OK.

667
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,760
Stop crying. Stop crying.

668
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,489
Stop crying.

669
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,400
Stop crying.

670
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,560
Will you?

671
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,060
[Breeze Mansion]

672
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,960
Master,

673
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,560
you have to stop giving

674
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,410
everyone sugars every day.

675
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,040
Look.

676
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,680
We four are

677
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,680
from Zhaifeng Institute.

678
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Others cannot

679
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,640
enjoy your sugars.

680
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,560
He helped my brother

681
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,250
and brother helped him.

682
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,050
He is no long an “other person”.

683
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,240
In another word,

684
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,080
from now on,

685
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,450
can you give your sugars only to me,

686
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,320
to your brother

687
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,560
and to senior?

688
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,560
Mo Lin,

689
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,000
you are being strange.

690
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
Just say what

691
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,160
you want to say.

692
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,280
I…

693
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,640
I…

694
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,210
You just don’t understand.

695
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,680
Let it go. Let it go.

696
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,210
You are really strange.

697
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,500
Thank god it isn’t broken.

698
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,650
What are you worried about?

699
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,540
Our enemies are in the dark while we are obvious.

700
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
We have no idea where they are

701
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,920
or what they want.

702
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,360
We are like aimless flies.

703
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,440
It

704
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,240
sucks.

705
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,160
We should be steady

706
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,880
at such times.

707
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,840
Wait for

708
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,640
the truth to come out.

709
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,720
Enemies will show themselves.

710
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,640
I haven’t apologized to you

711
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,240
for the Horn.

712
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,160
I lost to you.

713
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,930
Besides, you helped me with the refugees.

714
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,160
Thank you.

715
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,240
By the way,

716
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,720
may I go to General Xu

717
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,640
to see if he can help you?

718
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,200
He will agree.

719
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,480
Thanks.

720
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,720
We are all from the Fifth College.

721
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,080
We have the same aim.

722
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,810
You still hold on even if you are tired out.

723
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,660
You are really like Xifan.

724
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
Xifan?

725
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,000
Is he your senior in Zhaifeng?

726
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,240
He is my first sincere friend

727
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,240
in the world.

728
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,490
He spied in Shanhai Gang

729
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,640
at the risk of his life

730
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,640
in order to help me.

731
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,880
I heard from him that he has left

732
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,280
and would come to me soon.

733
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,530
I will introduce you to him.

734
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,720
You must be familiar.

735
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,200
Lu Ping.

736
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,160
Lu Ping.

737
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
I received a letter wrote with blood.

738
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,080
Something must happen to Xifan.

739
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,240
Senior!

740
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,480
Senior!

741
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,440
Senior!

742
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,400
Senior!

743
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,520
Senior!

744
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,720
Who hurts you?

745
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,000
I spied in Shanhai Gang.

746
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,680
With the help of my father,

747
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,040
everything was going well.

748
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,680
I have made clear all the

749
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,000
secret paths there.

750
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,770
Father asked me to leave early.

751
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,160
I am so greedy.

752
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,450
I want to kill master for you

753
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,860
and end all the things.

754
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,000
But I still had a flaw.

755
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,600
I finally escaped

756
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,780
and even had no time to go to my father.

757
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,560
I come to you first.

758
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,720
It’s good that you are alive.

759
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
You don’t know how I worry about you.

760
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,520
Thank God,

761
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
you are alive.

762
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,720
By the way,

763
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,940
where is Su Tang and Mo Lin?

764
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,080
I left them in E’zhou.

765
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,120
Good.

766
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,160
Zhou Youlong may come at any time.

767
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,160
It is not safe here.

768
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,400
How did you know that

769
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,400
I am in E’zhou Mansion?

770
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,920
Lu Ping,

771
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I have underestimated you.

772
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,840
When did you find it?

773
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,320
I went to Big Dipper with Master Chu Min.

774
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,040
I came to E’zhou just out of

775
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,610
my temporary decision.

776
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,680
Su Tang would not have met me

777
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,440
if they haven’t encountered refugees.

778
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,520
We met just because of coincidence.

779
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,180
You must have investigated it

780
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,880
before you know

781
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,000
all of these.

782
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,000
I suspected you when

783
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,680
we received your letter
sent to Senior Xu’s mansion.

784
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,960
I told Qin Sang to help me behind.

785
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,800
As expected, you…

786
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,000
Lu Ping,

787
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,200
you are indeed Lu Ping,

788
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,680
who is careful all the time.

789
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,880
Xifan,

790
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,360
what did Shanhai Gang give you

791
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,460
to make you sell your brother?

792
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,680
They just warned me that you were

793
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,040
to blame for the destruction of Zhaifeng.

794
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
Only when the awakening is captured by the gang,

795
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,480
can the world be peaceful again.

796
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,080
Senior,Shanhai Gang

797
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,960
was the one who destroyed Zhaifeng.

798
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,040
Please be clear-minded.

799
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,440
Don’t be cheated by them.

800
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,260
Don’t you think I will not prepare

801
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,560
before I come to you?

802
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,640
Yan Xifan,

803
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,600
you sell your brother!

804
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,840
You are my good man!

805
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,840
What are you doing?

806
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,760
Capture him now.
