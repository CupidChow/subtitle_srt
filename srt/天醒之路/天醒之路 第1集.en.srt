Beidou Chamber

other martial arts prodigies.

I've attracted quite a few oddities.

I managed to duck in time,

117
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,680
but what if you hurt Ziyan?

118
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,800
You...

119
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,730
Do you remember what I said?

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,520
If you allow your mistress to wander off,

121
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,800
by law, you should be punished.

122
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,130
You should be beheaded.

123
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,880
I'm sorry. Please forgive me, General Qin.

124
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,800
Get up.

125
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,180
Why do you take the blame for everything?

Qin Qi.

127

the demeanor of the leading
martial arts academy.

129
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,760
Then I can assist you in the future.

130
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,880
Am I right, Mr. Wen?

131
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,400
Ms. Qin has great aspirations.

132

You're indeed
the daughter of a military aristocrat.

There's a message from Chan State.

They were attacked by an unknown force.

137
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,720
They hope you can discuss
the issue with them.

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,260
Who dares to be so bold?

139
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,680
It's Shanhai Gang.

140
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,760
We'll go past Chenqiao Town
on our way back to the capital.

141

Tell them to meet me in Chenqiao Town.

142

I'm coming with you.

143

I'm done.

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,560
I can't move anymore.

160
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,160
-What's going on?
-Exactly.

161
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,400
No way...

162

Lu Ping. Let me carry it for you.

163

You are not to help him.

164

We have to jog ten<span>every day.

165
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
Get up.

166
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,760
You're the eldest disciple.

167
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
Even our master said
that I'm naturally incompetent.

168
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
Your soul of Strength is surely
better than mine.

169
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,200
It's unfair.

170
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,600
Lu Ping.

171
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,100
Su Tang is a girl
and even she can carry it.

172
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,650
As an eight-feet-tall man,

173
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,080
aren't you embarrassed?

174
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
Exactly.

175
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,760
Lu Ping, if you behave like this,

176
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,280
how will Zhaifeng Institute
surpass Beidou Chamber?

177
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Xifan.

178
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,690
What is Beidou Chamber?

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,640
The martial arts academy
in Chan State is huge,

180
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,320
but they didn't dare to say
they want to surpass Beidou.

181
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,850
Our Zhaifeng Institute...

182
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,890
We don't even have decent clothes.

183
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,480
If we keep saying things like this,

184
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,760
we'll be the laughing stock
of Chenqiao Town.

185
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
-Yes.
-Yes, that's right.

186
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,640
Not to mention we have someone
holding us back.

187
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,240
My godbrother had been injured,
so he's frail.

188
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,560
If you have anything against him,

189
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,690
pick a fight with me.

190
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Xifan.

191
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
My back is also sprained.

192
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,360
Just let me off today.

193
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,600
Knock it off.

194
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,010
You can't fool me with such tricks.

195
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,320
No one in Zhaifeng Institute
is allowed to fall behind.

196
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,040
-Even the worst disciple.
-That's right.

197
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,960
Pick it up.

198
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,880
Jog.

199
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,680
Lu Ping, I'll help you.

200
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,480
The valiance of Zhaifeng

201
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,160
surpasses that of Beidou!

202
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,960
The valiance of Zhaifeng

203
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,680
surpasses that of Beidou!

204
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,600
-The valiance of Zhaifeng
-This is really heavy.

205
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,080
surpasses that of Beidou!

206
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,920
The valiance of Zhaifeng

207
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,600
surpasses that of Beidou!

208
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
The valiance of Zhaifeng...

209
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
It's Wen Gecheng.

210
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,440
Are you sure?

211
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,000
I've already asked around.

212
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,840
It must be him.

213
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,880
Keep Zhao Xifan occupied.

214
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,840
I'll be right back.

215
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,640
Be careful.

216
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,800
It seems we can't carry out our task.

217
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
We'll jog towards East City.

218
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,250
Where is Lu Ping?

219
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,600
Xifan.

220
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,130
Where is Lu Ping?

221
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,530
He has gone to the restroom.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,880
Step aside!

223
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,040
Xifan.

224
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,970
Why is Lu Ping always like this?

225
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,480
Exactly.

226
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,400
[Chenqiao Relay Station]

227
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,400
General Qin.

228
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,880
It must have been hard on you
traveling such a long distance.

229
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
Master Wei and I

230
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,040
have prepared a great feast

231
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
to welcome all of you.

232
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,640
Someone is dead

233
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,210
and you're still in the mood to eat?

234
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
This way, please.

235
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,680
Who are you?

236
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,000
Who are you?

237
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,930
I would like to meet Mr. Wen.

238
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,770
I have important information.

239
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Leave right away.

240
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,680
Leave now.

241
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,540
This is the Shanhai Badge.

242
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,960
What is it for?

243
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
I don't know.

244
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,880
After receiving this badge,

245
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,560
several sects in the martial arts world

246
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,840
were either annihilated

247
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,770
or disappeared.

248
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,800
Recently,

249
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,440
the Fengling Gang near Chan State

250
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,040
sent a letter to me for help.

251
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,140
They said they also received
the Shanhai Badge.

252
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,160
General Qin.

253
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,560
I think this is highly unusual

254
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,280
and thus invited you over to discuss it.

255
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,560
This matter is indeed unusual.

256
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,560
General.

257
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,440
I think this is

258
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,040
a normal dispute
in the martial arts world.

259
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,900
Soul Combat Convention
is right around the corner.

260
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,640
It's unwise to be delayed by this.

261
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
Mr. Wen.

262
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,200
Since lives were taken,

263
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,440
how can the government do nothing to help?

264
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,320
Qin Sang.

265
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
Don't interrupt Mr. Wen.

266
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,880
Ms. Qin.

267
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,960
There are rules in the martial arts world.

268
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,480
If the general interferes,

269
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,320
he will disrupt the order
of the martial arts world.

270
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,120
Moreover,

271
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,280
should this issue hold us up
from attending Soul Combat Convention,

272
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,400
wouldn't it be a waste
of His Majesty's efforts?

273
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,960
It's not worth it.

274
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,960
Master Wei is highly reputable
in Chan State.

275
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,480
There are skilled warriors in his manor.

276
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,760
The letter was addressed
to the Wei family for assistance.

277
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,520
It should be handled by Master Wei.

278
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,280
General Qin.

279
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,120
I've been thoughtless.

280
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,400
Please forgive me, General Qin.

281
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,920
If so,

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,130
we'll leave this matter to Master Wei.

283
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,040
Master Chen, you should assist him.

284
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,080
Do not allow those criminals to get away.

285
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,920
Yes.

286
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,520
Qin Qi.

287
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,280
Are you really staying out of it?

288
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,940
You've been away for too long.

289
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,700
It's about time you head home.

290
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Behave yourself.

291
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,200
[If you won't handle it,]

292
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,360
[I’ll go]

293
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,320
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

294
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,160
Get lost.

295
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
How dare you go against officials?

296
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,890
You might get shot to death.

297
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,780
Gentlemen, please get to the bottom
of this matter.

298
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,200
Lu Ping, go.

299
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,820
I haven't dealt with you
about straying away from the team.

300
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,200
Do you like it?

301
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,200
-Yes. Did you pick it?
-Yes.

302
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,160
Xifan.

303
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,240
Xifan.

304
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
Lu Ping.

305
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Do you remember the origins
of the six souls

306
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,840
that our master taught us?

307
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Xifan.

308
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm not very smart.

309
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,120
It gives me a headache to listen to that.

310
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,080
Su Tang.

311
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,280
Shitou.

312
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,560
Su Tang, hold this for me.

313
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
-Impressive.
-Exactly.

314
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,200
-Nice!
-Great archery skills!

315
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,080
Xifan is remarkable.

316
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,880
Indeed.

317
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
All martial arts practitioners

318
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,720
have to learn
from the founder of martial arts.

319
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,360
We have to pick one soul first

320
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,960
and then move on to practicing two.

321
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,240
Lastly, we should master five souls.

322
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,960
I only used the soul of Vision

323
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,760
to look at the trajectory
of the wine urn and the coin.

324
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,020
That is how I managed
to hit it in one shot.

325
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,800
Lu Ping.

326
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,200
Our master taught us archery.

327
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,080
Today,

328
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,740
if you can perform as well as I did,

329
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,520
I won't punish you.

330
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,040
Sure.

331
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,800
Bring it on.

332
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,640
What is this?

333
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,960
How embarrassing.

334
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,920
He's really lame.

335
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,800
Such a loser.

336
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,600
I am a loser.

337
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,240
A loser should roll around on the ground

338
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
and then find a tree to hug.

339
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,960
If Xifan didn't meddle today,

340
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,450
I would have gone with that mighty general

341
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,360
to Kaifeng for a life of luxury.

342
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,490
You're in Zhaifeng Institute.

343
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,360
You should abide
by the morals of martial arts.

344
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Even if you're not studious,

345
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,760
you shouldn't sneak away.

346
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,600
That's one.

347
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Since you practice martial arts,

348
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,730
although you're naturally inapt,

349
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,200
you shouldn't get complacent
and disgrace yourself.

350
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,160
That's two.

351
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,440
Thirdly,

352
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,140
and the most important of all,

353
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,700
you disturbed the officials.

354
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,700
That is disregard for the law.

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,160
Should the government find fault with you,
it will implicate Zhaifeng Institute.

356
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,000
What will your peers do?

357
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,800
You'll be punished
for the multiple mistakes.

358
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
I can't turn a blind eye to it.

359
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,800
Zhaifeng Staff!

360
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,800
Hit me if you want to.

361
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Don't hit Lu Ping.

362
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,840
Su Tang.

363
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,360
Our master placed me in charge
of the institute's matters.

364
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,120
I'm responsible for disciplinary actions.

365
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
You're naturally gifted.

366
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,680
You shouldn't be held back
by such a person.

367
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,200
Otherwise, when you'll have
to choose him or give up on him,

368
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
how will you decide?

369
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,640
Whatever the choice,

370
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
I'll always side with Lu Ping.

371
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,800
Well said.

372
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,940
-I'll leave this to you.
-Lu Ping!

373
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,380
Lu Ping, stop right there!

374
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Master...

375
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,160
Help...

376
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Save us...

377
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,240
I can save you.

378
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,120
Five thousand silver taels.

379
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,840
Get up.

380
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,020
Please don't kill him.

381
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,460
Don't make me look bad.

382
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,720
Master, I haven't even hit him.

383
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,440
You rascal, kneel.

384
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,920
Apologize to Xifan.

385
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,880
This rascal owes me a huge debt.

386
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,560
If you beat him to death,

387
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,240
who should I get my money from?

388
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,240
Master.

389
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,840
You're even worse than Xifan.

390
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,880
You...

391
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,600
Xifan.

392
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,560
Come here.

393
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,960
The widow and owner of Ruyu Restaurant,
Jin Ruyu,

394
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,520
has been kidnapped by bandits.

395
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,640
She's going to become
the lady of the fort tomorrow.

396
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,120
Jin Ruyu has quite a lot of assets.

397
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,100
There are quite a few holes
in the walls of Zhaifeng Institute.

398
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,440
We must get them mended before winter.

399
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,700
Your task for tomorrow

400
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,160
will be led by Xifan and Su Tang.

401
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,720
Master.

402
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,440
Me and my lame tricks,

403
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,050
wouldn't it cause trouble?

404
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,770
You're no good at fighting.

405
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,600
At least, you can keep watch.

406
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,400
You.

407
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,600
You're in the wrong today.

408
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
No dinner for you.

409
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,160
You are not allowed
to sleep in the dormitory.

410
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,440
Go and scrub the stables clean.

411
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,600
Carry out the task with Xifan tomorrow.

412
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,400
Master.

413
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,380
I really don't want to join this time.

414
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,640
Xifan.

415
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,840
Xifan.

416
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,900
Xifan, hold on.

417
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,960
Xifan, stop right there.

418
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,880
Xifan.

419
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,880
Haven't you always wanted

420
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,010
to get rid of bullies and help the weak?

421
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,120
We can't sit on the sidelines.

422
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,330
How much money are you going
to get out of it this time?

423
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,840
Martial arts practitioners

424
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,210
should uphold justice.

425
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
What you just said

426
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,040
is so materialistic.

427
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,960
Master.

428
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,560
Throughout the years
I've been in Zhaifeng Institute,

429
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,290
you did save quite a few people.

430
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,040
But you always charged
a high price for that.

431
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,600
It is not righteous.

432
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,080
Didn't the rich

433
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,240
make a fortune with their own hands?

434
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,160
Xifan.

435
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,920
If every warrior in the world is like you,

436
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
if they only save the poor,

437
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,640
what about the wealth of the rich?

438
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,200
Who will charge them for righteous acts?

439
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,240
Does your righteousness

440
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,850
despise the rich and love the poor?

441
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,730
You have really let me down.

442
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
So much for the years

443
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,560
of effort that I've spent on you.

444
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,780
Are you worried
that there will be too many bandits?

445
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Don't worry.

446
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,360
The God of Bandits...

447
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,120
He'll surely show up.

448
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,240
Isn't that the loser
of Zhaifeng Institute, Lu Ping?

449
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,840
-That's right.
-He really is a hopeless loser.

450
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,400
Exactly.

451
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,320
Right?

452
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,000
The steamed buns for today.

453
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
They are really good.

454
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,370
Did you save them for me?

455
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,400
I failed to hold Xifan back

456
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,040
and got you beaten up.

457
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
I should be punished.

458
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,560
Here.

459
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,800
Osmanthus candy?

460
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Where did you get it?

461
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,130
I stole it this morning.

462
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,680
Lu Ping.

463
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,080
Why didn't you tell them
what happened this afternoon?

464
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,040
Why should I?

465
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,240
They wouldn't laugh at you if they knew.

466
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
I don't like it when they mock at you.

467
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,320
It makes me lose my appetite.

468
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,440
Su Tang.

469
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
If they get to see
what I'm truly capable of,

470
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,520
what should I do when they beg me to stay?

471
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,880
Won't that be bad?

472
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,160
Haven't we already decided?

473
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,080
Once we find Wen Gecheng,

474
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,640
we'll leave Zhaifeng Institute.

475
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,400
Say...

476
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,520
Will Shanhai Gang...

477
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,130
Will they find us in Chenqiao Town?

478
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,080
Don't worry, Su Tang.

479
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,650
But no one ever escapes from Shanhai Gang.

480
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,000
Su Tang.

481
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,860
We already made it out alive once.

482
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
We will have many more years to live.

483
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,440
Master.

484
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,840
It will be midnight soon.

485
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,800
I don't think the reinforcement
from Wei family will make it in time.

486
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
Why don't we surrender?

487
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,260
They are Shanhai Gang.

488
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,720
[Disturbances in the three realms]

489
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,380
[are like a burning mansion.]

490
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,720
[Only the invincible Shanhai Gang]

491
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,240
[can tide you over.]

492
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,600
Ling Ziyan,

493
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,540
Kuiying Sword.

494
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,480
Master Zheng.

495
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,400
Qin family's Sun Streamer Swordplay
does live up to its reputation.

496
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Is that all there is to Shanhai Gang?

497
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,600
How vulnerable.

498
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,210
He's from Shanhai Gang.

499
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,540
It turns out...

500
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160
Since the beginning,

501
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,760
Shanhai Gang only sent out one man.

502
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,320
[From the very beginning,]

503
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,200
[we've been trapped
in the illusion he created,]

504
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,730
[with his soul of Essence
to kill each other.]

505
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,700
[We won't discover
the truth until we're dead.]

506
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
[Shanhai Badge?]

507
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,800
Ziyan, catch it!

508
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,560
Miss, let's go!

509
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,250
Don't stand up to him. Let's go.

510
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Shitou.

511
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,159
As for your tasks,

512
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,920
drug their food and drinks.

513
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,360
Su Tang.

514
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,699
You'll team up with me.

515
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,850
Watch the timing and make a move
after securing Jin Ruyu.

516
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,120
Lu Ping.

517
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,480
What are you doing?
Why are you idling there?

518
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,540
I'm keeping watch.

519
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,920
What's in your bag?

520
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,880
Food.

521
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,280
We're here on a rescue mission,

522
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,360
not a picnic.

523
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,840
I have to bring food to keep watch.

524
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,920
Besides,

525
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,500
if I don't eat this now,

526
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,730
Su Tang will need to eat them later.

527
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,000
Xifan.

528
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Ignore him. The rescue comes first.

529
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,360
Be careful.

530
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,679
Let's go.

531
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,560
Miss.

532
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,760
We've been running all night.

533
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
That man is still coming after you.

534
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,720
Why don't we rush back to Kaifeng

535
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,050
and inform the general?

536
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,570
I was here to annihilate Shanhai Gang.

537
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,340
But now, I ended up getting
the people of Fengling Gang killed.

538
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,840
How can I have the nerve
to ask my brother for help?

539
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,640
Right,

540
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,600
this is the Shanhai Badge
that you seized from him.

541
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,680
Where the Shanhai Badge goes,
casualties follow.

542
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,340
I can't let him retrieve this.

543
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
This is bad.

544
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,020
He has caught up with us again.

545
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,280
Miss.

546
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,600
I'll go and lure him away.

547
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Chuanyun Fort is halfway on the hill.

548
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,360
Head over there and hide for a while.

549
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,160
I'll meet you there if I get away.

550
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,480
No!

551
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,930
You're no match for him.

552
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,400
I'm trained in the soul of Energy.

553
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Combat wise, I can't win,

554
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,560
but I can get away.

555
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,640
I'm not scared. We'll swap clothes.

556
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,560
[Chuanyun Fort]

557
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,720
Madam Jin.

558
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,480
Is that lover of yours not coming?

559
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,120
Don't you worry.

560
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,220
What is Zhaifeng Institute like?

561
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,560
Zhaifeng Institute.

562
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,560
Righteous and chivalrous.

563
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,880
Once Master Guo hears of this,

564
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,640
he's bound to rescue me.

565
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,880
Today,

566
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,360
just put on a show with me.

567
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,160
Once he gets here

568
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,520
and save the damsel in distress,

569
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,380
that makes a pair of good fortune.

570
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,370
I'll treat all of you to drinks.

571
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,280
Thank you, Madam Jin.

572
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,720
Come on.

573
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,490
-Let's drink!
-Drink it up.

574
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,520
Report!

575
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,560
Movements were spotted
at the foot of the hill.

576
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,620
Zhaifeng Institute seems to be here.

577
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,480
We'd better take Madam Jin

578
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,080
into the wedding hall
to wait for her lover.

579
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,880
Yes.

580
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,080
Madam Jin, this way, please.

581
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Let's go.

582
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,840
Hurry up.

583
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,880
Come on.

584
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,200
Let's go.

585
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,400
Shut the door.

586
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,720
Where is Master Guo?

587
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,120
Did he tell you to save me?

588
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,160
Master Guo?

589
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,360
Save you?

590
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,520
I knew it.

591
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,440
You must have heard of me?

592
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,940
Seriously, Master Guo...

593
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,760
He says he doesn't care,

594
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,360
but deep down, he still can't stand

595
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,020
that I'm brought here
to become a bandit's wife.

596
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,040
Why did you come alone?

597
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,040
Where is he?

598
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,040
[Since Shanhai Gang is at my heels,]

599
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,320
[I might as well go along with it]

600
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,760
[and lure him in.]

601
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,080
When did Zhaifeng Institute

602
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,440
take in such a pretty female disciple?

603
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Be honest with me.

604
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,560
Is Master Guo interested in you?

605
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,800
Miss.

606
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,620
Please take off your clothes.

607
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,880
Why should I take my clothes off?

608
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,000
Don't panic.

609
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,810
I'm a government official.

610
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,520
If you put on my clothes,

611
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,650
you'll definitely be safe in here.

612
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,200
However, you must bear in mind,

613
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,530
no matter what happens,

614
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,250
you must not leave the room.

615
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,930
You're a government official?

616
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,010
I've looked around.

617
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,720
There are a dozen men
in the front and the backyard.

618
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,850
There are no guards on the watchtower.

619
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,720
It's going to be a breeze.

620
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,920
I'll tackle the bandits.

621
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,320
You'll rescue Madam Jin.

622
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,320
Hold on.

623
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Why are you holding me back for no reason?

624
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,760
Let's rescue her quickly
and head back for dinner.

625
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,160
If I've guessed it right,

626
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,010
the God of Bandits will show up.

627
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,340
The God of Bandits?

628
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,840
You're not here to rescue her at all.

629
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,780
You're here to arrest him?

630
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,760
[The God of Bandits
always gets ahead of you.]

631
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,200
[He intercepts those thieves]

632
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,860
[and robs them of the riches.]

633
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,880
[Will you lose to him again this time]

634
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,410
and let him get ahead of you?

635
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,770
The God of Bandits shows up
every half a month.

636
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,920
Master.

637
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,920
I'll do it.

638
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,920
Su Tang.

639
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,440
Why do you look so pale

640
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,100
hearing that I'm going after
the God of Bandits?

641
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,160
Anyway,

642
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,100
I can't help you trick him.

643
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,160
I won't rescue Madam Jin.

644
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,120
My stomach hurts. I'm heading back.

645
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,640
Shitou and the guys already
sneaked into the kitchen to drug the food.

646
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,920
You'll rescue Jin Ruyu today

647
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,780
and leave the God of Bandits to me.

648
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,040
Xifan.

649
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,740
You're so ungrateful.

650
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
When the bandits
went into a frenzy last time,

651
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,800
he saved you.

652
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,490
He keeps robbing others of riches.

653
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,840
I have to arrest him
since he has violated the law.

654
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,120
I think it's because you keep losing
to the God of Bandits,

655
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,650
that you feel embarrassed?

656
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,280
I'm not.

657
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,520
Master gave me this badge.

658
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,410
I have to be the role model
of Zhaifeng Institute.

659
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,340
Did I piss Zhao Xifeng off so badly
that's he's become dumb?

660
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,890
He can't even handle some bandits.

661
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,360
My thoughtful wife gave me an heirloom.

662
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,920
Leader.

663
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,880
What treasure is it?

664
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Show it to us.

665
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,000
Leader, it's quite nice.

666
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,330
-Let's drink.
-Here...

667
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,880
Tonight I'll...

668
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,680
Xifan.

669
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,400
Something fishy is going on.

670
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,370
That bride isn't Madam Jin.

671
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,240
You are not Madam Jin.

672
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,480
Shanhai Gang's insolent chap.

673
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,810
