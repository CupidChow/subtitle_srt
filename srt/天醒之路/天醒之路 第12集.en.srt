00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,370
Have you forgotten?

4
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,800
I only attended the Soul Combat Convention

5
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
in order to find Mr. Wen.

6
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,840
I don't care about winning it.

7
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,360
He is now waiting for me
at Xinghua Restaurant.

8
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,760
He is going to get
my confinement unsealed.

9
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,360
Coward.

10
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,760
What did you say?

11
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,920
I said you're a coward.

12
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,680
We made a deal

13
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,360
to compete fair and just for once.

14
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,290
Yet now, you're getting cold feet.

15
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,720
You're clearly worried about
Xifan and the others.

16
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
But you insist on saying you're not.

17
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
I despise you.

18
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I actually...

19
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,720
Sangsang!

20
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,480
Are you all right?

21
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
You're an idiot, Wei Hu!

22
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,090
I said shoot the guy!

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,579
You almost hurt Sangsang!

24
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,040
You?

25
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,280
Why did you ambush me?

26
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,360
Lu Ping.

27
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,079
The Soul Combat Convention is something

28
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,800
all martial arts followers dream about.

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,360
And you said you don't care?

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,770
How arrogant can you be?

31
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,320
You...

32
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,960
How dare you hold Sangsang's hand?

33
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,680
Wei Tianqi.

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
I don't have time for your drama.

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,079
Just go.

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,520
Sangsang.

37
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,040
Did this man pick on you?

38
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,640
I'll kick his ass for you.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,720
Fine.

40
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,290
I'll let you do that.

41
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,520
But think carefully, Mr. Wei.

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,040
Do you honestly want to fight me?

43
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
You...

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,160
All right. I'll remember this.

45
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,360
I'll let you go today.

46
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,760
Next time, I'll make you beg for mercy.

47
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go.

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,839
Ms. Qin.

49
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,440
You should go as well.

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,890
Xifan and the others have the same outfit.

51
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,490
It must be the new clothing
of Zhaifeng Institute, isn't it?

52
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
If you really don't care about them,

53
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
why do you keep it?

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Fine. I won't force you to talk.

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,280
But before you go to meet Mr. Wen,

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,720
come with me.

57
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,120
I embarrassed myself in front of Sangsang.

58
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,760
I have to turn this situation around.

59
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Otherwise, how could I face her again?

60
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,680
This can't do.

61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,360
I have to think of something.

63
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640

I knew I saw it here.

65
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,820
What are you doing with it, Young Master?

66
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
Didn't Lu Ping say

67
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
he's going to meet Wen Gecheng?

68
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,340
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir.

69
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
That's it.

70
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,400
Wen Gecheng is the invigilator
of Soul Combat Convention.

71
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,530
He is the authority.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,260
I want him to help me to get back
to the convention

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,159
and become the champion
like a real winner.

74
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,490
That way, I'll shine in front of Sangsang!

-There we go!
-Young Master.

Wen Gecheng is the appointed
invigilator of the convention.

77

He stands at the very top.

78
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,120
He won't be so easy to convince.

79
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
Perhaps you should give up this plan.

80
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,760
What do you know?

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,320
He's only pursuing wealth
by working for the government.

82
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,180
I don't believe

83
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,900
there's someone noble
among all the corrupted.

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,800
By the way,
where did Lu Ping say he was heading?

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
I think he said Xinghua Restaurant.

You've got some nerves to participate
in the convention being crippled.

It's out of your league.

in his rabbit hole.

We all know the risk of this competition.

Wansui Mountain is over there.
It's one of the checkpoints.

Xifan and the others are fighting
for Zhaifeng there.

112
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
You should've been there with them.

But right now
that's not exactly my business.

fighting them.

171
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,480
You lost.

172
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Look closely at what you just fired.

173
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,720
How is this possible?

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,520
How can it be my firework?

175
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,280
It's over.

176
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
Everything is over.

177
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,170
Thanks to the beating you gave him.

178
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,530
Xifan has just mastered

179
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,810
the soul of Essence.

180
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,220
It's controlled by the heart.

181
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,160
So was that the legendary mastery

182
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
of the soul of Essence?

183
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,000
To be able to control others' conscious

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,720
and alternate the gap of their memory?

185
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,280
That happened because of you.

186
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,640
Thanks a lot.

Surpasses that of Beidou!

How dare you bully me.

The firework of the East Wing
has burned out.

The last person who walks out

198

Although we already have
our own battle uniforms,

202
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,520
I still feel like something is missing.

203
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,360
The formality doesn't matter.

204
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,090
Who says it doesn't matter?

205

Don't you want to change

209
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,040
Zhaifeng's reputation for Master?

210
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,040
How?

211
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,520
We have leverage.

You guys go back to the camp.

232
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,280
I have some personal errands to attend.

[Those are the Wei guards.]

There is a homicide in Xinghua Restaurant.

The Victorious Dragon Troop
has locked the place down.

You cannot go there.

My brother has always been
suspicious of you.

are stationed in the camp.

What happened?

276
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,050
I went to Xinghua Restaurant earlier.

277
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,000
It was under attacked.

278
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,520
And Mr. Wen...

279
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,130
He's severely injured.

280
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,660
We don't know if he'll make it.

281
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,690
Perhaps I attracted the Shanhai Gang.

282
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,080
I did this to him.

283
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,860
Shanhai Gang came for you more than once.

284
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,120
What's the reason behind it?

285
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,440
After everything that has happened,

286
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,360
you still can't trust others?

287
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,120
It's not that I can't.

288
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm afraid to.

289
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,560
I'm afraid that one of you

290
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,420
would be the one lying over there!

291

Lu Ping.

292
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,720
I don't think we can hide it
from them any longer.

293
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,200
With everything that is happening,

294
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,320
having back up is always a good thing.

295
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,400
Disturbances in the three realms

296
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
are like a burning mansion.

297
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,240
Only the invincible Shanhai Gang

298
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,800
can tide you over.

299
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,800
Help my sister.

300
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,530
Three years ago,

301
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,240
Mr. Wen saved us from Shanhai Gang.

302
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,800
But then we got separated.

303
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,650
I disguised myself as God of Bandits
just to find him.

304
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,340
So you escaped from Shanhai Gang?

305
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,160
That's right.

306
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,720
We were running like fugitives.

307
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,170
We got to live a stable life three years

308
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,040
after meeting Master.

309
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,720
No wonder Xing Luo
never quit searching for you.

310
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,960
They are famous for being brutal.

311
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,480
Of course they wouldn't let you go.

312
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,840
I was supposed to be the target

313
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,760
of the ambush of Xinghua Restaurant.

314
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,560
I should never have stood him up.

315
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,160
It's my fault he's hurt.

316
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,560
Mr. Wen was a bandit.

317
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,010
Shanhai Gang has always resented him.

318
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,740
Even if you did make it on time,

319
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,600
you'd just add more casualties,
nothing else.

320
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,480
Lu Ping.

321
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,120
Perhaps the reason you escaped the ambush

322
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,040
is because in the end,

323
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
you didn't choose to go to Mr. Wen
to find out ways

324
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,120
to unlock the confinement.

325
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,980
Instead, you chose your friends.

326
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Yes.

327
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,720
It's destiny.

328
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,560
God is trying to tell you

329
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,320
that you did the right thing.

330
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,800
Don't worry too much.

331
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,380
Mr. Wen will be safe for being a nobleman.

332
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
We're here, but the enemy is in the dark.

333
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,920
No funny business, Lu Ping.

334
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,380
As long as Mr. Wen wakes up,

335
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,650
the truth will naturally be revealed.

336
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm tired of all the schemes

337
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,200
and the persecution.

338
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,840
If they dare come at me

339
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,000
or the people around me again,

340
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,040
I will break the walls

341
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,660
and fight until every man is down.

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,460
The Soul Combat Convention
has just started

343
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,280
and our main invigilator
suffers an attack.

344
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
General Qin.

345
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,920
Do you wish to defend yourself

346
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,000
of what Mr. Xia accused of you?

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,400
I have nothing to say.

348
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
Your Majesty,

349
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,080
it is the truth.

350
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,760
Of course Mr. Qin has nothing else to say.

351
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,000
Then Mr. Xia,

352
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,680
what is your opinion?

353
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,800
Your Majesty,

354
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,090
the reason our main invigilator
was attacked

355
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,840
is because this convention

356
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,760
is not based on a solid background.

357
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,160
If those martial arts followers
becomes one of us by winning,

358
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,090
it'll only bring this imperial court
more concerns.

359
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,280
I suggest

360
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,600
Your Majesty to abolish
the Soul Combat Convention.

361
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,160
Your Majesty.

362
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,080
Someone ordered the attack on Mr. Wen.

363
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,920
It shows that some authorities
are scared of the exams

364
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,040
like this one, which doesn't require
a royal background,

365
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,720
and only focusing on one's ability.

366
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,000
Everywhere in the country
is your land, Your Majesty.

367
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,040
These people were so bold
that they abused their power,

368
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,120
oblivious of their emperor.

369
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,600
What audacity!

370
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,800
Mr. Xia,

371
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,520
should we keep the convention afloat

372
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,860
to demonstrate our empire's greatness?

373
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Or

374
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,680
should we

375
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,120
submit to these outlaws

376
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,720
and be at their mercy?

377
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,080
Mr. Qin.

378
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,720
-What does that suppose to mean?
-Your Majesty.

379
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,960
We will choose the people
with actual capability.

380
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,480
Now someone is sabotaging the convention

381
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
and violating the empire.

382
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,720
I shall never back down!

383
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,160
I swear on my life

384
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,880
that I shall never allow those outlaws

385
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,820
another chance to stir our peace.

386
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,440
You're doing things the wrong way.

387
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,480
Enough.

388
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,000
You have my permission, General Qin.

389
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,260
The convention will not be canceled.

390
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,920
You take charge of

391
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,360
the attack on Xinghua Restaurant.

392
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
[I hope Mr. Wen has woken up.]

394
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,610
[That way, I can ask him
about what happened myself.]

395
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,760
[Oh, no.]

396
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,530
[What is Qin Qi doing here?]

397
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,560
I was drinking at Xinghua Restaurant.

398
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,920
And the young master of Wei Family
happened to be there.

399
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,180
Suddenly, dozens of assassins showed up

400
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,640
and attacked me.

401
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,520
I fainted

402
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,260
as I was severely injured.

403
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
When I woke up today,

404
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,060
it's been days since then.

405
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,000
Mr. Wen.

406
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,080
Can you tell who did this to you?

407
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,160
It was the Shanhai Gang.

408
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,320
Shanhai Gang?

409
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,480
You have already become
a government official.

410
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,080
So why are people like them

411
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,840
still chasing after you?

412
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,840
Or was their target

413
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,560
actually the Wei Family?

414
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,800
I wonder how Mr. Wei is doing?

415
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
His three bodyguards are dead.

416
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,480
However, he survived.

417
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,240
But I heard his injury is serious.

418
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,920
He hasn't woken up.

419
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,640
Three more kills

420
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,520
on Shanhai Gang's record.

421
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,240
Mr. Wen.

422
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,360
Why were you in Xinghua Restaurant?

423
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Were you meeting someone there?

424
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,280
[Oh, no.]

425
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,040
[If Qin Qi finds out
Mr. Wen was there to see Lu Ping,]

426
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,640
[he'll never let Lu Ping go.]

427
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,640
It's nothing.

428
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,280
I suddenly feel nostalgic

429
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,560
of Xinghua Restaurant's
homemade apricot wine.

430
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,260
Have you heard enough?

431
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,840
Come in then.

432
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,520
Qin Qi.

433
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,160
Mr. Wen.

434
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,210
How did you know we're here?

435
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,680
I was very worried after hearing

436
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,220
about Mr. Wen's accident.

437
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,840
So I secretly followed you here.

438
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,200
If I knew you two
have urgent issues to discuss,

439
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,600
I would've chosen another day
to visit you.

440
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,930
Mr. Wen, you need not worry.

441
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,400
I'll take care of the convention.

442
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,280
And I will certainly

443
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,860
find the person who attacked you
in Kaifeng.

444
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,740
I'll leave it to you, General Qin.

445
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,840
Mr. Wen.

446
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,250
We shall meet again.

447
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,320
You saw him.

448
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,480
Good.

449
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,080
Come home with me.

450
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,760
Qin Qi.

451
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
I just got here.

452
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,120
General.

453
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,960
I recently received

454
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,920
a crystal calcedony.

455
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,180
I'd like to give it to Ms. Qin
as an ornament of her sword.

456
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,920
I wonder if you'd grant me the honor

457
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,240
to accompany me?

458
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,920
Qin Qi.

459
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,640
You're quite busy,
so why don't you head back first?

460
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,760
I'll go with Mr. Wen to see the calcedony.

461
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,560
Since this is what Mr. Wen wants,

462
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,440
come straight back home after you're done.

463
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,960
Don't cause him any more trouble.

464
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,480
Mr. Wen.

465
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,600
Where is the chalcedony?

466
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,720
You ought to know

467
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,640
there is no chalcedony.

468
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,840
Then why...

469
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,360
The thing you wants to know

470
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,520
is precisely what I want to tell you.

471
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,640
But the general was present,

472
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,800
it was not the right time.

473
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
So I couldn't tell you the truth.

474
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Why exactly happened
in Xinghua Restaurant?

475
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,320
That day...

476
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,800
Mr. Wen.

477
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,240
[That day, I was waiting for Lu Ping.]

478
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,120
[He didn't show up]

479
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,480
[even hours after the scheduled time.]

480
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,040
[Instead, Wei Tianqi came to me
with Lu Ping's badge.]

481
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,920
[I was worried my whereabouts are known.]

482
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,580
[So when I was about to leave,]

483
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,880
[Shanhai Gang ambushed me.]

484
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,260
Watch out, Mr. Wen!

485
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Where is Lu Ping?

486
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,280
Come closer. Let me tell you.

487
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,800
Sir, he's right up there!

488
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
You mean

489
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,400
that Walker of Shanhai Gang's
left upper arm

490
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,320
is wounded by your Bone-piercing Needle?

491
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,280
That's correct.

492
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,000
I specifically had them make

493
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,200
the Bone-piercing Needle as my weapon.

494
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
It goes straight into the bones.

495
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,160
If one tries to pull it out forcefully,

496
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,960
it'll deepen the wound
and it won't stop bleeding.

497
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,600
It will take time to heal.

498
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,600
I supposed my needle is still attached

499
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,640
on that Walker's shoulder.

500
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,160
Then why didn't you tell my brother

501
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,680
about all of this?

502
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,560
The general has always been biased
toward Lu Ping.

503
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,760
If I told him I was there to see him,

504
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,080
he might've considered him suspicious

505
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,200
of colluding with Shanhai Gang.

506
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,010
But why are you telling me this?

507
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,040
Weren't you the person who secretly told

508
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,600
my whereabouts to Lu Ping?

509
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,320
I know

510
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,640
that you'd never hurt Lu Ping.

511
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,890
I'm still too weak to go around.

512
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,160
Please pass down my message to him.

513
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,960
Shanhai Gang has infiltrated Kaifeng.

514
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,490
He must leave immediately.

515
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,880
As for unlocking the Soul Confinement,

516
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,480
I will figure something out.

517
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm not leaving.

518
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,000
Since I've decided to fight
alongside Zhaifeng,

519
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,720
I'd never leave you guys.

520
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,320
Lu Ping.

521
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,660
Now is not the time to be stubborn.

522
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,370
Mr. Wen had made it clear

523
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,600
that this place isn't safe anymore.

524
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
Ms. Qin is right.

525
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,330
It was my lack of consideration

526
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,400
for sending you out to battle.

527
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,520
But now the situation is different.

528
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,400
You had your breakthrough
at the convention.

529
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,600
It's only a matter of time
before they find you.

530
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Lu Ping.

531
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,280
Do what Xifan says.

532
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,840
I'm not being stubborn.

533
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,560
I know way too well

534
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,520
how Shanhai Gang works.

535
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,980
They're forcing me to leave Kaifeng.

536
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,810
Once I step out the city,

537
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,120
I'll step right into their trap.

538
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,760
Your brother has heavily guarded
the Wansui Mountain.

539
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,880
Our only choice

540
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,600
is to stay.

541
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,280
It's the safest way.

542
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,880
Mr. Lu,

543
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,040
this is the wine you asked for.

544
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,160
Ziyan,

545
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,440
when did you start following his orders?

546
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,760
It's just an easy task.

547
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,840
I thought a celebration is in need

548
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,580
since you and him
have made it to the final round.

549
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,400
Get drunk while we can.

550
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,200
But sleep if we can't.

551
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,370
Since Shanhai Gang is everywhere,

552
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,160
then let's just stay

553
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,800
and get the championship

554
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,000
to restore the reputation of Zhaifeng.

555
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,400
The enemy is closing in,

556
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,330
we cannot drink.

557
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,720
That too.

558
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
You should be the first one to drink.

559
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,960
How can the rest of us

560
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,440
dare to drink before you?

561
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,120
Have some.

562
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,560
Fine.

563
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,120
I'll drink.

564
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,400
You too.

565
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,520
For the past three years
after I escaped them,

566
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,480
I could barely stay asleep,

567
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,040
fearing that any moment,
I could be taken back again.

568
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,500
I've always wanted to know

569
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,640
what it feels like
to get completely wasted

570
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,600
with friends.

571
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,960
I actually feel at peace

572
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,380
even with the enemy on my tail.

573
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,620
If confronting them
is just a matter of time,

574
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,440
why don't we embrace it head-on?

575
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,400
You're right.

576
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,560
The final is right around the corner.

577
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,960
Any strength saved is any strength gained.

578
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,440
Otherwise, how can we make them surrender?

579
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm still here.

580
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,760
I might be the champion.

581
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,600
I will not show you any mercy.

582
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,000
Fine.

583
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,400
But don't cry when it's my turn

584
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,480
to beat you up.

585
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,880
You...

586
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,199
Drink this first.

587
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,719
-Xifan, cheers.
-Cheers.

588
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,680
Lu Ping.

589
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,000
Following your brother

590
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,660
is not a good habit.

591
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Lu Ping.

592
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,000
Is there something on your mind?

593
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,000
I forgot to bring my clothes with me.
I'm going back for it.

594
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,040
Get some sleep.

595
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,880
You've only told me, Xifan, and the guys

596
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,080
about your meeting with Mr. Wen.

597
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,600
But Shanhai Gang knew about it.

598
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,360
Then who was it

599
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,540
that leaked the information?

600
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,120
You've grown.

601
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,500
Besides eating candy,

602
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,660
I see thinking has become your hobby.

603
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,090
Xifan and Mo Lin have been with me
the entire time.

604
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,520
Ms. Qin and Shanhai Gang are enemies.

605
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,800
Even if it was the Wei Family,

606
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,280
they'd never trade anything
with Wei Tianqi's safety.

607
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,610
There's only one person

608
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,000
who knows when and where
you were going to see Mr. Wen.

609
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,010
This person wasn't with us.

610
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,640
And only this person

611
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,200
can make you upset and leave the camp

612
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,800
-secretly in the middle of the night!
-Stop it.

613
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,680
Lu Ping.

614
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,280
Let me accompany you.

615
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,520
Guo Youdao!

616
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,000
Have you teamed up with Lu Ping?

617
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,920
-I...
-After my son bumped into him in Kaifeng,

618
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,400
he not only lost in the convention,

619
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,130
but also got severely injured.

620
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,520
I have a temper too!

621
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,700
I will not tolerate this anymore!

622
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,560
You have a stupid son!

623
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,440
And you're trying to smear
my disciple's name!

624
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,840
How embarrassing!

625
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,000
-Don't come near me.
-Don't you lie! I know everything!

626
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,720
Before he set off for Xinghua Restaurant,

627
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,680
he found Lu Ping's badge!

628
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,200
Tell me now!
Did you two team up to bully him?

629
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,000
Zhaifeng Institute cares only
about the convention!

630
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,200
But you?

631
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,440
You keep persecuting,

632
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,920
threatening, and chasing after us!

633
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,880
I see.

634
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,160
Young Master Wei was unwilling
to leave the convention,

635
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,040
so he tried to stop my disciple.

636
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,040
So he took up a rock
and dropped it on his foot!

637
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,440
You!

638
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,920
You're a psycho.

639
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
Get him!

640
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,300
And then go get Lu Ping!

641
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,040
Don't!

642
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,640
Lu Ping? What are you doing here?

643
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,640
Get him! Stop!

644
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,120
-How mighty, Mr. Wei.
-You're hurting me.

645
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,560
We heard there's been an attempted murder
recently in Kaifeng.

646
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,320
The Victorious Dragon Troop
is here to investigate.

647
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,000
You knew my brother
and the Qins aren't just acquaintances.

648
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,160
We just saw the Victorious Dragon Troop.

649
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,520
I'll tell them right now.

650
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,080
Don't!

651
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,000
I...

652
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,000
Listen carefully!

653
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,730
One day,
Zhaifeng Institute will cease to exist!

654
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,600
Lu Ping.

655
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,120
I was too emotional.

656
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,080
I let my emotions take over me.

657
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,400
Mr. Wei is the last person
I should ever offend.

658
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,720
-Come on.
-Master.

659
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,060
That's not important.

660
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,040
I'll become the champion

661
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,840
of the Soul Combat Convention.

662
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,960
No one will dare bully us again.

663
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,000
Have you thought it through?

664
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,040
Do you really want to work
for the emperor?

665
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,640
Then what do you want me to do?

666
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,400
Leave?

667
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,040
Or stay?

668
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,200
Master.

669
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,570
They didn't hurt you, did they?

670
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,120
Those minions are nobody to me.

671
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,300
Stop messing around, you two.

672
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,160
Go back to Wansui Mountain now.

673
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,760
The final round is coming up.

674
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,800
I'm heading back to rest.

675
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Lu Ping, could it really be Master?

676
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,610
Su Tang, did you notice something?

677
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,890
When Wei Ming was grabbing Master,

678
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,060
not only couldn't he defend himself,

679
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,200
but he also had to protect
the left side of his body.

680
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,220
Do you remember the Bone-piercing
Needle Qin Sang mentioned?

681
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,860
Could all this be just a coincidence?

682
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,400
Perhaps...

683
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,780
Master just didn't want
to offend Wei Zhong.

684
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,760
He doesn't like trouble.

685
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,200
You know that too.

686
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
Lu Ping.

687
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,940
Do you have the heart to doubt him?

688
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
It looks like we really need

689
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,000
to win this competition.

690
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,240
Lu Ping.

691
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,240
Su Tang.

692
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,680
I don't want to doubt him.

693
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,800
I wouldn't dare.

694
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,940
It looks like the longer
we stay in Wansui Mountain,

695
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,880
the safer we will be.

696
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,040
[This is the only way
to keep others from smelling the blood.]

697
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,760
[Who would have thought]

698
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,640
[this kid would notice.]

699
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,520
What's on your mind?

700
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Ms. Qin,

701
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,730
is what happened in Xinghua Restaurant
really serious?

702
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
This concerns the Shanhai Gang.

703
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,700
My brother is investigating it already.

704
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,480
Why are you suddenly concern about it?

705
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,920
Tomorrow's final round
will be held in the ring.

706
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,800
Mr. Zhao Xifan is still wounded.

707
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,080
Su Tang and Mo Lin are not your rivals.

708
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,120
The only remaining competitor you have

709
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,360
is Lu Ping.

710
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,120
I've been waiting for this day to come.

711
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,320
I can finally teach this brat a lesson.

712
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,600
Miss, if they lose to you,

713
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,200
they probably will be assigned
to a normal position,

714
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,920
stationing outside of Kaifeng, right?

715
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,120
Ling Ziyan.

716
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,080
What do you want to say?

717
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,600
Miss, you come from a wealthy family

718
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,080
and you have the general's protection.

719
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,960
However, Mr. Lu has a poor background.

720
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,480
If the emperor doesn't reward him,

721
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,740
I'm afraid bad things will happen to him.

722
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,240
Are you asking me to let him win

723
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,200
in the final round?
