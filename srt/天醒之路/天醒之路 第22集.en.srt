2
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,820
Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 22

4
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,040
Senior Yan.

5
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,980
Senior Yan.

6
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,250
Zhou Youlong will come at any time.

7
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,040
It’s not safe here.

8
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,280
How could you know

9
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,320
I was in E’zhou Mansion?

10
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,560
You are the same Lu Ping.

11
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,040
You are careful at all times

12
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,240
Xifan.

13
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,560
What did Shanhai Gang do to you?

14
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,680
You betrayed your brother.

15
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,400
They just reminded me that

16
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Zhaifeng Institute was destroyed because of you.

17
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,200
Only by catching the awakening back to
Shanhai Gang,

18
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
can the world be peaceful.

19
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,000
Xifan.

20
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,120
Shanhai Gang destroyed Zhaifeng Institute.

21
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,240
Be sober.

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,730
Don’t be fooled by them.

23
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
Do you think

24
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,079
I’m not ready to catch you?

25
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,440
What are you waiting for?

26
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,040
Go for them.

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,680
Run.

28
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,880
Damn!

29
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,760
Yan Qiuci always appears.

30
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,880
Catch them.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,440
Wait.

32
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,690
I don’t want to get my father involved.

33
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,920
Yan Xifan.

34
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,160
Remember.

35
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,390
Now,

36
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,240
I am your boss.

37
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,040
Really?

38
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,120
Let’s argue in front of the master

39
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,020
to see who is more reasonable.

40
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,640
Master.

41
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
Shanhai Gang didn’t follow us.

42
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,060
You’d better be hurry to heal.

43
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,040
Guard.

44
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Cocky.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
Arrogant!

46
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,890
What kind of senior you are?

47
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,120
Stupid!

48
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
You are talking about Xifan

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
or yourself?

50
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
I should have been caught by Shanhai Gang.

51
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,600
The master died because of me.

52
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,320
Now is Xifan.

53
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,980
They really think that I can live in peace

54
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,890
with their lives in exchange for mine.

55
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,450
If they hadn’t created the chance for you,

56
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,960
or let you cut the third chain in Big Dipper,

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,060
you may have died in Shanhai Gang.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,460
How could you have a chance to complain here?

59
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,610
Elder Guo and Xinfan made choices for you.

60
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,040
They want you to fight back

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,960
instead of complaining the life.

62
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,159
Xifan must have been bewitched by

63
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,720
Shanhai Gang.

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
If you are not strong,

65
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,220
how can you bring him back safely?

66
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Miss Qin.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You comfort people so differently.

68
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,920
It’s a deal.

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,660
Let’s fight together.

70
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,480
Let’s go.

71
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,760
Go to see elder Yan.

72
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,800
Elder Yan.

73
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Your injury?

74
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,159
It’s not a big deal.

75
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,960
Elder Yan.

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

77
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,240
It’s a long story.

78
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Xifan sneaked into the Shanhai Gang

79
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,400
and kept in touch with me.

80
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
He told me the news of E’zhou.

81
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
But I didn’t expect

82
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
he was so impulsive.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,720
He assassinated master of Shanhai Gang.

84
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,880
And he fell into the trickery of theirs.

85
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,890
I’ve been following him all the way

86
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
to avoid any catastrophe.

87
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Elder Yan.

88
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Xifan went into Shanhai Gang for me.

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
I…

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
You’re brothers.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,130
It’s not your fault.

92
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,720
I didn’t expect that he progressed

93
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,600
faster in Shanhai Gang

94
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
than in Wuji Manor

95
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,640
and Zhaifeng Institute.

96
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,100
I knew he could use 3 forces

97
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
when I fought with him.

98
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,000
I don’t know what kind of crooked means

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,159
he used to progress?

100
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Method of Xi Sui.

101
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,280
The usual means of Shanhai Gang.

102
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,820
The reason why they plundered the people

103
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,600
was to use the Method of Xi Sui of their generals

104
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,560
with those with high accomplishments.

105
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,090
It can improve the combat power in short time.

106
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,520
I heard that Xifan mentioned that you have been

107
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,920
imprisoned in Shanhai Gang for many years.

108
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,560
Is that because…

109
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,840
Yes.

110
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
They want to use Lu Ping’s

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,260
innate ability of six forces.

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
to make more experts for

113
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Shanhai Gang.

114
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,240
Six forces?

115
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,360
The weapon on your hand…

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,880
The Horn?

117
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,140
You got it by yourself?

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,500
I got it in Qisha Institute of Big Dipper.

119
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,640
But I just got this weapon.

120
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,200
I didn’t train well.

121
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,600
So just now,

122
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,800
I almost hurt Xifan.

123
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,920
It’s the fate.

124
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,520
Like father, like son.

125
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,730
Elder Yan, what are you talking about?

126
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
What father?

127
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,880
Did Chu Min and Guo Youdao

128
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,840
tell the story of your life?

129
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,410
The story of my life?

130
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
What is it?

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,440
The weapon on your hand,

132
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,880
is your father’s unique weapon.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,560
My…

134
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Father…

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Your father

136
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,810
is the leader of seven peaks in Big Dipper.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,360
Leng Xiutan.

138
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,220
Some things happen

139
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,200
naturally when fate comes.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,640
Master,

141
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,610
what kind of person is Master Leng?

142
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
He was upright and honest.

143
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,770
He had the best martial skill in the world.

144
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,160
He deserved the name of hero

145
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,840
and the respect of millions of people.

146
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,960
Go.

147
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,280
Salute to

148
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,640
your master

149
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,610
and Master Leng.

150
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,980
[Leng Xiutan]
[Guo Youdao]

151
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,020
[Leng Xiutan]
[Shao Yinchu]

152
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,520
Brother and sister.

153
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,360
I brought your kid here.

154
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
I knew.

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,530
I heard the tune of The Horn.

156
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
from my mom.

157
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,960
Miss Qin.

158
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,520
I heard Junior Lu is back.

159
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,320
What happened to you?

160
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
Is there any news

161
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
in Big Dipper?

162
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Don’t mention it.

163
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,200
We were placed in confinement.

164
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,880
It was dirty and smelly.

165
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,440
Miss Qin.

166
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,800
Is Lu Ping the son of Master Leng?

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
White.

168
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,480
It is about

169
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
to rain.

170
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
Your parents love you,

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,240
cherish you.

172
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,880
It’s a pity they’re all dead.

173
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
What are you talking about?

174
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,980
They are dead in the Shanhai Gang.

175
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,320
Uncle Yan.

176
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,890
Do you know how my parents died?

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,160
Leng Xiutan, Shao Yinchu.

178
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,600
They are famous couple in Jianghu.

179
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,400
They could use five forces.

180
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,560
Maybe it is the fate.

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,480
Or your powerful parents.

182
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,120
You got six forces

183
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,640
when you born.

184
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,140
You are the awakening in a hundred years.

185
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,600
It’s the ability you have

186
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,720
that attracts the people of Shanghai Gang.

187
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,060
[Qisha Institute]

188
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,220
[Qisha Institute]

189
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
Shanhai Gang

190
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,560
came for me?

191
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,640
Big Dipper was the most powerful

192
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,080
in the world.

193
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,400
We open the gate all the time.

194
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,840
Some sects would duel martial arts with us.

195
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,000
Xifan’s mom was badly ill at that time,

196
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,340
So I back home to visit.

197
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,610
Chu Min and Guo Youdao went down the mountain.

198
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Shanhai Gang came

199
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,520
in the name of dueling martial arts.

200
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,360
That day when I hurried back,

201
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,520
Shanhai Gang had left.

202
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,760
Qisha Institue was destroyed.

203
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,200
Your parents died.

204
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,570
My sixth junior Liu Song and

205
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,200
seventh junior Lyu Chenfeng are missing.

206
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,040
I didn’t know what happened.

207
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,160
We thought

208
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,120
you were dead.

209
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,900
Did my master leave Big Dipper

210
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,680
because of it?

211
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
And Master Chu Min hid in Tianzhao?

212
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,800
We have good relationship with each other.

213
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,920
No one wanted to stay here

214
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,280
after your parent’s death.

215
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
I also resigned as the master of Peak.

216
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,440
Back to my hometown,

217
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,560
I built Wuji Manor.

218
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,200
I’ve been fighting with Shanhai Gang

219
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,640
because of this hatred.

220
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,040
I didn’t expect that…

221
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
You didn’t expect

222
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,280
I was taken to Shanhai Gang

223
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,760
after I was displaced.

224
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,240
What's more, my master saved me

225
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,800
but didn’t tell me anything.

226
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,760
You have the talent.

227
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,410
But your parents still want you

228
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,280
to have a smooth life.

229
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,920
I named myself Lu Ping.

230
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,340
I just hope my life will be smooth.

231
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,320
I didn’t expect that I was the one

232
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,760
with the most twists and turns.

233
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Senior Yan.

234
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,680
Why did you tell him?

235
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,160
Lu Ping is the son of Leng.

236
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,020
It’s the truth.

237
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,570
He’ll know sooner or later.

238
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,200
What?

239
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,120
Lu Ping is son of Master Leng?

240
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,480
Calm down.

241
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,680
I have some words to tell Lu Ping.

242
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,240
Now you can tell me.

243
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
You didn’t tell me anything before.

244
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,240
Is there any reason?

245
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,520
Lu Ping.

246
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,480
Yu can believe in me.

247
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,760
Lu Ping.

248
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,360
The incident was really a mistake

249
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,520
in martial arts competition.

250
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,240
Master.

251
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
How could it hurt people’s lives?

252
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
How could it burn the mountain?

253
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
How could it imprison me for years?

254
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,109
The whole thing is full of doubts.

255
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,040
You just said it was the mistake.

256
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,290
Do you want to find out the truth

257
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
or dare not to?

258
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,440
You are right.

259
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,560
I dare not to find out the truth.

260
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,780
The accident of that year resulted in

261
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,400
the death or departure of the most famous

262
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,740
Seven Peak masters in Big Dipper.

263
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,040
Of course we dare not to find out the truth.

264
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,440
If we find out something,

265
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,600
what can we do to fight against them?

266
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,480
So the Big Dipper knew

267
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,040
Shanhai Gang killed my dad.

268
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,120
To protect yourself,

269
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
you can pretend that you can’t see

270
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,440
or hear anything.

271
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,240
Lu Ping.

272
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,800
At that time, Big Dipper lost a lot.

273
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,840
As the master,

274
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,480
I can’t let it fall into a desperate situation.

275
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,840
I…

276
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,000
I am sorry.

277
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,860
I wasn’t here that day.

278
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,480
Neither was Chu Min

279
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,920
nor Guo Youdao.

280
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,730
Shanhai Gang went on the mountain,

281
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,500
burnt Qisha Institue,

282
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,960
and killed three masters of Peak.

283
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,880
One master of Peak is still missing.

284
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,680
You called it an incident.

285
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,140
No one is allowed to mention it again.

286
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,520
Now the people of Shanhai Gang

287
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,250
appear in the territory of Dan.

288
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,960
Only one of the seven masters is suspected.

289
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,160
You are still indifferent.

290
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,120
Tell us,

291
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,160
is there the skeleton in the closet?

292
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,920
Yan Qiuci.

293
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Don’t guess at will!

294
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,880
Do I?

295
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,170
Or are you protecting your old friend？

296
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,320
What does Uncle Yan mean

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
by these words?

298
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,680
I…

299
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,000
I…

300
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,020
She didn’t dare to say.

301
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,480
Because she didn’t dare to face it

302
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
Because the most suspect is

303
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
her lover,

304
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Liu Song.

305
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,570
No. that’s impossible.

306
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,720
It can’t be him.

307
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,360
He was in charge of the mountain that day.

308
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,320
He is also the one who let Shanhai Gang in.

309
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,560
Junior Lv is innocent,

310
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,240
He wouldn’t do that.

311
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,320
So the most suspicious person

312
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
is him.

313
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,760
Yan Qiuci.

314
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,400
He is dead.

315
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,920
Master Chu Min.

316
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,280
Is it true what Uncle Yan said?

317
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,360
Lu Ping.

318
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,000
Yan Qiuci.

319
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,840
You stir up trouble with your nonsense.

320
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,320
You…

321
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,280
You’ve gone too far.

322
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,940
I have only one word to ask.

323
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,820
Big Dipper and Shanhai Gang have a deep feud.

324
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,660
Now my good friend has been taken by them.

325
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,320
Shanhai Gang provoked us.

326
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,040
Such a disgrace,

327
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,290
will Big Dipper have any action

328
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,290
to take care of this?

329
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,280
Lu Ping.

330
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,200
This matter involves the dispute

331
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,760
between Tan, Dan and Shuo, the three countries.

332
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,840
The relationship between them is complicated.

333
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,370
As a disciple of Big Dipper,

334
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,320
you are also a child of Big Dipper…

335
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,520
-A child of Big Dipper.
-You shouldn’t…

336
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,800
Where were you when

337
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,400
my parents were killed by Shanhai Gang?

338
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,280
Where were you when

339
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
Shanhai Gang endangered the world?

340
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,240
Now they took

341
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,000
my best friend.

342
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,640
I can’t be a coward like you.

343
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,980
If you won’t go,

344
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,680
I will.

345
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,080
Lu Ping.

346
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,160
If you leave…

347
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
If you leave here.

348
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,820
You are no longer the disciple of Big Dipper.

349

351
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
So I can’t respect

Big Dipper any more.

353
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,400
From now on,

354
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,410
Lu Ping has nothing to do

355
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,240

Stop.

361
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,920
I am in charge in Big Dipper.

362
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,200
I usually indulge you.

363
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,960
Today, I will never forgive anyone

364
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,650
who wants to follow Lu Ping.

Master Yan.

368
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
You’d better go back to be the
Master of martial arts circles.

369
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,520
As soon as you come back,

370
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,800
Big Dipper

371
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
is in a mess.

372
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,600
Are you satisfied

373
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,400
with this??

374
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,840
You think you can keep him in dark all his life.

375
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,240
But he was already aware.

376
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,680
Don’t deceive yourself.

377
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
Don’t be articulate!

378
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,040
I think you’re just trying to save your own son.

379
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,640
You led Lu Ping to seek revenge on Shanhai Gang.

380
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,800
With him,

381
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,960
Shanhai Gang will show up.

382
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,600

only when you meet them positively,

can the problem be solved.

392

You kept Lu Ping in the dark for three years.

393
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,240
Were you right,

394
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,920

Now many forces gathered in E’zhou.

400
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,450
The situation is more complex.

401
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,120
Shanhai Gang acts tricky.

402
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,120
Our Wuji Manor can’t deal with them alone.

403
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,920
If I do not pull the Big Dipper in,

404
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,120
it is difficult to let Xifan out.

405
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,840
What can we do next?

406
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,880
There is someone in Shanhai Gang

407
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,200
who has cultivated Force of Spirit to this level.

408
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,000
They turned younger master to a different person.

410

Shanhai Gang didn’t kill Xifan.

411
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,760
It must also be a plot

412
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,200
to blackmail Lu Ping.

413
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,340
Gather all the disciples in city.

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,720
Suddenly I didn’t know whether

695
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,020
I was in Tan or Shuo.

696
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,320
I was lost.

697
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,520
So I am late.

698
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,800
It is also a customary rule to guard

699
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,560
the important areas of peace talks with troops.

700
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,240
General,

701
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,160
you seem to be dissatisfied.

702
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,680
No.

703
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,360
I am a warrior.

704
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,480
I only know fight when the two armies confront.

705
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,560
You’re talking about peace talks,

706
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,520
but you’re actually bringing many soldiers here.

707
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,780
Your speech is contrary to your thought.

708
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,880
Xu Tianbing.

709
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,240
Peace talks are good for countries and people.

710
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,530
It’s the decision made by our King and Tan’s King.

711
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,680
Why?

712
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,040
Is General Xu ineffective in running the army?

713
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,760
Are you afraid my Longjie Army

714
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,960
with less than a hundred soldiers here?

715
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,220
It’s right.

716
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,880
General Xu fought with me several times

717
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,600
and won

718
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,480
only a few battles.

719
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,560
Qin Qi.

720
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,560
General Xu.
