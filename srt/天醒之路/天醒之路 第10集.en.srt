[Episode 10]

3
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Stay alert.

4
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
Minmin.

5
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
What do you think

6
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
about these adorable disciples?

7
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Do you like them?

8
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
Don't gloat too soon.

9
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,920
I have many more ways to torture you.

10
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,610
Be sure to wake up early
to come here tomorrow.

11
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,610
Greetings, Master.

12
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,780
Please allow us to bow down to you.

13
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,320
Save your energy.

14
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,920
Leave it for the convention.

15
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Lu Ping.

16
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Luo Ting made you break one

17
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,840
of the Soul Confinement's chains.

18
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,280
You can use two soul powers now.

19
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,940
You're way stronger than him.

20
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,520
Master Chu Min.

21
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,520
My soul power was split as well.

22
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
But I couldn't learn

23
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,840
the soul of Strength like them.

24
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,700
Are you hiding something from me?

25
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
Your Mo family's imperfect bloodline

26
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
are destined to have incomplete meridians.

27
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,880
You won't be able
to learn the soul of Strength.

28
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,519
That's why during Soul Splitting,

29
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,980
you're the only one
who lost all five senses.

30
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,840
You better give up earlier.

31
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,000
What's with the long face?

32
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,159
Sometimes, the level of martial arts

33
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,690
isn't determined
by the amount of soul power,

34
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,159
but the usage of it.

35
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,920
Certain techniques need the usage

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,330
of multiple souls power simultaneously.

37
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
The arrangement and grouping
of the six souls are endless.

38
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,920
The derived techniques will be endless.

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,640
This is the essence of soul power.

40
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,760
Assassin Boy still doesn't understand.

41
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,320
If they are properly combined,

42
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,520
having five souls power won't be a loss.

43
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,840
Having one less soul power to train on,

44
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,580
the other five souls power

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
will be more refined.

46
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,080
I understand.

47
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
So this is good news.

48
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,480
Just like I used the soul of Energy

49
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,210
to dodge Xifan's soul of Sound.

50
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,280
After that, I used the soul of Pivot

51
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,680
to sprinkle the knockout drops.

52
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,810
I could assassinate
while staying invisible at the end.

53
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,200
Su Tang.

54
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
How about it?

55
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
With my martial arts,

56
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,610
I can surpass Xifan now.

57
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,960
I want to train alone.

58
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,360
After Xifan's Soul Splitting,

59
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,440
it seems he totally changed.

60
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Did his brain get smashed that day?

61
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,280
Master.

62
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,400
I won't be wrong in my judgment.

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,140
Maybe something went wrong
during the Soul Splitting.

64
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,760
Xifan!

65
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,680
Are you all right?

66
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,760
I'm fine.

67
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,360
When Lu Ping wants to hide
his injury from me,

68
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,220
he has the same expression
as you have right now.

69
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Tell me first.

70
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,720
What happened to you?

71
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Didn't you restore your hearing
because you broke through

72
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,120
the Soul Splitting
in the Sutra Repository?

73
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,360
How could you lose the soul of Sound now?

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,700
I used excessive force

75
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,480
that my meridians are blocked.

76
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,800
It's nothing serious.

77
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,320
Blocked meridians?

78
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,360
Was it because when you saved Lu Ping
in the Sutra Repository,

79
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
your Soul Splitting wasn't complete

80
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
and yet you still helped him?

81
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,280
That's why your meridians are blocked.

82
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,960
I'm going to find Lu Ping.

83
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,880
Su Tang!

84
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,159
Be careful.

85
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,210
I checked the ancient records.

86
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,330
Halting the Soul Splitting

87
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,920
is unsolvable.

88
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,400
What will be, will be.

89
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,320
I'll let nature takes its course.

90
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,240
The time will come.

91
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,600
It was my own choice.

92
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,280
Lu Ping doesn't owe me anything.

93
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't tell him about this.

94
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,420
You should at least rest for two days.

95
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,770
The convention is just around the corner.

96
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,160
Su Tang.

97
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm still Zhaifeng's eldest disciple.

98
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't want to be a burden
or useless to anyone.

99
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,260
Do you understand?

100
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,000
Xifan, your candy.

101
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,880
I'm worried about Xifan too,

102
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,400
so I came to take a look.

103
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,360
Lu Ping.

104
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
How can you sleep at a time like this?

105
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,280
Lu Ping, do you hear me?

106
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
You talk so loud.

107
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,620
Even the deaf can hear you.

108
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,220
Think of a solution quickly then.

109
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,880
Xifan already said,

110
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,850
"What will be, will be."

111
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,320
What can I do?

112
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,900
He's the eldest disciple.

113
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
He can still fight with broken legs.

114
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,440
Can he not handle
a small problem like this?

115
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,300
I have something to do.

116
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,320
I can't talk.

117
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,210
Do you still have the candy?

118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,920
Mo Lin!

119
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
Su Tang is being filial towards me.

120
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,080
Giving it to this guy

121
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,090
is better than letting you have it.

122
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Enjoy it.

123
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,320
Why are you following me?

124
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,280
We're guys.

125
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,320
Don't you understand?

126
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,280
You're actually cold on the outside
but warm inside.

127
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,840
The meaner you are towards someone,

128
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,970
the more you actually care about them.

129
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,720
I guess you're definitely thinking

130
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,040
about the way to help Xifan.

131
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,500
Right, Disciple Brother?

132
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,690
What did you call me?

133
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,240
Disciple Brother?

134
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
Yes. You're my disciple's godbrother,

135
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,280
so you're Disciple Brother.

136
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
Otherwise,

137
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,440
why would I run all the way
to appease you?

138
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,160
Assassin Boy.

139
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,800
I told you before.

140
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm not a boy.

141
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,960
You accepted the mission
to kill me back then.

142
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Wasn't it to earn money
and venture the martial arts world?

143
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,560
Why are you clinging to Su Tang
and not leaving?

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,460
You tried for so long.
Why didn't you give up?

145
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Although that brat, Su Tang,

146
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,960
has great strength

147
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
and is fierce towards me,

148
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,760
she's actually quite kind.

149
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm used to living alone.

150
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,280
If I were to leave now,

151
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,160
without Su Tang's fierceness,

152
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,240
your loathsomeness,

153
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,520
Guo Youdao's shamelessness,

154
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
and Xifan's coldness,

155
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
I'd feel like something is missing.

156
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,200
What's missing?

157
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,250
During the Soul Splitting,

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,760
I was thinking.

159
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
If I couldn't survive it,

160
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,200
everyone would get bad luck.

161
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,000
So I must protect you guys.

162
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
Instantly and inexplicably, I could move.

163
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,240
Honestly,

164
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,330
getting a disciple matter not.

165
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,720
Having an excuse to stay

166
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,560
is good enough.

167
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,640
Right.

168
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,480
When I broke through the Soul Splitting,

169
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
I was thinking about you guys.

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
Who were you thinking of?

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,240
Could you...

172
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,480
Su Tang.

173
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,000
Su Tang?

174
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Hey!

175
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,520
[When I broke through the Soul Splitting,]

176
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,080
[I was thinking about you guys.]

177
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,610
[Who were you thinking of?]

178
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,280
[Li Tailor Shop]

179
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,680
Miss.

180
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
This is the lotus flower pastry
you wanted.

181
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,400
In my opinion,

182
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
General Qin's decision isn't unreasonable.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
That Luo Ting isn't a good guy.

184
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,820
Lu Ping looks unreliable.

185
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
He's also second-rate.

186
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
He humiliated you in public.

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,160
Miss, if it's unbearable,

188
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,080
I have an idea.

189
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,440
I'll bring my people
to drag them back now.

190
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,520
Peel their skin off

191
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,840
to ease your anger.

192
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,660
Listen carefully.

193
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
You can do whatever to Luo Ting.

194
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,720
But Lu Ping is mine.

195
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,170
Without my command,

196
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
nobody can touch him.

197
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,200
But...

198
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,000
Lu Ping is yours.

199
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,120
Miss, you're still protecting Mr. Lu.

200
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,040
Wen Rui is right.

201
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,130
He's a second-rate person.

202
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,080
But when he's serious,

203
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,360
it's reassuring to let him watch my back.

204
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,480
It's me.

205
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,120
Mr. Lu, you're too rash.

206
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,920
How dare you trespass
a general's residence.

207
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
If they discover you,

208
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,250
you'll be shot to death.

209
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,400
Did you hear her?

210
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,920
The Victorious Dragon Troop
is just outside,

211
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,580
waiting to peel your skin off.

212
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,640
My skin is rough and tough.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,500
The troop shouldn't be bothered.

214
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,090
But regarding the Soul Splitting,

215
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,580
Qin Qi didn't give you a hard time, right?

216
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,610
Did you come here because you're worried?

217
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,480
What's this?

218
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,840
It's for you.

219
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,880
Open it.

220
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,050
Did you bring this as an apology

221
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,000
or is it part of your scheme again?

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,800
This...

223
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,940
Didn't I tear your clothes last time?

224
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,560
When I look at it,

225
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,200
if you were to wear it,

226
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,440
it should look quite nice on you.

227
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,880
Right, the Soul Combat Convention
will happen soon.

228
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,240
There are many candidates.

229
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,570
Not every candidate can meet Wen Gecheng.

230
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,400
So I came here specifically

231
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,480
to inquire about Wen Gecheng.

232
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,040
Inquire?

233
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,440
Do you know under Shuo's laws,

234
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,570
what's the punishment for bribery is?

235
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,040
Bribery?

236
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,720
Ziyan, call Wen Rui.

237
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,380
Tell him someone trespassed our residence.

238
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,600
Ziyan, take my brush.

239
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,360
I can't accept this bribe for naught.

240
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
She's from
a government official family indeed.

241
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,380
How did it become bribery?

242
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,920
She mistook my kindness for malice.

243
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
Mr. Lu.

244
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,600
Ms. Ling.

245
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,000
This is from Ms. Qin.

246
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
[Shanhai Gang was hunting down
Mr. Wen back then.]

247
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,210
[My brother saved him.]

248
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,540
[My brother takes him as his confidant.]

249
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
[Plus, he's the chief examiner
of the convention.]

250
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,560
[To prevent fraud,
nobody can get near to him.]

251
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,840
[But this Soul Combat Convention]

252
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,440
[is really meaningful to my brother.]

253
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,099
[He'll definitely be there.]

254
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,760
[Provided you pass the preliminary exam,]

255
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,490
[you'll definitely meet him.]

256
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,839
Ms. Qin said the answers
to your questions are in the letter.

257
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,319
If you don't want to be skinned,

258
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,359
don't bring trouble to the Qin family.

259
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,619
I thought she was dumb.

260
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,420
I can't believe she always surprises me.

261
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,680
I thought your mistress hates me the most.

262
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,609
She thinks I'm a heartless person.

263
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,079
No, that's not true.

264
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,560
What's not true?

265
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,360
The person who may seem heartless

266
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,090
is actually the sincerest one.

267
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,880
You are actually the sincerest person.

268
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,410
Did your mistress say that?

269
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
Yes.

270
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,400
Ms. Ling.

271
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,720
It's late.

272
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,100
You should go back.

273
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,080
Mr. Lu.

274
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,760
Actually, I can go home later.

275
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,080
The convention is near.

276
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Do you have anything I can help with?

277
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,800
Now that you mention it, I almost forgot.

278
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,240
I'm not sure if you're willing
to help me or not.

279
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,040
Tell me.

280
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,560
Xifan is stubborn.

281
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,120
He doesn't listen to me.

282
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,640
If you can help me

283
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,890
unravel his trouble...

284
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,940
[Halting the Soul Splitting]

285
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,440
[is unsolvable.]

286
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,970
[What will be, will be.]

287
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
[I'll let nature takes its course.]

288
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,920
[The time will come.]

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,400
[If I can never use the soul power again,]

290
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,200
[I should at least relearn
my blade techniques.]

291
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
[I can't be everyone's burden.]

292
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,760
Xifan!

293
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
Ms. Ling.

294
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,000
Hero Xifan.

296
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,800
I brought this for you.

297
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,040
It's fine.

298
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,800
It's fine.

299
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,680
Is something troubling you, Hero Xifan?

300
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,240
I was sold to the Qin family since young.

301
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,320
I'm quite perceptive
towards other people's emotions.

302
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,200
If anything is troubling you,

303
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
you'll feel better if you say it out loud.

304
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
I'm a useless piece of junk.

305
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,240
You're not useless.

306
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,530
If it wasn't for you,

307
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,280
I have already lost my life
in Sutra Repository.

308
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,520
Ms. Qin and Mr. Lu

309
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
won't escape unscathed too.

310
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,240
You put your life at risk to save others.

311
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,320
You're a hero.

312
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,290
Zhaifeng is a united front.

313
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,240
You'll definitely succeed
in the Soul Combat Convention.

314
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,840
Mr. Lu won't complain
that you're a hindrance.

315
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,880
It's getting late.

316
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll take my leave then.

317
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,280
Ms. Ling.

318
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,200
Did Lu Ping send you?

319
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,800
Some sickness can only be cured by ladies.

320
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,160
Which girl did you cheat

321
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,440
to get this Ms. Ling?

322
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,000
A silly girl who looks stern.

323
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,360
Lu Ping, is this real?

324
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,940
Soul Combat Convention's preliminary exam
is in ten days.

325
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We can finally meet Wen Gecheng.

326
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,400
[Qin Residence]

327
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,280
The convention will start soon.

328
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,400
Why are you here?

329
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
Today's Soul Combat Convention,

330
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,960
Mr. Wen will be there, right?

331
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,180
Mr. Wen is the convention's
chief examiner.

332
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
I sent someone to pick him up.

333
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,200
What?

334
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,480
Why are you still standing here?

335
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,840
If you come late,

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
even if you're my sister,

337
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,840
I won't tolerate it.

338
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,240
The convention is starting.

339
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,060
Why are you smiling
instead of getting nervous?

340
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,840
Qin Qi.

341
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,720
As your sister, I'm a woman of her words.

342
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
I feel at ease then.

343
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,560
Xifan.

344
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,520
Look at the fluttering flags
of the other martial arts academies.

345
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,640
Ours are the only shabby-looking ones,

346
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
like a miscellaneous army.

347
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,940
We look poor, don't we?

348
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,840
Tell me.

349
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,840
Why didn't Master prepare for us?

350
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,320
Soul Combat Convention
is about martial arts,

351
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,720
not about putting a show.

352
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,060
These symbolic items aren't important.

353
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,440
Lu Ping.

354
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,080
Can we really meet Wen Gecheng this time?

355
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,320
This time,

356
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,720
we definitely can.

357
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,720
Even at the Soul Combat Convention,

358
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
you're still wearing your shabby clothes.

359
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,200
Listen to me. Just go home.

360
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,100
You're embarrassing yourself
by staying here.

361
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,600
Qin Qi is here.

362
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,440
Su Tang. Don't let him frighten you.

363
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,600
I have seen much of the world.

364
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,640
I'm very clear about how this would go.

365
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,440
After this,

366
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,600
it's most likely
that he'll talk about saving the state

367
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,930
and upholding justice.

368
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,170
When you guys come to this convention,

369
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,320
you already have the awareness to enlist.

370
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,650
Death is common in the cruel battlefield.

371
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,050
It's the same for today.

372
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,000
Soul Combat Convention will begin.

373
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
Those who fear death, please leave now.

374
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,760
Stay if you're willing.

375
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,220
After you wear this badge,

376
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,530
you've signed the oath of enlistment.

377
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,130
There's only superiority.

378
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,540
Your life matters not.

379
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,480
Soul Combat Convention's first round

380
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,320
is to test everyone's soul power.

381
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,440
As long as the entire team

382
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,120
passes a total of four stages,

383
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,800
they will advance.

384
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,080
As for the rest,

385
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,060
let your strength speaks for itself.

386
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,370
There are many people here.

387
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
Let's get to the second round first

388
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,920
and wait until there are fewer people.

389
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,040
You may start.

390
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,200
Command tokens are hanging
on the top of the tree.

391
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,960
Rely on the soul of Energy's
lightness skill to rise to the top.

392
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,690
Whoever can retrieve
the command token may pass.

393
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
Where's the rest?

394
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,920
There's one more guy.

395
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
Watch out.

396
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,520
He's lying still.

397
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,720
Come down.

398
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,720
What's wrong?

399
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
How can he this bad?

400
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,480
Come down.

401
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,920
-Are you all right?
-Try harder.

402
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,720
Can you train for two more years?

403
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,520
Come down quickly.

404
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,200
Come down if you can't. Let it go.

405
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,240
That's right.

406
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,920
Stop it, you can't reach it.

407
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,640
-You can't reach it.
-Come down.

408
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,560
Watch out!

409
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,160
Are you all right?

410
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,800
The pose isn't important.

411
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,620
Most important is the result.

412
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,480
Tianzhao Academy and Zhaifeng Institute

413
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,680
passed the stage for the soul of Energy.

414
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,820
In every corner of the forest,

415
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,360
six musicians are playing the same song.

416
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Everyone needs to use the soul of Sound

417
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,400
to identify their current location

418
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,320
and mark them on the map.

419
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,040
Whoever can identify
more than three musicians

420
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,040
may pass the stage for the soul of Sound.

421
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,760
I'm done.

422
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,880
I've marked the six musicians.

423
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,360
Check them.

424
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,920
Not bad.

425
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
All your answers are correct.

426
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,840
But the exam hasn't ended.

427
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,800
As per the convention regulations,

428
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,200
you must play the song you heard

429
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,280
to prove that it's the song you heard,

430
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,640
and you didn't cheat.

431
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,360
Only then will you pass this stage.

432
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The exam on the soul of Sound
requires me to play music

433
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,330
and know musical notes.

434
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
It's a rule

435
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
established by Mr. Xia personally.

436
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,720
I believe

437
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,040
all of you are from prestigious academies.

438
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,610
It's not difficult, right?

439
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,680
Lu Ping.

440
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,360
Kaifeng belongs
to the prominent families after all.

441
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
All of you are a bunch of wild kids.

442
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,560
You're nothing.

443
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,480
Lu Ping.

444
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,360
I tried my best

445
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,160
and finally passed two stages.

446
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,600
I thought you nailed the stage
for the soul of Sound.

447
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,280
Did you get a stomachache?

448
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,400
Whatever.

449
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,570
It's an exam for officials anyway.

450
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,520
Those from prominent families
will have the upper hand inevitably.

451
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,240
But we must pass four stages
out of the six stages.

452
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
Unfortunately, I just unlocked
the soul of Essence

453
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,840
and it's poorly used because of
the disruption of Soul Splitting.

454
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,570
We can only count on Su Tang now.

455
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,520
Miss.

456
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,440
For the test on the soul of Strength,

457
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,000
everyone must lift
more than five stone dumbbells to pass.

458
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,040
You look weak and thin.

459
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,680
It's better if you give up.

460
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,120
[Now, I only passed the test
for the soul of Vision.]

461
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,760
[For this round, I have to win.]

462
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,520
All right, I understand the rule.

463
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,440
Let's begin.

464
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,080
All right.

465
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,080
The test on the soul of Strength

466
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,520
begins now.

467
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,880
What are you doing?

468
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,420
What are you doing?

469
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,640
Put me down!

470
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,560
I'm afraid of heights.

471
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,760
Three adult men

472
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,720
putting all their hope on a young lady.

473
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,960
Let me tell you.

474
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,720
I just passed five of the tests

475
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,040
with flying colors.

476
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,960
I heard

477
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,900
that someone
was completely humiliated in the test

478
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,320
for the soul of Sound.

479
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,240
Hey, Mr. Wei.

480
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,240
Can you cut the crap?

481
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,360
Why don't you taste the good stuff I have?

482
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,880
I really want to see

483
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,560
how long you guys can stay here.

484
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,480
Let's go.

485
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,880
Lu Ping.

486
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,080
Su Tang.

487
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
I passed.

488
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,680
Su Tang, are you okay?

489
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,160
Hey, you two.

490
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,000
Elites gather
at this Soul Combat Convention.

491
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Can't you figure a way out?

492
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,160
You can't just depend on my luck.

493
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,080
Su Tang.

494
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,720
You did great.

495
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,130
I was the one holding you guys back.

496
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,160
Xifan.

497
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,800
Don't listen to Mo Lin.

498
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,760
The goal of Soul Combat Convention

499
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,440
is to gather elites from various regions.

500
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,280
It's not odd if the standard is higher.

501
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,520
Let's go home earlier and rest well.

502
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,840
Maybe you'll recover tomorrow.

503
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,640
General,

504
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,720
the list of those
who passed the preliminary exam.

505
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,440
Reassign some camps
of the Victorious Dragon Troop.

506
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,040
Let them stay in the camp area

507
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,520
during the convention

508
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,960
to prevent cheating.

509
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,880
Drawing lots is coming next.

510
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,890
We need to prepare
tomorrow's second round of tests.

511
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,770
That's right, General.

512
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,560
Do you know which martial arts academy

513
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,580
does the simplest team belong to?

514
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,400
I think I saw an old acquaintance

515
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,600
among them.

516
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,180
It's Zhaifeng Institute.

517
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,200
It's the institute where that kid,
Lu Ping, is from.

518
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,120
Sir.

519
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,840
He harbors evil intentions.

520
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,370
He's not worth mentioning.

521
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,900
The snowfield was freezing cold.

522
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,760
He would've been long gone.

523
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,360
Sir.

524
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,560
Mr. Wen.

525
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm fine.

526
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
I just recalled some past memories.

527
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,240
Qin Qi, Mr. Wen.

528
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,800
I passed the exam.

529
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,280
Wen Rui.

530
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,160
Send Mr. Wen to his room.

531
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,320
Yes.

532
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,600
Is Mr. Wen leaving?

533
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,720
Can't you stay for a while?

534
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,720
Maybe...

535
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,040
Maybe someone wants to find him.

536
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,480
Mr. Wen has an old illness.

537
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,920
Could the matter be more important

538
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,050
than his own health?

539
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,880
Mr. Wen.

540
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,720
[No, I need to find Lu Ping.]

541
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,000
Lu Ping, what's wrong?

542
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Take a seat first.

543
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,320
The convention isn't
as simple as we thought.

544
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,120
This round tests us on the four arts.

545
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,239
The next round can be problematic too.

546
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,239
We must figure out a way
to meet Wen Gecheng.

547
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,239
We can't just idle and take the exam.

548
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,199
What about Xifan, Master, and Mo Lin?

549
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,520
Lu Ping!

550
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,400
I've been looking for you guys.

551
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,199
Follow me now.

552
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,560
Mr. Wen already left.

553
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,920
All right.

554
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,239
Wen Rui should've sent him back
to his residence.

555
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,520
My brother is handling matters.

556
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,050
He won't be back for a while.

557
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,800
Take my horse.

558
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,240
For the drawing lots,

559
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,770
I'll let Xifan do it for you.

560
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,520
[Zhiwei Study]

561
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,680
General gave his orders.

562
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,160
Three years ago, your cardinal
was damaged in the snowfield.

563
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,690
and you need to recuperate.

564
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,860
General will handle
the matters of the convention.

565
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,320
Who's there?

566
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,210
General Wen, it's fine.

567
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,560
I think

568
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,400
it's a wild cat playing in the garden.

569
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,680
Well, have a good rest.

570
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,360
I won't disturb you anymore.

571
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,540
I'll take my leave.

572
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,090
See General Wen out.

573
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,400
General Wen, please.

574
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
You've been hiding for a long time.

575
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,240
Why don't you come out and meet me?

576
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,560
Why did you lie for me?

577
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,400
At my place,

578
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,160
I always have youngsters wanting to get in

579
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,800
through the back door.

580
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
I can feel your soul power.

581
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,240
It has no killing intent.

582
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,280
I think you're not targeting me.

583
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,300
I don't want the back door.

584
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,680
I just want to ask you something.

585
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,280
Did Shanhai Gang

586
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
cause your injury?

587
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,960
You know about Shanhai Gang?

588
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,760
It's in the past.

589
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,490
Since you mentioned it,

590
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,320
I'll tell you a story.

591
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,930
Three years ago,

592
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,460
when I was the martial arts world,

593
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,080
I saved a brilliant young man

594
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,000
from Shanhai Gang.

595
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,240
[However,
a short while after I saved him,]

596
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,100
[we encounter the people from
Shanhai Gang who were hunting us down.]

597
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,880
[But I was outnumbered.]

598
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,740
I got heavily injured.

599
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,460
I lost all my martial arts.

600
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,520
General Qin saved my life.

601
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,570
So I've been following him ever since.

602
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
You lost...

603
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,860
your martial arts to save that child.

604
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,210
It's only martial arts.

605
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,890
A person's life is more important.

606
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,240
Although I no longer have martial arts,

607
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,080
I still have my eyes.

608
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,320
General Qin treats me well.

609
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,600
I can contribute to the country.

610
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,160
A loss can be a blessing in disguise.

611
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,480
Mr. Wen.

612
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,130
Let me also tell you this old story.

613
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,610
Thirteen years ago,

614
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,520
a lonely boy was kidnapped

615
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,120
and brought to Shanhai Gang.

616
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,130
He was tortured for a long time.

617
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,610
He initially thought
he was going to die there...

618
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,680
until a hero came and saved him.

619
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,200
After the boy was saved,

620
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,080
he has been searching for his savior.

621
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,720
But he couldn't find him.

622
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,360
He only knows

623
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,260
that his savior is called Dao.

624
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,200
Soul Confinement.

625
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,760
It's really you.

626
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
You're still alive.

627
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
Dao.

628
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,280
No.

629
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Mr. Wen.

630
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,720
I found you.

631
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,960
I wonder if the four sauceboxes

632
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,600
were beaten black and blue or not.

633
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,440
How can my disciples lose?

634
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,840
The four of them

635
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,840
have entered the second round.

636
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,800
All right.

637
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,920
Zhaifeng is going to be famous this time.

638
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,200
Are you sure

639
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,610
Lu Ping will fight for Zhaifeng
in the end?

640
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,160
You should know that he has a motive.

641
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,040
Don't I have a motive as well?

642
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,480
What Lu Ping will choose in the end?

643
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,240
Let's wait and see.

644
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,680
Su Tang and I

645
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,200
have been staying at Zhaifeng Institute
for the past three years.

646
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,860
Our master might be reckless,

647
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,560
lazy, greedy, and a drunk,

648
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,120
but he treats us well.

649
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,060
I'll take you to meet him if possible.

650
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,360
All right.

651
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,840
Lu Ping.

652
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,200
Lu Ping!

653
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,080
Lu Ping.

654
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,760
Lu Ping.

655
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,560
Lu Ping!
