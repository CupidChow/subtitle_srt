2
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,820
Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 20

4
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,960
Master Chu Min.

5
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,440
Did you see Qin Sang?

6
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,160
I am sleeping. Don’t shout.

7
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Hurry, back to practice.

8
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,920
Qin Sang doesn’t know anyone else here.

9
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
She only knows you.

10
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
Open the door. I have something to tell her.

11
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,400
I am not kidding.

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,329
I am leaving now.

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,360
Really?

14
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
He has gone?

15
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,360
In a little while, he will be far away.

16
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,920
It’s fun.

17
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,160
Qin Sang.

18
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,730
You lied to me again.

19
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,290
Don’t hit me.

20
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,050
I don’t have any power of force now.

21
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,100
I do not stand a chance fighting against you.

22
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I miss my senior,

23
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,170
Su Tang and the little assassin

24
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,160
when I am alone.

25
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,320
But who I miss the most

26
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
is you.

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,060
It is good to see you

28
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,680
again.

29
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,880
I thought you were dead.

30
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,940
It was a long way for you

31
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
to be here.

32
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,480
I’ve been riding for a long time.

33
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,340
My bottom hurts

34
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,640
Why are you so careless, Miss Qin?

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,600
Lu Ping.

36
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,840
What were you going through these days?

37
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
Let me take you to a place.

38
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,040
I have something

39
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
to tell you.

40
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,960
So Ling Ziyan accompanied you all the way.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,760
Why do you focus on this only?

42
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,160
Are you jealous?

43
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
I am not.

44
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,660
I’m angry with you.

45
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,160
You’re always on your own.

46
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,970
You won’t tell me anything.

47
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,280
Do you consider me as…

48
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,160
As what?

49
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,840
A friend.

50
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,600
I wanted to take revenge.

51
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,570
I didn’t care about my life.

52
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
Nor do I want to bother others.

53
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Look at the magnificent sight here!

54
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
Compared with it,

55
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,560
our so-called troubles have become small

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,930
and insignificant.

57
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,640
Look at there.

58
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,600
It’s my master’s star of destiny.

59
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Before he died,

60
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,720
he tried his best to settle everything for me.

61
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,920
I believe that his careful arrangement

62
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,700
has its own reason.

63
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,540
I will take the chance.

64
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,250
Maybe there’s something I want

65
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,760
at the end of the road.

66
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,680
Lu Ping.

67
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
No matter what you want to do,

68
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,400
I will accompany you.

69
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,140
Even if it's dark at night,

70
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,640
with stars and me,

71
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,420
the road will always be easier to walk

72
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,080
Qin Sang.

73
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Thank you.

74
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,450
You’re welcome.

75
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,120
Now, Xifan has left Shanhai Gang

76
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,360
And he got news.

77
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,480
I have to practice harder

78
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,240
to get my power of force back.

79
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,770
So we can fight Shanhai Gang

80
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
together.

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,880
Yes.

82
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
You should practice harder.

83
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,840
In these days of your death,

84
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,740
I turn anger into strength

85
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,360
and I can use 3 forces now.

86
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,880
My death?

87
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Yes, your death.

88
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,960
Hit me?

89
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,600
Challenge me?

90
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,880
Master Chu Min, I…

91
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,000
Figure it out.

92
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,440
You really like Lu Ping,

93
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
or you want to compete with Qin Sang?

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,600
I…

95
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,370
You know nothing about Lu Ping.

96
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
I’m not as good as Miss.

97
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,320
If you want people to respect you,

98
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,200
you have to be strong first.

99
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,360
Master Chu Min,

100
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,120
I lost my face today.

101
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,419
I’ll be embarrassed to see him in the future.

102
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,240
Can I stay with you?

103
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,150
Poor kid.

104
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:46,360
You have stayed here for long.

105
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,610
I am glad to have you to talk with me.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,680
You can stay as long as you want.

107
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,920
Thanks, Master Chu Min.

108
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,290
Why do you always use me as a shield?

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,740
You said you wanted to company me.

110
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,600
Regret now?

111
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,680
My brother is a tough man.

112
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,980
Ziyan is a sensitive girl.

113
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Qin Sang,

114
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,200
I regard Ling Ziyan as my friend.

115
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
It’s good for her

116
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,920
to make things clear.

117
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
I believe that

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,260
she can find her own way

119
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,920
and the man she can rely on.

120
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,840
What should we do next?

121
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,800
I have heard a tune every night.

122
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,800
I think it is the message

123
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,040
my master left to me.

124
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,800
But I haven't figured out what it means.

125
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,600
Find out

126
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,090
where it’s coming from.

127
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,610
Big Dipper is too big

128
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
to find out where it came from.

129
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
The seniors from the Fifth College,

130
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,520
they have no interests to discuss that with me.

131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,170
It depends on what you do

132
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,180
if others don’t listen to you.

133
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,600
White!

134
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,600
Give the White back to me.

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,330
Give it back!

136
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,680
Why did Lu Ping hear the inexplicable tunes

137
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,880
in Big Dipper?

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,800
Speak it out!

139
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,760
Speak it out!

140
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
Give me the rabbit.

141
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,380
Tell me the answer.

142
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,280
Answer.

143
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,320
Put down your sword first.

144
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Tell me first.

145
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,160
Quiet!

146
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,880
Senior.

147
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,960
White.

148
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,890
Senior Huo Ying.

149
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,320
You don’t like Lu Ping, either. Right?

150
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,400
We won’t tell him.

151
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,960
Piss off him.

152
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,890
No more talking.

153
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
I don’t know what tune Lu Ping heard.

154
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,210
It’s in the direction of Qisha Institute.

155
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,120
There are all the magic weapons of Big Dipper

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,560
in the past hundred years.

157
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,480
The sound you hear

158
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,640
probably resonates with the weapons inside.

159
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,840
Armory?

160
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,570
Let’s go and have a look.

161
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,160
How could it be that easy?

162
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,960
Stop.

163
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
After death of the former masters of Big Dipper,

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,050
their weapons will be stored in Qisha Institute.

165
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,720
If the disciples have courage,

166
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,400
they can challenge the Qisha Institute

167
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,330
and inherit the weapons of elders.

168
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,250
It just depends on your ability

169
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
if you can get it.

170
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Qisha Institute is in Kaiyang Peak?

171
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,320
Yes.

172
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,120
After being guarded by the Master Guo Wushu,

173
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,520
the hidden weapon inside becomes more abnormal.

174
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,040
If you are a little careless, you will lose life.

175
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
Our senior failed to challenge several times.

178
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,680
You may not be better than him

with your present skill.

180
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
She said that

181
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,120
it is not an easy thing.

182
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,250
How can we compare with each other easily?

White.

185
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,720
How do I know if I can get it

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
if I don't go in?

187
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,050
Senior Huo Ying.

188
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Maybe he can make it.

189
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
He is the one who can compare with you

190
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,040
in the time of practicing

191
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,520
in the Fifth College.

192
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
If he can walk out of here.

193
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,320
Maybe you can as well.

194
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,920
If you didn’t violate ancestral system
and fought against corrupt officials,

195
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,440
you’d have been in the first institute of elites.

196
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,570
Don’t mention that.

197
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,250
It’s all in the past.

198
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
He can succeed first.

199
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,480
The senior…

200
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,480
What’s wrong?

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,160
The senior.

202
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,760
What happened?

203
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,780
He went to Qisha Institute again.

What the master had tried so hard to get

206
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,680
was in here.

207
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,040
You have only one force.

208
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,560
Let me go with you.

209
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,320
Are you worried about the master

210
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,600
or me?

211
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,280
She didn’t want you to die in vain.

212

213

The outside concealed weapon is dangerous.

You can’t get in with your one force.

215

There’re all the highest level weapons

216

217
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,120
It’s more dangerous.

Thank you for reminding me.

219
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,300
But I have to do that

220
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,820
No matter how dangerous it is.

221
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,440

222
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,760
he wanted me to live.

223
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,900

It should be the one you were looking for.

Why are you so familiar with it?

I was trapped here for three days.

Find the direction of the sound wave

something remarkable.

But you only learned the arrogant and conceited.

269
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,010
I promised him to stay in Qisha Institute.

270
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,840
I did that.

No wander my master sent me here.

279
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,520
I could win in

280
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,780
the Force Combat Convention.

281
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,720
I can also

282
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,260
win here in Big Dipper.

283
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,120
Arrogant!

284
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,920
I expended all my energies

285
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,010
on the defense of Qisha Institute.

286
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,610
I made the Jiebing Platform of The Horn

287
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,360
by the characteristic of Force of Sound.

288
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,160
It’s hard for ordinary people to get close.

289

If you got The Horn,

290
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,760
I would give up completely.

291
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,440
I will do my best to help you in Big Dipper

292

301
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,840
and wash dishes.

302
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,360
Why are people in the Fifth College so lazy?

303
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,680
I’m the little hope

304
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,520
they hold out in despair.

305
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,360
I let them down.

306
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,000
Lu Ping.

307
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,410
That’s okay.

308
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,160
You can go back to master Chu Min and have a rest.

309
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,920
I have to figure it out myself.

310
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,680

311
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,560

And

319
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,660
everyone looks down on us.

320
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,720

You remind me of someone.

324
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,810
He used to say things like that.

325
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,600
He’s so much purer in heart than you are,

326
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,280
that he doesn’t use others as an excuse.

327
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,050
What do you mean?

328
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
You’ve been there hundreds of times

329
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,320
and never got a weapon.

330
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,280
It shows that the weapon
you are looking for is of high level.

331
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,040
You saved me

332
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,800
to use my Force of Sound.

333
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,520
Your target is

334
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,160
The Horn,

335
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,600
right?

336
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,800
I thought you were good,

337
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
but I didn’t expect you were useless.

338
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Same as you.

339
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,020
I don’t think you're much better.

340
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,120
I am curious.

341
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,540
There are thousands of weapons in Qisha Institute.

342
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,320
Why do you want The Horn?

343
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
It is the best.

344
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,760
You should have a reason.

345
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,160
I’m going to get rid of evil.

346
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
What about you?

347
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Does that matter?

348
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,440
I will get The Horn.

349
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,080
I won’t let you get it.

350
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,720
Not with the best of intentions.

351
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,380
Speak it out. What do you want?

352
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
I want to ask you.

353
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,930
Is there a way to help

354
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,480
Lu Ping to get The Horn faster?

355
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,720
He wants The Horn?

356
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
Guo Youdao.

357
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,640
You are clever.

358
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,170
Give me the wine.

359
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,960
Yes.

360
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,080
This tune.

361
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,450
What is this?

362
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,280
Didn’t you say that the wind in the stone room

363
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,520
would urge The Horn

364
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,240
to expand Force of Sound?

365
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Master said you have lost your power of force.

366
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,060
You can’t fight directly.

367
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,040
You can only win by dodging.

368
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,760
So I arrange the bells.

369
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,960
Later, I use the power of sword to

370
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
pick up the cobbles and hit the bell.

371
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,400
Cobbles rebound can simulate

372
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,680
the track of Force of Sound.

373
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,720
It can help you to practice.

374
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,680
You are clever.

375
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,320
Do you think of anything?

376
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,000
Do you remember the day we breaking the force?

377
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Have you heard the tune I sang to you ?

378
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,300
I don’t remember where

379
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,120
I heard it,

380
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,840
nor who sang it.

381
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,320
But it is in my mind.

382
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,520
I know it is the song.

383
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,530
What does this have to do with the Horn?

384
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,240
Someting.

385
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
When I was close to The Horn that day,

386
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,540
the attacks that resonated with the wind

387
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,480
were not irregular.

388
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,720
The tune is this song.

389
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,600
You mean that

390
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,800
as long as you know this song,

391
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,160
you can know the direction of the next sound wave.

392
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,240
As long as you can avoid the sound wave,

393
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
you can walk to the front of The Horn.

394
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,720
Are you ready?

395
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,160
Lu Ping.

396
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,320
You are a worthy opponent.

397
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,160
I have my responsibility to complete.

398
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
I am sorry.

399
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
You are late.

400
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,320
Tang Xiaomei said

401
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,720
she had cleaned kitchen.

402
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,520
If you dare to cook without permission,

403
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,380
she will break your leg tomorrow.

404
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,650
Senior Huo Ying told me,

405
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,320
this sweet cake is famous

406
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,380
and hard to buy.

407
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It usually takes half a day to get it.

408
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
How did you buy it?

409
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,920
Did you use the Token of your family

410
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,560
or being unreasonable?

411
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,000
It is not Kaifeng.

412
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,480
The Token is useless.

413
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,960
I heard the boss of the shop is a couple.

414
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,560
I coaxed the boss that,

415
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,480
my husband is seriously ill,

416
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,420
he has high fever and talks nonsense.

417
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,720
He really wants to eat the sweet cake.

418
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,640
The boss believed me

419
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,200
and gave me the last box.

420
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,240
It’s a reward for

421
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,080
your hard practice.

422
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,080
You are influenced by me.

423
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
A good liar now.

424
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,760
Here.

425
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,010
Have a share of nice food

426
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,880
with you.

427
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,760
I have stayed a long time in Kaifeng.

428
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
I love the life

429
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,440
here.

430
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,760
Here?

431
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,080
There is no fancy clothes and delicious food.

432
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,920
You have to practice with me.

433
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,960
Don’t you mind?

434
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
I am the honor of Family Qin.

435
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,400
I’m sure to help

436
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,260
when I see that you’re not so skilled.

437
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,720

438

The martial arts of the Qin Family are secret.

Now there’s Miss Qin

440

teaching me attentively.

I m so unique.

442
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,000
Am I one of Qin’s?

443
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,320
Lu Ping!

444
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,880
You took advantage of me!

445
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,520
You said your husband is seriously ill.

446
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,580
He has high fever and talks nonsense.

447
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,240
Wait. I am eating.

448
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,200
You…

449
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,240
You two are together!

Mr. Wei.

452

Miss Qin is practicing the secret skill with me.

453
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,100
Don’t you always be afraid of suffering?

454
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,360
Why are you here?

455
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,890
I am afraid you will do something bad to Sangsang.

457
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,880
It’s time to leave.

Do you want to cook White

464
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,840
for dinner?

466
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,240
Has it been our fault?

467
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,800
We treat ourselves as losers.

468
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,700
So they treat us as losers.

469
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,730
I don’t know when my courage

470
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,560
has become smaller than White.

472
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,840
I think Lu Ping could do it.

Although he failed last time,

474
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,880
I have a hunch that

475
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,440
he will succeed this time.

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,100
Can this resonance

521
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
break the chain?

522
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,400
Master.

523
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,200
What’s wrong?

524
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,000
The Horn.

525
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,210
Can I have a look?

526
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,480
I said he could do it.

527
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,680
Twenty five for one.

528
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,640
Money.

529
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,920
Lu Ping, you are awesome.

530
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,160
Yes. You are good.

531
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Impossible.

532
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,360
How could I lose?

533
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,440
That kid met a lot of impossibilities.

534
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,160
It was impossible

535
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,920
for him to live,

536
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,640
but he did.

537
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,760
He broke the Qisha Institute.

538
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,160
Do you look down on me?

539
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,840
You are goof. Come back!

540
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,760
Fight with me!

541
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,120
Come back!

542
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,640
Master.

543
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,610
Guo Youdao has died.

544
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,400
Bullshit.

545
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,800
He is coward.

546
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,320
A mouse!

547
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,640
He promised me

548
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,000
if I stayed in Qisha Institute,

549
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,400
he would come back and fight with me.

550
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,800
I waited for him in Big Dipper

551
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,600
for more than ten years.

552
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,400
If Ican’t win him,

553
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,000
what’s the point of

554
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,440
the past few years?

555
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,010
It is meaningful, for sure.

556
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,840
Elder.

557
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,920
I heard that you have rebuilt the Qisha Institute

558
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,380
in Big Dipper these years,

559
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,760
gathering the scattered weapons.

560
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,460
I think master will be happy to hear about

561
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,840
your achievements.

562
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,160
I don’t care if he’s happy.

563
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,440
I want to prove

564
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,200
I am better than him.

565
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,500
[Guo Youdao]
[Guo Wushu]

566
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,240
I can’t live under his name all my life.

567
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,280
Elder.

568
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,720
I know you miss him.

569
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,840
You don’t want to believe his death.

570
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,720
I don’t miss him.

571
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,880
He didn’t want to come back.

572
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,040
Before master died,

573
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I've been told some obscure things.

574
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,500
I couldn’t get the meaning that time.

575
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,080
It’s not until today that

576
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,640
I understand what he means.

577
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,540
He told Master Chu Min to take me here.

578
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,080
He knew I would meet you.

579
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,370
He used you to stimulate my competitive mind.

580
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,200
He led me to Qisha Institute.

581
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,000
He sealed my power of force temporarily

582
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
by connecting star to destiny.

583
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,720
So that I can practice Force of Sound

584
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,920
to the extreme,

585
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,600
and get The Horn.
