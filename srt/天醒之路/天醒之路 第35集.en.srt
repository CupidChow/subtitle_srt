00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,820
Legend of Awakening

3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 35

4
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,470
Old White.

5
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,260
He’s also a poor guy imprisoned here.

6
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Unfortunately, he is insane.

7
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,190
Snowy weed.

8
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,070
It is not fatal.

9
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,910
The weed would be given to those who

10
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,030
know the secret in the army.

11
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
They will lose their mind if taking it for long.

12
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,280
They will forget their past.

13
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,350
Even forget who they are.

14
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,670
If I am right,

15
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,310
he is Lyu Chenfeng.

16
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,870
What?

17
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,020
He is Lyu Chenfeng. Master of Tianquan Peak.

18
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,710
He is the reason

19
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,210
why I came to Wuji Manor.

20
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,020
How about Lu Ping and Qin Sang?

21
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,230
Don’t worry.

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,110
I’ve arranged them

23
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,240
in the same place with Lyu.

24
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,230
They’re safe.

25
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,190
I hope you can understand that

26
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,560
it’s necessary for me to do that.

27
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,900
Father.

28
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,390
It’s my fault.

29
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,030
I wronged you.

30
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,110
I am sorry.

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,680
Now we’ve got the Thousand Pine Ruler.

32
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,740
Shanhai Gang would surly come for it.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,270
We must be more cautious in the future.

34
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,750
You have to take care of our Wuji Manor

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,900
and the martial arts circles.

36
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,790
I see.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
You can go with your seniors and juniors,

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,060
and take the Ruler to Wuji Manor.

39
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,370
Keep it under close supervision.

40
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,590
I can take care of the rest.

41
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,430
Yes.

42
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,760
He called me eldest brother.

43
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,150
He was calling my father.

44
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,830
Lu Ping.

45
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,590
We met an old friend by chance.

46
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,650
Isn’t that good?

47
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,880
It’s a pity that he doesn’t remember anything.

48
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,470
Otherwise, I can ask

49
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,480
what my father looks like

50
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,380
and what my mother looks like.

51
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,050
You don’t have parents.

52
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,750
But you have me.

53
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
I have to find a way out

54
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,390
because of your words.

55
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,790
Bring Old White with us.

56
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,470
The drug is for him.

57
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,690
Someone has a secret

58
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
and doesn’t want him to remember it.

59
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,730
What do you mean?

60
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,110
You need to know something.

61
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,770
Wen Rui fought against the attackers.

62
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,210
His skill is not from Shanhai Gang,

63
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,350
but Wuji Manor.

64
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Recently, Master Yan has done a lot.

65
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,600
It seems that he intended to stop the Longjie Army

66
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,560
from eliminating the Shanhai Gang.

67
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
I even doubt that…

68
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,950
No.

69
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,220
Uncle Yan is a good friend of my father’s.

70
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,710
He hates Liu Song.

71
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,560
And he was injured last time
to solve the problem of Big Dipper.

72
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,909
He defends me and Big Dipper.

73
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,150
I don’t believe

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,960
he was colluding with Shanhai Gang.

75
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,220
I don’t get it, either.

76
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,790
If he did it,

77
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,950
what’s his purpose?

78
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,909
If only Old White could wake up.

79
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,070
You shared his meal.

80
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,180
The effect should have been weakened by now.

81
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,630
Let’s ask him

82
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,950
if there’s a clue.

83
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,230
Maybe we can get out of here

84
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,820
and find out who is behind the scenes.

85
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,960
How to ask him?

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,920
Let’s stimulate him.

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,910
Qin Sang.

88
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,990
He is a poor man.

89
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,310
Move.

90
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,270
Who are you?

91
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,470
Speak.

92
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,030
You.

93
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,270
It’s you.

94
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,270
It’s you.

95
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,150
We’ve found a way out.

96
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,980
Old White is not crazy.

97
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,390
It’s not a normal sword.

98
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,610
It’s a treasured sword.

99
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,350
With this,

100
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,110
I can find a way out.

101
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,350
Qin Sang.

102
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,630
Do you know?

103
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,470
I had been locked up

104
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,510
in a hellish place like him

105
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,830
for nearly ten years.

106
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,470
I almost forgot who I was.

107
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,910
I thought

108
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,990
I was the only one

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,660
who had such a miserable fate.

110
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,960
I never thought one would suffer the same as me.

111
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,240
Old White.

112
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,760
You won’t give up, right?

113
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,030
So in order to survive,

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,460
we have to fight together.

115
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,190
Sister.

116
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,490
Who are you calling?

117
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,950
She is my wife.

118
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,610
Forge the sword.

119
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,790
Sister.

120
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,610
What are you talking about?

121
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,350
The sword is for your sister?

122
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,230
You…

123
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,030
Your sister is my mother.

124
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,270
Sister.

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,870
Dream!

126
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,040
No one is allowed to be near the master’s study

127
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,150
these days.

128
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,410
Understand?

129
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
Yes, younger master.

130
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,470
Mr. Xifan.

131
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,010
Have you seen Princess?

132
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,600
What happened to her?

133
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,960
She has been looking for Lu Ping since last night,

134
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,360
but hasn’t been back all night.

135
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,320
We can’t find her anywhere.

136
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,580
I am worried about her.

137
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,230
Don’t worry.

138
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,790
I’ve arranged them

139
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,000
in the same place with Lyu.

140
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,950
They’re safe.

141
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,230
It’s necessary for me to do that.

142
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,990
She…

143
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,190
Xifan.

144
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,930
Did you know something?

145
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,130
The princess went to look for Lu Ping every night.

146
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,870
After all, she is young

147
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,280
and cannot help thinking about romance.

148
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,190
I think

149
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,190
they pretend to be attacked.

150
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,710
It’s possible that they both eloped.

151
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,970
That’s impossible!

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,280
The princess is a girl of the highest integrity.

153
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Now the Shanhai Gang has not been destroyed.

154
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,200
How could she ignore his majesty’s edict

155
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,060
and the Qin Family’s reputation?

156
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,670
If she gets what she wants to do,

157
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,750
will the result be different?

158
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,110
What do you mean?

159
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,790
There’s news to inform General Wen.

160
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,600
Wuji Manor has successfully retrieved

161
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,200
the Thousand Pine Ruler the day before yesterday.

162
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,150
You have?

163
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,540
Why didn’t you tell us?

164
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,320
Princess is not in mood for the serious things.

165
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,670
You are indulging her.

166
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,750
Do I have to rely on Longjie Army?

167
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,740
These are matters in Jianghu.

168
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,030
I can solve them by myself.

169
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,430
Mr. Xifan.

170
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,450
Is that true?

171
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,210
General Wen.

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
A few days ago,

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,480
my father and I besieged the team of Shanhai Gang,

174
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,340
and indeed, we have got the Ruler.

175
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,580
How about Liu Song?

176
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,910
He has escaped.

177
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,630
We’ve solved the problem of commander’s seal.

178
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,640
I have invited all people in martial arts circles

179
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,430
to Wuji Manor for the wedding.

180
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,390
This wedding must be held.

181
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,920
Now the princess is missing.

182
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,960
If you send soldiers to look for her,

183
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,840
you’re telling everyone that
the princess escaped the marriage.

184
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,150
Who will bear the guilt

185
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,110
of resisting the marriage?

186
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,350
Do you have any solution?

187
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,780
I have a measure satisfactory to both sides.

188
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,830
The marriage can be held as planned.

189
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
Qin Family can keep their reputation.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,390
The plan to exterminate Shanhai Gang

191
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,310
remains the same.

192
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,480
The marriage can be held as planned?

193
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,430
How?

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,000
The princess is missing.

195
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,040
We have an old friend of Qin’s

196
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,270
in Wuji Manor.

197
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,630
Father.

198
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,590
You mean Ziyan?

199
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,070
No.

200
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Ling Ziyan was the servant of Qin’s.

201
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,440
How could she…

202
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,590
General Wen.

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,830
I will send someone to look for princess.

204
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,390
But we have to do the serious things.

205
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,280
You have to figure it out.

206
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,990
Are you one of Qin’s

207
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,940
or a soldier of the emperor’s?

208
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,710
Father.

209
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,540
Do we really have to deceive General Wen?

210
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,990
No more talking.

211
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,070
It’s a matter in Jianghu.

212
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,540
There are many rules in Longjie Army.

213
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,030
I am annoyed about them.

214
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,870
Moreover,

215
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,360
don’t you want to protect your brother?

216
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,510
After this,

217
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,790
Lu Ping and Qin Sang can get to a faraway place.

218
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,630
As for Ziyan.

219
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
I will report to his majesty myself.

220
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,580
Father.

221
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,750
Can I meet them?

222
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,790
No.

223
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,870
We must eliminate the gang once for all.

224
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,710
Wen Rui buys our words now.

225
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,830
Don’t make trouble

226
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,440
and make him suspicious.

227
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,300
Fan’er.

228
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,120
Don’t hesitate to do something important.

229
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,110
Now we have found the Ruler.

230
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,130
I will fulfill your wish

231
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,190
about the marriage.

232
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,760
Everything will be as your wish.

233
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,270
You can just let it be.

234
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,310
Yes.

235
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,510
Younger master.

236
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,400
Younger master.

237
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,330
Miss Ling comes.

238
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,930
She is preparing the wedding clothes for you.

239
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,390
I see.

240
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,310
Ziyan.

241
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,140
My father’s decision was abrupt.

242
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,000
I am sorry about that.

243
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,470
I asked master for the marriage.

244
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,750
Master.

245
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,000
I wish to marry on behalf of Miss.

246
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,840
I will cooperate with master
to complete the arrangement of his majesty.

247
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,790
Don’t worry.

248
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,750
I grow up with Miss.

249
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,190
I am familiar with her.

250
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,870
There will be no flaws.

251
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,150
You have no relationship with Wuji Manor.

252
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,080
How can you sacrifice your reputation?

253
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,540
Younger master has saved my life.

254
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,760
I am willing to share his worries

255
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,830
and serve him all my life.

256
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,620
I hope you can fulfill my wish.

257
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,560
Xifan asked me several times to take you in.

258
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,230
You are important to him.

259
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,390
In this case,

260
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,569
let’s arrange it like this.

261
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,990
Thanks, master.

262
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,869
Why?

263
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,030
I am nobody.

264
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,480
I’ve received great favor from Wuji Manor.

265
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,910
This marriage matters the future of you,

266
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,910
and Wuji Manor.

267
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,400
I’ll do what Miss can’t do and doesn’t want to do

268
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,510
for her.

269
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,420
Ziyan. You don’t have to force yourself.

270
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,590
I am not.

271
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,830
I’d love to.

272
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,430
Ziyan.

273
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,590
I’d love to marry Yan Xifan.

274
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,030
Others think it’s a show.

275
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,950
You and I know that clearly.

276
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,470
Xifan.

277
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,700
Do you want to marry me?

278
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,790
In this world,

279
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,640
there is only one person whom

280
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,290
I would like to get married with

281
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,550
and live with.

282
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,430
That girl,

283
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,590
is you.

284
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,570
General.

285
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,080
Haven’t found yet?

286
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,510
No.

287
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,470
Check there.

288
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,150
Yes.

289
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,380
You, follow me.

290
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,310
Lu Ping.

291
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,710
Are we going to get out soon?

292
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,240
Are you in such a hurry to get married?

293
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,090
I remember when you and I first met.

294
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,030
You kept hiding your identity from me.

295
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,040
You don’t want to tell me.

296
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,910
I mistook you for

297
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,830
being a member of Shanhai Gang.

298
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,680
Are you still blaming me?

299
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,310
I know now.

300
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,510
You kept it a secret,

301
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,430
hoping I wasn’t involved in trouble.

302
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,290
Why are you talking about this?

303
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,830
I was so cruel to you

304
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,250
to protect you at that time.

305
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,320
You come from a miserable family,

306
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,050
but you are still indomitable.

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,910
I come from a noble family,

308
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,990
but I can do nothing for you.

309
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,380
I will lose the Qin Family’s reputation.

310
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,510
I am a man.

311
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,810
How can I have a girl protecting me?

312
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,240
It’s even more humiliating.

313
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,510
Lu Ping.

314
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,750
If this is really Yan Qiuci’s intention.,

315
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,310
what can you do?

316
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,990
I will ask him by myself.

317
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,060
I will accompany with you.

318
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
What Miss Qin said before

319
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,830
with ambitions,

320
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,790
is because of my masculinity.

321
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,790
You brat.

322
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,670
I hate duplicity the most in my life.

323
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,880
It’s been a long time.

324
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
I need to stand up.

325
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,550
Brother.

326
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,790
Done.

327
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,990
Done?

328
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,870
Good, Old White.

329
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,870
You’re good.

330
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,450
We haven’t put the first edge on it.

331
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,450
There’s no time.

332
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,450
We should get out of here first.

333
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,390
Lu Ping.

334
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,710
Miss Qin.

335
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,590
We are facing Shanhai Gang now.

336
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,790
For Wuji Manor

337
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,630
and Shuo,

338
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,030
the truth can only be hidden with Junior Lyu.

339
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,000
Everyone will think that

340
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,630
you two are a couple living a sequestered life.

341
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,070
They won’t search for you.

342
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,790
Liu Song.

343
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,750
I won’t let you escape this time.

344
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,430
Almost there.

345
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,870
Go on.

346
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,270
What’s wrong?

347
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,350
Hurt.

348
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,670
I have a headache.

349
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,190
It’s bad.

350
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,670
The toxic smoke.

351
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,600
Someone wants to kill us.

352
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,280
Hurry. Let’s get out of here.

353
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,480
Old White.

354
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,110
Hurry.

355
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,290
Let’s go.

356
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,830
Qin Sang.

357
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,720
Brother.

358
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,030
Let’s go.

359
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,570
Hurry. Let’s go.

360
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,200
Old White.

361
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
You’re a good man.

362
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,410
You should know that

363
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,630
I can’t leave my wife behind.

364
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,300
If we can’t get out.

365
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,880
You should live your life well.

366
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,750
Do you hear me?

367
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,310
Go.

368
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,630
Go.

369
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,910
Qin Sang.

370
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,950
Can you hear me?

371
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,710
Silly.

372
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,440
Why did you come back?

373
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,550
Qin Sang.

374
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,980
I always say you’re a fool,

375
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,230
but I am the biggest fool myself.

376
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,750
No.

377
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,330
Four forces are not enough.

378
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,360
I need to break another lock.

379
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,390
One more.

380
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,710
I can save you.

381
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,230
Lu Ping.

382
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,670
Don’t do that.

383
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,230
You’ll die.

384
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,790
I believe I can save you.

385
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,270
Lu Ping.

386
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,590
Lu Ping.

387
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,390
Lu Ping.

388
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,350
Chenfeng.

389
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,710
Forge a sword for my wife.

390
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,840
Weapons are divided into Yin and Yang.

391
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,040
Yin and Yang coexist.

392
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,080
They live together and never separate.

393
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,270
Okay.

394
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,280
I will forge it will cold iron,
and put the first edge with blood.

395
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,710
It would be a nice sword.

396
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,950
Brother.

397
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,310
Do you have a name for it?

398
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,030
Love.

399
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,490
Do you have a name for it?

400
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,830
We can call it,

401
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,710
Dream.

402
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,470
Dream…Dream.

403
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,620
Put the first edge with blood.

404
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,740
Put the first edge with blood.

405
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,480
You’d put the first edge with blood.

406
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,880
Put the first edge with blood.

407
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,540
Put the first edge with blood.

408
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,490
Brother.

409
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,750
I remember it.

410
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,560
Put the first edge with blood.

411
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:11,830
Yes.

412
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,030
Dream.

413
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,070
We have the Dream.

414
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,370
Qin Sang.

415
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,660
Is that because the toxic smoke or bleeding?

416
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,070
Qin Sang, Qin Sang.

417
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,390
It’s the Cold toxin.

418
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,470
Cold toxin in her body.

419
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,040
Is that because of your sword?

420
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,160
Did you poison in the sword?

421
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,630
No.

422
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,630
No.

423
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,880
It’s the cold iron at the bottom of the lake.

424
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,640
I need to find Wen Rui.

425
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,710
He should have a way.

426
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,390
Old White.

427
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
Why are you staring blankly?

428
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,070
Father.

429
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,490
I’ve sent invitations.

430
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,670
Uncles from all sects came here.

431
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,460
That’s a big opportunity.

432
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,830
I will introduce them to you later.

433
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,790
Father.

434
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,890
When shall we eliminate Shanhai Gang?

435
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,590
We can do the thing

436
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,510
step by step.

437
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,800
Eliminating Shanhai Gang will be

438
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,590
the first thing you do in Jianghu.

439
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,430
Can I meet Lu Ping

440
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,870
after that?

441
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,870
It is your wedding today.

442
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,290
You are marrying the girl you love.

443
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,230
Cheer up.

444
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,750
Go and find her.

445
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,200
I need to see her,

446
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,520
no matter she is alive or dead.

447
00:30:59,520 --> 00:30:59,990
Yes.

448
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,630
Wen Rui.

449
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,870
Princess.

450
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,950
Find a doctor.

451
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,920
What dose Princess look like now with you?

452
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,350
You couldn’t protect her

453
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,510
with an army.

454
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,830
How about you?

455
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,050
General.

456
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,740
Princess has got cold poison in her body.

457
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,150
How…

458
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,880
Get some ginger soup.

459
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,310
And get a fire

460
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,600
to warm the Princess.

461
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:42,950
Yes.

462
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,310
I am on it.

463
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,190
Lu Ping.

464
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,510
Lu Ping.

465
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,190
I am here.

466
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,940
Do you feel better?

467
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,830
Where am I?

468
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,760
Princess.

469
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,870
It’s a mansion of Wuji Manor.

470
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,670
It’s my fault

471
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,470
that you got hurt.

472
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,190
Yes. It is your fault.

473
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,540
A question for you.

474
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,310
Why is it all red

475
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,510
in Wuji Manor?

476
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,210
What’s going on?

477
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,140
Master Yan insists on the wedding

478
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,040
despite of the disappearance of the Princess.

479
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,310
It’s a grant marriage.

480
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,190
I can’t help it.

481
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,590
Wedding?

482
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,450
Qin Sang is not here.

483
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,070
Who will Xifan marry?

484
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,060
What’s wrong with Wuji Manor?

485
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,790
Wuji Manor.

486
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,710
Brother. Sister.

487
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,830
Wuji Manor.

488
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,670
Wuji... Wuji Manor.

489
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,240
Old White. What happened?

490
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,920
What’s wrong?

491
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,520
Old White.

492
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,400
Old White. What’s wrong?

493
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Brother. Sister.

494
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,630
I saw him again.

495
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,680
It’s all right.

496
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,710
I saw him again.

497
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,230
Miss.

498
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,430
Who is he?

499
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,590
He is Lyu Chenfeng.

500
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,810
Old White. Don’t panic.

501
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,320
-He is out of his mind.
-That’s all right.

502
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,120
That’s all right.

503
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,520
He only believes Lu Ping.

504
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Don’t bother him.

505
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,840
Old White.

506
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
I’ve remembered.

507
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,440
What do you remember?

508
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,850
The reason why I have stayed here for 19 years.

509
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,110
I am your brother.

510
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,600
You can tell me.

511
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,310
Liar.

512
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,690
My eldest brother is dead.

513
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,270
Old White.

514
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,909
Do you remember?

515
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,239
I need you to kill him for me.

516
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,030
Kill my foe for me.

517
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,570
I want to avenge for my brother.

518
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,159
Why don’t you kill him by yourself?

519
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,750
Who is he?

520
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,850
I don’t practice the martial arts.

521
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,159
My eldest brother, sister.

522
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,070
My seniors and juniors.

523
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,190
They all practice the martial arts

524
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,350
except me.

525
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,610
I only know how to forge swords.

526
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,570
I thought my eldest brother

527
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,870
would protect me all my life.

528
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,469
It’s why I can’t protect him

529
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,469
on that day.

530
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,510
I don’t know who you are.

531
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,430
But I can only rely on you now.

532
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,030
Tell me his name.

533
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,030
He…

534
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,410
I don’t know.

535
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,150
I remembered just now.

536
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,870
I only know

537
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,740
he is in Wuji Manor.

538
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,550
Wuji Manor.

539
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,310
Wuji Manor.

540
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,950
Wuji Manor.

541
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,650
Come out with me.

542
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,880
I have something to ask.

543
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,470
What?

544
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,550
Let go of me.

545
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Tell me the truth.

546
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,390
What happened in Wuji Manor

547
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,080
when Qin Sang and I were in water prison?

548
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,910
Yan Qiuci got the Thousand Pine Ruler

549
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,410
back from Shanhai Gang.

550
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,870
Today’s wedding is

551
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,790
for Xifan and Ling Ziyan.

552
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,790
He used Qin’s reputation

553
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,170
and frontier military defense as excuses.

554
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,430
I

555
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,430
can’t stop him.

556
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,550
He is good to his own son.

557
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,170
How about the son of his friend?

558
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,830
So cruel.

559
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,990
What do you mean?

560
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,400
What are you going to do?

561
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,130
What can I do?

562
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,630
We are old friends

563
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,380
and we can talk about the past.

564
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,730
Master, wait for me.

565
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,550
Master.

566
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,230
What’s wrong?

567
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,030
Master.

568
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,230
The Force of Air is a dodge skill.

569
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,040
It’s for you to move quickly.

570
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
It’s not for running forward day and night.

571
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,900
We have been running for a day.

572
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,550
The horses are dead.

573
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,590
I am the next

574
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,200
to be exhausted to death.

575
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,040
I am afraid there’s not enough time for my brother.

576
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,750
Master.

577
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,350
Or

578
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,600
you can carry me.

579
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,460
Say that again?

580
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,430
Wait.

581
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,350
Master.

582
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,830
The smell of boss.

583
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,380
Something goes wrong.

584
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,280
Old White.

585
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,030
I am taking him to Wuji Manor.

586
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,390
Lu Ping.

587
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,510
It is Xifan’s wedding.

588
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,590
Although Yan Qiuci is unpredictable,

589
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,450
he is determined to destroy Shanhai Gang.

590
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,080
In case someone is controlling Wuji Manor,

591
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,830
or there are secrets,

592
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,290
we have to wait until we find out the truth.

593
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,070
Calm down.

594
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,430
Don’t worry.

595
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,280
I know it is Xifan’s wedding.

596
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,320
I have my sense of propriety.

597
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,240
I have made an agreement with Wen Rui.

598
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,200
He would attend the wedding tonight

599
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,460
and bring Old White and me into the manor.

600
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,990
I’m just checking.

601
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,180
Whatever the outcome,

602
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,050
I will discuss with you.

603
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,090
You can have a rest here.

604
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,750
Wait for me.

605
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,830
Take care.

606
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,530
Let’s go. Old White.

607
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,020
[Wuji]

608
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,870
Master Liu. Nice to meet you.

609
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,180
Old White.

610
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,950
It is a big event today.

611
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,050
You should listen to me.

612
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,950
Yes.

613
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,110
Brother.

614
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,860
Why do you call me brother?

615
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,090
Don’t worry.

616
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,840
Today, you only need to identify the enemy.

617
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,700
I will take care

618
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,270
of the rest.

619
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,630
Master Yan, congratulations.

620
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,030
Everyone.

621
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,500
Please have a seat.

622
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,430
I am indebted to be

623
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,410
the master of martial arts circles for years.

624
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,230
Now Shanhai Gang makes trouble in Jianghu.

625
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,590
I will fight against the gang with you.

626
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,510
Today, my son and Princess Xining are married.

627
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,990
After the wedding,

628
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,110
they will work with you

629
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,870
to eliminate the scum in the Jianghu,

630
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,250
and maintain the justice.

631
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,470
Great.

632
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,630
It’s time to welcome the bride.

633
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,410
You don't wait for me to drink on your wedding.

634
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,540
Do you remember our brotherhood?

635
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,720
Old White.

636
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,670
Look carefully.

637
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,600
Is there your enemy here?

638
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,270
Yan Family is skilled in the sword.

639
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,430
I will pass on the sword treasured by the family to my son.

640
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,840
I also passed on Yan Family to Xifan.

641
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,510
I hope you all can

642
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,270
take care of my son in the future.

643
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,190
Xifan.

644
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,750
Take this.

645
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,250
Thanks, father.

646
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Younger master. Congratulations.

647
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,040
Old White. Are you all right?

648
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,000
The sword.

649
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,210
The man with this sword.

650
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,310
It’s him.

651
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,790
He killed my eldest brother.
