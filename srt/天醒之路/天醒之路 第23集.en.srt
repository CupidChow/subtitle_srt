00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,579
Episode 23

4
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,520
When we arrived,

5
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,079
I found that your army

6
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,040
had surrounded the post.

7
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
I even didn’t know I was

8
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,840
in Tan or Shuo.

9
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,640
It is a routine to have army for security

10
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,720
at the peace talk site.

11
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,720
You say you come to negotiate,

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,079
but you actually bring an army here.

13
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,640
It seems that you don’t mean what you said.

14
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,880
Xu Tianbing,

15
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,360
peace talk benefits both countries and people.

16
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
It is the decision of majesty and your emperor.

17
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,800
Why?

18
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,600
Are you afraid of

19
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,800
my Longjie Army containing less than 100 people

20
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,880
because of your poor military ability?

21
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,080
Qin Qi.

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,920
General Xu.

23
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,560
Minister.

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,360
I didn’t mean that.

25
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,400
However, the years of war

26
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,920
only made our people suffer

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,000
and benefited others.

28
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
I also received massage saying

29
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,160
Shanhai Gang has come to E’zhou.

30
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,840
No one knows what they are up to.

31
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,560
In my opinion,

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,960
we have to be

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
careful right now.

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,800
Enough. General Xu.

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,440
Peace talk is coming. Avoid conflicting.

36
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,520
As I say, minister,

37
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,000
I know you

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,520
are pursuing peace between the two countries.

39
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,640
The peace talk has begun.

40
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,440
Your son took his friends

41
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,640
and Miss Qin

42
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,079
threatened to take my life.

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,000
They threatened me with peace talk

44
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,720
at the gate of my city

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,960
and asked me to let refugees in.

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,840
Minister Xu,

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,040
you two must have made your decision.

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,720
And I as a general

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,040
may well have to retire.

50
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
Please go on your talk.

51
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,120
I will leave first.

52
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,520
General Xu!

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,960
Minister Xu.

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Your general may be

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,520
too arrogant.

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,040
I…

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,800
Minister.

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,560
My sister was indeed self-indulgent in the
refugee event.

59
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,720
Please forgive her.

60
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,800
It’s just a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
We have exchanged our peace talk contract.

62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,840
We have some details to talk about.

63
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,640
Shall we call it a day?

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
Your son is upright.

65
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,960
Please send my best wishes to him.

66
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,240
The peace talk may not seem so easy.

67
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,440
Majesty was determined

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,920
and asked us to make it.

69
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,200
In my opinion,

70
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,520
you have to stop your sister

71
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,240
from doing wrong things.

[Breeze Mansion]

73
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,480
Father,

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,520
why did you come?

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,640
My good son and his friends

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
kidnapped the general of this city

77
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,080
and let the refugees in.

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,360
If I don’t come back,

79
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,800
will you change the world one day?

80
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,640
Father,

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,840
General Xu was too cautious.

82
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,400
People are innocent.

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,159
You have come for the peace talk.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,760
We have to deal with those refugees anyway.

85
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,320
If we take actions earlier, they will suffer less.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
As for my friends,

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
they are my fellow disciples in Big Dipper.

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,680
Please let them live in here.

89
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
I will take care of them.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,680
Weifeng, I know that you have cared about

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,080
the politics since you were young.

92
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,240
But you have to

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
be steadier from now on.

94
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,880
I am sorry.

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
I made you worry.

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,880
Forget it.

97
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
According to General Qin,

98
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,720
Shanhai Gang seems

99
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,920
to be ambitious.

100
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,280
They may cause big troubles.

101
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,840
It benefits us to have helpers from Jianghu.

102
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,159
The war has lasted for too long.

103
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Anyway,

104
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,200
the peace talk must be made.

105
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,320
Father,

106
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,560
I told you about joining the army.

107
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,880
You promised me.

108
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
It is what I wrote about managing

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,080
the army during my days in Big Dipper.

110
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,920
Please have a look.

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,520
Since you have left Big Dipper,

112
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
just stay at home for your illness.

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
Don’t think about these things.

114
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,160
Don’t bother writing these.

115
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,600
I know what you are thinking of.

116
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,040
I know that you can’t be persuaded.

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
But you should be practical

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,560
and try to tell right from wrong.

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
I understand.

[Breeze Mansion]

121

Be practical?

122
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,120
If everyone is satisfied with
their original status,

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
and is afraid of changing,

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
who will unite the world?

Help yourself?

126
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,160
Your sister is an idiot.

127
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,669
And you ask me to help myself?

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,600
Who is the idiot?

Master,

130
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
what are you doing?

131
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,480
Didn’t you ask me to bring sugar to you?

132
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,880
I agree.

133
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,480
You are no longer an idiot.

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,560
I have only one condition.

135
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,520
Do you have medicines which can strengthen

136
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,240
human body and cure their illness?

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,840
If I have such,

138
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,480
I would have eaten myself.

139
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,640
They can’t be left.

You can give them to anyone

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,800
except Xu Weifeng, the toy boy.

144

Why?

Master, I don’t understand.

Am I inferior to him?

No one can be so perfect.

You won’t give me no matter what happens, right?

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,360
I will ask Mo Lin for more.

177
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,360
Thank you all the same.

178
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,240
But it is useless

179
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,360
for me.

180
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
I have too many such things in my early years.

181
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,160
Maybe I am bound to be a waste.

182
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,280
What I wrote is just

183
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,200
my day dreaming.

184
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,320
It is not necessarily wrong to have dreams.

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,440
When I was young, my brother and I

186
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
were imprisoned in a horrible place.

187
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,800
I thought it would in my dream to get out.

188
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,040
But my brother told me

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,960
that have dreams were not necessarily wrong.

190
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
If you don’t even have your dreams,

191
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,360
you will really die.

192
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,560
Don’t lose hope.

193
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
Your advice may one day

194
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,640
be put into use one day.

195
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,080
Su Tang,

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
I just met you.

197
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,480
Why do you help me like that?

198
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,040
Both my brother and I don’t have a home.

199
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
I really hope you can succeed

200
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,280
as you helped others go home.

201
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,960
I have had asthma since young.

202
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,760
Even my father lost hope in me.

203
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,800
You are the first one to say it to me.

204
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,960
Su Tang,

205
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,440
thank you.

206
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,440
After senior left,

207
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,520
you are the first one

208
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,120
to cheer my brother up.

209
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,720
I thank you for him.

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,760
Does Lu Ping really

211
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
care about his senior?

212
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,280
OK. I will do it myself.

213
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,720
It’s late.

214
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,240
You have to go to bed.

215
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,280
I will take the medicine.

216
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,520
By the way,

217
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,040
send my message to Lu Ping

218
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,960
that his senior will surly come back.

219
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,800
I have taken the medicine.

220
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,280
Don’t worry.

221
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,120
Good bye.

222
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,880
Boss.

223
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
I know what you mean when you

224
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,720
say that I should help myself.

225
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
You toy boy,

226
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,480
my drugs would bring you diarrhea.

227
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,840
Let’s see how you can flirt with master.

228
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,280
Miss,

229
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,280
according to the general,

230
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,320
it is during the peace talk.

231
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,760
Please stay at your room.

232
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,320
Did you climb over the wall again?

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,160
Aren’t you afraid of being killed by arrows?

234
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,080
I said that we can

235
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,720
meet even if we don’t live together.

236
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
Have you got any information about Xifan?

237
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,820
[Breeze Mansion]

238
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,040
It is already midnight.

239
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,160
He hasn’t got diarrhea.

240
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Did he find out it is a purge

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
and refused to eat?

242
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,840
He goes out alone

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,240
in such a night.

244
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,640
As I said, he can’t be so perfect.

245
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,000
He must have some problems.

246
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,960
It’s strange.

247
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,520
Where is he?

248
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,440
I asked the scouts your brother gave

249
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,840
me to search in the city for long

250
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,200
without results.

251
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,440
What about the peace talk?

252
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,520
It will start tomorrow.

253
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,720
If Shanhai Gang wants to interfere,

254
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,680
they will certainly appear tonight.

255
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
Xu Tianbing is arrogant

256
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,200
and made conflicts with my brother.

257
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,760
My brother tolerated him

258
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
for the sake of the peace talk.

259
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,280
He isn’t so patient

260
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,000
when facing me.

261
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,109
It is different between

262
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,829
sister and official affairs.

263
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
If one day, some brat boy

264
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,240
gets close to Su Tang,

265
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,800
what will you do?

266
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,160
If Su Tang really likes him,

267
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,040
I don’t care who he is.

268
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,000
Lu Ping, don’t give your sister to a bad guy.

269
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Xu Weifeng is not a good man.

270
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,160
How did you come, too?

271
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,400
Why?

272
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,320
Lu Ping can come.

273
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,680
Why can’t I?

274
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,800
What’s more,

275
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,160
I have been good at Force of Air

276
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,680
since I broke my force.

277
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
I no longer need bricks when climbing over walls.

278
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,240
Oh,

279
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,000
let’s talk about something serious.

280
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,840
I saw Xu Weifeng put out the candle

281
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,640
and left his mansion.

282
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,640
He was stealthy.

283
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,760
He must have some secrets.

284
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,640
But I lost him at the half way

285
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,920
or I will expose his secret.

286
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,720
Why did you stay at the gate

287
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,600
of his mansion at midnight?

288
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,160
I…

289
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,800
Miss,

290
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
news from Xu’s Mansion.

291
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,920
Something happened to Xu Weifeng.

292
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,000
Miss Su Tang couldn’t find her brother or Mo Lin,

293
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,160
and she came to you.

294
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Didn’t you say that Xu left at midnight?

295
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,560
Why did something happen to him?

296
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,560
Who knows what

297
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,880
evil things he is doing?

298
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,920
Maybe he detected me

299
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,760
and left me on purpose.

300
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,480
Boss,

301
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,040
think about it.

302
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
We are not the people of Tan.

303
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,040
Why did he help us whole-heartedly?

304
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,720
Brother.

305
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,800
What’s up?

306
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,280
Mr. Xu is spewing blood.

307
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
We can’t stop him.

308
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,640
Young master.

309
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,640
Young master.

310
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,520
Young master.

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,360
Mr. Xu.

312
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,200
He is poisoned.

313
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,360
Where is the antidote?

314
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,560
Do you want to expose me in public?

315
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,600
You can be jealous.

316
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,680
But you have to save him.

317
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,880
Did you give him poison?

318
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,760
I…

319
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,000
I just gave

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,520
him a purge.

321
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
Who knows he will spew blood?

322
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,280
Moreover,

323
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,760
you should ask him

324
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,120
why he went out secretly at midnight.

325
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,840
What was he up to?

326
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,840
Young master heard that you

327
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,680
were searching for Mr. Yan.

328
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
He gave some money

329
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,080
to the refugees

330
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,520

I know I am lazy, greedy and cowardly.

344

get out with me.

help myself.

It is not like this.

349
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,960
Should I watch master go with him?

350
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,920
Boss,

351
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,720
Xu Weifeng is not one of us.

352
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,840
We are friends that are ready to die for each other.

353
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,520
Do you also think that I was wrong?

354
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,400
You just have to

355
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,560
apologize to Senior Xu first.

356
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,880
Okay.

357
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
You believe in him although

358
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,280
you just know him for a short time.

359
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Since you don’t believe in me,

360
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,880
I can leave.

361
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,240
Even if I give up the career as an assassin,

362
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,400
I can go back to Wuyou Valley

363
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,200
to inherit my property.

364
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,760
Let’s never see each other again.

365
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,640
Mo Lin.

366
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,480
-Mo Lin.
-Mr. Lu.

367
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,560
Mr. Lu.

368
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,600
Young master has woken up.

369
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,440
He had got a information of Mr. Yan.

370
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,400
There is a mansion in the outskirt,

371
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,160
which used to be the home of officials’ concubines

372
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,800
with the name of Tingsong Villa.

373
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,680
It used to be a wild land.

374
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,520
But these days,

375
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,440
people came and went there at night.

376
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,240
Some refugees found that Mr. Yan

377
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,160
was one of those people.

378
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,800
Senior Xu,

379
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,400
it was my brother’s mistake that you got poisoned.

380
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,160
I apologize for him.

381
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,640
But I still suspect you.

382
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,080
We just knew each other.

383
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,480
You don’t have to get involved in,

384
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,360
let alone helping us

385
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,400
at the risk of your life.

386
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,120
For all my life,

387
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,240
no one thinks I can achieve anything

388
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
because of my inherent illness.

389
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,600
Only Miss Su Tang encouraged me.

390
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,320
I should have done that

391
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,040
for her trust.

392
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,440
Then I will accept your information.

393
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,520
Brother.

394
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,680
-I…
-Su Tang.

395
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,920
Take good care of Senior Xu.

396
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,520
Mr. Xu.

397
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,840
General.

398
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,160
What happened?

399
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,240
Miss ran again.

400
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,760
She left a message saying

401
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,600
she was to search for Yan Xifan with Lu Ping.

402
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,160
General Qin,

403
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,680
the peace talk will start tomorrow.

404
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,280
Xu Tianbing was so aggressive.

405
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,280
There are many items we haven’t decided on.

406
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,760
It is not the time for your own business.

407
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,400
Family and country are different.

408
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
Don’t you see that I am talking with Mr. Xia?

409
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,320
Go now.

410
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,640
Get her back.

411
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,800
Yes.

412
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,920
Mr. Xia.

413
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,520
It is between me and Yan Xifan.

414
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,760
Why do you come?

415
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,120
Your business is also what I care about.

416
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,320
I am also helping my brother

417
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,920
when I am helping you.

418
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,120
Lu Ping.

419
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,800
It’s almost there.

420
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
Have you thought about that if

421
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,760
Xifan is really there,

422
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,760
what will you do?

423
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,840
He never defeated me in Zhaifeng.

424
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,480
Maybe I can

425
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,880
beat him to wake him up.

426
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,200
What if…

427
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
What if he

428
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,760
doesn’t wake up?

429
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,160
Did you think of the worst situation?

430
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,680
In my hardest times,

431
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,400
he never gave up on me.

432
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,680
I will neve give up on him.

433
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,160
I won’t leave him in Shanhai Gang

434
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,680
no matter he is good or bad,

435
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,640
insane or silly.

436
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,520
He doesn’t want to live like that.

437
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Don’t worry.

438
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,600
The evil cannot beat the justice.

439
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,920
Xifan is upright.

440
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,680
He can’t be prisoned in Shanhai Gang.

441
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,480
My junior almost moves me

442
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,960
by showing his feeling for me.

443
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,400
You said that I have never defeated you.

444
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,560
You are so confident

445
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,480
to save me.

446
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,960
Aren’t you afraid that I might be jealous?

447
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,360
Xifan, let’s talk

448
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,040
later when we are back.

449
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
It is not funny in Shanhai Gang.

450
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,160
Go back with me,

451
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,760
Lu Ping.

452
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,360
Xifan,

453
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
wake up.

454
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,720
Don’t forget it.

455
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
It’s because of you that Zhaifeng destroyed.

456
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,280
You are the one to reflect on yourself.

457
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
I am fine now.

458
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,920
Master Zhou,

459
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,520
take good care of them.

460
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,800
After our big event,

461
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,400
take them to the gang.

462
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
You can go back first.

463
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,920
I will take care of Mr. Xu.

464
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,680
Yes.

465
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,560
Mr. Xu.

466
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,760
It is windy here.

467
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,120
You can’t stand it.

468
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,440
I feel much better

469
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
seeing you care about me.

470
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,960
Don’t worry.

471
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,080
They are brothers.

472
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,520
They will end all the things.

473
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,360
What?

474
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,000
You should not stand in the wind.

475
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,720
I will go to get you a coat.

476
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,240
I know I am lazy, greedy and cowardly.

477
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,320
But I swear in my name of

478
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,920
the World’s No. 1 Assassin

479
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,880
that I didn’t give him poison.

480
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,200
What?

481
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,440
People can use acupoint

482
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,680
to create fake health condition.

483
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,080
If Mo Lin didn’t tell the lie,

484
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,640
Mr. Xu may really forge his

485
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,320
condition of being poisoned.

486
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,380
[Su Jing Dan Shuo Tan]

487
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,280
It is Shanhai Token.

488
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,720
How come it is here?

489
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,680
Are you familiar

490
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,400
with this token?

491
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,400
Mr. Xu,

492
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,120
you are from Shanhai Gang.

493
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,320
Sometimes it is happy to know nothing.

494
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,360
Why do you want to know the truth?

495
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,880
You should have been more careful

496
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,040
in case you may be exposed.

497
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,600
Mr. Yan, you are not qualified to teach me.

498
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,920
I am the team leader

499
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,480
in the frame of E’zhou.

500
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,680
You are here

501
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,720
to help me.

502
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,920
Xifan,

503
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,480
he is our leader this time.

504
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,440
Master.

505
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,120
You are…

506
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,560
I heard that you were a friend of Lu Ping.

507
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,480
Maybe this time

508
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,600
I need your help.

509
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,560
Don’t you believe him?

510
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Mr. Xu is said to be the
son of Military Minister.

511
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,200
He also cooperated with Lu

512
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,080
in E’zhou and became his good friend.

513
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,880
I don’t know why

514
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,280
you want to join in hand with us.

515
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,520
Allies are made

516
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,280
by profit.

517
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,040
Everything is under control.

518
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,520
Have you arranged the scapegoat

519
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,920

I am just curious that

533
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,200
whether your king

knows about our cooperation?

00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,440
I am just an ordinary man.

692
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,800
If you are hurt because of me,

693
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
I can’t be at ease.

694
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,080
Zhou Youlong.

695
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,360
The girl I love

696
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,720
must be safe and live long.

697
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,720
I can sacrifice my life

698
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,120
for her,

699
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,680
let alone my martial arts.

700
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,760
It would be better if you

701
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,160
kill Yan Xifan for me

702
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
after you improve your skills.

703
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,040
Master Zhou,

704
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,560
you can’t betray Master Lin.

705
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,600
Zhou Youlong,

706
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,920
dare you to touch him!

707
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,040
I will kill you.

708
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,320
Master,

709
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,040
let’s talk at another place.

710
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,440
I can’t stand the scene

711
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,480
of saying goodbye.

712
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,800
We have to focus when doing Xi Sui.

713
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,400
As I said,

714
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,680
you can’t leave me.

715
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,040
Are you OK?

716
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,120
I’m OK.

717
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,560
Just now, you said you like me

718
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,840
and could sacrifice your life for me.

719
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,600
Is it true or were you acting?

720
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,840
I will tell you after all these.

721
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,800
Boss, please flirt

722
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,360
at another time.

723
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,440
I found our senior in the city.

724
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,680
He dressed like another person

725
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,600
and sneaked into the post.

726
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,520
There were many baskets on the cart beside,

727
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,360
with a strong smell of blood.

728
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,200
It felt strange.

729
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,600
So I came to you.

730
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,920
Post?

731
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,440
What was he doing there?

732
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,560
Oh dear.

733
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,400
Shanhai Gang will ruin the peace talk.

734
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,880
Qin Qi is very careful about this.

735
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,160
Now Xifan interfered into it.

736
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,320
It will cause great trouble.
