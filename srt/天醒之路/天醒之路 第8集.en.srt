00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,520
[Episode 8]

3
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,100
Honorable guests?

4
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,200
Are those the honorable guests
you mentioned?

5
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,720
No matter what, I want the private seats.

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
Wei Hu.

7
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,320
Throw them out.

8
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,320
Mr. Wei, Master instructed us

9
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,850
that we must keep
a low profile in Kaifeng.

10
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,050
If you won't, I'll do it myself.

11
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
Sir.

12
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,240
Move aside!

13
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
Sir, don't smash anything. Sir!

14
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,600
Go!

15
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,840
Excuse me, this is your congee.

16
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
Young Master!

17
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Young Master!

18
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
You...

19
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
Sir.

20
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
I'm taking the congee.

21
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,640
Madam.

22
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Thank you for standing up for us.

23
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,600
May I ask for your name?

24
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Get lost.

25
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
Just tell me your name.

26
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,680
I can tell that you're highly skilled.

27
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,340
I would like to learn from you.

28
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,610
Anyone who keeps me from having congee...

29
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,080
deserves to be beaten up.

30
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,300
Anyone who stands in my way...

31
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,340
deserves to be beaten up more.

32
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,959
Lu Ping.

33
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,520
Did you see her stances?

34
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,000
No, she was too fast.

35
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,680
Not even Qin Sang can see clearly
with her soul of Vision.

36
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,540
What happened?

37
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
We're just having congee.

38
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,720
How did it end up like this?

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,000
How is it? Are you hurt?

40
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
Don't worry. I'll stand up for you.

41
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,159
Who did it?

42
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,440
Master, you're really good
at acting in hindsight.

43
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,560
What are you saying?

44
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,680
Wasn't I away to get things done for you?

45
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Master was actually away just now
to get us a greeting gift.

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
Yet you can't come with us
to Tianzhao Academy.

47
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,080
I am after all
the Head of Zhaifeng Institute.

48
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,120
What does it make me

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,920
if I take my disciples
to Tianzhao Academy?

50
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
Take this greeting gift.

51
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
She will welcome you in person.

52
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,920
What gift is it?

53
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,180
It's fresh out of the oven.

54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,520
Fresh and piping hot.

55
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
A snack?

56
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,520
Is it sweet? Is it good?

57
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Master.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,040
We don't even know
what Chu Min looks like.

59
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
How are we to ask her to be our mentor?

60
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
Her?

61
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,409
She's highly skilled in martial arts.

62
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,120
Her beauty is unsurpassed.

63
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,600
We shared many years of friendship.

64
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,440
On top of that, you're bringing
her favorite gift to meet her.

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
She will definitely see you.

66
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,680
I get it. Step out.

67
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,680
Miss.

68
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,840
Someone is going around the city

69
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,040
scamming people
with the Qin family's badge.

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,720
Someone is using
the Qin family's gold badge

71
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,320
to scam people in the city?

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,600
There is a woman and a few men
among them. Young and old.

73
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,440
There is also someone with disabled legs.

74
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,680
I know who they are.

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,260
I'll deal with it personally.

76
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,640
I thought we would never meet again.

77
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,040
I heard the disciples of Tianzhao Academy

78
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,680
are all from renowned families.

79
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,200
How is this about martial arts?

80
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,840
It's more about family upbringing.

81
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,080
It's no wonder that old geezer
refused to come here.

82
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,640
He is afraid to look bad.

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,040
I think that it's pretty good
in Zhaifeng Institute.

84
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,520
For the first time in my life,

85
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
I agree with Xifan.

86
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
Lu Ping, let's go in quickly.

87
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,040
Master said the greeting gift can't wait.

88
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,880
We have to deliver it to Chu Min
as soon as possible.

89
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,140
-All right.
-Let's go.

90
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,240
I believe everyone already knows that

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,700
the Qin family
has gone overboard this time.

92
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,040
They are actually making disciples
from aristocratic families

93
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,680
compete with those pugilists.

94
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,200
Master told us that we must win
the Soul Combat Convention.

95
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,560
Take the Qin family down a peg.

96
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,020
Do you understand?

97
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,920
Yes.

98
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,320
All of you who are present
are all Master's disciples.

99
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,200
You're also peers who need
a breakthrough in your soul of Sound.

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,680
Today, you'll practice with me, Luo Ting.

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,020
We'll make a breakthrough together.

102
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,720
Noises are a hindrance,
when making a breakthrough in Sound.

103
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,900
You must bear that in mind.

104
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,880
You must train your soul of Sound

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,960
to the highest level.

106
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,480
Thank you.

107
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,660
I've asked around.

108
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,520
No one here knows Chu Min.

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,660
They think we're here as helpers.

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,300
What on earth did that old geezer say?

111
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,720
A peerless beauty
with great martial arts skills?

112
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
Did he lie to us again?

113
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,200
I knew it.

114
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Whenever Master sounds so certain,

115
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,170
nothing good ever happens.

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,120
Let's head back to the inn first.

117
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,960
Whose servants are you?

118
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,880
Are you here to deliver gifts
to Headmaster Xia?

119
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,610
Or are you applying to train
at Tianzhao Academy?

120
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,280
Leave the gift.

121
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,240
You can go after giving me a name.

122
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,320
[A gift from Guo Youdao...]

123
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,720
Don't touch it!

124
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
Who is it?

125
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,240
Get him!

126
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,160
Luo Ting.

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
They are here to make a scene.

128
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,240
Who are you?

129
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,000
How dare you barge into Tianzhao Academy?

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,920
Our apologies.

131
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,020
We're here to see someone.

132
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,200
We didn't know this would happen.

133
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,240
Tell us. Who are you looking for?

134
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,560
We are here

135
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
to seek out Chu Min as our mentor.

136
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
Please take us to her.

137
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Can't you even tell better lies?

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
Here at Tianzhao Academy,

139
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,120
we don't have a mentor called Chu Min.

140
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,680
Judging by their scrubby looks,

141
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,140
I bet they are thieves who want
to sneak into Tianzhao Academy.

142
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,120
Our peers nearly made a breakthrough
in our soul of Sound today

143
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,480
to master two soul powers.

144
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Now, look at what happened.

145
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,520
You've sabotaged it.

146
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,050
Master has fooled us again.

147
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,610
Take a good look at this.

148
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,380
We're from the Qin family.

149
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Do we need to steal anything?

150
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,080
Qin family and I are best friends.

151
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,530
They even found their way here.

152
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
I would have to check you out.

153
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,240
Mo Lin.

154
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,940
Harmony is prized.

155
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,320
Xifan.

156
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,760
It is pointless to reason with them now.

157
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,560
Mo Lin, where is the safest spot?

158
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,210
What are you still waiting for?

159
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,120
Go!

160
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,660
That's the quietest spot.

161
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,440
Disciples of Tianzhao Academy, listen up!

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Seal the doors. Arrest the thieves!

163
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,360
Yes!

164
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,560
People rarely come here.
We should be able to hide for a while.

165
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Didn't the inn people said

166
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
Lu Ping and the others
went to Tianzhao Academy?

167
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,800
What is going on?

168
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
[Hurry up! Don't let them get away!]

169
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
What happened?

170
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,920
Some people with
the Qin family's gold badge

171
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,250
have offended Luo Ting.

172
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,840
All disciples in the academy
are out to capture them.

173
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,700
Where are they?

174
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,560
The backyard.

175
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,440
They went towards the backyard.

176
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,000
[There's a crowd in the backyard.]

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
[I'm afraid it's just a diversion.]

178
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,520
We're doomed.

179
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,840
We're trapped in here.

180
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,240
Won't we get surrounded?

181
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,300
[What are you guys doing?]

182
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
I say, Ms. Qin,

183
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,400
we're here to seek a mentor.

184
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,760
Yet the disciples of Tianzhao Academy
insisted that we're thieves.

185
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,080
How is it reasonable?

186
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,960
You've been scamming with
my gold badge in the city.

187
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,360
How are you not thieves?

188
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,540
Qin Sang, what a coincidence.

189
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,240
It seems that
you have always lost something.

190
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,320
These people are indeed thieves.

191
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,280
Arrest them.

192
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,480
Hold on.

193
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,010
Luo Ting, wait a moment.

194
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
They are my friends.

195
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,140
I believe they are telling the truth.

196
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
If there's any misunderstanding
between you and them,

197
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,000
please let them off for my sake.

198
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,480
They are actually your friends?

199
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,720
Fine.

200
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,720
Since they wish to join Tianzhao Academy,

201
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,050
why don't I examine their abilities first

202
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,930
according to the regulations?

203
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,720
Qin Sang, you won't mind, will you?

204
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,810
Lu Ping, be careful!

205
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,160
All you have is Strength.

206
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,960
You didn't even master one soul power.

207
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,760
It might be fine in the countryside,

208
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,040
but here in Kaifeng, this is nothing.

209
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,320
Today, I intend to show great kindness

210
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,860
to teach you a thing or two.

211
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,640
It's you?

212
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,040
Who is that beggar?

213
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,650
Do you know I'm Master Xia's top disciple?

214
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,490
[Don't act disrespectfully!]

215
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Master.

216
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,040
Madam Chu Min.

217
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
My disciples have offended you.

218
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,060
-Please don't take it to heart.
-Chu Min?

219
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,640
You're that Chu Min,
the one our master told us?

220
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Do not be rude.

221
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,360
Although Madam Chu Min is a librarian

222
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,440
in our Sutra Repository,

223
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,120
she's the most powerful warrior
in Tianzhao Academy.

224
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
Master Xia.

225
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,640
We're here to see Madam Chu Min.

226
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,280
We didn't expect to offend your disciples.

227
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,940
Please don't take it to heart.

228
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,170
You can take your disciples
with you and get lost.

229
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,440
The four of you.

230
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,480
And those two lasses at the back.

231
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,560
Let's talk inside.

232
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
This time,

233
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,560
Guo Youdao finally did something worthy.

234
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,820
He has got us a powerful figure. Let's go.

235
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,360
We were referred by
the Head of Zhaifeng Institute,

236
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,640
Guo Youdao.

237
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,170
We hope Madam Chu Min
can take us in as your disciples.

238
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,130
There is someone else here.

239
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,680
Minmin.

240
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,640
I'm in pain. Look.

241
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,600
It hurts so much.

242
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,120
Master, what are you doing here?

243
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,280
Guo Youdao.

244
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,280
Do you really think that by tricking them

245
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,810
into offending
the entire Tianzhao Academy,

246
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,610
I'll feel bad enough to take them
as my disciples?

247
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,920
No. Minmin...

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,920
Master.

249
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,760
You wanted to fool us
from the start, right?

250
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,880
I...

251
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Wasn't I trying to get you started
in seeking a mentor?

252
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,680
Minmin...

253
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,520
You've been alone all these years.

254
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,600
You've been lonely.

255
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,079
If you take in a few disciples now,

256
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,280
isn't that pretty nice?

257
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,880
It will get lively, right?

258
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,839
What do you say?

259
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,079
Am I right, Minmin?

260
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Minmin, why did you hit me?

261
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,680
What I hate the most

262
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,280
is to be manipulated.

263
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,880
You people...

264
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,280
Get out of the Sutra Repository!

265
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,840
[Sutra Repository]

266
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,000
Lu Ping, what do we do now?

267
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,120
What now? I need to get treatment!

268
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,050
I... My head is really swelling up!

269
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,120
She's so vicious.

270
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,050
I can't stand it.

271
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,200
-It's too scary.
-Hold on to him.

272
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,130
This is so scary.

273
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,440
Goodness...

274
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,560
I sort of saved them.

275
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,520
They didn't even thank me.

276
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,080
How rude.

277
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,360
Miss, Mr. Lu came here for nothing.

278
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,560
He must be upset.

279
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,450
You shouldn't take it to heart.

280
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,700
I didn't do anything wrong at all.

281
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,560
Why do I feel so uneasy?

282
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,520
Ziyan, go with them.

283
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,480
Take a look at their inn.

284
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,020
If they need anything,

285
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,970
you'll see to it.

286
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,440
I don't want to owe him a favor.

287
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,600
Yes, Miss.

288
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,960
Don't move...

289
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,520
It hurts.

290
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,280
What is this? It's hot and round.

291
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
It's working if it's hot.

292
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
How will the swelling go down
if it's not hot?

293
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,000
This is the de-swelling device I invented.

294
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,240
If I were caught by Luo Ting today,

295
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,160
I'd make you suffer.

296
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,490
Perhaps your face might swell much worse.

297
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,000
You're right.

298
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,480
This is quite comfortable.

299
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,520
It's very warm.

300
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,080
I actually meant well.

301
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,040
Otherwise,

302
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,960
you won't even get to see Minmin.

303
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,400
So what if we saw her?

304
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,040
I thought it's already outstanding
to master one soul power.

305
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,880
Who knew

306
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,800
that it's not worth
mentioning at all in Kaifeng?

307
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,400
Su Tang.

308
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,240
Anyway, Chu Min refused
to accept us as her disciples.

309
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
I think that Lu Ping's standard

310
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
won't even get through the first round.

311
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,880
Why don't you come with me

312
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,210
to make a living
in the martial arts world?

313
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,080
Young lass, what's with you?

314
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,400
Did you get off the wrong side of bed?

315
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,660
Without your threats,

316
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
it seems as if something is off.

317
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,720
Since we returned from Tianzhao Academy,

318
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,920
Lu Ping hasn't said a word.

319
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,920
It's obvious that there's a disparity
in their skills.

320
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,800
Why don't I go and tell him a joke?

321
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,640
In terms of that,

322
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,680
you've fallen behind.

323
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,720
Someone already went.

324
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
Lu Ping,

325
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,900
we didn't get accepted today.

326
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,480
It's fine to go again another day.

327
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,560
Faith can even move mountains.

328
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,290
You're really optimistic.

329
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,800
Haven't you wondered

330
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,200
why someone who lived in such seclusion

331
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,600
would run into us so coincidentally

332
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,060
at the congee restaurant?

333
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,320
I've asked around.

334
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,760
Chu Min has been in Tianzhao Academy
for about ten years.

335
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,720
At this time of the year,

336
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
she would always buy crab congee there.

337
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,080
She kept such a persistent habit.

338
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,610
She must have an obsession.

339
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,920
It's just that the owner of
the congee place was so startled,

340
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,800
so he closed the place and headed home.

341
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,720
The crab congee that will break the ice

342
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,240
has to be made by us.

343
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,120
Xifan, you're right.

344
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,200
But you should be able to stand up first

345
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,330
before you can cook.

346
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,200
Wait here.

347
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,960
You left your crutch in Chenqiao Town.

348
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,160
You can't be in a wheelchair all the time

349
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
so I made you a new one.

350
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,450
It's a thank you gift for you
for warning me today.

351
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,060
Speaking of which, Xifan,

352
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,360
I bully you all the time.

353
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,280
Why did you help me?

354
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,360
Whatever danger we are in,

355
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,460
you always whine about it,

356
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,490
but you never failed to protect us.

357
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm not just helping you.

358
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,880
When I saw a lot of them
at Tianzhao Academy

359
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,920
who looks down on Zhaifeng Institute,

360
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,050
I thought to myself,

361
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,000
I'll have to keep leading
Zhaifeng Institute.

362
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,660
We mustn't get bullied again.

363
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
My dear disciple.

364
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,900
Will you give me a hand?

365
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,160
I can even defeat Xing Luo.

366
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,200
Not to mention a few crabs.

367
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,660
My dear disciple, you're so good at this.

368
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,360
When we were on the run,

369
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,800
Lu Ping made me do this very often.

370
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,060
I'm used to doing this.

371
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,690
Here, hold them.

372
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,010
We should get going.

373
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,690
My dear disciple...

374
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,040
What are you doing?

375
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,620
I'm going to set them free.

376
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,440
[This young lass...]

377
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
[She's actually quite pretty.]

378
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,100
If you really wish to help,

379
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,240
stop sending me money secretly.

380
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,210
Stay and start the fire.

381
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,920
Who wants to help you?

382
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm worried you'll go around with
the Qin family's gold badge

383
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,460
without a penny to pay.

384
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,810
It will ruin the Qin family's reputation.

385
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,560
You can't do it or are you afraid?

386
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,210
Do you think I'll be prodded into helping?

387
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Watch out.

388
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,100
Is this how you help me?

389
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,760
Ms. Qin is starting a fire?

390
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,180
Aren't you afraid to look bad?

391
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,380
It's my fault that you didn't
get accepted as disciples today.

392
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,680
When anyone in Qin family is in the wrong,

393
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,480
we have to take responsibility.

394
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,130
Talk after you clean your face.

395
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
Silly girl.

396
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,050
Master Guo's trick didn't work on Chu Min.

397
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,540
But we used your gold badge...

398
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,720
I'm sorry.

399
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,280
You...

400
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,240
You rascal...

401
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,530
You actually apologized to me?

402
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,920
What did you say? Say it again.

403
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,380
I didn't hear you clearly.

404
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,520
I said...

405
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,240
The fire died. Put in more wood.

406
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,280
Right. Yes.

407
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,960
[Which waiter lit the stove?]

408
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
[Is this meant for cooking
or burning the house down?]

409
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,720
Are you trying to burn the house down?

410
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,520
Who was here?

411
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,760
Step aside. I'll help you.

412
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Sure, I'll leave you to it.

413
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,760
I'm off.

414
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,200
Lu Ping.

415
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,800
Su Tang.

416
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,240
I've lost this bag of money for some time.

417
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,440
Where did you find it?

418
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,960
Lu Ping.

419
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,080
Was Ms. Qin here?

420
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,760
You're still acting?

421
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,620
I've checked them.
These are all government taels.

422
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,240
Well done.

423
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,060
Your observation skills have improved.

424
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,240
She is worried that we'll keep
putting expenses on a tab

425
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,520
and make the Qin family look bad.

426
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,580
She came specially to bring us money.

427
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
With this rich sponsor,

428
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,460
I can even reserve the entire
osmanthus candy shop for you.

429
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,280
Has Ms. Qin fallen for you?

430
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,320
Have you also fallen for her?

431
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,520
Lu Ping.

432
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,760
Are you not going to get a mentor?

433
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,820
Are you using her to meet Wen Gecheng?

434
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,040
Su Tang.

435
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,010
The path I choose...

436
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,810
It can't be changed.

437
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,040
The young lady of aristocracy and us,

438
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,940
might seem to be on a similar path,

439
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,570
but in the end, it won't be the same.

440
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,540
Do you understand?

441
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,720
Look at you.

442
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,560
You're also pitiful.

443
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,240
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,040
I didn't bring you crab congee this year.

445
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,800
You always said
the congee was made for me.

446
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,720
But I knew,

447
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,730
you actually missed the flavors
from your hometown.

448
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,850
You just want to satisfy your craving.

449
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,560
Everyone says that

450
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,800
as you age, your wisdom grows.

451
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,040
But now that we've both aged,

452
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,400
there's still a lot we can't comprehend.

453
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,640
For instance,

454
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,840
the dead are gone.

455
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,240
You should move on.

456
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,080
Guo Youdao.

457
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,450
These past few years,
you haven't been drinking less...

458
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,320
than I did.

459
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,440
I drink to forget the past.

460
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
You drink...

461
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,840
to live in the past.

462
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,460
There are thousands of philosophies
on life in this world.

463
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
I don't have to understand them all.

464
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,600
Stop trying to talk me around.

465
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,690
It has been ten years...

466
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,680
I no longer hold any aspirations.

467
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,160
My heart is dead.

468
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,480
How can I still take in any disciples?

469
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,580
Don't be in a rush to leave.

470
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
You've drunk so much wine.

471
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,600
It's time to eat.

472
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,580
Have another bowl of crab congee.

473
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,160
I can't...

474
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,720
If I keep eating,

475
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,760
I'll die from overeating
before I get a mentor.

476
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,810
You've used up your soul power?

477
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,800
Listen.

478
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,960
I...

479
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Lu Ping, we've tried so many times.

480
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,520
It still doesn't taste
like the congee from the restaurant.

481
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,560
There are plenty more fish in the sea.

482
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,760
Why don't we pick another mentor?

483
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,800
I don't want to change
the path I've chosen.

484
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,860
Do you want to see Master Guo bullied?

485
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,600
Every year, Master Guo comes to Kaifeng.

486
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,530
He always ends up getting bruised.

487
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,340
Yet he still keeps coming.

488
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,000
Chu Min must mean a lot to him.

489
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Let's keep going.

490
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,200
Here...

491
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,680
Hurry up.

492
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Look...

493
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,840
Look at these kids.

494
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,160
They are so serious.

495
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,040
Aren't they like our younger selves?

496
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,120
I've got it.

497
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,160
Mo Lin.

498
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,400
Don't you have all sorts of poisons?

499
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,840
Is there a colorless and odorless one
we can put in the congee

500
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,570
that will make Chu Min let us...

501
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,720
Minmin...

502
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,120
Madam Chu Min.

503
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,810
We've made you crab congee.

504
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,040
Please try some.

505
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Please.

506
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,719
No... Don't!

507
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,449
That's enough, Minmin!

508
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,639
The crab congee.

509
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,159
It's a token
of these youngsters' sentiment.

510
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,679
Are you going to waste it?

511
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,210
What's going on?

512
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,140
She's not responding.

513
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,000
Did you really poison her?

514
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,450
Meet me at the Sutra Repository tomorrow.

515
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,400
Quickly, address your mentor.

516
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,640
-Master...
-I'm not your mentor.

517
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,920
Nor am I some deity.

518
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
It's only a few days away
from the Soul Combat Convention.

519
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
If you wish
to enhance your soul powers rapidly,

520
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,720
I know of a method
that isn't really a method.

521
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
Think it through and then come to me.

522
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,560
Minmin.

523
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Minmin.

524
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,280
Does it taste like it once did?

525
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
Your disciples...

526
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,720
None of them can cook.

527
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,260
But the boiling temperature
of the freshly made congee...

528
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,240
It's quite interesting.

529
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,600
Luo Ting.

530
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,360
It seems you're holding it against me?

531
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,040
I just feel bad for you.

532
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,840
You are a high-ranking official
of Shuo Kingdom.

533
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,000
His Majesty should rely on you the most.

534
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But Qin Qi made a name for himself

535
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,810
at the Soul Combat Convention.

536
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,840
I also have no choice,

537
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,440
but to show Qin Sang respect.

538
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,920
Those scoundrels even made
a racket in Tianzhao Academy.

539
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
This really is...

540
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,680
It made you look bad.

541
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,600
Do you still remember

542
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,560
what it is that I often taught you?

543
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,360
Bide your time.

544
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,120
Gear up for the moment.

545
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,880
Those kids from Zhaifeng Institute...

546
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,440
They are but mediocre in martial arts.

547
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,480
They came to seek a mentor

548
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,340
just to participate in
the Soul Combat Convention.

549
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,120
If you're Chu Min,

550
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,960
what will you do to enhance their powers

551
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,840
in a short time?

552
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,600
You mean...

553
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Lu Ping and his peers will take a risk

554
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,610
in using that banned skill?

555
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,080
Who humbled herself

556
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,760
to speak up for Lu Ping?

557
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,320
Do you remember?

558
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,440
Get up.

559
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Some matters

560
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,280
I have to handle them on my own.

561
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,480
But you must remember

562
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,560
that schemes can kill better than weapons.

563
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,700
Politics is way more complicated
than the martial arts world.

564
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,000
How difficult can it be to kill someone?

565
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Minmin, please enjoy.

566
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,880
This is...

567
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,770
Soul Splitting Technique?

568
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,680
Exactly.

569
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,400
There's not much time left.

570
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,640
Judging by your current skills,

571
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,720
you're seeking your doom
by participating in the convention.

572
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,640
The only solution
is to split your soul power.

573
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,480
What is soul splitting?

574
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,920
Soul Splitting Technique
uses an external Soul

575
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,400
to bear the soul power down
and enhance it in a short time.

576
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,120
It is to aid in mastering one soul power

577
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,920
or even mastering many at a time.

578
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,560
It can promise instant results,
but it's also very risky.

579
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
This is an officially banned skill.

580
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,360
How risky can it be?

581
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,200
The least impact is
losing all five senses.

582
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,560
The worst is...

583
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,800
losing your life.

584
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,440
You wish to gamble?

585
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,480
Then you'll place your bets.

586
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,560
Getting killed in the convention or here,

587
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,220
what difference does it make?

588
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,680
I'll take the risk.

589
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,540
I'll go along with Lu Ping.

590
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,000
Xifan.

591
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,960
Are you going down with them?

592
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,800
The methodology in martial arts
is like an instrument.

593
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,460
As long as you bear no ill will,

594
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
then all restriction is off.

595
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,880
You're just trying to make me join you.

596
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,160
I'm not a fool.

597
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
You talk so much.

598
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,810
You call yourself the best assassin
in the world?

599
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,720
Miss, you should practice your swordplay.

600
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,520
All right.

601
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,040
Are you worried
about Mr. Lu and the others?

602
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Why don't you plead on their behalf?

603
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,360
Why should I help him?

604
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,280
Can't he ask me for help?

605
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,920
Luo Ting?

606
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,920
He never gets up early
to practice swordplay.

607
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Why is he acting differently today?

608
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,140
Miss, he is going
towards the Sutra Repository.

609
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,120
That's bad.

610
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,000
Luo Ting is narrow-minded and vengeful.

611
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,880
He might harm Lu Ping.

612
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Let's follow him.

613
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,120
Where is he?

614
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,920
What is that sound?

615
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,840
Ms. Qin, what are you doing here?

616
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,920
Lu Ping.

617
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,920
Do you know what you're doing?

618
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,240
Soul Splitting is banned.

619
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,360
It can kill you.

620
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,800
Fine.

621
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,280
You'd risk your life for the convention?

622
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
I'll report to my brother right now.

623
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,000
This...

624
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,040
Once Soul Splitting begins,

625
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,040
you'll get a backlash
once it's stopped halfway.

626
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,160
Ms. Qin.

627
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,720
Right now, you can only join them.

628
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,680
Moreover,

629
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,120
you'll be marked with an imprint
of blocked meridians.

630
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,050
If you can't make a breakthrough
within a day,

631
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,880
you'll live with that mark for life.

632
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,720
Soul Splitting has begun.

633
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,680
Life is now in the hands of fate.
