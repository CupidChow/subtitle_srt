00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,520
[Episode 6]

3
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,680
Ms. Qin.

4
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,320
The Qin family
is from an aristocratic clan.

5
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,720
Instead of enjoying a luxurious life,

6
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
you're in pursuit of Shanhai Gang

7
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,090
and having a hard time here.

8
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,800
I still remember the scene

9
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,540
where all the Fengling Gang were killed.

10
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,840
After my parents passed away,

11
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,640
I wouldn't listen to my brother.

12
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,890
So I've been wandering around
the mundane world.

13
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,600
As people always say,

14
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,480
"Pay your own debts."

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,240
If I hadn't been so arrogant,

16
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,780
Fengling Gang would never
have been destroyed.

17
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
So I have to get to the bottom of this.

18
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,160
I owe them that.

19
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,890
You certainly do have noble aspirations.

20
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,640
But aspiration
doesn't work on dead people.

21
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,480
I won't be deceived
by you again this time.

22
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,880
In the martial arts tower,

23
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,640
the mechanisms are specifically designed.

24
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,240
There will be no casualties.

25
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,920
You saw what Wei Tianqi

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,640
did to us.

27
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,360
Can you be certain

28
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
that he won't rig the mechanisms?

29
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,140
Why didn't you say so earlier?

30
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
Don't worry, Ms. Qin.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,120
My life is far more critical than yours.

32
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,400
I don't have much time.

33
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,360
Lu Ping...

34
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,410
You have to get out of there.

35
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,810
After one joss stick is burned,

36
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,920
not even God can save you.

37
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,560
I think this mechanism
is controlled by its engine.

38
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
As long as we destroy that part,

39
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,000
we can get out of here.

40
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
I can use my soul of Strength.

41
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
Doesn't your family's sword skills
include the soul of Vision?

42
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
See if you can see through how it works

43
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
and try to stop it.

44
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
I can't.

45
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm not as good as my brother.

46
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,340
I can't see through it.

47
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
You can't?

48
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,720
Forget it then.

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,740
What do you mean forget it?

50
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,020
What are you doing?

51
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,480
There's only you and me

52
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
in the last moments of our lives.

53
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,300
What else can we do?

54
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,960
Now that I look at you,

55
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,690
you're actually quite pretty.

56
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,600
If we couldn't sleep together,

57
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,200
isn't it astonishing
if we could die together?

58
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,159
You...

59
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
Bully!

60
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,780
I'm taking my clothes off.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,060
Even if I had to die,

62
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,320
I would never die with someone like you!

63
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
I see it!

64
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
Miss!

65
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,680
Miss,

66
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,000
are you wounded?

67
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,320
[No...]

68
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,210
[The Soul Confinement is unleashed.]

69
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,120
[I have merely one joss stick of time
to use the soul of Strength.]

70
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,560
[If I keep this on with Qin Sang,]

71
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,960
[it would be too late.]

72
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,840
[I have to come up with a plan]

73
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
[to force her to protect me.]

74
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,280
Mr. Lu...

75
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
Your clothes...

76
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,860
Don't look at me like that.

77
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,760
If I didn't do this, you wouldn't
unleash your power,

78
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,090
and we would've been buried underground.

79
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,320
You have a sly nature.

80
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,760
Who knows what else
goes inside your brain?

81
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,800
Fine.

82
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
How about this?

83
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Let's make a deal.

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,120
I wish to obtain the Tianying Stone

85
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
in order to be accepted in
the Soul Combat Convention.

86
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,640
You may stay and watch over me.

87
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,810
If someone from Shanhai Gang
tries to contact me,

88
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,220
I will be at your mercy.

89
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
But in order to obtain the Tianying Stone,

90
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,000
I need you to help me.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,600
Are you setting me up?

92
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
If I wished to do that,

93
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,400
you would've been dead.

94
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,010
Why would I put myself through so much?

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
Ziyan.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Keep an eye on Wei Tianqi.

97
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,200
Make sure he doesn't cause
any more trouble.

98
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,400
And I will be watching this delinquent.

99
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,080
Who knows what he is up to?

100
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,440
Yes, miss.

101
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,360
Please take care.

102
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,160
And you too, Mr. Lu.

103
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,930
Listen to me carefully.

104
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,220
From this very moment,

105
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,840
you are not allowed to leave my sight,

106
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,120
nor talk to me.

107
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,690
You and I are suspect

108
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
and supervisor.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,930
If you truly are from Shanhai Gang,

110
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,320
I shall use

111
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,040
my Kuiying Sword on you.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,960
Sure.

113
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,039
Lady Qin.

114
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,440
Did you get his identity?

115
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,360
Sir.

116
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
His name is Lu Ping.

117
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,170
He's from Zhaifeng Institute.

118
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
I have been watching him inside the tower.

119
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,360
That man is more than what he seems.

120
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,820
Besides, he is the one
Mr. Wei is looking for.

121
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,440
If he is the mysterious man

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
who met with Ms. Qin

123
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,080
at Ruyu Restaurant that day,

124
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,480
everything makes sense.

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,920
Who would've known

126
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,960
this man is right under our noses...

127
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,520
Lu Ping is now at the top of the tower.

128
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,080
Our men have stationed
around the martial arts tower.

129
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,880
We can make a move
once the other disciples are out.

130
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,480
But there's one thing...

131
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,640
I don't know if I should tell you.

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,760
Say it.

133
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,520
You don't have to keep him alive

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
for Lord.

135
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
This man killed Xing Luo.

136
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
We're out of his league.

137
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,040
We can only take his life
by using the mechanisms

138
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,500
in the martial arts tower.

139
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
Sacrifice him for Lord.

140
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,280
Only then would Lord spare our lives.

141
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
Give the order.

142
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,240
Do it.

143
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
I appoint you as the commander.

144
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,240
No mistake is allowed.

145
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,780
The smell inside the tower

147
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
is not normal.

148
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,700
Some of them went in

149
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,920
and some of them head out.

150
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,860
Don't take me back!

151
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
-Let's go, Mr. Wei.
-We have to, Mr. Wei.

152
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,960
-I'm not done yet.
-Mr. Wei.

153
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,920
Master ordered that,

154
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
when the time is right, we must leave.

155
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,780
I want revenge!

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,180
Let's just go, Mr. Wei!

157
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,840
Wei Tianqi?

158
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,380
Why is he taken away by his own men?

159
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
This is not right.

160
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
It's a trap!

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,760
Xifan!

162
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,130
Mo Lin? Why are you here?

163
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,600
Did you guys defeat Wei Tianqi?

164
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
We defeated others from downstairs.

165
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,400
But the Wei Guards seem

166
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,530
to have been ordered

167
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,840
to take Wei Tianqi away.

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,880
The exam isn't complete.

169
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,840
How could they throw their honor away?

170
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,640
Unless their lives are at stake.

171
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,720
I smelled some men
with an unknown identity

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,320
outside the tower.

173
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
They had weapons in their hands.

174
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,440
This can't be good.

175
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Chun.

176
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,250
Take everyone with you.

177
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
And get the Master
of Chan State Academy over here

178
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,620
-as fast as you can.
-Yes, sir.

179
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,480
Su Tang.

180
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,360
Mo Lin and I will go up to find Lu Ping.

181
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,490
I'm afraid he is the target of the exam.

182
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,840
Maybe your judgment is wrong.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,400
Zhaifeng isn't a popular organization.

184
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,920
Maybe it's the Chan State Academy
that's coming for you.

185
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,480
This exam concerns the qualifications
of Soul Combat Convention.

186
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,680
It's the goal
of every martial arts disciple.

187
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,120
But the guys at the academy
have dropped out.

188
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,850
It shows how powerful
the man behind the scene is.

189
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm afraid they're scared
of what Lu Ping can do.

190
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,040
So they deliberately lured him here

191
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,480
to finish him using the terrain
and the mechanism in the tower.

192
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
The more you reach the top,

193
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,520
the lesser the company,

194
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
the higher their chances are.

195
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,520
So to speak,

196
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
the biggest trap is at the rooftop.

197
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,720
I'm going with you!

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,280
You're Ms. Qin's maid.

199
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
What are you doing here?

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,530
Ms. Qin is with Mr. Lu at the moment.

201
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,400
I heard everything you said.

202
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,840
She will also be in danger
if something happens to him.

203
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
Just follow me.

204
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,640
Wait for me!

205
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,560
-Tianqi!
-Sir.

206
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,580
-What happened?
-Father!

207
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,120
Why did you have them bring me back?

208
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,680
I haven't finished the test yet!

209
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,940
I didn't lose to Lu Ping

210
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
and I still want to put
Zhaifeng Institute in their place!

211
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,160
Get Tianqi back to his room

212
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
and lock the door!

213
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
He will not leave his room

214
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,020
until the exam is over!

215
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,840
Father.

217
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,530
What is going on?

218
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,640
My boy.

219
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
Behave and stay home.

220
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,160
Don't you go out and mess around.

221
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,040
Your life,

222
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,960
my life,

223
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,360
the lives of our entire family

224
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,680
depends on it.

225
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,340
I thought you were good at what you do.

226
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,690
But why do I feel like you've weakened?

227
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,160
If Lady Qin is here,

228
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,880
how can my poor technique

229
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,280
even be noticed?

230
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
Ms. Qin.

231
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,560
I don't know who you really are.

232
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,290
A girl has to have her leverage.

233
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,000
I will give it back to you

234
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,780
once I find out your identity.

235
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,640
Why is there another mechanism?

236
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,560
Lu Ping,

237
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,080
what is happening?

238
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,890
This isn't the exam.

239
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,160
Someone is coming for us.

240
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,490
This cage is made by meteoric iron.

241
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,010
Not even my Kuiying Sword
can cut it loose!

242
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,730
[How can his soul of Strength
suddenly be so strong?]

243
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,600
I've seen that chain before.

244
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,040
What is it?

245
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,000
Who are you?

246
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
No matter who I am,

247
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I cannot die here.

248
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,280
I'll hold it myself!

249
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,610
You guys go get them out!

250
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,080
Lu Ping!

251
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,120
-Ms. Qin!
-Su Tang.

252
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,960
Ziyan.

253
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,760
Su Tang.

254
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,960
This is meteoric iron.

255
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,200
Even soul of Strength cannot break it.

256
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,930
Let me think of something else.

257
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,540
Get out of here with Xifan.

258
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,560
Without me, I don't think

259
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,360
the guys at Shanhai Gang
will go after you.

260
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,280
-Lu Ping!
-Listen to me.

261
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,160
Shut up!

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,160
I brought you all in here

263
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,280
and I am bringing everyone out!

264
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,540
No one from Zhaifeng will be left behind!

265
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,680
Here it is!

266
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,360
I think this medicine
can burn the meteoric iron.

267
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,160
Step back.

268
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
Step aside.

269
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,440
Lu Ping.

270
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Assassin boy.

271
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,040
Your time management is spot on.

272
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,380
One joss stick of time.

273
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,850
Not one second more,

274
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,530
not one second less.

275
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
[There is something wrong
with your tower!]

276
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,000
Zhao Xifan might be in danger!

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,730
You have to open that tower now!

278
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,839
You uneducated kid...

279
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,280
It's true that you don't know
how this works.

280
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,079
Listen to me.

281
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,160
This is the exam.

282
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,839
We will never open the tower in advance.

283
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,930
Xifan and Su Tang are both in there.

284
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,480
Even the stubborn Lu Ping

285
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,960
is one of us.

286
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,359
If you don't open the tower now,

287
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,880
Zhaifeng Institute will never let this go!

288
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,119
We won't let this go!

289
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,079
-Open the tower!
-Open it now!

290
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
-Open it!
-We won't leave you alone!

291
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,800
Your skin is slit open.

292
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,060
It's as if you don't feel anything at all.

293
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,080
Are everyone in Zhaifeng

294
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,810
lunatics that don't feel pain?

295
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,120
Lu Ping,

296
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,520
why didn't you leave?

297
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,200
Why did you have

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,920
to drag Xifan in here with us?

299
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
I was probably infected by the guy

300
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,820
who only knows how to carry rocks.

301
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
Don't worry.

302
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,880
Even if I become crippled,

303
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,200
I won't blame it on you.

304
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,680
Shouldn't you explain to me

305
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
what exactly the chain is

306
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,560
on Lu Ping's body?

307
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,280
Ms. Qin.

308
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,040
I don't have the answer to your question.

309
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
The most important thing

310
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,680
is leaving together.

311
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
I'm sure the reason why he didn't leave

312
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
is because he believes that,

313
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,720
if we do this together,

314
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,170
it will be better than fighting alone.

315
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,120
Ms. Qin.

316
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,460
I hear noises outside.

317
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
Perhaps Chun brought the chief here.

318
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,600
Zhaifeng's disciples are in there too.

319
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,460
Lu Ping is not the only one inside.

320
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,920
Don't worry.

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,560
Since the Killing Dragon Stone
was dropped,

322
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
no one can escape.

323
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,160
Once we set out the hypnotic smoke,

324
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
we can then go inside.

325
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,620
As Master said,

326
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
we only keep Lu Ping alive.

327
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,700
The rest, is doomed to die.

328
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,600
Set the smoke.

329
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,600
Oh no.

330
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,250
I smell hypnotic smoke.

331
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,560
This place doesn't even have rat holes.

332
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,880
How much more unlucky can I be

333
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,210
with you guys at my side?

334
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,450
What about the top of the tower?

335
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,420
That is the weakest spot
of the entire tower.

336
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,920
Mo Lin,

337
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,680
can you use your silver needle on me again

338
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
to gain me one more joss stick of time?

339
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,880
It's useless.

340
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,200
You're used to the pain.

341
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,040
My needle

342
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,220
can't stimulate your veins anymore.

343
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Don't come close.

344
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,960
Disturbances in the three realms

345
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,490
are like a burning mansion.

346
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,020
Only the invincible Shanhai Gang

347
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,240
can tide you over.

348
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Ms. Qin, you should just give in.

349
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,240
You really are one of them...

350
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,760
Lu Ping!

351
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,880
Don't go.

352
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,650
Trust your brother.

353
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,120
Then why did you save me?

354
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,920
Lord was interested in your abilities.

355
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,090
He knows the only way to have you,
is to lure you in.

356
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
Do you know

357
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,570
how Shanhai Gang deal with prisoners?

358
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,700
They drain every single drop of blood

359
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,490
and scrape every single bone of your body.

360
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,960
They'll show you the only thing

361
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,170
you'll ever feel in this world is pain.

362
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,880
You should be happy

363
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,020
that your guys at Fengling Gang are dead.

364
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,300
No more suffering.

365
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
If it was you,

366
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,690
how long can you hold on?

367
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,680
Shut up!

368
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,400
Lu Ping!

369
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,640
Thanks.

370
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,840
Silly.

371
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,160
He's crazy.

372
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,360
He's using Qin Sang's sword
to stimulate his veins.

373
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,690
He's fighting against Soul Confinement.

374
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,800
I think there's one Soul Confinement
missing in his body.

375
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,180
-They're out!
-They're here!

376
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Xifan is out.

377
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,960
Xifan!

378
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,080
-Xifan!
-Are you okay?

379
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,760
My tower...

380
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,800
Move!

381
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,650
What on earth did you do?

382
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,760
Didn't the Chief make it clear?

383
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,640
The person who obtains the Tianying Stone

384
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,480
and gets out the tower first
wins the exam.

385
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,680
I...

386
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,490
Lu Ping of Zhaifeng Institute,

387
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,720
sir.

388
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,200
Sir,

389
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,480
I wonder how many disciples

390
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,360
of Chan State Academy

391
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,840
passed this time?

392
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,800
-Yes!
-Tell us!

393
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
None, right?

394
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,680
Although the tower is expensive,
but it doesn't seem firm at all.

395
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,120
Now your academy

396
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,240
doesn't even have a chance
to retake the exam.

397
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,080
You...

398
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,120
-He's right.
-None!

399
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,560
What the devil did you do?

400
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,240
I was generous
to let you inside the tower,

401
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,160
and now...

402
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,880
You deliberately destroyed it, didn't you?

403
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,680
Fine!

404
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
That is a felony.

405
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
Zhaifeng Institute, stay in Chenqiao Town

406
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,080
for the rest of your lives.

407
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,740
You shall never participate
in the Soul Combat Convention again!

408
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,920
He took off.

409
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,520
All right now.

410
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,080
Let me introduce to you once again,

411
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,480
your senior,

412
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,600
God of Bandits.

413
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,140
God of Bandits?

414
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,000
-He's God of Bandits?
-Lu Ping is God of Bandits?

415
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,260
I'm not dreaming, am I?

416
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,520
-Does it hurt?
-Doesn't it hurt?

417
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,580
He even acquired the Tianying Stone.

418
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,130
You don't believe my words?

419
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,000
The words of your eldest senior?

420
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,880
It's true then!

421
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,760
So Lu Ping was the one who saved us

422
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,820
from Shanhai Gang!

423
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,700
God of Bandits!

424
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,520
Lu Ping!

425
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,000
-God of Bandits!
-Lu Ping!

426
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,840
Lu Ping!

427
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,560
God of Bandits! Lu Ping!

428
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,320
God of Bandits! Lu Ping!

429
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,600
Miss.

430
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,280
Why don't we sit down and rest?

431
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,560
God of Bandits! Lu Ping!

432
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,520
Let's go.

433
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,820
Thank you for the Tianying Stone.

434
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,280
A delinquent will always be a delinquent.

435
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,210
You just can't control your hands.

436
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,440
Stealing means taking without asking.

437
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,980
I traded it with something
of the same value.

438
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,650
This is that Shanhai Badge!

439
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
When did you give it to me?

440
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
That is more useful to you

441
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,960
than it is to me.

442
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,300
I hope you get what you want

443
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,560
one day.

444
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,370
Don't touch my brother!

445
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,120
He needs to heal.

446
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Ms. Qin.

447
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,840
All the troubles along the way

448
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,560
are brought by you chasing my brother.

449
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,880
We don't know if Shanhai Gang

450
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,360
is planning an ambush around here.

451
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,840
We should go.

452
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,080
Everyone has their own path.

453
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,280
I wish you would stop chasing after him.

454
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Lu Ping, let's go.

455
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,320
Miss,

456
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,360
are you really letting Mr. Lu go?

457
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,200
We have work to do.

458
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,650
Don't you think what happened in the tower

459
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,170
is a bit suspicious?

460
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,120
You mean...

461
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,420
The Wei Family?

462
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Lu Ping got away?

463
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,580
Who on earth is Lu Ping?

464
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,320
How could you fail with so many men

465
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
and mechanisms in the tower?

466
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,170
He brought the tower to the ground.

467
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,800
Many of our men died in there.

468
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,320
Fortunately, I already told them

469
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,920
to not wear our signature clothes.

470
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,120
At the moment, we haven't been exposed.

471
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,240
He broke the tower?

472
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,760
Even damaging the tower is a crime.

473
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,720
Gather all of our men to look for them.

474
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,360
Head to the governmental office
if you have to,

475
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,760
I don't care how much money
we have to spend.

476
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,560
Have them guard the gate.

477
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,840
Lu Ping can never leave Chan State!

478
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,560
Sir.

479
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,040
One more thing.

480
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,080
There was another person in the tower.

481
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Ms. Qin!

482
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,020
I thought you set off for Kaifeng!

483
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,920
Mr. Wei, did you know that

484
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,740
someone from Shanhai Gang
entered the tower

485
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
and tried to kill me?

486
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,800
Well...

487
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,280
Well...

488
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,680
Why were you in the tower?

489
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
Shanhai Gang?

490
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,040
Even if they ought to commit crimes,

491
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,840
they wouldn't do it in the tower.

492
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,640
They wouldn't dare offend your family.

493
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,600
They are thousands of mechanisms
in the tower.

494
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,720
Perhaps someone of Zhaifeng

495
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,410
accidentally activated it

496
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,610
and hurt you unintentionally.

497
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,560
The machines in the tower
are for the purpose of the exam.

498
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
But the ones I bumped into
are all fatal and dangerous.

499
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,610
My Kuiying Sword

500
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,640
couldn't even cut its iron cage.

501
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,840
This is clearly plotted!

502
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Since you're willing to cooperate,

503
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,260
then I shall stay
and find out the truth with you.

504
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,920
Okay...

505
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,160
Okay.

506
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I'll give out the orders.

507
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,720
[Father!]

508
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,040
[Help me, Father!]

509
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,920
Father!

510
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,480
Help me!

511
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Do you have any idea who my father is?

512
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,040
Qin Qi,

513
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,440
what are you doing here?

514
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,280
Miss, please forgive
the Victorious Dragon Troop

515
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
for not arriving on time to save you.

516
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,680
General Qin.

517
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,720
I...

518
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,560
It was impolite of me
to receive you like this.

519
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,160
Please forgive me, General.

520
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,080
Qin Qi!

521
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,580
So am I a brother to you now?

522
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,760
After all the days you've been gone?

523
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,000
Actually, I would've come home
after a few days.

524
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,000
You wouldn't have
to bring so many men to get me.

525
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,480
Even the Victorious Dragon Troop is here.

526
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,340
Outsiders would think
you're fighting a war again.

527
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,640
If something did happen to you,

528
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,560
even if the General was on a battlefield,

529
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,360
he would still come back for you.

530
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,880
Qin Qi...

531
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
I was wrong.

532
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,240
I shouldn't worry you.

533
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,120
I've been out in the world
for so many years.

534
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,320
I don't need you to protect me like this.

535
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,290
You don't need protection?

536
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,120
Then take care of yourself!

537
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,820
Are those the people who hurt you?

538
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,240
General!

539
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I treated Ms. Qin like my guest!

540
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,660
I would never dare!

541
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,560
Please, General Qin!

542
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,440
Sangsang!

543
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,440
Sangsang, help!

544
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,280
How dare you!

545
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,840
You don't get to call Ms. Qin by her name!

546
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,640
Qin Qi.

547
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,040
This is just a misunderstanding.

548
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,920
I hurt myself accidentally.

549
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,490
Thank you, General!

550
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Thank you, General!

551
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm scared, Father.

552
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,120
Qin Sang.

553
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,610
It's time to go home.

554
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,400
It's almost time for
the Soul Combat Convention.

555
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,800
You should stay focused.

556
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,200
[Wei Residence]

557
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,880
Qin Qi, about Shanhai Gang...

558
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,480
They will take care of their own business.

559
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,840
But the Wei Family didn't help
much with rescuing Fengling Gang

560
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,760
and now with the thing of the tower.

561
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,880
They truly are suspicious.

562
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,540
Shouldn't you look into them?

563
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,480
Think about it.

564
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,680
What you said sounds like
such a comprehensive plan.

565
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,600
How could Shanhai Gang

566
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
allow someone like Wei Tianqi
be a part of it?

567
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,440
Sangsang!

568
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,160
That kind of makes sense.

569
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,520
But how did you know I'm here?

570
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,080
Did Ziyan tell you?

571
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,480
You wrote the letter yourself.

572
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,120
You said they imprisoned you here.

573
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,980
Did you forget?

574
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
A letter?

575
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,680
Qin Sang.

576
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,640
Is there anything else
that's left unsolved?

577
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Did anyone else pick on you?

578
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,600
General!

579
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,800
Actually, in Chenqiao Town...

580
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,880
Nothing happened.

581
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,640
Qin Qi.

582
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,940
I promise you I will behave this time.

583
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,200
No more troubles.

584
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,880
I just need you to promise me something.

585
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Tell me.

586
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,360
I want him to send me off.

587
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,720
Me?

588
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Sangsang thinks so highly of me!

589
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,160
I, Wei Tianqi, will do whatever it takes!

590
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,960
-You...
-I...

591
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,080
Qin Sang.

592
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,540
Are you really interested in that loser?

593
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,200
He's not like you.
You scold me all the time.

594
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,060
He at least will have chat with me.

595
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,240
Sangsang!

596
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,440
Wait for me in Kaifeng!

597
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,800
I will go and find you.

598
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,920
Sangsang!

599
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,920
Wait for me!

600
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,280
Wait for me!

601
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,440
Sangsang!

602
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,970
Watch your step.

603
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,560
Our family conquers the world
sitting on horses.

604
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
What a joke would it be if you fall?

605
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,440
Miss.

606
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,880
Breaking the tower is a felony.

607
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,080
Are you not worried for Mr. Lu?

608
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,940
After all, he did he save me...

609
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
I mean, he saved your life, miss.

610
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,600
If I didn't make the Wei Family escort us,

611
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,300
they would be in the hands
of Wei Zhong by now.

612
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,320
Whether to live or die,

613
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,400
is up to him now.

614
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
I cannot help him.

615
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,120
If my brother gets word of this,

616
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,720
it will be even harder for them.

617
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,520
Miss.

618
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,930
So you intentionally stop the Wei family,

619
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,200
so that they can escape Chan State.

620
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,600
In order to protect Mr. Lu,

621
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,480
you even admitted
to the letter you didn't write!

622
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Are you done?

623
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,680
You think Mr. Lu is a good person

624
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,760
as well, don't you?

625
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,320
I don't think he's a bad person,

626
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,160
since he is up against Shanhai Gang.

627
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,560
It must have been his idea

628
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,380
to send a letter to my brother.

629
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
He saved me once

630
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,600
and I returned the favor.

631
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,680
And that's it.

632
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,360
If we ever meet again,

633
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,159
I shall give no mercy.

634
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,100
Stop looking at it.

635
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,080
I know what I'm doing.

636
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,340
It smells amazing!

637
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,679
I was too indiscreet
to not have brought salt with me.

638
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,120
A little bit of paprika and cumin

639
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,449
would have been better!

640
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Xifan.

641
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,560
I'm back from scouting.

642
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,690
No one is chasing us.

643
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,780
Chun and Shitou have gone
to let them know we're coming.

644
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,400
Let's rest here for a while.

645
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,440
If we travel for the night,

646
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,120
we'll make it back in Zhaifeng
tomorrow morning.

647
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,000
I never expected the arrival of Qin Qi.

648
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,240
He made the Wei Family
too occupied to notice us.

649
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,600
We got lucky.

650
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,800
Luck?

651
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,560
I traded my life for that luck.

652
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,800
Is Lu Ping awake yet?

653
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,720
Serving him is draining me out.

654
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,840
Are you injured?

655
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,600
Your elbows are still attached
and so are your limbs.

656
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,480
So cut the crap.

657
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,770
Men don't fight with girls.

658
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,880
Xifan.

659
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,360
Was it really not you who called
the Victorious Dragon Troop?

660
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
I thought your brother called them.

661
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,440
Su Tang.

662
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,970
Who exactly are you two?

663
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,360
Tell me.

664
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,080
Perhaps I can help.

665
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,050
Maybe I can help you save some trouble.

666
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,200
You can't help us.

667
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,520
Lu Ping!

668
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,410
Have some water.

669
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,040
Lu Ping.

670
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,600
You were nice in the tower.

671
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,320
Why are you acting up?

672
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,760
That was in the tower.

673
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,520
What happens in the tower,
stays in the tower.

674
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,040
Besides, the Wei Family and Shanhai Gang

675
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,480
won't let us go so easily.

676
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,820
Are you trying to lose another leg

677
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,840
by following us?

678
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,780
Zhaifeng never lets anyone stay behind.

679
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,680
This is our rule.

680
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,700
Whether you want it or not,

681
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,600
I'll obey it.

682
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,120
As you wish.

683
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,040
Master!

684
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,050
What did you say?

685
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,680
Lu Ping is the God of Bandits?

686
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,440
Yes.

687
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,640
And he even broke their tower?

688
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,200
-Yes, Master!
-Yes!

689
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,680
If you ask me,
I don't think Lu Ping is a fool.

690
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,720
He's keeping all the skills hidden.

691
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,600
Yes. Xifan and Lu Ping are both wounded.

692
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,520
They walk slower.

693
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,440
They want us to bring
the good news to you first.

694
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,600
They'll be here very soon.

695
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,760
Master, should we get ready

696
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,850
to welcome them?

697
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,760
Welcome my head!

698
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,800
Come here, all of you.

699
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,360
Do you have any idea how costly

700
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
that tower is?

701
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,040
Which part went out of our control?

702
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,480
Qin Sang? Forget it.

703
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,400
Now Qin Qi too?

704
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,360
Lu Ping sneaked out of Chan State
right under our noses!

705
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,200
Sir.

706
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,920
He can't run forever.

707
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,280
No matter how far he goes,

708
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,520
he still have to go back to Zhaifeng.

709
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,120
Before Lord starts blaming,

710
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,920
we have to get him back!

711
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,840
In order to keep everyone's mouth shut,

712
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,720
wipe out Zhaifeng Institute.

713
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,640
Yes, sir.

714
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,640
Mr. Wei.

715
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,520
Do we really have to find Lu Ping?

716
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,040
He brings bad luck.

717
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,520
If it weren't for him,

718
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,340
why would Sangsang be so far away from me?

719
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,240
And how could Chan State Academy
be completely humiliated?

720
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,640
If we do not have revenge,

721
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,620
how can you call yourselves
men of the martial arts?

722
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,240
My father is a coward.

723
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,280
But I, Wei Tianqi, will not tolerate this!

724
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,360
But Lu Ping is capable
of breaking the tower to ruins.

725
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,200
Our men,

726
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,680
including you,

727
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,360
might not be his rival.

728
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,080
-He has a point.
-Yes.

729
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,160
Don't worry, my friends.

730
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,720
Everything is under my control.

731
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,540
[Make it tighter.]

732
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,680
[Tuck it in.]

733
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,320
Hurry up.

734
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,600
Carry ten kilos with you every day.

735
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,960
I don't want to see anyone
lacking one step.

736
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,520
Get moving.

737
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,360
Master!

738
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,980
It's daytime already.

739
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,080
Xifan and Lu Ping still haven't come back.

740
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,240
Did anything happen to them?

741
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,040
-Yes, Master!
-Would anything have happened?

742
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,240
Did anything happen?

743
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,020
It's a good thing they haven't come back.

744
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,890
Who knows how much money
he is going to cost me?

745
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,440
Sorry!

746
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,040
I let you down again, Master!

747
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,960
Xifan!

748
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,240
Xifan is back.

749
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,960
-Xifan!
-You're back!

750
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,880
Lu Ping!

751
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,080
-Xifan!
-Are you alright?

752
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,280
You're finally home.

753
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,560
-Xifan!
-I got you.

754
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,560
Be careful.

755
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,720
What took you so long?

756
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,800
Here, I got you.

757
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Slower.

758
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,120
-Good to have you back.
-All right.

759
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,520
-I was so worried.
-Stop!

760
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,840
Master.

761
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,200
Chan State's exam...

762
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,960
We won.

763
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,240
Rong.

764
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,200
Master.

765
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,160
Head to town.

766
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,930
See if they have any followers.

767
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,840
Yes, sir.

768
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,440
Followers?

769
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,490
What followers?

770
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,760
How could there be followers?

771
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,720
What does he mean?

772
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,520
-How can this be?
-Didn't we win?

773
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,840
I want Zhaifeng Institute
to close down now!

774
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,160
No one gets out!

775
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,800
Master!

776
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,160
Master!

777
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,440
The Wei family is here, in Chenqiao Town!

778
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,640
They're coming for us!

779
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,680
-See?
-Coming for us?

780
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,560
I told you so.

781
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,360
They're coming for us.

782
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,480
What should we do?

783
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,740
The Wei Family got to us

784
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,000
before Shanhai Gang could.

785
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,200
With us here,
we'll never allow them to touch Lu Ping!

786
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,960
-That's right.
-That's what I'm talking about!

787
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
We won't allow it!

788
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,810
Although I don't like this organization,

789
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,080
I hate Wei Tianqi even more.

790
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,180
So I've decided

791
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,000
to help you once more for free.

792
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,200
-Yes!
-Thank you, Mr. Mo!

793
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

794
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,480
Shut up!

795
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,720
You brat...

796
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,600
Ever since the day I took you in,

797
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,440
I knew you'd be a big trouble to me.

798
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,920
Get out now.

799
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,560
I said get out!

800
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,840
Master...

801
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,320
-Master...
-Why is this happening?

802
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,680
Now is not the time to scold him.

803
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,140
We can't let the Wei Family
take Lu Ping away.

804
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,900
What's the matter?

805
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,440
That family has power and money.

806
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,930
Do you know that?

807
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,640
This guy?

808
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,320
He's a rat's poop,

809
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,340
destroying the entire porridge.

810
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,780
There's no place for him here.

811
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,640
You clearly don't want to offend
the Wei Family.

812
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,920
-Yes!
-Exactly!

813
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
What a coward!

814
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,680
What's up?

815
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,820
How embarrassing?

816
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,000
Today,

817
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,780
I will not change my attitude.

818
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,900
Who disagrees?

819
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,900
-Go with him!
-Master.

820
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,360
Stay away from me.

821
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,880
Don't call me master.

822
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
With everything that's happening,

823
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,420
it's either his departure

824
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,920
or the end of Zhaifeng.

825
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,200
From now on,

826
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,320
you have nothing to do
with Zhaifeng Institute.

827
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm sick and tired
of that shabby little cabin.

828
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,080
Leaving is just a matter of time.

829
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,680
Leaving early is even better.

830
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,640
Su Tang.

831
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,200
I'll go where my brother goes.

832
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,480
Lu Ping!

833
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,960
Don't let your temper get in the way.

834
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,040
Rest, cripple.

835
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,880
Don't break both of your legs.

836
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,010
Otherwise, you'll be taking
your loser master's place.

837
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,360
Master.

838
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,160
-Don't push Lu Ping away.
-Don't let him go.

839
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,420
Master, don't do this.

840
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,800
Please.

841
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,570
Please don't do it, master.

842
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,080
Lu Ping...

843
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
You acted like you were so sure.

844
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,880
So now where are you going?

845
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,640
The Wei Family are almost here.

846
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,160
Come with me...

847
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,200
Sir.

848
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,120
We've searched the entire
Zhaifeng Institute.

849
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,780
Lu Ping is nowhere to be found.

850
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,320
You're a bunch of losers!

851
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,560
Spit it out!

852
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,720
Where's Lu Ping?

853
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,240
Don't abuse your status.

854
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,440
Yes, Zhaifeng Institute is small.

855
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,920
But it's not just any place

856
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,610
where you can trample over!

857
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,720
Don't fight!

858
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,840
Calm down.

859
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,480
Don't fight.

860
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,220
Who said you get to do that?

861
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,800
Mr. Wei.

862
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,520
Sorry about that.

863
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,660
It's true that Lu Ping is not here.

864
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,120
I fired him already.

865
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,120
Besides, once he heard your name,

866
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,120
he fled with a tail between his legs.

867
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,240
Sir.

868
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,290
This old man can't be educated.

869
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,480
Why don't we set this place on fire?

870
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,320
Do it!

871
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,240
Don't! Sir!

872
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,200
Please don't!

873
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,240
Don't!

874
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,840
Mr. Wei.

875
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,560
I got it!

876
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,970
That brat must have fled

877
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,610
to the back of the hillside.

878
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,480
I'll take you there.

879
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,520
-Hurry up.
-After you.

880
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,720
-Let's go!
-Over here.

881
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
This way, please.

882
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,680
-Xifan.
-What should we do?

883
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,560
Follow them.

884
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,240
Make sure Master
doesn't do anything stupid.

885
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,080
-Okay.
-Let's move.
