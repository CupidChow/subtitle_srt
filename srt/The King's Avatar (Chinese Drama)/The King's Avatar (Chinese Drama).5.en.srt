00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,300
= Episode 5 =

3
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Won again.

4
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,640
Just got lucky.

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,720
It is clear that you are competitive.

6
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
Keep a low-key when I need to be modest.

7
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Keep a high-profile when I need to show off.

8
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,200
I really don't have any strategy guide.

9
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,560
You are a real veteran.

10
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,160
Didn't add me as a friend or accept the files.

11
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,320
What can I do? I'm very helpless.

12
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,360
If so, you could instruct her with words and deeds.

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,560
If she doesn't receive the file, you can try another way.

14
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440
I'm like a bear with a sore head.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
I could be that, too.

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,440
But it wouldn't solve any problem.

17
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you sure you can't finish the task?

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,240
I....

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,880
I'm sure...

20
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,920
under the instruction of my boss... I can finish the task.

21
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,400
The deadline is within 24 hours.

22
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,000
When time runs out, you'd either be a winner,

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
or you would be a loser.

24
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
This is the Glory World Rules written by me.

25
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,720
It's not a strategy guide.

26
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Just a glance at the whole process.

27
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,320
Not showing off your experience of success.

28
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
It's just a collection of failures and lessons.

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
I don't read manuscripts.

31
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,720
Bring it here.

32
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,200
What a crappy manuscript! Ditch it!

33
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Tang, take your time.

34
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,320
Come on. Have fun!

35
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Brat, go working now!

36
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,720
Tang, you are quite good now.

37
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,280
You've made progress quickly.

38
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,160
You needed 2 minutes to defeat me before.

39
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
Now you only need 40 seconds.

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,640
In fact, it could be faster.

41
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,240
How could you learn so fast, any secret?

42
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
It must be the manuscript.

43
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
I just flipped it through.

44
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,800
There's nothing valuable.

45
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
You threw it away?

46
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Where did you leave it?

47
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
At the bar.

48
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,040
Well...

49
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,120
Type last month's statement of account.

50
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll see it through.

51
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,760
Boss, you have been telling me to do things as early as possible.

52
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,480
So I finished it yesterday.

53
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,320
Besides, I used Microsoft Excel to summarize it.

54
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,760
The No. 47 computer in Section B is broken. Go check.

55
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,120
Boss, you've been emphasizing computers are essential for net cafes.

56
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,280
We'd sacrifice everything but computers must be in a good condition.

57
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,000
So?

58
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,080
I've fixed the computer in Section B.

59
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Thanks to the omnipotent restart button.

60
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,160
Did the boss tell you to disappear when you're supposed to?

61
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,800
What? When should I disappear?

62
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,520
Now.

63
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
Network manager.
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

64
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,560
Coming.

65
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,240
When did you become so quick and neat?

66
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,200
OK.

67
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,200
This is the long-lost Secrets of Glory.

68
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:12,680
Tang read this and then made great progress.

69
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
I don't expect the same thing.

70
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,920
Just wanna look at it.

71
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,120
What is this?

72
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,280
Poached Eggs?

73
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,040
Is this the strategy guide or a recipe for Tang?

74
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,640
For Z-word jitter,

75
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,937
the most important is changing directions with a stable APM.

76
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,400
What's this? Salted duck egg?

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
Falling Palm.

78
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,760
Though it is not a high-level skill, it has a very strong blowing effect.

79
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,000
The blowing distance it creates is beyond the opponent's attack range.

80
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,640
It is an extremely terrible micro-operation.

81
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,920
Is this a teacup?

82
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,240
Why cups?

83
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,320
Chaser!

84
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,360
This must be the fancy Chaser practiced by Battlemage.

85
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,160
At this critical moment, my perceptions are essential.

86
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sitting for too long is not good for your heath. Have a rest.

87
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,560
Please get up and have a cup of tea.

88
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Let's take a recess.

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you talking about?

90
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,971
I got you a schedule of Jun Moxiao's online time.
= Jun Moxiao's Schedule =

91
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:19,320
I got you a schedule of Jun Moxiao's online time.

92
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,600
If you have to wait, you should at least follow the schedule.

93
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,920
Otherwise, you'd be the Waiting Stone, wasting your time...

94
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:43,451
I'm tired of thinking about the plan.

95
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
How to arrange it?

96
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,520
Well...

97
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,200
Call up players in Team 1. I have a task for them.

98
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,400
How should we arrange the big plan?

99
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,400
About Boneyard we talked about last time, when shall we start?

100
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
You really meant it?

101
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Oh, no. Were you kidding me last time?

102
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,080
I've deployed all players. Waiting for you now.

103
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
Please keep your words.

104
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
No need to bother your people.

105
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,880
I have my own team.

106
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,680
See you in half an hour at Boneyard.

107
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
His own team?

108
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,200
He is to bring a team of experts to help me.

109
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,062
Come with me to attack the Boneyard, OK?

110
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,440
Can we PK at Boneyard?

111
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,200
There are plenty of opponents to practice with.

112
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,960
Everyone is quite fierce.

113
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,880
I'd love it.

114
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,160
Give it a try.

115
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,320
Guild Master, are these people all experts?

116
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
Of course.

117
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,920
Look at the momentum of this female Battlemage.

118
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,920
Very competitive.

119
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
It seems that she has never fought in such a place.

120
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,240
Nowadays... fewer and fewer experts are willing to teach newbies.

121
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
But for Dungeons like this…

122
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
…only one for each team.

123
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,440
You all have a chance.

124
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,760
What about the future?

125
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,680
About the future....

126
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
Look at this Ranger.

127
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,760
He looks very experienced.

128
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,080
Guild master.

129
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Is it the newbie who joined the fight against Blood Gunman?

130
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,960
No experience. It's all lessons.

131
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,040
Just looks like him.

132
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
Master, let's go.

133
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,920
Let's wait for one more player.

134
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,600
Look.

135
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,320
The master told us to wait for another player.

136
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,400
It must be a peerless player.

137
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,200
Top players always show up last.

138
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,440
Must be very powerful.

139
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,880
She just registered to buy equipment yesterday.

140
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,680
Are you sure it can break the record?

141
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,280
Who is sitting on my chair?

142
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,160
Who?

143
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
Well...

144
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm in the Dungeon.

145
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,160
Can these two newbies make it?

146
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
Bao Zi is making random moves.

147
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,720
He can kill a monster in ten seconds or in two minutes.

148
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,760
What the heck?

149
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,920
Han Yanrou really hasn't fought in any Dungeon at all.

150
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,360
She has no idea of teamwork at all.

151
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,960
Guild master, it's kinda messy.

152
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,840
Hold on, hold on. It's all tactics.

153
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
Why is one person missing?

154
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,760
Where is the Launcher?

155
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,000
Why only four left?

156
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,200
One missing.

157
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Bought so many heavy weapons that he couldn't carry?

158
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,000
The Launcher is unreliable.

159
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,080
Zombie Bailey escaped will be in the dragon bone soon.

160
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
Really unreliable.

161
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,240
Zombie Bailey has run away. Still shooting aimlessly.

162
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Oh, gosh, reacted in 0.1 second and hit the target!

163
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,000
Who do you think is standing on the dragon bone?

164
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,800
Shooting all the way around pushed Zombie Bailey to Jun Moxiao.

165
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,280
The umbrella turned into a spear.

166
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,560
Stabbing again and again.

167
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,160
The operation of gun is incredible.

168
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:57,885
Amazing!

169
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:00,120
It must be a professional player with 90% possibility.

170
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,320
Female Launcher Feng Shu Yan Mu...

171
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,960
Mu…

172
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,600
Is she Su Mucheng?

173
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,600
Of course, she is.

174
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,680
The one helping our Lanxi Pavilion to attack the Dungeon is her.

175
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,840
With Su Mucheng's help, it will make our guild master proud.

176
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't be ridiculous. Focus on shooting.

177
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,840
You only got lucky to shoot like this.

178
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,840
Focus on our mission.

179
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,960
It's just a coincidence.

180
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,720
I thought she was Su Mucheng.

181
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,200
Congratulations to Lanxi player Jun Moxiao,

182
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,440
Feng Shu Yan Mu, Bao Zi, the Invader,

183
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,240
Han Yanrou and Lan He for breaking the record of Boneyard.

184
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,520
A new record!

185
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
What did I just say?

186
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,720
My expert and I came up with the strategy of.

187
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,680
You're so wise!.

188
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,240
Exactly!

189
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Yes, yes.

190
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
= Ranking List of Guilds =

191
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,920
= The First Kill List: Jun Moxiao killed seven enemies =

192
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:21,794
= Dungeon Records: Night Evil Cat; Spider Cave; Frost Forest; Boneyard =

193
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:27,645
Jun Moxiao is awesome.
= The Best Player: Jun Moxiao =

194
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,480
A whole new record.
= He's amazing! Master, please instruct me! =

195
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
He created all the records in District 10.
= Another New Record =

196
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,600
Jun Moxiao, you are the best.

197
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,080
Jun Moxiao is the most competitive master in history.

198
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,760
Lanxi Pavilion ranks at the top.

199
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If anyone broke this record, I'd eat the keyboard.

200
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,800
See?

201
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,240
If it hadn't been for my assistance, Zombie Bailey'd have run away.

202
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,720
My lady, that's the master of Lanxi Pavilion.

203
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,080
He will know it is you.

204
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,480
Are you going to do anything?

205
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,240
If Jia Shi knows it, what should you do then?

206
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,520
I'm not afraid.

207
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,800
Professional players came to break the Dungeon record.

208
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,120
How embarrassing is it to bully the weak by being strong?

209
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,280
Who would anyone believe it?

210
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,160
You are talking about me.

211
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,240
The new form is unlocked.

212
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,480
Help me test my thousand-machine umbrella.

213
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,880
I will show no mercy.

214
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,920
This transformation form is Pure Soul Spear.

215
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,120
With attack speed 5, it is the fastest of war spears.

216
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,760
This transformation form is Decider Rifle.

217
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,520
With light weight and large recoil,

218
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,200
it's a perfect transformation to the gun profession.

219
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
This transformation is Heraldic Shield.

220
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,600
It's evolved from the knight's shield

221
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,640
and can easily change to the Cleric skill of thick blood.

222
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,200
At the same time, it also...

223
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
...has high magic resistance and wide defense range.

224
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,760
It's a close-fighting weapon for the fighting profession.

225
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
All right, stop it.

226
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,960
That's why we stole her hairpin the day before yesterday,

227
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,200
her rubber band yesterday, and her costume today.

228
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,880
You didn't use the word "stole" very accurately.

229
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
This thing goes back and forth in family members' hands.

230
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,360
At best, it can be regarded as recycling to maximize its value.

231
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,000
Isn't it?

232
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
Look at this hairpin and this rubber band.

233
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Especially this costume.

234
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
Perfect flexibility.

235
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,360
Perfect.

236
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,920
# You cover your unwillingness with a smile. #

237
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,640
# You cover your unwillingness with a smile. #
Run!

238
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,520
# But you try your best not leaving regrets for me. #

239
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:01,560
# You are like my private investigator. #

240
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,760
# Understand my every move and expression. #

241
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,520
# you are the best in my heart. #

242
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,400
# Time sometimes flies so fast when we are together, #

243
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,680
# Sometimes time becomes so slow. #

244
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,880
# You are my dearest in my heart. #

245
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,240
# You will always be my support. #

246
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,440
# I will care about you forever. #

247
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,714
# you are the best in my heart. #

248
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:50,840
That's all for today.

249
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,160
I'm offline. I'm going to train.

250
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,000
We'd better confirm the tactics of this competition.

251
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,400
I already said at the tactical meeting you just need to be my assistant.

252
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,000
Leave the rest to me.

253
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
If you have to do this, I'd like to remind you of a few things.

254
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,000
Yu Wenzhou and Huang Shaotian from Lan Yu, they...

255
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,840
This is not my first competition.

256
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,480
Mucheng is here.

257
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Captain.

258
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,160
What's up?

259
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,560
Well, you just became captain.

260
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,920
There is a new atmosphere both inside and outside of Jia Shi.

261
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,280
I think we should do a makeover with the interior decorations.
= Jia Shi Team =

262
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,640
It is the new design sketch.

263
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
You can make these small decisions as you see fit.

264
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,480
OK, I'll get someone to arrange it right away.

265
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,920
But there is one thing I haven't done well.

266
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,960
Go ahead.

267
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
Now Jia Shi is on an upward trend.

268
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,240
Only the guild has not fit into this.

269
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,600
It'd hold the captain back.

270
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,000
Is our guild's performance that bad?

271
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,080
The main reason is an expert has been stirring up things.

272
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,640
He not only robbed several big guilds of their top kills,

273
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,680
but also broke the record of Dungeon one by one.

274
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,280
The Dungeon record?

275
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,640
It's easy.

276
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,920
What kind of expert can be there in Glory?

277
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
So…

278
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,640
We will report our achievement of record tomorrow.

279
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,000
It is absolutely in our pocket.

280
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,320
No one can surpass it.

281
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,480
It attributes to everyone.

282
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,280
But what we have to do is to make persistent efforts.

283
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
Take another Dungeon record.

284
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,960
It's good your spirits were high.

285
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,600
It scared our new records down the board.

286
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,480
Three, two, one.

287
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,000
Start.

288
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Congratulations to Praisage players, Fei Xiangtian, 00 Kill,

289
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,280
Meng Tianchen, Jiuyang and Jinxiang for breaking the record of Boneyard.

290
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,240
Results: 16 minutes 56.78 seconds.

291
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,080
What are Dungeon records used for?

292
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,200
They are for Lanxi Pavilion to break it.

293
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,640
Everyone should be prepared.

294
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,760
I will launch a new round of attack on Dungeon records soon.

295
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,040
You'll have to work hard.

296
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,320
Come on.

297
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
You can certainly do it.

298
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,200
Brother, your record is not that good.

299
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,760
It was broken in just two days.

300
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,680
Is it too harsh to say so?

301
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,840
I can't say that.

302
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Brother, the new records are all fragile.

303
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,200
You don't have to be too sad.

304
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
No... What if…

305
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,160
What if the master likes to challenge?

306
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,280
Brother, what hideous messages did you withdraw?

307
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,800
Brother, do you need any materials?

308
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,640
The guild has got some new powerful spider silk.

309
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,920
The more, the better.

310
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
Then one more Dungeon?

311
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,880
But this time let's talk about after-sales service.

312
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,880
Do you have any warrant?

313
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,520
No warrant for such a product.

314
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,600
I saw the new record.

315
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,600
16 minutes 56.78 seconds.

316
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,560
It must be professional players.

317
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,120
And this result is already the limit.

318
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,160
It is almost impossible to break again.

319
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,440
Impossible?

320
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,480
Then our record is gone.

321
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,480
But I love looking for possibilities in the impossibility.

322
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Sun Xiang led professional players to create a record of 16 mins 56.78 secs.

323
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,920
No matter how many times I simulate actual combat,

324
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,040
I can't find a way to speed up and shorten the time.

325
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,520
The straightway is blocked, then we have to find a by-pass.

326
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,760
But I still need a Swordsman.

327
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,920
Is this net cafe contracted by Ye Qiu?

328
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,365
There's a competition tonight. I'll support Jia Shi.

329
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,520
So obvious! Can't you tell it?

330
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
It is.

331
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,560
It is the cardboard cut-out I bought for tonight.

332
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,920
The original size is exactly the same as tall as Ye Qiu.

333
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,800
Could you help me put it here?

334
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,560
Get it done.

335
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,760
The same size?

336
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,840
The same height?

337
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,160
By the way, brat,

338
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,520
in the competition tonight...

339
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
which team will win?

340
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,280
Boss, which team do you expect to win?

341
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,480
I think Jia Shi will lose.

342
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,600
It would be impossible for Jia Shi to win without Ye Qiu.

343
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,480
Well...

344
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,080
What are you hissing about?

345
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,251
I asked you which team would win.

346
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:00,240
Not to disarm a bomb. What took you so long?

347
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,320
Forget it.

348
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,320
Put up all these posters later.

349
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,480
I want everyone coming to the net cafe today to be in Ye Qiu's eyes.

350
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,200
Boss.

351
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,400
You have a good eye for these posters.

352
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,000
It's very sharp and unique. The cardboard cut-out is well done.

353
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,520
Taller than Ye Qiu himself.

354
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,160
Garage Kits videos are also great.

355
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,600
Why don't we be thorough?

356
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,440
Let's change the password of the net cafe, too.

357
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,000
How about "Ye Qiu is the most invincibly handsome"?

358
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,560
Ye Qiu is the most invincibly handsome.

359
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,240
That's a good one.

360
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,302
My Net cafe has been upgraded so much!

361
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,880
You should have known I just used rhetoric methods.

362
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,080
It's called irony.

363
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,200
Deal.

364
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,160
The brat has made progress.

365
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,800
It's the 16th round of the season of Glory Professional Alliance.

366
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,120
Jia Shi Team against Lan Yu Team.

367
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,702
Hello, everyone, audience, and everyone who is watching live.

368
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,000
Meet you again.

369
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,960
I am your old friend, Xiao Luo.

370
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,680
Please welcome the host, Jiashi Team!
= Love you, Jia Shi! =

371
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,840
The one coming first is the new captain of Jia Shi,

372
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Sun Xiang, known as the new king.

373
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Coming next is the top Launcher in our League, Su Mucheng.

374
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
Let's welcome the challenger, Lan Yu Team!

375
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,760
Now coming is Yu Wenzhou, one of the League's four greatest tacticians.

376
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,960
The second is the Blade Master, Huang Shaotian.

377
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,120
Let's see whether the new God of Fights, Sun Xiang

378
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,920
can survive from Huang Shaotian's nonsense talking?

379
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,840
The two teams have assembled.

380
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,920
Please shake hands with each other.

381
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,360
Little classmate, you senior will tell you the gap between you and Ye Qiu.

382
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,560
Listen carefully in class later.

383
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Did Su miss me?

384
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,960
No.

385
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,840
You've gained weight again.

386
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,920
Shut up.

387
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,120
Now the players of two teams have said hello to each other.

388
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,668
I don't know if they have made any sparks.

389
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,560
This is incredible.

390
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,880
Where is the beer, network manager?

391
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,280
Over there.

392
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,640
Lan Yu team has fallen behind by 0-3.

393
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,440
It seems that since they defeated Wei Cao Team,

394
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,240
with Sun Xiang, the new king's participation,

395
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,040
Jia Shi is very competitive.

396
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,800
And Sun Xiang now has Leaf of Autumn, the divine account.

397
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,840
His strength will be enhanced.

398
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,040
Three players from each team.

399
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,480
The loser leaves the game according to KOF rules,

400
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
and another one in the team come in.

401
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,320
Until no one left in the team.

402
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,640
The winning team will score 3 points.

403
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,160
Is it possible for Sun Xiang to defeat all three players by himself?

404
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,280
No way.

405
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,320
It is very difficult to do it.

406
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,680
Besides, the opponent is strong.

407
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,080
Jia Shi will win.

408
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,605
Then finally comes the long-awaited arena contest.
= Never ever be defeated! =

409
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:11,880
Then finally comes the long-awaited arena contest.

410
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,640
The arena contest between Jia Shi and Lan Yu will begin soon.

411
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,680
The first round. Sun Xiang, Battlemage and Leaf of Autumn

412
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,480
vs. Yu Feng, the Berserker and Brilliant Edge.

413
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
Competition map: Line Canyon.

414
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,154
Start.
= the 1st round =

415
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:33,760
Start.

416
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,360
Leaf of Autumn launches attack first.

417
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,200
Face to face fighting.

418
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,080
Leaf of Autumn dodged the blow.

419
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,320
Backhand Dragon Tooth, float!

420
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
Sky-striking. The Brilliant Edge fell.

421
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,400
Draconic Crusher.

422
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
The attacking pace of Leaf of Autumn is very good.

423
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,280
Never expected Sun Xiang stormed as soon as he came up.

424
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,320
Yu Feng has no strength to fight back.

425
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,240
Continuous stabbing. Leaf of Autumn suddenly launched an onslaught.

426
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Brilliant Edge is in danger.

427
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,560
He is very likely to be killed directly.

428
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,040
Sun Xiang used 15% of his blood volume
= Glory =

429
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,260
Sun Xiang used 15% of his blood volume

430
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,194
to kill Yu Feng, Lan Yu's first player.

431
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,160
Great advantage.

432
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,280
It seems that one killing three is possible.

433
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,000
Lan Yu's second player Qi Master, Receding Tides is coming.

434
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Falling Palm being followed by Draconic Crusher.

435
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,982
Great, Sun Xiang used only 10% of his blood volume

436
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:38,800
to kill another player from Lan Yu.

437
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,360
Jia Shi's fans started screaming.

438
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,680
Can Sun Xiang be the third to win a one-against-three match?

439
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,720
The third round begins.

440
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,160
Lan Yu's final player is Ammunition expert, Bullets Rain.

441
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,040
It's another long-distance profession.

442
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,320
Dragon Soaring.

443
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,480
Second kill.

444
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,160
In Jia Shi's first show, Sun Xiang shows his stunning strength.

445
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,560
Sun Xiang made it.

446
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,360
He really has won the one-against-three.

447
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,720
A new God of Fights is born.

448
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,640
What kind of luck did he run into?

449
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,280
Could you win the triple crown?

450
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,560
Boss, boss, boss.

451
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
You're the network manager?

452
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,560
Come here.

453
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,040
Boss, is this your network manager?

454
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,520
He doesn't even know where the beer is.

455
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,600
Sorry, sorry.

456
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,560
What's wrong with you?

457
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,040
You don't even know where the beer is.

458
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,040
Now, draw the topographic map of the Net cafe for me.

459
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,840
The position of a screw should be accurate to centimeter.

460
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,720
Did you hear me?

461
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,240
I…

462
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Get the customer his beer.

463
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Sorry, the beer is there.

464
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,600
Don't do it again next time.

465
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,440
Welcome back.
= Lan Yu vs. Jia Shi =

466
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,880
= Lan Yu vs. Jia Shi =
After the singles and arena contests,

467
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,680
now the score is 0-6. Lan Yu falls behind.
= Lan Yu vs. Jia Shi =

468
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,600
If they want to win, they'll have to get 5 points in the Team Competition.

469
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,640
And get two extra points for ace.

470
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,360
No big deal.

471
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Chu, bring me my account book.

472
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,720
I've already calculated everything, boss.

473
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,440
Do it again.

474
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,440
All of them.

475
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,960
Captain.

476
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,720
Where shall we celebrate tonight?

477
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,400
Ying Chao bar.

478
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
All of you cover for me later.

479
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,520
I will kill them all by myself.

480
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
Gotcha, Captain.

481
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,000
Captain, let's follow the tactics.

482
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,320
Relax, Mucheng.

483
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,080
After all, we still have the captain.

484
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,480
We all know that the Lan Yu team has Yu Wenzhou,

485
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,360
one of the four Tactical Masters in Glory.

486
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
It is a team with very high tactical qualities.

487
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,280
The cooperation between the players is very tacit.

488
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,040
For Jia Shi Team,

489
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,760
can the new captain lead his players to fight with a different style?

490
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Let's wait and see.

491
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,120
Remember, be happy.

492
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,840
Shaotian.

493
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,480
Remember tactics.

494
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Consider it done.

495
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,080
When did I fail you at critical moments, right?

496
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,440
Yes, come on.

497
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,480
Players from both sides enter the competition map.

498
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,760
Jia Shi vs. Lan Yu.

499
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,720
The Team Competition will begin.

500
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,560
Of the two strong and competitive teams,

501
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,200
Sun Xiang, Battlemage, Leaf of Autumn

502
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,240
Yu Wenzhou, Warlock, Swoksaar

503
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,360
Su Mucheng, Launcher, Mu Yu Cheng Feng.

504
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,160
Huang Shaotian, the swordsman, Troubling Rain.

505
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,240
What kind of spark will the 4 players create?

506
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,320
Sun Xiang has shown strong personal strength.

507
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,360
We look forward to his performance in the game.

508
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,080
Leaf of Autumn, Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

509
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,600
His momentum is still very strong.

510
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,520
After attacking the Ammunition experts, Bullets Rain,

511
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,360
he aims directly at Warlock Swoksaar.

512
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,280
Bullets Rain stands up!

513
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,560
He interferes with Leaf of Autumn's attack.

514
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,360
This thermal missile repelled two people effectively.

515
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,040
On the other side, Swordsman, Troubling Rain,

516
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,600
aims directly to Jia Shi's Sharpshooter.

517
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,080
Both sides choose to send the strikers to the back row to disturb output.

518
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,680
Sun Xiang reacted very fast.

519
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,320
Yu Wenzhou predicted well and pulled back the Qi Master.

520
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,360
So he escaped from the Draconic Crusher of Leaf of Autumn.

521
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,920
Yes, we see that the blood volume of both sides is now equal.

522
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,680
So if this stalemate continues, Lan Yu is going to lose.

523
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
Now we have a standoff here.

524
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,240
Lan Yu's Qi Master failed to protect the back row.

525
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,400
Swoksaar is still pinned down by Leaf of Autumn.

526
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,920
Good job! Sun operates very fast.

527
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,800
Escaping the ammunition expert's stiff bullet.

528
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,480
Lousy!

529
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,360
With continuous Stabbing, Leaf of Autumn hit Swoksaar.

530
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,480
Sun Xiang continues the momentum of one-against-three.

531
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,040
Sun Xiang, awesome!

532
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,160
Awesome? Lousy!

533
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,320
Unpack!

534
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,680
Lan Yu needs to adjust their paces now.

535
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,960
All the Jia Shi players stride forward,

536
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,480
aiming to put continuous pressure on Lan Yu.

537
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,880
Jia Shi is going to lose.

538
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,000
