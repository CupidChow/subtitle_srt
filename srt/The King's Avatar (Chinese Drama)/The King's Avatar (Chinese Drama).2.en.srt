4
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,100
Can I pay the bill now?

5
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:39,626
Sure.

6
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:40,708
Master, come here.

7
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,433
Come on.

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
Wait a second.

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,800
Why is this black screen again?

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,600
Am I playing Glory or the computer is playing me?

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Master.

12
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,640
Is that man playing with your account?

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
He will probably steal your equipment.

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,440
Oh, no.

15
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
You bastard.

16
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,960
Won.

17
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
I saw the battle start,

18
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
so I played a round for you.

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,680
How long did it take you to win?

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
Forty seconds.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,400
This is awesome.

22
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,480
I won.

23
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,280
Well done.

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,840
Master.

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,120
You just said Glory is more than a battle.

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
What is Glory?

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040
Glory.

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,280
We know each other through Glory.

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,920
Glory is the world for all of us.

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
You need to pay the bill, right?

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,240
Sorry.

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
I'm looking for a job here.

33
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,720
What's your name?

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,240
Ye Xiu.

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Ye what?

36
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,560
Ye Xiu.

37
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,120
Your name is so similar to the name of the God in Glory

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,640
Interesting.

39
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,080
Do you have experience working as a network management?

40
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,600
No.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,320
Can you log into the game for costumers?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,760
No.

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Can you examine the network operation?

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,040
No.

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,440
Can you maintain the network equipment,

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,840
upgrade antivirus software and detect unsafe information?

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,000
No.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,640
What the hell do you know?

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Well.

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
I know how to Glory.

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,320
You are hired.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
Let's get this straight.

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
You don't know anything.

54
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
If your performace is poor,

55
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,400
I won't hire you.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,200
I am not running a charity here.

57
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,520
What a mess.

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
Not bad.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,040
This is too good for me.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,040
Sorry, but you are over thinking.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,360
This is my room.

62
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Your room.

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,960
There.

64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Right here.

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,120
This...

66
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,160
The condition here is not exactly good.

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,240
However, the staff dormitory is full for the time being.

68
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
It's okay. It's fine.

69
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
All I need is a bed.

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,400
The quilt is at the head of the bed.

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
Help yourself.

72
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,600
There is no rush.

73
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,520
OK.

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,120
Stop.

75
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,080
Hello.

76
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Go and change the light bulb.

77
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,600
The light bulb?

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
There.

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,880
OK.

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,040
What's wrong?

81
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,560
Check the switch.

82
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,600
Network manager, where is the instant noodles I ordered?

83
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,640
Coming.

84
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,960
Sorry.

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,240
Coming.

86
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Sorry.

88
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,360
Gave me an extra hour.

89
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
Chu, Table 24 adds another hour.

90
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,760
Network manager, more instant noodles please.

91
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
All right. I am coming.

92
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
I told you to hurry up.

93
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,280
What the hell?

94
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,760
What is going on? Network Manager.

95
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,160
I am sorry.

96
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
We are closed for half a day.

97
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
Sorry. Come back tomorrow.

98
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
Sorry. Come back tomorrow.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,880
For the first time, I realise

100
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
installing a light bulb is a technical job.

101
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,520
I'll get someone to fix it.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,640
Stop.

103
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,400
Let's talk about the loss you caused.

104
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,880
You can deduct today's loss

105
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,360
from my salary,

106
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
All right.

107
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
A full-time employee's monthly salary is 3,000 RMB.

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,680
You are still an intern.

109
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,600
You can only get half. That would be 1500 RMB.

110
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,720
Some customers did not pay the Internet fee.

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
That's 427 RMB.

112
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,160
The meal fee is 361 RMB.

113
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,640
The fee for repair is 500 RMB. The insurance costs 32 RMB.

114
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Let's take a look.

115
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,800
This is today's loss.

116
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,760
Seems like that was just small mistake.

117
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
Master, I will go back to work now.

118
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
While repairing the Internet cafe, I have no choice but to close up.

119
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
You are responsible for that as well.

120
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
Looks like

121
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,920
you won't have any salary this month.

122
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,840
Today's loss is

123
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,840
9,892.5 RMB.

124
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,080
When I say I bear the loss, I mean

125
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
I'll pay for the light bulb.

126
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,640
I will deduct the change from the loss then.

127
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,000
Nine thousands.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
9,892.

129
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,120
How are you going to repay me?

130
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
Don't have an answer?

131
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,960
If you don't have an answer,

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,280
then you have to listen to me.

133
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,240
From now on,

134
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,320
You will be the network management.

135
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
You are responsible for cleaning.

136
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
You are also responsible for hard labour.

137
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,360
I can give you a place to live and provide you with three meals for free,

138
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,720
but I won't give you a cent.

139
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,000
Master.

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,320
You will get remuneration according to the work you do,

141
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,240
I will deduct them from your debt.

142
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,080
Any problem?

143
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,920
I

144
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,240
No.

145
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,120
Come on and work hard.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,360

Get out.

Bro.

152

The club does not welcome reporters like you.

153

Bro, please listen to me.

Wait a minute. Let me check,

164

It will only take a few seconds.

165
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,640
Turn around the screen.

166

Okay.

167
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
You know about computers as well?

168

I will resolve this for you.

Are they still hiring?

Let me change a mood.

177

Be careful, everyone.

178
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,880
When you are fighting on you own,

179

you will get a lot of rare materials.

Isn't this just open?

182

We are not very familiar with this game,

183
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,880
They even kicked me out when we entered the dungeon.

184
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,440
Here comes three newbies.

185
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
I will make you miserable then.

186
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,520
OK. You three can follow my lead,

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
There is nothing scary about Night Evil Cat, the wild cat.

A wild cat?

189
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,920
The cat is bigger than the three of us combined.

190
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,520
We couldn't even take one hit from it.

191

That's because none of you acted as the bait.

192
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,760
For example,

193
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,640
if I slap you right now,

194
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,960
you will hate me and

195
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,760
chase me around, right?

196
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,280
Right.

197
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,920
This time

198
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,360
he slaps you ten more times.

199
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,400
You will hate him even more and

200
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,520
chase him around,

201
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,080
right?

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
That's what I mean.

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
The one who causes the highest AD

204
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,640
will be the target of the monster.

205
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,880
The monster won't attack others.

206
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,600
If we just go and fight against a monster,

207
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
it will be a mess.

208
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,920
Night Evil Cat was supposed to attack me,

209
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
but it turned to attack others.

210
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,080
In the end, everything is out of control.

211
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Got it?

212
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,640
Got it.

213
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,040
Understood.

214
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I've been talking for a while now.

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Have you teamed up yet?

216
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,000
Did you shout out?

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,640
We just need to find a Cleric and we are good to go.

218
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,520
I am designing a weapon like this.

219
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
I call this a thousand-machine umbrella.

220
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,200
How could you?

221
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,880
You have come up with the idea and

222
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,040
keep it away from me?

223
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,440
There are two materials left.

224
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,040
There are two forms

225
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
which cannot be adjusted freely.

226
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,400
When I finish designing,

227
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
You are going to kill like crazy and

228
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
make your name known by the world of Glory.

229
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,960
OK.

230
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
I am looking forward to

231
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
the day when the thousand-machine umbrella is made.

232
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,960
My research failed.

233
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
I've sealed off a thousand-machine umbrella.

234
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,000
Is there not enough materials?

235
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm going to fight through all the dungeons and get the materials.

236
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,400
Wait for me.

237
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,520
Is there anyone who is interested in team up with us?

238
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,080
Have you teamed up yet?

239
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Do you guys need a Cleric?

240
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,080
I will join you.

241
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,810
= Invite Player Yue Zhongmian to the Team =

242
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,600
This one has decent ATN.

243
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,280
He can be the bait very easily.

244
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,320
Let you be the first to be taken away.

245
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,240
This

246
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll let you be the second one

247
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,640
who goes into hell.

248
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,600
You are the third.

249
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,360
The Cleric. He needs to survive for the time being.

250
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
Never mind. I don't care whether you will die or not.

251
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,360
I am in such a bad mood.

252
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,000
The reward from the dungeon

253
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,720
belongs to me.

254
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,480
Let's go.

255
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,180
= Players Yue Zhongmian, Dun Xing, Ci Sha Zhe, Yi Qiang Chuan Tou and Jun Moxiao Enter the Dungeon of Night Evil Cat =

256
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,120
Night Evil Cat appears.

257
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,440
The Knight.

258
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Hit it.

259
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,640
The Sharpshooter starts shooting.

260
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,280
Everybody, go, go.

261
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,400
The Thief. You need to attack as well.

262
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
The Knight can hold up for a while.

263
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,200
Healing.

264
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
Don't you see he is hurt?

265
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,200
The agenda of Yue Zhongmian is too obvious.

266
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,680
Jun Moxiao,

267
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,440
are you pretending to be stupid or what?

268
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,960
Healing.

269
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,520
Jun Moxiao, heal the Sharpshooter.

270
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
Heal the Sharpshooter.

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
Jun Moxiao. What's wrong with you?

272
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,720
Can't you see he runs out of HP?

273
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,120
Healing.

274
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,120
What the hell?

275
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,040
Bro. Healing.

276
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,960
I can't.

277
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,520
If I do, the bait will be useless.

278
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
Listen to me and heal him.

279
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,640
I am the bait right now. What are you afraid of?

280
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
If you make a simple mistake and

281
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
can't be the bait,

282
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,520
Night Evil Cat will go after me instead,

283
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
just like the three of them.

284
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Are you setting me up

285
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,640
on purpose?

286
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
You want to pocket the reward without sharing.

287
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,960
Isn't that your purpose?

288
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,040
The reward of this dungeon is quite rare.

289
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,400
I can't just let some newbies

290
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,040
get the reward.

291
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,280
You made a plan from the very beginning.

292
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,320
Using them to reduce the HP of Night Evil Cat.

293
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,400
Let them be the targets of Night Evil Cat.

294
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,680
I have to say

295
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,160
this is a clever move.

296
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,720
It's just the two of us now.

297
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
How about we cooperate and kill Night Evil Cat together?

298
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,280
I will give you half of the reward.

299
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,560
Half?

300
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
I prefer to take it all.

301
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,760
You're crazy. If I am dead, you won't live either.

302
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,800
Night Evil Cat has reached the stage of rampage.

303
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,520
You can't handle it alone.

304
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,800
This way no one will get the reward.

305
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,040
You are such a idiot. Jun Moxiao.

306
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,720
I will remember you.

307
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,320
Do you know how strong our Yue Lun guild is?

308
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,080
You're finished.

309
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,560
A man wants to kill Night Evil Cat alone.

310
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,280
He is only a Cleric.

311
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,240
Show me how you are going to kill it.

312
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,640
Congratulations to Players Yue Zhongmian,

313
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,600
Jun Moxiao, Yi Qiang Chuan Tou,

314
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,360
Dun Xing and Ci Sha Zhe.

315
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,680
They are the first team which passes the Green Forest dungeon.

316
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
The first. The first.

317
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,000
The first kill in this District.

318
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,040
You are God. Please friend me.

319
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,280
The first kill.

320
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,360
All rise and show your respect to the God.

321
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,000
You are God.

322
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Impossible.

323
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,400
Jun Moxiao. Jun Moxiao.

324
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,720
Jun Moxiao.

325
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,720
How dare you stealing the first kill from me?

326
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,840
I am not a pushover.

327
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,520
Hey!

328
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,200
Hello, Director Cao.

329
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,960
Yes, it's me, Chang.

330
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,200
Reports.

331
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,360
I will send the reports to you tonight.

332
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,120
I have come up with the headline.

333
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,880
It is

334
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,200
“Shocking. Jia Shi Team Changed the Color of Their Uniform“

335
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,120
“Something huge is Happening in Jia Shi Team”

336
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,880
What do you think?

337
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,640
Too bad?

338
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,880
I have another one.

339
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,800
It's called “Why are Flowers so Red?"

340
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,840
“Because they are always accompanies by green leaves”

341
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,360
Wei Cao will not be happy about that.

342
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,480
Then

343
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,360
All right, I will go back immediately.

344
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,720
I shall revenge next time.

345
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,960
Mu Qiu.

346
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,600
No matter how rare the materials are and

347
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,360
how difficult to upgrade a weapon,

348
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,960
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

349
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,220
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =
I will do everything I can

350
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,440
I will do everything I can

351
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
to make your genius work come true,

352
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
I shall take it with me

353
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,560
when I reach the top of Glory.

354
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,400
What the hell?

355
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,280
Network manager.

356
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,840
Master.

357
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,640
Bastard.

359
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,280
I can see the God again.

360
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
Did he really retire?

361
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,720
You are not going to wait for him to change his mind?

362
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,800
I mean, what if he comes back?

363
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,560
You don't believe in yourself.

364
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,680
You still don't believe me.

365
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,880
What if people ask about this?

366
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,960
What if they think I am the reason

367
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,000
he chose to retire?

368
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,160
They will think I forced him.

369
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,800
They will think I drove away the most valuable player in Jia Shi.

370
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,120
That's good.

371
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,880
Take it as a praise.

372
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
Just let them talk.

373
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
I don't think this is a praise.

374
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,760
You forced the most power player in the League to retire,

375
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,080
which means you are even stronger than him.

376
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,040
As long as most people accept you,

377
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,480
the opinions of the minor

378
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
do not matter.

379
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,520
How many people do you think

380
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,240
will care about someone in the history?

381
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Will it be so smooth?

382
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,000
You're too nervous.

383
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,040
You think you are inferior to Ye Qiu.

384
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,360
You think you can't be the captain of Jia Shi.

385
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,920
You also think Leaf of Autumn is out of your reach,

386
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
The title of the Fight God,

387
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,840
I certainly do not think that way.

388
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Do you want people to say things like this?

389
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,840
Of course not.

390
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
If you don't do a great job,

391
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,680
they will say so sooner or later.

392
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,720
If you don't want this to happen,

393
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,240
show everyone your true strength.

394
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
You are the captain of Jia Shi.

395
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Ye Qiu.

396
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,560
In a few months,

397
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,320
people will forget about someone who retired.

399
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,360
Why are you here again? Get out.

Get out.

403
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,600
I am sorry.

404
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,640
The flowers will be delivered soon.

405
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,520
Who are you?

406
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,240
We need to give flowers to our boss. It's urgent.

407
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,960
Get in.

408
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:39,760
Thank you.

409
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,040
Who are you?

410
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm here to deliver the flowers.

411
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,320
Mr. Tao is waiting for them.

412
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,360
Go, go.

413
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:49,960
Hurry up.

414
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,800
The scene is all set.

415
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
Three. Two, One. Start.

416
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,200
Dear audience, hello.

417
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,560
Welcome to the press conference of

418
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,920
Jia Shi club.

419
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
Next,

420
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,600
let's give a big round of applause

421
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,240
to the owner of Jia Shi club, Tao Xuan.

422
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
He will tell us about

423
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
the new plans and strategies for the team.

424
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,000
Hello, everyone. I'm Tao Xuan.

425
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
I'm honored to

426
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,800
have the chance to

427
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
communicate with people

428
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
who support Jia Shi Team today.

429
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Your enthusiasm

430
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,560
touches me a lot.

431
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,560
Meanwhile, I feel ashamed that

432
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
I am going to announce

433
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,880
something unfortunate

434
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,430
to you in this press conference.

435
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,880

436
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,200

439
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,560
our beloved captain,

440
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Ye Qiu

441
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
decided to step down as captain

442
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,360
a few days ago.

443
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,400
About Ye Qiu's retirement,

444
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,120
as his boss

445
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,440
He really left?

446
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,640
We all know

447
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
the level of teams in the League of Glory

448
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
is rising dramatically.

449
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,120
The intensity of competition is getting stronger.

450
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,960
Players need to spend 80 hours a week to practice,

451
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,200
which has exhausted them and

452
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
given them great pressure.

453
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,880
The club.

454
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,600
How dare he.

455
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,760
I tried to persuade Ye Qiu

456
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,800
to be the consultant of the team.

457
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,360
Unfortunately, Ye Qiu has made up his mind.

458
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,640
We deeply regret his leaving.

459
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,720
But we understand and respect

460
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,400
the decision made by

461
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,760
the former captain of Jia Shi.

462
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,400
Master,

463
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,920
I am so sorry.

464
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,720
I accidentally dropped

465
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,280
some water on the floor.

466
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,320
It makes me mad.

467
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,960
How about adding 5 RMB to my debt?

468
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,720
Money is useless.

469
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
My God is not coming back.

470
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,320
As an experienced player,

471
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,200
Ye Qiu has accompanied Glory

472
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,640
for ten years.

473
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,360
For many people, including me,

474
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,400
Ye Qiu

475
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
is the legend of an era.

476
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,840
I will never get the chance to see Ye Qiu again.

477
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,480
He won three championship for Jia Shi.

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
Strictly speaking,

479
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,560
Ye Qiu is the one who retired,

480
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
but Leaf of Autumn

481
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
is still in Jia Shi.

482
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,560
Without Ye Qiu, Leaf of Autumn

483
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,240
is like an empty shell without soul.

484
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,800
Ye Qiu's retirement is regrettable.

485
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
However, Jia Shi needs to move on.

486
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,400
I will never see Ye Qiu again?

487
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,360
His retirement

488
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,240
doesn't represent the end of a legend.

489
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,440
How can you say this after what you have done?

490
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
He gives the baton to the next generation

491
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,200
so that they can continue the legend.

492
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,040
The one who takes the baton from him

493
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,000
Move. I can't see.

494
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,040
is the best newcomer of this Professional Alliance,

495
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,000
Sun Xiang.

496
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,040
Bastard.

497
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,360
Get me my computer.

498
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,080
Where is that?

499
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,240
At the bar.

500
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,440
It's an honor to

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,240
take the baton from Ye Qiu and

502
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
become the new captain of

503
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,920
Jia Shi.

504
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,640
On the very day when Ye Qiu left,

505
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
a newcomer

506
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
wants to replace him?

507
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,640
He has no idea what he is doing.

508
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,880
With the account, Ye Qiu also told me

509
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,080
something valuable.

510
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,920
Do you like eSports?

511
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,320
What?

512
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,120
If you like it,

513
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,320
consider all of this as a glory,

514
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,680
rather than a chance to show off.

515
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,680
He said to consider all of this as a glory,

516
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
rather than a chance to show off.

517
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,680
Then why are you showing off?

518
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
We will come up with a new strategy

519
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,160
in the shortest time possible

520
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,280
to complete the transformation of Jia Shi.

521
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,200
Someone says I am rude.

522
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
Then I'll show you

523
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
what rudeness really looks like.

524
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,640
There are so many commentaries.

525
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,040
Here comes the keyboard woman.

526
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,960
Everyone is interacting with you.

527
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,760
Captain Sun Xiang.

528
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,480
You just took the position as the captain

529
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,080
from Ye Qiu,

530
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,040
do you think

531
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,680
you are truly qualified for this position?

532
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,600
In other words,

533
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,280
can you be just as good as Ye Qiu?

534
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,320
Just as good?

535
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,120
If that's all I want,

536
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,280
I would not have signed

537
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
the contract to transfer to Jia Shi back then.

538
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,720
Ten years ago,

539
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
all teams fumbled and moved forward step by step.

540
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,120
That's why they become strong now.

541
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Indeed.

542
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,200
That's how Jia Shi

543
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,760
obtains the title as the best team in Glory.

544
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,160
First,

545
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,800
No, what I want to say is

546
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,080
if Ye Qiu entered the current League matches,

547
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,760
with his strength,

548
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,400
he probably wouldn't become the third winner.

549
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,640
This is the reality.

550
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,280
Strong players emerge from power teams.

551
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,520
If you are immersed in old achievements,

552
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,960
your career as an eSport player will become narrow and

553
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,600
eventually you will be left behind.

554
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,680
Since I have chosen to accept this honor

555
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
as the captain of Jia Shi,

556
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,000
I have one goal and one goal only.

557
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,240
From now on, when people talk about Jia Shi,

558
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
they will no longer mention the three consecutive championship.

559
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,560
They will think Jia Shi as the best team in Glory.

560
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,680
Leaf of Autumn belongs to Ye Qiu.

561
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,360
Good job.

562
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,800
Well done.

563
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,120
That was so exciting.

564
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,240
In fact, he is right.

565
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,520
What do you mean?

566
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,000
Old players retire and newcomers emerge.

567
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,000
It is the rule of nature. No one can change it.

568
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
Say it again.

569
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,680
However,

570
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,880
Old players are not deserted.

571
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,800
The newcomers are not invincible.

572
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,960
In the world of Glory,

573
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,000
there is no difference between the experienced and the newcomers.

574
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,480
Yeah.

575
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,640
In the world of Glory,

576
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,880
In the world of Glory, there is only our love for this game.

577
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Ye Qiu no longer exists in the League,

578
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,400
but Jia Shi and Leaf of Autumn

579
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,720
will dominate the League.

580
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,440
No one can tell until they fight.

581
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,720
Yes.

582
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,080
You don't know until you fight.

583
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,680
Empty eyes. Slow movements.

584
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,000
How long has it been since I saw you?

585
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,320
This is how you abandon yourself.

586
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,560
I finally realised that there are things way more difficult

587
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,640
than playing Glory in this world.

588
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,440
So you are not abandoning yourself?

589
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,240
You want a new start.

590
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,000
I probably won't come back

591
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,360
as a successful.

592
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,800
I bring the things

593
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,760
you didn't take.

594
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Did you watch the live broadcast?

595
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,400
I was too angry so I only saw half of it.

596
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,680
Then I just turned off the TV.

597
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,200
Don't look at it anymore.

598
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
Are you worried that I may not be able to stand it?

599
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,840
I am worried that Sun Xiang may not be able to stand it in the future.

600
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,960
My partner knows me the best.

601
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,120
The guild master took the first kill of Night Evil Cat.

602
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,960
When did he become this powerful?

603
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,600
The guild master pretended to be strong,

604
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,120
but he only did this because of that God.

605
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,560
Yes, everyone was dead.

606
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,360
He was the last one standing.

607
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,680
I heard that Jun Moxiao

608
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,240
killed Night Evil Cat on his own.

609
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
Jun Moxiao again.

610
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,240
Who is he anyway?

611
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,160
He is just like another Sun Xiang.

612
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,440
Have no respect for his predecessors.

613
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,080
As a journalist,

614
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,000
I am obliged to expose what you truly are.

615
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
Jun Moxiao is so despicable

616
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
he wouldn't heal other members of the team

617
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,000
so that he could have the reward from the hidden boss all to himself.

618
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Watch out for him, everyone.

619
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,520
Jun Moxiao is so despicable

620
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,800
he wouldn't heal other members of the team

621
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
so that he could have the reward from the hidden boss all to himself.

622
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,880
Watch out for him, everyone.

623
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,160
Jun Moxiao is so despicable

624
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,440
he wouldn't heal other members of the team

625
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,200
so that he could have the reward from the hidden boss all to himself.

626
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,520
Watch out for him, everyone.

627
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,680
Let's team up.

628
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Go and fight in a dungeon together.

629
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,000
We are one person short.

630
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
Let's team up.

631
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,200
Let's team up.

632
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
You are the God.

633
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,000
What do you want?

634
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,320
I can't find anyone to team up

635
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,720
because of you.

636
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,480
Now you know your mistake, newbie.

637
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,280
You better learn from this.

638
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,560
Respect those who are more experienced than you.

639
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,800
Understood?

640
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
You do have a temper.

641
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,360
How about this?

642
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,360
We know each other now.

643
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,720
Let me join you.

644
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,240
We can cooperate together.

645
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,440
I won't let you off this easily.

646
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
I think he really wants to cooperate with us.

647
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
You believe him?

648
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,680
Sun Xiang even wants to surpass Ye Qiu.

649
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,560
I knew you are angry about

650
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,840
Ye Qiu's retirement.

651
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,600
Let him be the bait later.

652
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
None of us will help him out.

653
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,320
Let Lord Spider make him miserable.

654
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,560
Only if you are willing to be the bait.

655
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,200
What are you waiting for?

656
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,560
Let's go.

657
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,960
We're about to meet Lord Spider.

658
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,320
I will go and provoke it.

659
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,400
Okay, we will wait here.

660
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
Come to work right now.

661
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,000
Come with me.

662
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,120
What kind of trap is this?

663
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,760
Is he offline?

664
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,240
It's as simple as that.

665
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,720
What do you think?

666
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,320
He is pretending to run out of HP

667
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,920
to let us guard down.

668
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,720
Then he will revenge,

669
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,720
Looks like you were affected

670
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,200
by what happened last time a lot.

671
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
In this USB flash drive,

672
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,880
it is a collection of all the matches Ye Qiu played.

673
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,400
Go and play it on the screen so that everyone can see.

674
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,640
Is this thing even working?

675
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,280
Of course it is.

676
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,520
Wait.

677
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,320
Did I add

678
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,280
the side face of my God into it?

679
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,040
No. I need to check again.

680
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,440
It is about the competitions, not about his look.

681
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,560
What do you know?

682
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,120
Someone who plays Glory well

683
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,680
only has attractive techniques.

684
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,600
My God,

685
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,600
he also has charisma.
