00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,640
= The King's Avatar =

2
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,300
= Episode 6 =

3
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,080
First of all, all of us should be calm.

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,120
After attracting his main force,

5
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,440
we will surround the rest of the four when it's a good timing.

6
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,040
And then kill Su Mucheng and the other three.

7
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,880
Kill and win!

8
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,200
Come on, come on, come on!

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,960
OK, come on.

10
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Be happy. Be happy.

11
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,200
Remember, be happy!

12
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,000
Shaotian.

13
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,440
Remember the tactics.

14
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,040
Don't worry. Consider it done.

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,560
Players from both sides enter the competition map.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
The Team Competition between Jia Shi and Lan Yu will start right away!

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,760
Of the two strong and competitive teams,

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,520
Sun Xiang, Battlemage, Leaf of Autumn,

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,480
Swoksaar, Yu Wenzhou, Warlock

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,360
Su Mucheng, Laucher, Dancing Rain,

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,240
Huang Shaotian, Swordsman, Troubling Rain.

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,560
So what kind of spark will these four star players create?

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,520
A showdown between two strong teams.

24
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,800
What's important may not be personal strength.

25
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
It's teamwork.

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Sun has shown strong personal strength.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,720
How will he perform in the Team Competition?

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,080
Leaf of Autumn with Dragon Head Raising.

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,720
The momentum is still very strong.

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,680
After shooting Bullets Rain,

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
he aimed at Warlock Swoksaar.

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Bullets Rain stands up.

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
He interferes Leaf of Autumn's attack.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,640
Good job with the heat-sensitive missile! Two down!

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Now Troubling Rain, Battlemage,

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,920
Is aiming at the Sharpshooter of Jia Shi.

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,320
Both sides choose to send the strikers to the back row to disturb output.

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,120
Sun Xiang reacted very fast.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,120
Yu Wenzhou predicted well and pulled back the Qi Master.

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,160
So he escaped from the Draconic Crusher of Leaf of Autumn.

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
Sun's personal strength is strong.

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,200
He took control of the situation when against three players.

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,640
It is not what Lan Yu wants to see.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,680
Yes, we see that the blood volume of both sides is now equal.

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,400
So if this stalemate continues, Lan Yu is going to lose.

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Now we have a standoff here.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
= Jia Shi vs. Lan Yu =
Lan Yu's Qigong Master failed to protect the back row.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Swoksaar is still pinned down by Leaf of Autumn.

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,400
Lousy!

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,440
With continuous Stabbing, Leaf of Autumn hit Swoksaar.

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,560
Sun Xiang continues the momentum of one killing three.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
Sun Xiang, awesome!

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,400
Awesome? Lousy!

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,520
Unpack!

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,880
Lan Yu needs to adjust their paces now.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,280
All the Jia Shi players stride forward,

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
aiming to put continuous pressure on Lan Yu.

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,880
Jia Shi is going to lose.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
To lose?

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,880
Awesome! Wonderful!

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,200
We can see Sun Xiang is very brave and strong!

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,320
Who did you say was going to lose?

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,480
Maybe it'll be a lot worse.

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,120
You're right, now we see:

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,760
if Lan Yu does not make timely adjustments...

66
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,840
You said Jia Shi is going to lose?

67
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
Are you kidding?

68
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,080
He has taken the limelight now.

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,480
No, Jia Shi is going to lose.

70
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,200
Why?

71
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,840
Yu Wenzhou is using his trump-card tactics:

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,760
Lock-one & Release-four.

73
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,960
Unpack!

74
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,160
Will Lan Yu turn over to attack?

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,040
Hello, Xiang!

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
The induction course begins.

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,360
Get ready to fight against me!

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,200
Did you fight?

79
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,160
The account you are using now is divine.

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,280
Leaf of Autumn!

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
Could you show me Dragon Head Raising?

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,360
You can't?

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,520
How do you deserve to own the account?

84
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,600
How do you?

85
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Why don't you change your name?

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,640
Yi Sun Zhi Xiang!

87
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,960
Three-stage Chopping, Cyclone Chopping.

88
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,680
Go up, go up!

89
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,640
Three-stage Chopping.

90
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,960
I was teasing you. Chop!

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,080
Sun Xiang...

92
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,160
Do you really have no dignity?

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
The little puss-head doesn't seem to be as dedicated as you are.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry to say that to my little turtle...

95
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,280
Let me tell you something secretly.

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,080
Your master is only using one hand now.

97
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
One hand is not enough.

98
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm getting ready to kick.

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,880
Shut up and stand still!

100
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Who will be defeated?

101
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,160
Well, if you can, come after me.

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,360
You win if you can touch a single hair of mine.

103
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,840
What built up your confidence?

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
Just finished one-against-three.

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,760
To be honest, the one-against-three match was a gift for you.

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,680
Look how boastful you are!

107
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,760
The frog at the bottom of a well is better than you.

108
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,080
You know, when Master Ye won three consecutive championships,

109
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,440
you were still in the kindergarten playing with plasticine.

110
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,800
So you should have known where you rank on the list.

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,080
I'll kill you!

112
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,160
In fact, we all know that of all Lan Yu's tactics,

113
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
Huang Shaotian has never been the core.

114
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,480
But as an output core player, what should others do if you are boastful?

115
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,760
After losing the output point where Leaf of Autumn stood,

116
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,280
its team players are in an awkward situation.

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,040
Captain, return!

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,760
The cooperation between Lan Yu players is very tacit.

119
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
Under the leadership of Swoksaar,

120
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,680
four Lan Yu players surrounded four Jia Shi players.

121
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,200
A war of position is on the way.

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,240
This is not good.

123
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,720
Jia Shi's players were hidden from view among various skills.

124
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,360
Su Mucheng is rapidly losing blood.

125
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,840
In Lan Yu's tactics, Troubling Rain is the role of harvesting.

126
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,040
Therefore, he is not the core of tactics.

127
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,640
The current situation is what Lan Yu is willing to see.

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Chaotic Rain, Swoksaar and Yu Wenzhou

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,000
continue to suppress the blood volume of each other.

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,080
Except for Leaf of Autumn,

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,480
the blood volume of other Jia Shi players have dropped below 40%.

132
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,080
Director Li.

133
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,360
Is this Lock-one & Release-Four?

134
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,680
That's right.

135
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,160
It's exactly Lock-one & Release-Four.

136
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,920
How did you know Lan Yu would use...

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,360
Lock-one & Release-Four?

138
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,480
Because he is Yu Wenzhou.

139
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,600
A dirty heart.

140
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
Sun Xiang is still too young.

141
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
He has not figured out the tactics of the other side.

142
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,960
That's right.

143
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,640
Yu Wenzhou is indeed a master tactician.

144
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,160
At present, Lan Yu has great advantages.

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,360
Return quickly!

146
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,440
Jia Shi needs to stall things.

147
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
They need to wait for the captain.

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,360
Now Jia Shi is leaderless.

149
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,320
In this situation,

150
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,560
if no one can step up to take over the situation,

151
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,800
I think Jia Shi would lose the game.

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,760
Now pay attention! Beheading!

153
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,440
Cleric coming to cover with Shield Qigong!

154
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,080
Perfect gun shooting! Strong treatment!

155
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
Roger that.

156
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,160
After the treatment, blood is back.

157
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,080
Air Hood!

158
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,040
Good job!

159
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,800
Dancing Rain is leading others to shoot intensively.

160
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
Immediately killed the one with the lowest blood volume.

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,480
Guardian angel, Soul Speaker.

162
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,560
A substitute is now in.

163
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,680
At the critical moment,

164
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,120
Su Mucheng stepped up.

165
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Nice counterattack!

166
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,360
With such a disadvantage, she saved the situation.

167
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,880
The substitute fill the position quickly.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
Song Xiao, outflank!.

169
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,360
Don't let Su Mucheng break through.

170
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,000
The rest stay put. Get ready to unpack.

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,440
OK.

172
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,400
Seal!

173
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
It's a curse arrow.

174
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,960
Swoksaar began to sing.

175
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,840
Jia Shi's blood volume is already very low.

176
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,800
Quadra Kill!

177
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Incredible cooperation!

178
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,840
Meanwhile, count the damages.

179
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,480
Four were killed in a blink of an eye.

180
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,360
Jia Shi has performed very well in the front.

181
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,640
Without Leaf of Autumn, Dancing Rain could lead others and kill one.

182
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
Su Mucheng performed well!

183
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,320
Aced! The substitute is not in his position.

184
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,560
Leaf of Autumn is in danger! Jia Shi is in danger!

185
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,520
OK, Lan Yu is joined up with Troubling Rain.

186
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,920
Leaf of Autumn is facing a one-against-four situation.

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,400
Dear Xiang,

188
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,720
if you can't understand such a simple tactic,

189
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,040
you should amputate everything blow your eyebrows.

190
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,720
So go back to your kindergarten class.

191
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,120
Now you know the gap between you and Master Ye.

192
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
But Master Huang doesn't mind to continue the class for a while.

193
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,040
One last lesson for you.

194
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,040
It's about how to behave as a human.

195
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,440
Three.

196
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,880
Two.

197
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,760
One.

198
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,640
Leaf of Autumn was killed directly.

199
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,600
Now Jia Shi has only one substitute left.

200
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,960
= Huang Shaotian =
He has just arrived. But it's too late.

201
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Lan Yu conveniently killed the substitute.

202
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,760
Good.

203
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,400
Aced.

204
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,960
Congratulations, Lan Yu!

205
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,880
They won!

206
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
At the same time they destroyed Jia Shi.

207
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,720
Yes, Lan Yu, who didn't have a good start, won the game!

208
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,200
Due to the extra points of ace, Lan Yu won!

209
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,240
They played in a dirty way.

210
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,160
Welcome the players from the two teams

211
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,240
to shake hands and answer the curtain call.

212
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,320
Little classmate, your master will always be your master.

213
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,360
Su, pay attention to your diet.

214
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
Eat less.

215
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
Come on, congratulations.

216
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Great! Keep working hard.

217
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,320
Let's see each other next weekend.

218
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
Bye-bye.

219
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,600
Yu Wenzhou is really awesome.

220
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,680
With a team competition, he bounced back all of a sudden.

221
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,680
Starting with Sun Xiang's one-against-three,

222
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,560
it's all Yu Wenzhou's strategy.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
What?

224
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,120
A strategy letting the opponent win?

225
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,240
One-against-three is very exhausting.

226
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Sun Xiang was filled with extreme arrogance.

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
In the group war,

228
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,480
as long as Huang Shaotian moved slightly, Sun Xiang would explode.

229
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,120
Yu Wenzhou had got ready. Just waiting for the ace.

230
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,360
Didn't see you for days, I should look at you with special respect.

231
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,800
I admire you!

232
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,880
Network manager, where's the beer?

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Over there.

234
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,240
Our network manager really remembers the map of the net cafe?

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,240
Enough is enough.

236
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,880
You did it on purpose.

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Wait.

238
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,320
Ye Xiu, are you attacking the dungeon now?

239
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,240
Did you find anyone?

240
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,480
Not yet.

241
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,480
Ask him. He is a Swordsman.

242
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,760
Thanks, boss.

243
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,800
But...

244
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,200
My Swordsman will come to me.

245
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,120
Why is the guy so sneaky?

246
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
Something wrong with him.

247
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,800
Let's go.

248
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,480
Hello, hello.

249
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,360
Handsome!

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,880
Is there a network manager whose last name is Ye?

251
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,360
Yes?

252
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
And his name is alike... the former captain of Jia Shi.

253
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,640
Could you ask him to come here?

254
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,260
Handsome, could you say something to me?

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,440
I'm new here.

256
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,880
Such short answers! Cool!

257
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,360
I see.

258
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,240
Did Ye make you mad?

259
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,920
It's OK. I know him very well.

260
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,520
He's afraid of me. You ask him to come here.

261
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
I'll beat him.

262
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,840
Beat him?

263
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,080
Who are you?

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,520
Who am I? I am Huang Shao...

265
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,240
What about you, handsome?

266
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,040
I can understand how you feel.

267
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,880
Although said Lao Ye is mean, bad-mouthed and boastful,

268
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
he is as miserable as he looks.

269
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
So don't be mad at him.

270
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,280
Huang Shao...

271
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,600
I'll log in the computer for two hours.

272
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,680
Ye Qiu.

273
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm telling you, you're not a gentleman.

274
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
You have changed, Ye Qiu.

275
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,120
You didn't treat me like this before.

276
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,440
Could you be gentle with me?

277
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
OK, if you don't apologize to me...

278
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm leaving. Bye

279
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,280
Lao Ye was a captain before.

280
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,840
Now look at where he ended up.

281
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,680
Forget it. I won't hold grudges against him.

282
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
Lao Ye.

283
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
You've really determined to work as a network manager?

284
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,000
Is the decision too hasty?

285
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,640
Although you're still using the keyboard,

286
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,200
the calculator keyboard can't compete with our keyboard.

287
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,760
Don't forget you were a king.

288
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,160
And why did you retire secretly?

289
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,720
Is there any hidden secret?

290
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,920
Or did they bully you, use you, and dump you?

291
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,560
So you had internal conflicts.

292
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,840
If you talk nonsense again, I'll throw you into the trash can.

293
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,480
Lao Ye!

294
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,200
How could you treat me like that?

295
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,480
OK, then why did you ask me to come?

296
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
I don't have much time.

297
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,920
My schedule is full of training every single day!

298
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,680
If it weren't for our friendship, who'd listen to your mean words?

299
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Don't you feel a little warmth?

300
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,120
Can't you satisfy my curiosity?

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,880
Well...

302
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,040
If you really want to know, there is a way.

303
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,800
I'd do anything for you.

304
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,800
Tell me the password, now!

305
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,520
Ye Qiu is the most invincibly handsome.

306
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,320
I asked for the password. Why are you boasting?

307
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,640
Ye Qiu is the most invincibly handsome.

308
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,960
Enough is enough.

309
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm the only one who could tolerate with it.

310
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,240
Come on, did you hear me?

311
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,560
Shame on you.

312
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,560
This is the password, believe it or not.

313
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,040
Lao Ye, you have really degenerated!

314
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,840
You know... I am embarrassed to say it.

315
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,120
How could it be the password?

316
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,760
When did you become so childish?

317
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,560
I'm laughing my ass off!

318
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,520
Are you done laughing?

319
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,720
Get up if you are.

320
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,240
Isn't it just a Dungeon?

321
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,440
I can make it immediately.

322
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,680
You said the record of Boneyard is ridiculously high.

323
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,800
Who is so boring?

324
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
It's Jia Shi again.

325
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,320
Your relationship with Jia Shi has gone south.

326
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,560
You retired. They are still chasing you in Glory?

327
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,200
Wait.

328
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,050
What you would do is to offend them, right?

329
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,520
Would you help me or not?

330
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,720
Who was the captain?

331
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,880
Sun Xiang.

332
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,720
Well, I did not have enough fun in the alliance.

333
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,080
Master Huang would like to teach him a lesson again.

334
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,960
Pass me the account card.

335
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,440
Master Huang will defeat him and take away all his dignity.

336
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,960
No way! A 27-level Swordsman?

337
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,120
The worst of the worst.

338
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,760
How can I do it?

339
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,200
I'd lose my dignity if anyone found out.

340
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,640
What a shame!

341
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,320
You're guilty?

342
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,240
No...

343
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,560
There is no such word of "guilty" in my dictionary.

344
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,160
But...

345
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Five Jia Shi's professional players are on the other side.

346
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,480
Will the two of us...

347
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,280
I know you'd have a strategy.

348
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,160
But why is one missing?

349
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,200
Who is the fifth one?

350
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,880
They haven't confirmed it yet.

351
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,520
Hello, Su, guess who I am?

352
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,680
Did you miss me?

353
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,000
I've come to visit Lao Ye.

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,280
Come visit us when you're free.

355
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,600
By the way, any inside info?

356
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,520
- Why is Jia Shi so lousy? - Step aside.

357
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,720
Mucheng, enter the Dungeon at 3 o'clock.

358
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,000
Mucheng...

359
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
The captain asked you to have the resumption meeting in the seminar room.

360
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,840
When?

361
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,640
Now.

362
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,680
Why hasn't Su come yet?

363
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,800
Jia Shi is not far from here.

364
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,400
Women never keep their time.

365
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,200
She is never late.

366
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,160
Maybe something came up.

367
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,520
She's not coming?

368
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,440
What should we do?

369
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
We need one more.

370
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,360
Who?

371
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,800
I contacted someone in Lanxi Pavilion.

372
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Who is it from Lanxi Pavilion?

373
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,200
Master of the 10th District of Lanxi Pavilion.

374
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,960
The guild master?

375
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,520
Is he reliable?

376
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,800
You're not famous. Nothing would go wrong.

377
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm not famous?

378
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,200
- Listen. I'm very... - Afraid of Yu Wenzhou? Everyone knows it.

379
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,520
No, I mean I keep a low-key to avoid public panic.

380
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,400
But...

381
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Lao Ye, tell me the truth.

382
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
Will he keep it as a secret?

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,160
Will he bring trouble to me?

384
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,640
Make a guess.

385
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,160
I'd better shut up.

386
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
If there is no problem, you can enter in ten seconds.

387
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,520
Start.

388
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Lan He increase output.

389
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
Han Yanrou, pay attention to cooling time.

390
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,960
Bao Zi, shoot more accurately.

391
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,720
Make a way with flowing water. I'll eliminate all monsters.

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,760
Stay close.

393
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Push ahead with all strength.

394
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,720
Lao Ye, we can't take any advantage of anything.

395
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,240
After all, the two rookies are not skilled.

396
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,120
But Jia Shi sent professional players.

397
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,920
What do I do?

398
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,720
Lao Ye, we can't fight like this.

399
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,960
What should I do? We're running out of time.

400
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,880
Think about it.

401
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,800
What?

402
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,040
What the hell are you throwing?

403
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,920
Stop attacking.

404
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,280
Throw all the monsters in the air as fast as you can.

405
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Stuck them in stone cracks.

406
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,480
The strike time will be reduced by 4 seconds.

407
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,800
Killing monsters is not the goal, winning is.

408
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
How crappy the Dungeon record is!

409
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,360
Jun Moxiao is an attacking machine?

410
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,440
They are making new Dungeon records in turns!

411
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,280
Today, it's Lanxi Pavilion again.

412
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Lanxi Pavilion is the most powerful in Glory.

413
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,040
We should apply to join it.

414
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,040
Lanxi Pavilion is shameless!

415
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
They always ask experts to help them.

416
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
Who doesn't ask for help?

417
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,680
Exactly!

418
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,160
Such a shameless guild should be expelled from District 10!

419
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,360
Banning Lanxi Pavilion from summoning Jun Moxiao, the master of Dungeons!

420
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,040
Maybe all guilds are fighting for Jun Moxiao.

421
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,040
With the master joining them, they'll get new records.

422
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,800
Congratulations to the 10th district players: Jun Moxiao, Liu Mu,

423
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,520
Bao Zi, Han Yanrou, and Lan He..

424
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,280
They broke the record of Boneyard.

425
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,000
The time is 16 minutes 24.67 seconds.

426
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,960
Yeah!

427
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,560
Our Lanxi Pavilion has won again!

428
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,920
What a great performance!

429
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,960
Crazy again?

430
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,560
Come and see my master's great performance.

431
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,160
The record is broken again?

432
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,560
- Amazing! - How did this happen?

433
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,520
Look.

434
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,800
They stuck the monsters in stone cracks.

435
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,120
On average, 4 seconds are reduced when fighting monsters.

436
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,160
Great!

437
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,320
Look!

438
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,560
Weapons capable of changing forms?

439
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,720
This is the peak of Glory, isn't it?

440
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,360
From today on, this person belongs to our Lanxi Pavilion.

441
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Yeah!

442
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,720
Yesterday, in the 8th round of Glory Professional Alliance,

443
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,000
Jia Shi was defeated by Lan Yu.

444
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,080
Coming More details.

445
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,400
We have performed lousy in several competitions.

446
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,440
Should we restore ourselves?

447
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,080
Yes.

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,520
Yes.

449
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,280
You guys were lousy.

450
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,680
It has nothing to do with me.

451
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,040
Jia Shi team and Jia Shi Captain are always viewed as a whole.

452
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,440
Not now.

453
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,170
= Jia Shi =
When I was soloing with others in the front,

454
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,450
what are you doing back there?
= Jia Shi =

455
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:13,480
= Jia Shi =

456
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,120
Should I kick off all Lan Yu players? Only then could you win.

457
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
If it weren't for my points gained by one-against-three,

458
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,960
what could you bring to Jia Shi?

459
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,520
The four of us...

460
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,160
fighting against one of them...

461
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,640
It is you who should introspect yourselves.

462
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
On what grounds?

463
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,080
He's got all the limelight.

464
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,600
Congratulations to the 10th district players: Jun Moxiao,

465
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,120
Liu Mu, Bao Zi, Han Yanrou, and Lan He.

466
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,130
They broke the record of Boneyard...

467
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,360
How is it possible?

468
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,400
All right, I've helped you attack Dungeons.

469
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,320
The record is broken.

470
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,280
I've done so many things for you.

471
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,330
Could you share some inside info about you and Jia Shi?

472
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,920
What would you like to drink?

473
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,120
No need. I know it.

474
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,520
Let me guess what you want to drink now.

475
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,120
How do you like soda?

476
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,480
No?

477
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,760
Is it because you were bitterly disappointed

478
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,440
so you could only give up in tears?

479
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,760
How about this?

480
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,800
Wait. It's sour. Not suitable for your bitter mood.

481
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,480
Freshly brewed coffee?

482
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
You mean the mean guys in Jia Shi kicked you out?

483
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
They used you.

484
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,760
That's why you want to run away, right?

485
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,440
There are many people here.

486
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,200
Don't expose the identity of Blade Master 'cause people know your voice,

487
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,360
But did I...

488
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,680
Well, now you're having problems with my identity.

489
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm leaving now.

490
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,560
Don't you regret it.

491
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,680
OK, bye.

492
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,280
So...

493
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,840
Your bark is much worse than your bite...

494
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,040
You would treat me nicely, right?

495
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
10 yuan for the internet and 20 yuan for coffee.

496
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

497
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,800
I didn't even drink it.

498
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,600
You deserve the best. Now, pay the bill.

499
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,960
You are so mean!

500
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,360
I'm really broke now.

501
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,040
I'll give you the money.  I will.

502
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,720
Do you know that you are being extremely disgusting?

503
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,240
In the future, we should part our ways.

504
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,680
Don't come with me.

505
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,560
If I come to you again, I'll take your last name!

506
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,440
Farewell!

507
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,720
Three, two, one.

508
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,680
Ye Shaotian is back.

509
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,960
No, I'm looking for change, not for you.

510
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,600
Why don't you buy more drinks for 70 yuan?

511
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:30,760
No, I want to pay you to take a walk with me.

512
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,080
Lao Ye.

513
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,480
Lao Ye...

514
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,590
Do you know what your retirement means?

515
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,040
I don't.

516
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,480
You do?

517
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,560
You don't?

518
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
Retiring means one year later,

519
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,840
if you want to rely on your previous fame to come back,

520
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,920
no team will ever recruit you again.

521
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,960
Only convenience stores will greet to you: Welcome!

522
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,080
Do you understand?

523
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,320
You don't know?

524
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,400
It made sense.

525
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:19,040
Working in a 24/7 convenience store would be my only consolation.

526
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,960
Ye Qiu, wait!

527
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,590
I'm talking to you very seriously now.

528
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
You told me something before.

529
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,320
A veteran in Glory like you should cherish every second and minute.

530
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,280
But what are you doing now?

531
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
If you wasted a whole year...

532
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
your hands would not know how to use your skills.

533
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Every day now is more precious to me.

534
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,480
I want to finish something I must do.

535
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,560
But I never had a chance to do it.

536
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,840
What is it?

537
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,160
I have a good friend.

538
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,480
If he were still alive,

539
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,320
he must be one of the greatest masters in Glory.

540
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,400
He has a work of genius.

541
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,040
Are you talking about your umbrella?

542
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,840
Yes.

543
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,840
I'd like to revive the thousand-machine umbrella.

544
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,520
With it, I will add more excitement to Glory.

545
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,320
Wait, what did you say?

546
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,280
Adding more excitement to the Glory?

547
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,280
Glory veterans like me...

548
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,080
should cherish every single day.

549
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,240
And every single second.

550
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,920
Not waste any time.

551
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,080
Really? Say it again?

552
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
I am a professional player.

553
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,760
Lao Ye, you've got a detailed plan to return, right?

554
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,760
What do you think?

555
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,040
Ye Qiu!

556
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,120
Welcome!

557
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,640
I look forward to seeing you next time.

558
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,200
I knew it! You won't...

559
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,600
...leave so easily...

560
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,520
Wait for me.

561
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,400
Is your captain Yu Wenzhou looking for you?

562
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,400
Answer it quickly. If you don't, something big will happen.

563
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,080
What are you talking about? What will happen?

564
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,760
Don't underestimate me.

565
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,100
I'm proving my ranking to you by standing here.

566
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,850
So...

567
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,800
You didn't slip out of the hotel by walking through the fire escape?

568
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,400
Nope.

569
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,920
I escaped from the staff passage.

570
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,720
And...

571
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

572
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,320
Actually, it's good to be afraid of the captain.

573
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,080
Who would I be afraid of?

574
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,760
You don't believe it, do you?

575
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,400
My unruly soul...

576
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,280
...will make great achievements sooner or later!

577
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,480
Wait! Wait!

578
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,680
Lao Ye, do you think...

579
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,120
...the scene looks familiar?

580
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,360
Take a look.

581
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,360
Catch that unruly guy!

582
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,000
He got a nerve!

583
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,920
How dared he escape from the training camp?

584
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,040
Look here!

585
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,160
Anything?

586
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,800
No.

587
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,480
Anything there?

588
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,360
Nothing.

589
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,080
Come on, let's search over there.

590
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,600
OK.

591
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,240
We must catch him today.

592
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,600
He got a nerve!

593
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,240
OK.

594
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,520
Mr. Ye, why are you here?

595
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,800
Are you here to help me?

596
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,080
Helping my students is the bounden duty of every teacher.

597
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,320
Awesome. Thank you!

598
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,960
What's going on over there?

599
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,000
Go over there and have a look.

600
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,960
OK.

601
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,800
See? If it were not me...

602
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,960
you would be done.

603
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,120
Mr. Ye, you are really a good man.

604
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,200
I know you are different from other teachers in the training camp.

605
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
Look how tall you are!

606
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
Full of the brilliance of human nature!

607
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,400
Especially Mr. Han...

608
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,440
He's so mean!

609
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,640
As ruthless as a Tyrannosaurus rex.

610
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,760
Do you think...

611
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,840
Mr. Ye...

612
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
From now on, I'll be vigilant when meeting teachers.

613
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,680
I am not afraid of them at all!

614
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,400
Believe me.

615
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,320
My unruly soul...

616
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,560
...will make great achievements sooner or later.

617
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,840
But...

618
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,760
You've done a really brave job!

619
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,560
You'd rather sacrifice yourself than protect the students.

620
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,000
But if I remember correctly...

621
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,800
Dear Mr. Ye...

622
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,800
in the next two months...

623
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,320
was wearing a plaster cast when teaching.

624
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,800
You wanna know how it feels wearing a plaster cast?

625
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,280
Stop!

626
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,320
Should be faster.

627
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,120
You are here, Shaotian.

628
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,520
Let's go and train.

629
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Captain.

630
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,320
Why did you call me so late?

631
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,320
You're all here.

632
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,160
What's up? I was asleep.

633
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,440
Let me show you a video. Lan He just sent it.

634
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,960
The Dungeon record of the 10th district.

635
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,280
Why should we look at it?

636
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,800
Captain... I don't know why...

637
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,320
I fall asleep easily... Maybe it's what my body needs.

638
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,400
Could I look at it tomorrow?

639
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Good night. Good night.

640
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,600
You did not answer the phone in your room, right?

641
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,800
I did.

642
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,080
Captain, you know...

643
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,400
I like watching TV when I sleep.

644
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,600
So there might be some noise.

645
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,600
I'd try to fall asleep without turning the TV on.

646
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,900
It seems we have to talk about the TV thing tomorrow.

647
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,600
Don't put it off till tomorrow.

648
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,400
In this technical room, we should talk about something serious.

649
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,360
What Dungeon did you just say, captain?

650
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,400
Boneyard.

651
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,840
Boneyard?

652
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The record time was 16 minutes 24.67 seconds.

653
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,080
It is definitely abnormal!

654
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,320
It was fast.

655
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,600
But there was a new strategy in there.

656
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,480
A Swordsman and a Freelancer worked together.

657
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,880
Seems familiar?

658
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,640
No.

659
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,120
We don't have any Freelancer, do we?

660
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,560
Anyone? Freelancer?

661
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,000
But we have Swordsmen.

662
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,560
You! The Swordsman!

663
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,840
You performed well as a Berserker?

664
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,360
Should I worry?

665
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,440
Three-stage chopping!

666
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,760
Five-stage chopping now!

667
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,880
You don't get it?

668
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,400
Idiot!

669
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,640
What you care is food every day.

670
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,560
Come on. You idiot!

671
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,080
Captain, what did you just say?

672
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,120
Speaking of which, look...

673
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,640
Silver Blade and Green Guns worked together smoothly.

674
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,520
The cooperation between the two men is very tacit.

675
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,120
They must have known each other for long.

676
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,800
Yes.

677
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,640
Look at this guy. His name is...

678
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,600
Bao Zi, the Invader!

679
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,120
What a name!

680
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,040
He should work with Jiao Zi.

681
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,760
The two of them can make a breakfast.

682
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,840
I am not talking about this person.

683
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,360
I'm talking about Liu...

684
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,120
Han Yanrou.

685
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,440
This name sounds enlightening.

686
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,960
But I seriously suspect it could be a man...

687
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,120
How do you pronounce these two words?

688
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,440
Liu Mu, this must be a master!

689
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,360
And I'm sure he's weak!

690
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,320
He must be lousy!

691
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,040
On the contrary, Jiao Zi... He could be great.

692
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,440
I don't think so.

693
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,280
Don't you?

694
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,080
I think Liu Mu, as a Swordsman...

695
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,920
could seize each opportunity the Freelancer created.

696
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,000
From this point of view...

697
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,560
He is an opportunist.

698
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,920
I have only seen it in one person...

699
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,840
Don't you think it's very similar to you?

700
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,800
Is it?

701
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,600
Isn't it?

702
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,600
Must be a fan of mine.

703
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,920
They were mimicking my strategy.

704
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,360
Captain, I know why you asked me here at such a late time.

705
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,120
I will not be surpassed by them.

706
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
You don't need to worry.

707
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,040
I will work hard.

708
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,920
Believe me, OK?

709
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,800
This fan is you, right?

710
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,280
Be honest.

711
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,320
Sit closer.

712
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,120
Closer.

713
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,640
Three, two...

714
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,080
Am I so scary?

715
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,120
No.

716
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,840
About the TV thing...

717
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,120
Captain, I did it only for one time...

718
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,840
I think...

719
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,620
I will not ask...

720
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,440
Really?

721
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,840
Captain...

722
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,880
You're so kind!

723
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,880
Sorry. You have a bigger heart than I do!

724
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,560
I'm so excited.

725
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,000
You must tell me honestly what I do want to know.

726
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,400
OK. I will for sure.

727
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,560
The Freelancer who were with you...

728
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
What weapon was he using?

729
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,520
An umbrella.

730
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,000
What's its name?

731
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,640
A thousand-machine umbrella.

732
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,120
Specs?

733
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,000
Attacking speed: 5. A silver equipment.

734
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,040
Although there are no special specs...

735
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,640
it almost covers all forms of the professions.

736
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,800
How is Ye Qiu these days?

737
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,640
He is now working as...

738
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,520
I don't know much about it.

739
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,120
Jun Moxiao is Ye Qiu, right?

740
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,920
Is he?

741
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Isn't he?

742
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,120
Yes...

743
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,280
Do I need to continue?

744
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,600
Captain, listen...

745
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,120
It's him. He asked me to attack the Dungeon with him...

746
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
I said no.

747
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,440
Then he threatened and tempted me...

748
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,320
Then he said he wanted to finish something and revive an umbrella...

749
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,360
And said he would add some excitement to Glory...

750
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,840
- I told him not to do it... - Wait a minute.

751
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,120
He really said that?

752
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,840
His words were...

753
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,280
I will add more excitement in Glory.

754
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,120
That's what he said. He was serious.

755
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,640
I'd be Sun Xiang if I lied...

756
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,960
Sorry, Lao Ye.

757
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,640
You had time to attack Dungeons after the competition.

758
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,480
It seems that you don't get enough training.

759
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,040
Captain, did you just say we'd turn over a new leaf?

760
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,240
You'll keep your promise, right?

761
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,080
No.

762
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,280
Unless...

763
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,120
Unless what?

764
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,120
You go find a thousand-machine umbrella.

765
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,640
It's stealing...

766
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,560
Captain, isn't it shameless?

767
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,760
Look. Lan Yu has always been aboveboard.

768
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,360
Is it...

769
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,280
How can this be shameless?

770
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,320
We'll just borrow it for research purposes.

771
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,080
We will return it when it's done.

772
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,840
By the way, you may not be able to beat him.

773
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
Captain, you should be responsible for what you say.

774
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,320
I can't beat him?

775
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,960
Listen to me.

776
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,810
I'll beat his umbrella into a stick in minutes.

777
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,920
Three hours. I'll wait for you.

778
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,750
Only three hours?

779
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,230
When would you finish the training camp competition with me,

780
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,150
Ye Qiu?
