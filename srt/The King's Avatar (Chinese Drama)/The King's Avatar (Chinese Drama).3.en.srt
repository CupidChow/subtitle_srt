= Episode 3 =

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,160
Play it now for everyone.

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,840
OK.

5
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,560
Wait.

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,640
Did I take a good picture of

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,520
the master's side face?

8
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,160
Damn it!

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,480
Let's me check it again.

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,560
It's the Match Highlights that we want to watch, not your idol.

11
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,760
What do you know about it?

12
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,960
Playing well

13
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
is just the technical charm.

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,080
The master

15
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,600
also has personality charm.

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,040
It can't be.

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
I remember clearly

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,400
the photo was put in this document.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Why can't I find it now?

20
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
I have made up my mind.

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,160
In order to reduce the possibility of failure,

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,560
let's attack him

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,640
when he is running out of HP.

24
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
Teammate can immune to our attack.

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,920
What's the point attacking him?

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
How about using stones?

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,160
Stone damage is neutral damage.

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
As long as we use stone properly.

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
It will surely cost his HP.

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
It's here. I found it.

31
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,840
Here you are.

32
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,920
Something goes wrong.

33
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,000
I forgot that this TV

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,680
cannot read the disk.

35
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
I remember this TV has a high-end interface,

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,600
and can be connected to this computer.

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,960
Can you finish your words all at once?

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,480
Who is the boss here?

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,800
You are.

40
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,440
Then you do it.

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,520
Lazy boy.

42
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,720
I...

43
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,440
Come on, come on, come on.

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
Sliding shovel.

45
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
A 180-degree sweep.

46
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Really classic. No one can repeat it.

47
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,440
Come on.

48
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,480
What the hell.

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,360
Come on, come on.

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
Awesome.

51
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,080
Jun Moxiao.

52
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,840
What is this guy doing?

53
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,280
Not bad.

54
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
Sand throwing.

55
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Green guns.

56
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Four thorns in the air.

57
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,960
He plays just like Ye Qiu.

58
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,400
Ye Xiu. Ye Qiu.

59
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,320
Can he be Ye Qiu?

60
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,000
Impossible.

61
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
Chen Guo, what are you thinking?

62
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,640
Congratulations to the player,

63
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,600
Jun Moxiao...

64
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,080
Done with it.

65
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,680
Great!

# there is always hope rising from desperation #

74
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,680
A copy task

75
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
that can't be more simple

76
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
makes me find

77
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
my long-lost enthusiasm.

78
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,840
It's like being back to my youth.

79
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
Encouraging words, smiles

80
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,080
and goals

81
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,680
will all inspire my desire for victory.

82
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,800
I want to know

83
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,600
did you do it deliberately, purposely

84
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
or intentionally.

85
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
Boss, save your words.

86
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,600
Just pick up your account book,

87
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,920
and deduct my salary as much as you want.

88
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
I absolutely have no objection.

89
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,960
You know what? Youu have played so well.

90
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,440
You played just like Ye Qiu.

91
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,160
You've earned me a reputation.

92
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
That's right.

93
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
I seem like to be possessed by Ye Qiu.

94
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
That was a good fight.

95
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,320
He is my network manager.

96
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,840
The copy he just played

97
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,800
is really nothing.

98
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,160
Oh, he is the loyal fan of Ye Qiu you have found.

99
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Playing very good.

100
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,680
If you want to pass the probation period,

101
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
just cooperate with me.

102
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,760
I love Ye Qiu. Ye Qiu loves me.

103
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,920
Sometimes,

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
I even think I am Ye Qiu himself.

105
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,960
You really have the style of Ye Qiu in those days.

106
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,560
Right?

107
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,360
Boss, good choice.

108
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
It's nothing, nothing.

109
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,520
To be my network manager,

110
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,040
just two requirements.

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,880
First, have a name like Ye Qiu.

112
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,680
Second, play the Glory like Ye Qiu.

113
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
Good on you.

114
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,840
Waiting for your next visit.

115
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,520
How about the probation period?

116
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,760
You have passed it.

117
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,640
Can you also make a discount on the money I owe?

118
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,800
Discount? Sure.

119
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,240
Let me give you a 120% discount.

120
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,520
The debt has risen by 20%.

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,080
Keep smiling or

122
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,560
the probation period continues.

123
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,120
Keep it.

124
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
You wrote this?

125
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,680
Although you are now an intern at the magazine,

126
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,120
as a future journalist,

127
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,880
you must be objective.

128
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
I am objective.

129
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,680
You have stated clearly in your article that

130
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,000
Ye Qiu was forced to retire.

131
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
Jia Shi made Ye Qiu left

132
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
to protect there interests,

133
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Do you have any evidence?

134
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,440
Ye Qiu loves Glory so much.

135
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,240
It is impossible for him to choose to retire suddenly.

136
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,080
As you know, Jia Shi has two money-spinners,

137
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,840
Ye Qiu and Leaf of Autumn.

138
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,040
But the benefits

139
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,600
are far less than

140
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,680
a captain of a second-tier team.

141
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
I've heard people say before that

142
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,766
Jia Shi's senior officials

143
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,080
have long been dissatisfied with Ye Qiu.

144
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,640
Can this rumor

145
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,120
be regarded as evidence for news?

146
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,600
But...

147
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,200
I know you are a loyal fan of Ye Qiu.

148
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,480
But remember,

149
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
as a reporter

150
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,360
you should also stick to the bottom line of news.

151
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
You should learn from me.

152
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,080
No matter how great the reputation

153
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,320
was given to Ye Qiu by others,

154
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
I only stick to one principle.

155
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,440
Listen to him personally, then you can write the truth.

156
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,320
Director Cao.

157
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
I remember that you know Ye Qiu.

158
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,080
Can you introduce him to me?

159
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,240
So I can interview him.

160
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,760
After I checked with him,

161
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,000
I will know the truth.

162
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,120
Stop dreaming.

163
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
I have known him for eight years,

164
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,720
and haven't seen his face.

165
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,440
Didn't you interview him before?

166
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,200
Don't you know there is something

167
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,280
called QQ in this world?

168
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,160
What do you think of this form?

169
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,240
No, it won't work.

170
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,560
Not right. Let me do it.

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,360
You haven't tried it. How would you know.

172
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,720
I just knew it.

173
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Try to set the cannon on it.

174
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
And try this cannon again.

175
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,760
You two behave so well today.

176
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,720
After sweeping the floor, washing the clothes

177
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,240
and cooking the meal, then we can play the computer.

178
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Your instructions are orders we must follow, right?

179
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,720
Who washed it?

180
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,400
- Me - Me.

181
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,040
When did you wash it?

182
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
I washed it, not you.

183
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,520
Definitely, I did it!

184
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,960
Are you sure?

185
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,160
I am sure.

186
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,000
It's me.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,480
You...

188
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Why did you wash it

189
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,320
with black pants?

190
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,560
Come on, what are you drawing?

191
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,040
Let her change into this.

192
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,760
Are you sure?

193
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,800
Don't worry.

194
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,840
We got you a T-shirt.

195
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
This black stain

196
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,680
will be the most beautiful label of this T-shirt.

197
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,120
Unique T-shirt

198
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,440
for the unique you.

199
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,880
What exactly are you drawing here?

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,640
It's a

201
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,320
melancholy kitty.

202
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
Melancholy kitty, this way, please. This way, please.

203
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,400
Look at the camera, look at the lens.

204
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,560
Three, two, one.

205
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,080
Talking about the acquaintance with Mu Qiu,

206
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,320
I should thanks to the gravity

207
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
that sends me a lucky coin.

208
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,240
My lucky coin.

209
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,320
Wait.

210
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,920
Don't!

211
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
That's mine.

212
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
What?

213
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,480
Lucky coin.

214
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,120
Isn't that just a video game coin?

215
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,520
It is a birthday present from my sister.

216
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,240
Beat me and I'll give you ten more.

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
If you lose,

218
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
think of it as a gift to me.

219
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,680
Why are you so unreasonable?

220
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,960
Same interests

221
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,160
make us good brothers sharing weal and woe.

222
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,480
My frivolous youth, my ambition,

223
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,080
and all my glory are related to him.

224
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,520
I will take the thousand-machine umbrella

225
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,160
and return to the top of Glory.

226
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,508
= Upgrade =

227
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,440
What's going on?

228
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,680
How did this happen on the stage?

229
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,960
I always thought that winning is

230
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,520
the only thing that matters in life.

231
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,640
So I don't allow mistakes,

232
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,640
don't accept failure,

233
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,760
and starting all over again.

234
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,160
I will only choose to leave.

235
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,080
Tang, I am reviewing my lessons.

236
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,040
So I missed your phone.

237
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,160
Guoguo, I have got off the plane.

238
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,640
Now, I am on my way to the net cafe.

239
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,720
An interlude during examination

240
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,560
became the beginning of my friendship with Guoguo.

241
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,240
What are you doing?

242
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,280
Fighting thief.

243
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,360
Stop.

244
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,120
Are you OK?

245
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,800
I'm OK.

246
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,360
Get up.

247
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,120
I have to go first. Thank you.

248
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,000
You are welcome.

249
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,120
Your bag.

250
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
A mistake

251
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,000
gave us the chance to meet again.

252
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,600
This net cafe was left by Guoguo's father

253
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,280
after he died.

254
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,440
Carrying on her father's career

255
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,080
and making it better

256
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,960
become her life belief.

257
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
And I became

258
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,040
a great devil who urged her to learn and improve.

259
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
The rules remain the same.

260
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,160
Of course.

261
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I will be strict on you.

262
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,520
Come on.

263
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
Tang, look at this.

264
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,560
I really finished my homework. Look.

265
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,200
Is she the boss's best friend?

266
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,120
No.

267
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,640
Old enemy?

268
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Got it. A best friend like an old enemy.

269
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,680
Little bastard.

270
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Network Manager, your old enemy is calling you.

271
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,240
Come here.

272
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,080
Just a little stupid.

273
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
Take the luggage up.

274
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,080
Tang, let's go.

275
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,600
Don't worry.

276
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,880
And this.

277
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,120
Take it too, OK? Not heavy.

278
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
OK.

279
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,280
Let's go, Tang.

280
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,640
Go.

281
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,640
The word exercise book?

282
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,040
I almost ate it with the meal.

283
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,560
You know what?

284
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,280
If you give me a basin now...

285
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
If you give me a basin now,

286
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,760
I can spit out ink.

287
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,760
Well done.

288
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,520
Tong, don't worry.

289
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,880
This year, I will definitely pass it.

290
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,560
Guoguo.

291
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
This year, you have made a great progress.

292
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
Tang, since you left,

293
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,400
268 days have passed.

294
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,920
And I have studied for 267 days.

295
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Why is it one day short?

296
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,440
It is today.

297
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,440
Because you are here,

298
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,240
I must accompany you.

299
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Tang, don't you miss me?

300
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,240
A milk tea shop opened nearby.

301
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
It is very popular on the Internet.

302
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,400
There is a long queue every day.

303
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,320
Reasonable rest is called relaxation.

304
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,800
Unreasonable rest is called laziness.

305
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm not lazy. I am...

306
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,480
Ms. Chen Guo.

307
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,680
Tang, you must believe me.

308
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,440
Boss, I've brought it up

309
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,160
He, it's him.

310
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,160
He is the reason of my laziness.

311
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,120
Tang, let me tell you something.

312
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,640
He seems to be a nameless network manager,

313
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,920
but he played Glory so well.

314
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,960
I lost every time without strength to fight back.

315
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,800
Well, I'm responsible for studying.

316
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,720
You are responsible for the challenge.

317
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,120
Defeat this little network manager

318
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,000
and get back my reputation.

319
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Boss, I have to go first.

320
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,920
Let's talk.

321
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,280
Please go talk to Tang.

322
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Just ten minutes.

323
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,360
I have one page of homework to do.

324
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,680
Earn some time for me to make it up.

325
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
I'm afraid of being injured by mistake.

326
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,920
Do as I said

327
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,760
and the debts between us will be written off.

328
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,640
What if it doesn't work?

329
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,640
Then you will be a dead man.

330
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,320
At this moment of self-examination,

331
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,840
no one can be a stumbling block to her.

332
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,680
I really don't want to play Glory with others.

333
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,960
The boss is my best opponent.

334
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,160
Why?

335
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,840
She has been losing and I have been winning.

336
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,760
What a good feeling it is to play Glory like this.

337
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,320
If she can beat me once,

338
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
I wouldn't have

339
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,240
made her my sandbag.

340
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,640
Guoguo, turn on the computer.

341
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,160
Give me the card and let's play Glory.

342
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,320
You will lose.

343
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,280
Continue?

344
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,520
Not the end yet.

345
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,880
It's just so boring.

346
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,240
It should be over.

347
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,960
Done.

348
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,680
This PK is interesting, isn't it?

349
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,000
I finished today's review as scheduled.

350
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,440
But Tang seems to have some problems.

351
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,480
Many people will continue to do something

352
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,720
because it's easy.

353
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,000
But Tang is the opposite.

354
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,480
When she encounters something difficult to deal with,

355
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,520
there is no need to say anything more.

356
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
She will spare no effort to go on.

357
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,320
Rush up.

358
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,560
The keyboard keeps clicking.

359
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,720
My little Tang.

360
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,600
Does her heart of victory and defeat rise again?

361
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,840
You're kidding me.

362
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,560
Wait, another round.

363
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,840
No, it's been ten rounds.

364
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,800
There is no meaning to continue.

365
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,120
Your operation is quite fast.

366
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
But the coordination of left and right hands is in a mess.

367
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,640
Adaptability and judgment to perspective change

368
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,600
is basically zero.

369
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,080
The Glory of the world is just so.

370
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,120
You may defeat me 100 years later.

371
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,800
You are a little too much.

372
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Sorry, it's a little too much.

373
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,960
A hundred years

374
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,440
is just an exaggerated description.

375
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
It doesn't really take that long.

376
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,600
Off duty.

377
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,680
Tang.

378
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,120
Don't be unhappy. Smile.

379
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,920
Forget him.

380
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,040
He is a man saying whatever he likes.

381
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,560
Guoguo.

382
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
Open an account for me.

383
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,800
What?

384
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,640
Are you sure?

385
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
I want to use what he is best at

386
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,320
to defeat him personally.

387
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,720
In this Glory PK,

388
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,640
I am sure to win.

389
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,600
Will it work?

390
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Come on!

391
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,520
Come on!

392
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,280
Use the great skill.

393
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,160
Wouldn't it be nice to use it earlier?

394
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,720
Yeah.

395
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Hello, Guild master.

396
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,240
Guild master.

397
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,960
Coffee.

398
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,400
Since the opening of the 10th district,

399
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,720
a total of 12 first-time killings were recorded.

400
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
Zhong Caotang guild and Ambitions achieved four respectively.

401
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,680
And Lanxi Pavilion

402
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,800
only achieved one by far.

403
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,240
Meeting starts.

404
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,160
According to the current situation,

405
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,720
I'm afraid we are away from the target we have set

406
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,120
for a little distance.

407
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,680
Xi Zhou,

408
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,720
Is it real that we have only achieved one?

409
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,560
Why don't you stick all of it?

410
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,760
Why don't you stick all of it?

411
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,120
But fortunately, we are still rich in rare materials.

412
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,080
And the number of members is also steadily rising.

413
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,600
There are 82 more members today than yesterday.

414
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,040
Do you know

415
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,640
what's the ranking of Lan Yu in the league?

416
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,440
Do you know double-digit increase in membership

417
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,320
is not enough for such an ace team.

418
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,720
Do I have to do everything myself?

419
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,760
All of you should have a deep reflection.

420
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:53,926
= Apply to add Jun Moxiao as a friend =

421
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,200
What?

422
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,520
Guild master, It's time to hold the meeting.

423
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,520
Wait for a moment.

424
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Guild master, everyone is here.

425
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
On the guild plan for the construction of 10th District,

426
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,360
what suggestions do you have?

427
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Guild master.

428
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,680
There is an expert named Jun Moxiao in 10th district

429
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,480
who has taken three first kills these days.

430
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,960
And he hasn't joined any guild yet.

431
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
How about soliciting him.

432
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,440
We are having a meeting.

433
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,680
Soliciting experts?

434
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,760
Don't you all call yourselves experts every day?

435
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,960
How do we still need to recruit others to help.

436
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,302
If there is a problem,

437
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:15,800
you don't look for the reason from yourself,

438
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,640
but think about looking for exteral aids.

439
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,000
What kind of mentality do you have?

440
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,680
Besides, is this Ju Moxiao an expert?

441
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,400
He is just lucky.

442
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,880
Nowadays, there are two reasons for

443
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
those playing Glory without joining a guild.

444
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,320
It can be that

445
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,120
they can't play well.

446
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,360
Or there is something wrong with their characters

447
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,400
and guilds don't want them.

448
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,840
Beyond the two reasons,

449
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,000
then he must be a spy.

450
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,440
Lanxi Pavilion,

451
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,560
a guild for Lan Yu team

452
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,520
that fights for professional team to get materials,

453
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
has enormous potentiality.

454
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,920
They must own a sufficient stock of rare materials.

455
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,560
My rare materials

456
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,000
will soon deliver itself to me.

457
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,720
Jun Moxiao added me.

458
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,760
Jun, what?

459
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,960
Added me.

460
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,520
You just said he was a spy.

461
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,640
Did I say that?

462
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
The meeting is not over yet.

463
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,960
I just said this Jun Moxiao

464
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,360
maybe a spy.

465
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,200
It's just a possibility.

466
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,480
It needs to be proved.

467
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
We don't know until we have confirmed it.

468
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,200
All in all,

469
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,680
all of you should learn from me.

470
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,120
How can you just talk to solicit experts?

471
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,720
Action.

472
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,960
That is the best way to set up a guild.

473
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,440
The meeting is over.

474
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,600
Come in.

475
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,680
New information.

476
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,280
Take a look at this data.

477
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,560
So mysterious. What's wrong?

478
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,920
He took three first kills, so what?

479
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,480
He can't fight back in front of me.

480
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,880
Did you defeat him in the PK?

481
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,240
I didn't. I defeated him in bargaining.

482
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,920
Bargaining?

483
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,560
Soliciting experts should pay attention to strategies.

484
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,600
First of all, you have to understand his needs.

485
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,360
Hold the bottom line.

486
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,600
No matter what kind of experts

487
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,600
can be solicited.

488
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,560
I think

489
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,520
for the word"soliciting"

490
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,360
you may have some misunderstanding.

491
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,440
What's the matter?

492
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,080
At first it was clearly a good process of soliciting.

493
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,240
You made it into

494
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
a high-priced employment transactions.

495
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,720
Look.

496
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,560
Brother, you have joined in no guild.

497
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,040
Do you want to consider joining our Lanxi Pavilion.

498
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
Not interested for the time being.

499
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,160
At the very start,

500
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,440
you are very clear about your purpose.

501
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,440
But he refused you.

502
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,880
However, he left a hope for you

503
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,200
to make you feel there is still a chance.

504
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,480
You are right.

505
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
You have to know more about us before making a decision.

506
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,120
Well, we're going to attack the Frost Forest.

507
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,160
We are short of a master like you, Bro.

508
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,920
Do you want to join us

509
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,680
to feel the team atmosphere of our Lanxi Pavilion.

510
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,280
You want to challenge the record, don't you?

511
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Not that ambitious. Just give it a try.

512
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,840
You played the emotional card very tactfully

513
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,960
to invite him to attack Dungeon.

514
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,200
In the end, you also did not forget to praise him as an expert.

515
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
So far,

516
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,640
it's perfect.

517
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,880
But starting with this sentence,

518
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
you are completely immersed in his rhythm.

519
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,480
If only giving a try, I won't be interested.

520
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,880
No, not just trying.

521
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,960
As you know, bro,

522
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,960
Dungeon record in the new district

523
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,360
is very important for every guild.

524
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
Of course we also want to break the record.

525
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,880
Unfortunately, I am not a member of any guild.

526
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,440
I don't know the importance you mentioned.

527
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,680
It doesn't matter if he don't know the importance.

528
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Expert, the important thing is

529
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,520
you know what you want.

530
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,880
If the record is broken, the purple equipment is all yours.

531
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,920
How about it?

532
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Not interested in equipment.

533
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,320
Expert, what are you interested in?

534
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,240
Do you have any rare materials?

535
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,960
To challenge the record is clearly your words to say.

536
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,680
But he was the first to say it.

537
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,240
He planned to let you off guard

538
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,520
to think you are on the same side.

539
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,640
But it isn't expected the situation is changing fast.

540
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,520
His refusal upset your rhythm.

541
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,320
You already lost

542
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
when you became the first in a panic.

543
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,760
We certainly have. Lanxi Pavilion

544
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,560
has everything you want.

545
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,520
Thirty powerful spider silk,

546
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,840
eight  sharp teeth of white wolves,

547
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,920
and eight white wolf hair.

548
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,560
Bro, you're asking too much.

549
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,320
Didn't you say you have everything.

550
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,520
Yes, yes, but the three things you want

551
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,000
will take a lot of luck to get them.

552
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,400
You can only choose one of the three.

553
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,520
Then I choose the sharp teeth of white wolf

554
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,200
and maybe a bit of some powerful spider silk.

555
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,520
How about 25.

556
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,040
I

557
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,880
He raised the price at first

558
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
to deliberately give you room to bargain.

559
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,040
He makes you think you've taken the upper side.

560
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,000
Later he chose the cheapest one of the three,

561
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,560
the sharp teeth purposely

562
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,440
to make you think he lost

563
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,280
and you earned it.

564
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,960
In this way, he managed to take a weak position to further

565
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,160
ask you for some spider silk.

566
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,040
This is all his calculation.

567
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
And what you have promised him

568
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,520
maybe more than he wanted.

569
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,360
Still, I fell in his trap.

570
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,560
But the materials are still in our hands.

571
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,440
It's still our call.

572
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,264
You need to give me a part of the materials

573
00:38:33,265 --> 00:38:34,040
before I enter the Dungeon.

574
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,320
What? Give him some materials in advance.

575
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,623
A down payment goes first before the final payment.

576
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:42,440
= Apply to take 25 spider silk =

577
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,680
= Apply to take 25 spider silk =

578
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,920
Guild master, wait a minute.

579
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,240
Can't you just wait a minute?

580
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,320
We have so many members in Lanxi Pavilion.

581
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,560
He can't ran away.

582
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,200
Everything is under my control.

583
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,320
Then you all listen to my command.

584
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,160
Ok, ok.

585
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,320
All right, let's attack the Dungeon.

586
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,040
Expert, how do we fight later?

587
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,360
I understand what the expert means.

588
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,920
This circle drawn by him

589
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,800
is to represent that we will fight together.

590
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,313
Inside the circle is the pure land,

591
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:15,080
outside the circle is the battlefield.

592
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Am I right?

593
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,840
I mean

594
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,400
do not move out of the circle.

595
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,080
But

596
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,080
What is his plan?

597
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,400
How dare he face the monster alone.

598
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,760
Did he kill the monster

599
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,040
or was he eaten by it?

600
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,520
I'll go and check it out.

601
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,640
We need to give him a few more minutes.

602
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,280
Expert has his own strategy.

603
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,960
We must show our grace.

604
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,680
Then our grace is...

605
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
Waiting.
