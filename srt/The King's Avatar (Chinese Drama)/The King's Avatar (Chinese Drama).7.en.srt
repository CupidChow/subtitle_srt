00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,300
= Episode 7 =

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
Do you still need me to continue asking?

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,240
Here’s the thing, captain.

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,840
It's him. First, he said that

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,200
he wanted me to do the Dungeon with him.

7
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
So I told him that I wouldn't do that.

8
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
Then he threatened and lured me.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,640
He also said that

10
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,360
he would use an unfinished item

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,840
to bring some kind of umbrella back to life.

12
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
He also said he would add a little excitement

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,560
to the present Glory.

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,720
- Wait a minute. - Even I feel like...

15
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
He really said that?

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,800
He actually said that.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,840
I want to add a little excitement

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,320
to the present Glory.

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
That's exactly what he said.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,960
He meant it.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,600
If I lied to you, then I am Sun Xiang. That’s the truth.

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
I’m sorry, Lao Ye.

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
You’ve still got time to do the Dungeon after the match.

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
It seems that you haven’t received enough training from the team.

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,960
Captain, didn't you just say that

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,040
we wouldn’t talk about this?

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
You will keep your word, right?

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,040
Yes, I will.

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,240
Unless...

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Unless what?

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,080
Unless you can blow out a thousand-machine umbrella.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,480
It’s not stealing.

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,040
Captain, don’t you think

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,120
it’s a little bit shameless?

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
You see, our team Lan Yu

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,640
has always been righteous.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Will this...

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,200
How can you say it’s shameless?

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,200
We just want to borrow it and study a little bit.

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,960
After we’ve done, we’ll return it.

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,760
By the way, you may not be able to defeat him.

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,920
Captain, you should be responsible for what you said.

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,240
I can absolutely defeat him.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Let me tell you, according to my Combat Effectiveness,

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,360
I can make his umbrella become a stick immediately.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Believe it or not.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,880
Good. Three hours. I’ll wait for you.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
You really just give me three hours?

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
When can you finish the match with me

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,200
at the training camp?

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,240
Ye Qiu. Teacher.

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,040
Go, go, go.

54
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,160
Take it easy. I can do it.

55
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,880
You can't. Why are you so slow?

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,080
I don’t have much tricks left. Come on.

57
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
We’ve got a chance.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,120
Good.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,080
Not bad, great, boy.

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,160
How many matches have you won successively?

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,480
You see, Yu Wenzhou is weak.

62
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
He’s too slow.

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,320
How can I compare with you?

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,040
Be quiet.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,680
I'd like to announce one thing to you all.

66
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,440
Our training camp will start the evaluation officially tomorrow.

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,600
The person who graded last in the evaluation will be eliminated.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
Is everyone clear?

69
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,040
Don't go. Don't go.

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,640
Yu Wenzhou, you are the only student I’ve ever seen

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
who have never won in the regulation matches.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,360
If you lose again this time, you would be eliminated.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,880
If you want to have your own place in eSports,

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
then you have to work hard.

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Got it.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,480
All right, everyone.

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,240
Line up and draw lots to choose your opponent.

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
You first. Quickly.

79
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,080
I’d like to go back.

80
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,760
You first.

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
Don't be shy, draw one.

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,680
Don't be shy.

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Come on. You even don’t know how to draw lots?

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,800
Come on. Quickly.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,680
Take a look.

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,600
Who is it? Open it.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,520
Quickly.

88
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
Come on, who is it?

89
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,120
Who?

90
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,400
Don't hide it.

91
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,720
Ye Qiu.

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Ye Qiu?

93
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
You won the first prize.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,640
You’ve never won, and he has never lost.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,760
We even don’t need to guess.

96
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,480
Yeah.

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,960
Come on.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
Come on.

99
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,920
It's okay.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,440
The laughings from my classmates

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,520
make me extremely self-contemptuous.

102
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,680
So I started practicing

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
all day long.

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
Warlock versus Battle Mega.

105
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
The situation is not good.

106
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,000
The only turning point

107
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
is whether I can release the Curse Arrow or not.

108
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
But it takes me ten seconds to chant

109
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
to get the maximum energy.

110
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,280
It is impossible for me not to be interrupted.

111
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:54,484
# Failure is just #

112
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:56,988
# the light of success. #

113
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:01,336
# It's okay for me to start again. #

114
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
The only possible way

115
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,360
is to completely control him for ten seconds.

116
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,780
# We are accompanied by self-confidence and strength. #

117
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,705
# Even if we're beaten back #

118
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800
I can only stall for five seconds.

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,560
The chant would still be interrupted.

120
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,000
We must find a way to stall for another five seconds.

121
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:32,121
# We must try our best to win a battle. #

122
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:34,317
# We laugh, we cry. #

123
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,271
# We feel sad about setbacks. #

124
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,386
# We accompany each other and grow together. #

125
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,383
# This is our most glorious battlefield. #

126
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:52,099
# We should fight for our dreams and win nicely. #

127
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:57,202
# We hug each other and cheer because of success. #

128
00:06:57,437 --> 00:07:01,767
# We spend countless shiny time together. #

129
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:06,300
# This is our most glorious battlefield. #

130
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:12,004
# We must try our best to win a battle. #

131
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,205
# We laugh, we cry. #

132
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,280
# We feel sad about setbacks. #

133
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,880
# We accompany each other and grow together. #

134
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:26,394
# This is our most glorious battlefield. #

135
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:32,007
# We should fight for our dreams and win nicely. #

136
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:37,280
# We hug each other and cheer because of success. #

137
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:42,001
# We spend countless shiny time together. #

138
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:47,005
# This is our most glorious battlefield. #

139
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:51,866
# We spend countless shiny time together. #

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,840
He's doomed.

141
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
There's no suspense.

142
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,360
He can't defeat Ye Qiu.

143
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,400
He can't defeat Ye Qiu.

144
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
There is no suspense.

145
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,080
The game is on.

146
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,080
Dragon Tooth Sprint. Mr. Ye is so fierce at the beginning.

147
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,680
No mercy at all.

148
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,760
Sprint at the beginning?

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
Look up into the sky.

150
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,120
Mr. Ye Qiu, Mr. Ye Qiu.

151
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
Five.

152
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,280
Four.

153
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,880
Three.

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,600
Two.

155
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,480
One.

156
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,920
Two minutes and eighteen seconds.

157
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,240
In this way, it became the driving force for me to work harder.

158
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,960
Ye Qiu also became the opponent

159
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,640
that I wanted to meet the most in the match.

160
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,280
It's done.

161
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Captain, wait a minute.

162
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,280
What’s this?

163
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,160
The thousand-machine umbrella.

164
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,280
Captain, let me report.

165
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I strictly followed the your instruction.

166
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,040
I successfully and quickly got it.

167
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,880
Mission completed.

168
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,840
So your team Lan Yu stole things so high-key？

169
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,160
It's an robbery.

170
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
Long time no see.

171
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,680
Long time no see.

172
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,600
You two good friends

173
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,040
who both have strong hearts.

174
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,120
It's not easy for you to see each other,

175
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,840
maybe you can have a talk and improve your friendship.

176
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll take it with me. Bye.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,200
You're very interested in my thousand-machine umbrella?

178
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,520
I'd like to see the power of

179
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,360
the thousand-machine umbrella and Freelancer.

180
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,920
I owe you that. Two minutes and eighteen seconds.

181
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,840
I owe that to myself.

182
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,760
Two minutes and eighteen seconds.

183
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,560
Hide yourself to prevent interruption.

184
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,480
Very skilled.

185
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,160
You overpraised me.

186
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,160
Indeed it's an artifact.

187
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,960
It seems that your speed of chant has also improved.

188
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
But that's all.

189
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,240
You've got another move.

190
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,520
Did you try your best this time?

191
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,920
I try my best every time.

192
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,440
The thousand-machine umbrella along with Freelancer.

193
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,600
Maybe they can really change the pattern of our league.

194
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,160
It's just...

195
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,560
Maybe you can rely on the thousand-machine umbrella

196
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,320
and Freelancer's various skills to make a difference.

197
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
But how are you gonna pass the challenge in the Field of God?

198
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,000
Im not like you. You think too much,

199
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
which would cost many brain cells.

200
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,560
If you have the time,

201
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,040
I think you should think about

202
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,200
how to prevent Huang Shaotian from running around.

203
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
Ye Qiu.

204
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
I hope that the next time I see you,

205
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,200
you can add some excitement to the Glory.

206
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,720
We all suffer pains

207
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,080
while we're growing.

208
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,040
In this glorious world,

209
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,640
we've learned to reconcile with ourselves.

210
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,840
Okay, come on, let's smile.

211
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,440
Three, two, one

212
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
Okay.

213
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,160
Hold your chest with both hands.

214
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,600
Good.

215
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,360
Three, two, one.

216
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
Okay.

217
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,840
Let's look this way. At a 45-degree angle.

218
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,680
Here.

219
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,160
Okay.

220
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,800
Three, two, one.

221
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,080
No, still not good.

222
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,640
His eyes are too obvious.

223
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,120
One is big and the other is small.

224
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,000
Alright. It's okay. I'll adjust them again.

225
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,680
Make both eyes bigger.

226
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Good, good

227
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,960
Let me try.

228
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
Hold it tightly.

229
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,920
Look at a 45-degree angle.

230
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,600
This time, the picture is good.

231
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,360
His eyes now look the same.

232
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,120
Captain.

233
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,000
Go ahead. What is it?

234
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,280
Recently, a guy called Jun Moxiao appears in the 10th District.

235
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,840
All the guilds are not peaceful now.

236
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,280
I suspect that

237
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,000
he's a professional player from other teams.

238
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,040
who tries to cause trouble for us.

239
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
This is the end of today's work.

240
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Today's task is very arduous.

241
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Are you ready?

242
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
- I'm ready. - I'm ready.

243
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,000
Forty seven.

244
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,560
Forty eight.

245
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
How are you doing?

246
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Fifty three.

247
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,560
It's so unfair.

248
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,840
I can only fight one by one while you can fight a group.

249
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,480
Your attack speed is faster than mine.

250
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,080
This time, we're going to fight Toya.

251
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,640
It's not too difficult to defeat him.

252
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
But the reason why

253
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
he hasn't been defeated for so long

254
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,960
is because of the steps before we can fight Toya.

255
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
They're closely linked.

256
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,400
They are not only trivial but also time limited.

257
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,160
We can't make mistakes, Tang.

258
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,200
Mind your own business.

259
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,120
Tang and Bro Ye have been playing the Glory for a long time.

260
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,880
It seems that they cooperate quite well.

261
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,200
But Tang used to

262
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,360
play with us.

263
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,402
Why does she only

264
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,920
play with men now?

265
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,440
Go on.

266
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,200
Watch your steps.

267
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,120
Two guys in front of you.

268
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,720
Tang.

269
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,440
Speed up.

270
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,720
Tang.

271
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,960
Guoguo, wait a minute.

272
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,640
Tang, let's make a Sky-stirke.

273
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,840
Okay.

274
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,040
Good.

275
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,520
Tang.

276
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,440
We need to try harder.

277
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
There's a new cake shop nearby.

278
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,680
I heard the cakes are delicious.

279
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,600
Let's go there together.

280
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,880
I'll go if I have time.

281
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,040
Watch your back.

282
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,120
What's the matter?

283
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,800
There are some questions that I don't know.

284
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,960
You're the only one who can solve them.

285
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
Can you teach me?

286
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,520
Of course. Why don't you write them down first?

287
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,920
I'll solve them for you later.

288
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,440
Let's continue.

289
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
You play computer games everyday.

290
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,960
Did I invite you to here to play Glory?

291
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,680
You'd better get to work now.

292
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,280
From now on, you just practice with Tang.

293
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,360
and improve her skills. And that's your job.

294
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,560
Go left.

295
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,720
Nasty guy., you're playing dirty.

296
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,280
Delete.

297
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,680
Don't.

298
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,521
- What are you doing? - It's my phone.

299
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,960
What? Who asked you to record it?

300
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,440
Guoguo.

301
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,120
Tang.

302
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,200
Let's go to eat something and play together.

303
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,440
Let's do something interesting.

304
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,200
It's my treat. Let's go.

305
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
All right, stop it.

306
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,600
We are now doing the Dungeon.

307
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,960
Can we go later? Okay?

308
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,200
Back off.

309
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,160
Use the best trick. Mind your HP.

310
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,680
Add some HP.

311
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
The training strength and difficulties of Team

312
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,680
are not suitable for you.

313
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,560
You should go back to the training camp.

314
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,960
After improving the your skills,

315
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
you can come back again.

316
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,320
My name is Qiao Yifan.

317
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm an Assassin in the Wei Cao Team.

318
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,680
I am a professional player,

319
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,800
who is always the last one.

320
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,400
A professional player

321
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,520
who has never been on the battlefield before.

322
00:24:24,226 --> 00:24:24,823
Come on.

323
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,800
Two, three.

324
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,800
Yingjie.

325
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,080
Come here and take photos with us.

326
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,520
Come on, come on.

327
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,760
Yingjie. Yifan went to the training school.

328
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
It probably will be very difficult for him to come back.

329
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
Leave this spot to us.

330
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,880
Get out of the way, all of you.

331
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,480
Let me take a nice-looking photo

332
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,240
with the future captain.

333
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,600
Come on.

334
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,840
Let me knock you out with a brick.

335
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,080
That's my monster.

336
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
It's winner's.

337
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
Everyone, let's take a ten-minute break.

338
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,480
The following Toya

339
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
is a tough battle.

340
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,760
Didn't you just say it wasn't difficult?

341
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,802
This jungle boss is designed

342
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,320
according to the standard of ten people.

343
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,440
Indeed it's not difficult.

344
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,440
But there are only three of us.

345
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,080
Crap.

346
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,520
This Jun Moxiao is doing

347
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,880
Toya's pre-task.

348
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
He's already in the last stage.

349
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
If nothing happens, he'll achieve another first-killing.

350
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,200
Is he?

351
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,720
All the teammates,

352
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,520
gather in the training room in ten minutes.

353
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,880
It's an emergency training.

354
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,560
Your performances in this training

355
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,360
will be included in this month's evaluation.

356
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,920
If anyone's absent, his score will be zero.

357
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,120
What kind of training? It's so exaggerated.

358
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,520
Absence means zero.

359
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,640
In this case,

360
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,320
If I could perform well in this training,

361
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,600
can I be in the starting line-up?

362
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Let's go, Let's go training.

363
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,520
Go, go, go.

364
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,320
Let's go, Yingjie.

365
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,682
- Hello. - Hello.

366
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:54,454
Yifan, wait.

367
00:26:56,077 --> 00:26:56,509
Yingjie.

368
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,840
We've got a new opportunity.

369
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,080
A new opportunity?

370
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
Let's go.

371
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,560
To where?

372
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,240
Hurry up.

373
00:27:03,524 --> 00:27:03,905
Sorry.

374
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:04,343
No.

375
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:06,044
This is an activity led by the captain.

376
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,280
If you can perform well,

377
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,760
then maybe you don't have to go to training camp.

378
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,840
Are you ready?

379
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,360
Yes.

380
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:10,800
Let's go.

381
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,160
Captain.

382
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,960
Captain.

383
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,560
Sit down.

384
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,800
Take a seat.

385
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,640
Yingjie, you go first.

386
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,720
I'll find you.

387
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,360
We'll start in five minutes.

388
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
I'll wait here to see your performance.

389
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,560
Go to the Place of Exile. We'll kill a guy called Jun Moxiao.

390
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,200
Thank you.

391
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,200
I have to find a computer

392
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
in five minutes.

393
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,120
then can I catch up with this training.

394
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,920
Stop.

395
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
What's wrong, boss?

396
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,520
There's an ambush.

397
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,000
Ying Jie, you're the commander. Do it.

398
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Roger that.

399
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
Spread out and kill them one by one.

400
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Liu Fei, stay in your position.

401
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,040
Don't lose the target.

402
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,520
Okay.

403
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
Yebo, pay attention to Bao Zi. Don't underestimate the enemy.

404
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,320
Xiao Yun, take care of Han Yanrou.

405
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,240
Conserve your strength.

406
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,840
Got it.

407
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,880
Take my brick.

408
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,880
I thought you would use the brick.

409
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,760
It's not bad that we died together.

410
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,360
You're good, Bao Zi. You got the first blood.

411
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,440
Come back quickly to help Tang.

412
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,800
She's stuck in a fight.

413
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,320
Got it.

414
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,040
No need.

415
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,200
You wanna compare APM with me?

416
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,520
I don't believe you can be faster than I am.

417
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,160
Got yourself killed?

418
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,520
I told you that you should wait for Bao Zi.

419
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,120
Jun Moxiao can insist for so long

420
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,960
yet not in the inferior position.

421
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,280
I think it's almost impossible to defeat him in the front.

422
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,240
That's right, Toya.

423
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,160
If they want to fight Toya,

424
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,720
they must pass through this cave.

425
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,440
The terrain here is complicated and is suitable for ambush.

426
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,080
Shadows.

427
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,440
Yingjie, watch your back.

428
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Failure,

429
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,720
is what I expected.

430
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,160
But I didn't expect that

431
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,880
you can lose so fast.

432
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,440
Xiao Yun.

433
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,440
Rashness is your greatest enemy.

434
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,280
The match is never about

435
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,240
who starts first.

436
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,360
Okay.

437
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,080
Liu Fei,

438
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,440
it's good to care about your teammates.

439
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
But whenever a teammate is in danger,

440
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,960
you'll lose your correct judgment of the whole situation.

441
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,200
This is the main problem you need to overcome at present.

442
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
All right, captain

443
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Ye Bai.

444
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,160
Captain, I'll practice my low-level account well.

445
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,760
I'll find that Jun Moxiao again tonight

446
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,920
and take my revenge.

447
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,480
You think the reason why you failed today

448
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,480
is because you used the low-level accounts.

449
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,240
I...

450
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,800
You all think like that, right?

451
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,880
You're regular members of a champion team.

452
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,960
But you have to get inside the Dungeon

453
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,080
to fight an common player.

454
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,360
It's not worth your efforts at all.

455
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,680
Right?

456
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,000
Yingjie.

457
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,960
How do you think of this Jun Moxiao?

458
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,440
He's very good.

459
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,600
How good is he?

460
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,800
He's experienced.

461
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,880
His attacks and skills are used properly.

462
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,760
All his judgments are accurate.

463
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,600
He is better than all of us.

464
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,080
Yes, better than all of you.

465
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,440
He's great enough to kill all of you.

466
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,240
So don't despise any enemy.

467
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,840
It's a good lesson today.

468
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
When you go back home,

469
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,920
take a good look at the video of the match.

470
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,560
I hope you'll learn something.

471
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,280
Who exactly is this Jun Moxiao?

472
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,520
What you've encountered today

473
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,600
is the greatest force in the history of Glory.

474
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,880
Ye Qiu.

475
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,640
- Ye Qiu? - Ye Qiu?

476
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,360
Look at this.

477
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,200
It's interesting.

478
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,520
Hang on, Yifan.

479
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,800
Ask him to stop.

480
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,200
I'll go get him.

481
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,200
You've got ideas, but unfortunately,

482
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
you didn't realize your problem.

483
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,760
What's that?

484
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,200
A master is a master.

485
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,600
I feel so hot.

486
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,080
The operation is awesome.

487
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,760
What are you doing?

488
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
It's today's training video.

489
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,680
Isn't it the part that Yingjie lost?

490
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,280
Yeah.

491
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,040
Yes, this is it.

492
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,600
It was a terrible loss, wasn't it?

493
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,680
Do you know what this?

494
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,280
It's called the shadows.

495
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,080
Yebo.

496
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,120
Let's watch it again.

497
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,800
Yebo.

498
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,280
Where is the captain?

499
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,480
Where is the captain?

500
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,120
I think he's gone.

501
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,800
Actually, it's nothing.

502
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,280
Captain's afraid that you might suffer a terrible loss.

503
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,120
After all, your opponent is the master Ye Qiu.

504
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,560
This is it.

505
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,800
Ye Qiu? Jun Mo Xiao is the master Ye Qiu?

506
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,080
A master is a master.

507
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,720
Yeah.

508
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,800
When do you think I can be like him?

509
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,760
Just keep practicing.

510
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
I've got no water. Yifan.

511
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,520
Can you pour me a glass of water if it's convenient for you?

512
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,280
Thank you.

513
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,520
One more, Yifan.

514
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,120
- Look at you. - Look at you, Liu Fei.

515
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,040
Look at you.

516
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,280
Look, you lost first.

517
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,480
Don't look at me. I didn't perform well today.

518
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,520
This is not my real strength.

519
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,720
Actually, I think it would be nice

520
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,040
for Yifan to go to the Glory training camp.

521
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,600
If he stays in our team,

522
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,720
it's even worse for him to be a servant forever.

523
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,200
Keep watching. Keep watching

524
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,920
This lost is even worse.

525
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,640
Let's work hard.

526
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,960
Liu Fei. Ye Bo. Here you are.

527
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
Thank you. Thank you.

528
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,280
Look at this operation. Awesome.

529
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,600
This is quite handsome.

530
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
Isn't that you?

531
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,080
Impressive.

532
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,800
But by the way,

533
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,120
what's the pointing of him being great?

534
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,560
Our Wei Cao Team is better than him.

535
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,280
Exactly.

536
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,920
By the way, Yingjie.

537
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,640
I heard that

538
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,640
the restaurant we always go to

539
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,080
is going to decorate recently.

540
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,120
We may not be able to

541
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,520
eat their takeout for a long time.

542
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,600
So you have to help me eat more these days.

543
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:30,376
# But I can have endless power when I'm with you. #

544
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,440
Why this expression?

545
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm just going to train for a few days.

546
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,680
I will come back.

547
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,240
Come back early.

548
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,520
Of course.

549
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,200
When I come back,

550
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,920
you must defeat that Jun Moxiao.

551
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,440
I heard them say that the captain intends to train you

552
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
to be a successor.

553
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,200
Yingjie, come on.

554
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,280
You too. Come on.

555
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm leaving.

556
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:03,949
# This is our most glorious battlefield. #

557
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:09,715
# We must try our best to win a battle. #

558
00:39:09,953 --> 00:39:11,788
# We laugh, we cry. #

559
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,951
# We feel sad about setbacks. #

560
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:18,951
# We accompany each other and grow together. #

561
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:24,034
# This is our most glorious battlefield. #

562
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,920
Actually, I think it would be nice

563
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,040
for Yifan to go to the Glory training camp.

564
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,960
If he stays in our team,

565
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,080
it's even worse for him to be a servant forever.

566
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:39,631
# We spend countless shiny time together. #

567
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:44,047
# This is our most glorious battlefield. #

568
00:39:58,327 --> 00:39:59,108
Okay, thank you.
