Look out for the rear.

183
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,400
Keep an eye on the opponents.

184
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,840
Ye Qiu, the Tactical Master,

185
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,160
acts perfectly like we expected.

186
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,080
The situation may look chaotic.

187
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,280
Jia Shi has been consuming

188
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,520
the HP of Wei Cao.

189
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,360
Heal and give the magic sword a shield.

190
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
flight along to the back. Don't get killed.

191
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
Yes, such a chaotic scene.

192
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
But Jia Shi's one-to-one tactics

193
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,160
begins to show its merits.

194
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,640
Wei Cao is restrained.

195
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
Wei Cao needs to adjust formation as soon as possible.

196
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
Wang Jiexi uses magic bullets

197
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,160
to interrupt the movement of Matchstick of Jia Shi.

198
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Help the Cleric out.

199
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,200
Well predicted.

200
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,120
Wu Bu Liu Xing has predicted the movement of Dancing Rain.

201
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,200
Skill hit.

202
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,520
At present, the total HP of Jia Shi Team is superior.

203
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,520
The HP of the Cleric of Wei Cao drops rapidly.

204
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Yes.

205
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,920
So Jia Shi now

206
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
needs to hold their position.

207
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,600
I believe they will win.

208
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,320
Although there is some HP loss in Jia Shi Team,

209
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,400
in Jia Shi Team,

210
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,360
compared with Wei Cao,

211
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
they still have larger total HP,

212
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
with Toal Darkness, the Spellblade

213
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
remaining full HP.

214
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,320
At this time, Wei Cao Team,

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,040
Captain Wang Jiexi's decision will be critical.

216
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,960
Prepare to retreat, tactical move.

217
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,520
We see now Wei Cao are retreating.

218
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,600
Looks like the Cleric of Wei Cao

219
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,280
is too far away from his teammates.

220
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,520
This is an opportunity for Jia Shi.

221
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,120
If they can eliminate the Cleric of Wei Cao,

222
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,080
Jia Shi will win this round.

223
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,560
What an exciting match.

224
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,520
Whoever eliminates the opponent first

225
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,280
will be

226
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,600
the brightest star tonight.

227
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,920
This is not normal.

228
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,320
Distance yourselves,

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,640
Let's fly a kite first.

230
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Return to your positions.

231
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,680
Total Darkness is in a rush.

232
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,960
- He is now completely separated from the team. - Get ready.

233
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,560
Is this a tactic arranged by Jia Shi?

234
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Enlarged.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
Surround him in circle,

236
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,680
Looks like that was not a tactical arrangement.

237
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,480
A mistake by Total Darkness

238
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,080
destroys the advantage of Jia Shi.

239
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,960
He is too reckless.

240
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
If Jia Shi loses its advantage,

241
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
his recklessness is to blame.

242
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,920
Total Darkness is too reckless.

243
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
He gives Wei Cao a chance to eliminate himself.

244
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
The total HP of Jia Shi drops dramatically.

245
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
Yes, Wei Cao Team changed the situation instantly.

246
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,920
Currently, there are four players in Jia Shi

247
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,720
fighting against five opponents.

248
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
Although the substitute entered the competition,

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,480
he is still distant from the battlefield.

250
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,600
Jia Shi is in danger

251
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,440
Does Ye Qiu want to change tactics?

252
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,720
Formation reorganising.

253
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Focus your attacks on the front row in a distance.

254
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,320
Watch out.

255
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
How will Jia Shi deal with it?

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,080
It seems that the victory of this match

257
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
will slip through Jia Shi's fingers.

258
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,680
Ammunition.

259
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,120
Flames from Hell goes AOE.

260
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,040
Launcher.

261
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,120
Remote consumption.

262
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,280
Pay attention to support the two wings.

263
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Carry out Tactic Three.

264
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,440
Sweeping Tactic.

265
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,560
Leaf of Autumn and Dancing Rain

266
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,720
has accomplished the most classic cooperation in Glory.

267
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,760
With the cover of the Launcher, the Battlemage moves forward.

268
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,160
It seems that Ye Qiu has not changed his plan.

269
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Don't let Wei Cao have the chance to recover.

270
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,160
Let him in. Beheading tactics.

271
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,160
Wei Cao no longer intercepts Leaf of Autumn.

272
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,480
Seems to let him in.

273
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,520
Wei Cao wants to perform the last kill once more

274
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,880
to eliminate Leaf of Autumn.

275
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Red Leaves with low HP wants to fight back,

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,200
but is eliminated.

277
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,640
Red Leaves does not possess high HP.

278
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,040
She wanted to sneak attack Leaf of Autumn,

279
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,560
but she was interrupted by Dancing Rain.

280
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,160
At present, there are four players in each team.

281
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,240
Wei Cao's substitute also enters the match.

282
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Jia Shi eliminates one opponent,

283
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
but their total HP still falls behind.

284
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,680
They remain disadvantaged.

285
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,040
If Wei Cao delays on purpose,

286
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,520
in the case of equal number of players in both teams,

287
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Wei Cao can still win.

288
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,960
Let's start.

289
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,320
Leaf of Autumn wants to break through Wei Cao.

290
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,560
trying to eliminate another opponent.

291
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,240
Wei Cao lets Angelica, the Knight

292
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,280
to postpone Leaf of Autumn.

293
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,840
The Knight posses large HP and high DFS.

294
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
There are only 30 seconds left.

295
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,120
Difficult for Leaf of Autumn

296
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
to eliminate him in such a short time.

297
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,960
Can Ye Qiu use his superior skill

298
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
to create a miracle

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
in such a short period of time?

300
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,640
It looks impossible to eliminate the Knight

301
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
with high DFS.

302
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Leaf of Autumn is in full power,

303
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,520
while Angelica is trying his best to defend.

304
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,480
Other members of Jia Shi

305
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
also covers the captain's attacks.

306
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,800
Ye Qiu's is in full strength.

307
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,480
The match is warming up.

308
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,600
Fire cover.

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,920
Armor Crushing Cannon.

310
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,880
At this critical moment,

311
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
Dancing Rain helps Leaf of Autumn out.

312
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,800
With five seconds left,

313
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,520
Leaf of Autumn is still attacking.

314
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,240
The speed of skills is getting faster.

315
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,000
- Rising Dragon Soars the Sky. - 2 seconds remaining.

316
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
Draconic Crusher.

317
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,080
Ye Qiu. He did it.

318
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,040
The HP of the Knight of Wei Cao falls to zero.

319
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,200
He won in the very last second.

320
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,160
What a great match.

321
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,480
In the last second,

322
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
Ye Qiu eliminated the opponent.

323
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,160
The Fighting God ends this match

324
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
in his own way.

325
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,600
Dancing Rain's assistance

326
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,480
also proves to us

327
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,800
they are the best pair

328
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
in the League.

329
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,280
Tonight, we witnessed history together.

330
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,840
Jia Shi hasn't fallen yet.

331
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,880
Compared with the loses recently,

332
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,200
with this victory, Jia Shi

333
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
and Captain Ye Qiu with his stunning skills

334
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,360
prove to everyone

335
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,080
Jia Shi,

336
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
the King has returned.

337
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,160
The Fighting God once again created miracles

338
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,600
in the critical moment.

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,080
Let's shout out together.

340
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,400
The greatest name in the history of Glory,

341
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,640
Ye Qiu.

342
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,560
Yours are much warmer.

343
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,600
This is Captain Ye Qiu who did wonders tonight.

344
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Black mask.

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,880
Black hat.

346
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,280
And sharp eyes are his symbol.

347
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,600
He never appears in front of the public.

348
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Do not participate in any road show.

349
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
Do not participate in any publicity campaign.

350
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,360
We have enjoyed a great match,

351
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,240
but we will never see Ye Qiu, the God in Glory.

352
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,240
Maybe he only shows

353
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,720
who he really is

354
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,840
in front of the person he cherishes the most.

355
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,480
Glory is not a match for one individual.

356
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,120
Glory is a Team Competition .

357
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,920
Compared with magnificent techniques

358
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,840
or increased number of strikes,

359
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,320
teamwork matters more.

360
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,720
In time of crisis,

361
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,400
you need to show all your skills calmly.

362
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,360
There is no weak team in the League.

363
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,760
No one can take any chances.

364
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,320
This is the second time Wei Cao counterattacked.

365
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
In this round of attack and defense,

366
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,720
there was a serious mistake.

367
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,120
The rhythm of the whole match

368
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,960
became chaotic from that moment.

369
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,520
The clues of the tactics

370
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,000
were already exposed.

371
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,760
Look here.

372
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,800
When Wei Cao retreated.

373
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,560
the Cleric was far away from the team.

374
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
In this distance,

375
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,040
there were 40 position units.

376
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,920
However, the time to retreat was only six seconds.

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,200
Even if the Cleric was slow,

378
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,560
he still distant himself from the team

379
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
in such a short time.

380
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,680
What does it mean?

381
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
The Cleric already started to run off.

382
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,000
That's right.

383
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,520
This was a deliberately dropped bait.

384
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
However, we still took it.

385
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
We fought in full power at that time.

386
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,480
During the last 40 seconds.

387
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,240
we could have delay on purpose

388
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
to win the match.

389
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,480
However, you chose to attack alone.

390
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,080
I

391
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,000
After separated from the team,

392
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,920
you used Lei Guang wave array in two seconds.

393
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,480
In order to kill the bait

394
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,680
you wasted a strong skill

395
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,240
and your own life.

396
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,760
This is not the first time

397
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
something like this happened.

398
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,720
Give me a reason.

399
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,880
I wanted

400
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,720
I wanted to take the first kill for our team.

401
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
Not for us,

402
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,120
but for yourself

403
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,480
Whoever eliminates the opponent first

404
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,160
will be

405
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,560
the brightest star tonight.

406
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,000
You only use the right skill in the right time.

407
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,800
Turn advantage into victory.

408
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
This is the basic for professional eSports players.

409
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,360
If every player considers the Team Competition

410
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,600
as personal showtime,

411
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,320
this team

412
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,320
will not last.

413
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
I'm done.

414
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,280
Chen Yehui.

415
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
You are not suitable for Team Competition.

416
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,160
Go back to the guild.

417
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,400
Captain, I don't understand

418
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,720
what do you mean.

419
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,560
The team doesn't need you anymore.

420
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,160
Three championship trophies.

421
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,480
Three MVP Trophies in Regular Season.

422
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,840
This wall of Jia Shi

423
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
is the true honor wall in the League.

424
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,560
Now the League's pushing for more matches.

425
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,880
If we continue that old strategy,

426
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,000
we will soon be eliminated.

427
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,800
In the next match,

428
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,960
I want to try some new tactics.

429
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,480
In a competition, there will always be winners and losers.

430
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,520
Don't work yourself too hard.

431
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,280
I don't like losing

432
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,400
If you lose today, you can win back tomorrow.

433
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,160
Victory or defeat

434
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,240
is just a matter of probability.

435
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,240
However, business is different.

436
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,480
We are all gambling here.

437
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,520
If you don't watch your step,

438
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,760
you will fall into the bottom.

439
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,160
If you make any mistake, you're all out.

440
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,160
The new tactics you just mentioned.

441
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,080
Mucheng and I brought the Sweeping Tactic

442
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,160
to the League.

443
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,280
Now this tactic,

444
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,640
It is no longer a secret.

445
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,280
It's been targeted and studied.

446
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,400
It's normal.

447
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,600
Have you ever thought maybe

448
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,880
it's not a matter of tactics?

449
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,800
The problems lie in players.

450
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,320
What do you think of the newcomers from the last season?

451
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,960
What do you think of Sun Xiang?

452
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,520
He is good.

453
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,960
I have paid attention to him before.

454
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,840
He ranked first in KDA among the newcomers.

455
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
The efficiency is quite high.

456
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,400
Just

457
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,720
No.

458
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,880
I mean

459
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,280
how is he compared to your old days?

460
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,880
I can't tell unless I fight against him.

461
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,880
All you masters care about is

462
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
fighting against each other.

463
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Ye Qiu.

464
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,320
Sometimes, when you meet a person,

465
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,880
you will feel something different.

466
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
Let me introduce you.

467
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,040
This is Yue Yun.

468
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,000
He is like the Jia Shi's version of Sun Xiang.

469
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,360
Ye Qiu.

470
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,000
I didn't expect to see

471
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Bro Ye in person again.

472
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,360
What a honor!

473
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,120
Jia Shi's profit used to

474
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
account for half of the profit of the League.

475
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,880
However,

476
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,160
now we are way behind

477
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,400
other teams.

478
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,560
Now the whole League is changing.

479
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,120
We need to follow the trend.

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,760
What about now?

481
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,880
What we need the most is

482
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,080
players like Sun Xiang.

483
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,480
He is good at playing matches.

484
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,360
He can also bring some fresh blood

485
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
to create commercial value for the League.

486
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,880
Don't worry. When I join you,

487
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
we will be better.

488
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,600
What do you mean by "we"?

489
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
Let me introduce again.

490
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,080
He is the new captain of

491
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,320
Jia Shi, Sun Xiang.

492
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,480
From now on,

493
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,040
Sun Xiang will take your position as the captain.

494
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,520
The account of Leaf of Autumn

495
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,960
is his now.

496
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,640
Of course.

497
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,360
If you are willing to stay

498
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
to be his sparring partner,

499
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,880
I'll think of some way to help you

500
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,520
to get some compensation.

501
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,640
No need.

502
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,440
Terminate the contract.

503
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't you need to think about this?

504
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,840
If you terminate the contract,

505
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,120
you can't get a dime.

506
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,080
I chose to retire.

507
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,200
Do you like eSports?

508
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,840
What?

509
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,560
If you like it,

510
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,960
consider all of this as a glory,

511
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,400
rather than a chance to show off.

512
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,040
You are going to let him retire?

513
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,360
The rules of Glory have long changed.

514
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
It's not like

515
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,520
when the League first formed,

516
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,320
winning trophies does not mean you will get your investment,

517
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,960
My road shows

518
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,040
has already been scheduled.

519
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,480
Will Ye Qiu come?

520
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,840
He can't make money for us and

521
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,240
refuses to be obedient.

522
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
No matter how good he is as a player,

523
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,040
he is meaningless to me.

524
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,800
Retired players cannot participate in League matches for a year.

525
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,040
As a professional eSports player,

526
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,280
one mouth away from the matches

527
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
will end his career,

528
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,360
let alone a whole year.

529
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
Leaf of Autumn's account card is yours.

530
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,960
Hold your position.

531
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,920
Excuse me.

532
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,240
People don't even

533
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,080
make room for the captain in Jia Shi.

534
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,080
It seems that you are really going down.

535
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,040
Only those on higher places can go down.

536
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,560
If someone is always at the bottom,

537
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,680
he is nothing but desperate.

538
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,880
You become even more harsh these days.

539
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,280
I remember what you said before.

540
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,400
You said Jia Shi would never need someone like me.

541
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,920
How about now?

542
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
Jia Shi doesn't need you,

543
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
not me

544
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,280
Have you finished? I'm in a hurry.

545
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,560
Since my first day in Jia Shi,

546
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,400
You have always looked down on me.

547
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,440
How awesome were you then?

548
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,280
Don't do road shows. Don't endorse any product.

549
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,600
Let everyone wait for you.

550
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,240
Who do you think you are?

551
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,760
How about now?

552
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,040
Those who can stay

553
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
are the people who obey the rules.

554
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Have you finished?

555
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,120
Ye Qiu.

556
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
You are no longer a member of Jia Shi Team.

557
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,960
Why are you still wearing our team uniform?

558
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,760
Take it off.

559
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,440
Or I can help you take it off.

560
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,920
Ye Qiu, the Fighting God

561
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,880
Away game.

562
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
You come to buy things myself.

563
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,920
However, you are still one step behind.

564
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,040
I have already prepared

565
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,760
what you need in advance

566
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
like always.

567
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,440
Take another one of this.

568
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,960
What's wrong with you?

569
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,480
Can I pay the bill please?

570
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,640
What's the matter?

571
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,680
I won't go in.

572
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
Why? What happened?

573
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,000
My contract was terminated.

574
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,680
I choose to retire.

575
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,800
I will go with you.

576
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,080
Stay here and fight hard.

577
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,880
For our sake.

578
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,560
For the ten years

579
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,200
we spent together.

580
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,720
I know.

581
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,560
The fact that the captain is retired

582
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,680
may be hard for you to accept

583
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,800
at the moment.

584
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,480
There are pressure from above and dissatisfaction from below.

585
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,480
I need to do something.

586
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,720
Don't worry.

587
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
This retirement is

588
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,840
just a show.

589
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,040
As long as you stay in Jia Shi

590
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,560
I will

591
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,640
I won't leave.

592
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,480
You are still

593
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,960
my boss.

594
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,920
Actually, my heart was broken

595
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,560
when Ye Qiu chose to leave.

596
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,280
After all, we have

597
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,200
After all,

598
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,720
We have gone through

599
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,120
those difficult days together.

600
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,680
I don't know how you made

601
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,440
Ye Qiu leave.

602
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,800
He is stronger than you think.

603
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,120
To him, Glory

604
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,640
is his faith.

605
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,320
Rebuild a once

606
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,720
destroyed faith

607
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,960
will only make it more stunning and

608
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,320
more tenacious,

609
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,200
even if it takes some detours and

610
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,240
brings loneliness.

611
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,000
He will return to the starting point.

612
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,280
He will definitely come back.

613
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,320
Take back

614
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,280
his glory.

615
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,560

616

A year.

617
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,800

Thank you.

This is a time for all players

627
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,840
to start from the beginning.

628
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
Yes, let's start over together.

A new journey has begun.

631

Chu, we will take the old seats and four computers.

632
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,480
Yes, I know.

633
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,240
You go up first.

634
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,680
Good.

635

Give me your ID card later.

636
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,400
Got it.

637

Right, got the assignment.

679
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,440
You can choose a profession if you own a weapon.

680
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,680
What is your profession?

681
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,040
Glory has 24 professions.

682
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,360
It is divided into six main classes.

683
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,960
Fighter, Mage, Night Walker,

684
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,560
Priest, Swordsman and Gunner .

685
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
Each profession has its own advantages and disadvantages.

686
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,880
Should I choose my profession according to

687
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,000
my constellation or my characteristic?

688
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,960
Constellation.

689
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,560
It's okay. Don't be nervous

690
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
I will be your side.

691
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,240
# You are as always #

692
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,200
# from adversity to glory. #

693
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,320
# I am as always. #

694
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,800
# I am back with the same goal. #

695
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,040
See.

696
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,880
I am designing a weapon like this.

697
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,200
I call this a thousand-machine umbrella.

698
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,640
It can adjust itself into different shapes

699
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,720
when a player is below level 20

700
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,040
with 120 low-level skills before advancing to a higher profession

701
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,240
for all 24 different professions in Glory

702
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,000
without cooling down period.

703
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,960
# I am as always, #

704
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,760
# writing an ending for the story. #

705
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,680
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

706
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,080
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

707
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,360
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

708
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,320
# We are stronger when we used to be. #

709
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,520
# We go through deep and down. #

710
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,720
Long time no see.

711
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,240
A thousand-machine umbrella.

712
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,560
Leve 5.

713
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,160
Weights 2.3 kg.

714
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,240

716
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,062

# I have seen before. #

718
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,600
This strategy for the team

719
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
is built around the Battlemage.

720
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,600
I want to try a different profession though.

721
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
It is not a big deal.

722
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,960
It is important to choose the right profession.

723
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,720
Profession?

724
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
In the world of Glory,

725
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,120
if you are tied up to a profession,

726
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,120
then you must be the king's avatar.

727
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,562
# I am back with the same goal. #

728
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:28,562

# I am back with the same goal. #

731
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,920
I have a friend

732
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,240
who plays Glory like a master.

733
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,720
Then he left.

734
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,720
There is one thing he told me.

735
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,480
You just need to start all over again.

736
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,360
# We go through deep and down. #

737
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,680
# We stand at the starry summit. #

738
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,960
# Now I finally understand what I used to be. #

739
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,680
# I have always been my own hero. #

740
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,720
# I have seen before. #

741
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,080
# The legend. #

742
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,480
You little Bastard. You lost.

743
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,760
You lost already.

744
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,480
Quantum Bomb.

745
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Laser Rifle.

746
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,000
Master, can I pay the bill please?

747
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,920
You need to pay the bill, right? Just second.

748
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,680
After I finish this match.

749
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,520
Use your knee.

750
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,200
Don't use Swing.

751
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,600
Shut up.

752
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,640
It's just a battle.

753
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Do you need to be this serious?

754
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Of course.

755
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,960
Glory is more than just a battle.

756
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,360
Lost again.

757
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,240
Can I pay the bill now?

758
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,960
Sure.

759
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,480
Master, come here.

760
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Come on.

761
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,720
Wait a second.

762
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,120
Why is the screen black again?

763
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,440
What's the matter?

764
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,200
Am I playing Glory or the computer is playing me?

765
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,120
Master.

766
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,080
Is that man playing with your account?

767
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,120
He will probably steal your equipment.

768
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,120
Oh, no.

769
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,240
You bastard.

770
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,240
Won.

771
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
I saw the battle start,

772
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,240
so I played a round for you.

773
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,000
How long did it take you to win?

774
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,160
Forty seconds.

775
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,040
This is awesome.

776
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,640
Come on.

777
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,080
We are short of Tanks.

778
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,040
Who is good at playing Tanks? Come here immediately.

779
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,760
You are good, Bro.

780
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,920
I won.

781
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,080
Well done.

782
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,520
Yeah, well done.

783
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,280
Master.

784
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,720
You just said Glory is more than a battle.

785
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,920
What is Glory?

786
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,360
Glory.

787
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,880
We know each other through Glory.

788
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,360
Glory is the world for all of us.

789
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,680
You need to pay the bill, right? Sorry.

790
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,880
I'm looking for a job here.
