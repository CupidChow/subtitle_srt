3
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:57,120
I heard that other companies will do team building.

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
Yes, team building.

5
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,680
Seems pretty good.

6
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,320
Hey, Jun Moxiao.

7
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,480
Welcome.

8
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:18,960
That's our office gym.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
You can do some exercise here

10
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,120
to take a break from training.

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,960
Those are massage chairs.

12
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,560
I like them.

13
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,360
And here...

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,200
we practice here.

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,080
This is the power supply system.

16
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Don't touch it when some are in training,

17
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,200
or all computers will shut off.

18
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,160
Remember?

19
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,320
Yes.

20
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
This is where we keep our account cards.

21
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,120
You can put yours here.

22
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,040
How careless!

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,200
Someone puts my card of Jun Moxiao in it.

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,440
In case it loses,

25
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,000
the greatest thousand-machine umbrella in Glory

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,120
is nowhere to be found.

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,160
OK, that's it.

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,800
Feel free to look about.

29
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,040
Okay.

30
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,000
You come after me,

31
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,320
and that costs your weapon and account.

32
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:22,880
Wait, see the name.

33
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,200
Sullen Kitten?

34
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,560
You want the thousand-machine umbrella?

35
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
Then there's a chance

36
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,560
you can get it.

37
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
You can start a fight against anyone in our team,

38
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
equipping yourself with the umbrella.

39
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,120
If you win,

40
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,200
it's yours.

41
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,314
I promise that

42
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:43,177
I will no longer kill you.

43
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:49,360
Unfortunately,

44
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,920
if you lose

45
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,068
you have to go

46
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,920
and surrender your card.

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,320
Okay.

48
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,160
How about... him?

49
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,200
He's a Warlock.

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,880
You'd better find another person.

51
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,560
He's a Ninja,

52
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,240
which means that he casts a skill,

53
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,120
and we're in close quarters.

54
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,280
That's a bad option for me.

55
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,720
Well, your timing is perfect.

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,560
You need to think twice.

57
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,440
If I'm defeated,

58
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,800
the umbrella will be his.

59
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm convinced of your experience.

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,920
You can do a good job.

61
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,400
Well, I'll rekindle my spirit today.

62
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,240
I'll fight without equipment,

63
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,857
so he cannot blame it for the failure.

64
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,702
= You've taken off all equipment. =

65
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,331
= System Notification: The weapon is unavailable.=

66
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,051
= System Notification: The weapon is unavailable. =

67
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,290
= System Notification: The weapon is unavailable. =

68
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,360
Come on, cough up.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,960
I'll take it.

70
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,760
How can I... lost my card?

71
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
You're a visionary.

72
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:56,440
Why so sure he must lose?

73
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:00,440
I was not certain

74
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,360
until he chose the umbrella as his weapon.

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
With that,

76
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,760
our victory was guaranteed.

77
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,280
What?

78
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,480
Only Freelancers can use the umbrella

79
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,840
and reach their full potential.

80
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,480
For 23 other professions,

81
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,320
it's a drag.

82
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,120
Its various forms,

83
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,960
and strange weight

84
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,640
costed him the game.

85
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,320
That's why Mo Fan

86
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,960
lost nearly without fighting.

87
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,480
You smug jerk

88
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,040
fought with no weapon or equipment?

89
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280
How dare you!

90
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,697
That's nothing.

91
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,160
Have you thought about why you made it?

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,560
Talk about your extra skill points.

93
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,657
After my father's death,

94
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:20,868
I was accustomed to sit here on my own.

95
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,685
Those years,

96
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,960
I had always been alone,

97
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:38,400
during meals,

98
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,000
movies,

99
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,840
in the empty cafe,

100
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:50,000
and the virtual world of Glory.

101
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,057
When solitude becomes the norm,

102
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:56,582
you would find the world beautiful yet unchanging.

103
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,142
So we can't always be alone with ourselves.

104
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,880
We need company,

105
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:07,440
both online and offline.

106
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,377
We need to enrich our lives,

107
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:12,960
just like Glory,

108
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:16,217
which started with one district but now has ten.

109
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
This is life.

110
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:21,908
We never stop exploring and evolving.

111
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:27,165
# We go through deep and down. #

112
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:30,411
# We stand at the starry summit. #

113
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:34,091
# Now I finally understand what I used to be. #

114
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,548
# I have always been my own hero. #

115
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,360
# I have seen before. #

116
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:46,342
# I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary. #

117
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:49,531
# I am at the summit, looking for another summit. #

118
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,340
# We will meet again when the day comes. #

119
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,160
# We are stronger than we used to be. #

120
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,177
# We go through deep and down. #

121
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:02,445
# We stand at the starry summit. #

122
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:06,137
# Now I finally understand what I used to be. #

123
00:11:06,137 --> 00:11:08,530
# I have always been my own hero. #

124
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,960
Was I really isolated

125
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:14,342
when I lived a life like that?

126
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,480
I used to laugh with others,

127
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,314
and weep alone.

128
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Smile was my mask.

129
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,960
Everything changed when I met them,

130
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,971
the guys playing Glory,

131
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,200
They laugh,

132
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,377
bicker,

133
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:41,480
or cry,

134
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,680
whenever they feel like doing that.

135
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,640
Then I found that

136
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,240
I was just relieved

137
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:51,640
to show my true feelings.

138
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,400
Isolation is good.

139
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:59,222
But with friends, better.

140
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,160
All I want is to

141
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,280
take back my account card.

142
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,200
You must first get in there.

143
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:18,354
You've never tried,

144
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,760
so don't just give in.

145
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:23,577
A small tip.

146
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:25,840
Don't assume it's difficult

147
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,600
to deal with them.

148
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:29,320
You just put your brain into gear,

149
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:30,680
and be tough.

150
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,028
I don't understand.

151
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,988
You might find it a good team

152
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
when you're dealing with them.

153
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm going to go now.

154
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,022
= CLOSED. =

155
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,874
Do I need... friends?

156
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,640
Our match against Jia Shi is coming.

157
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,960
We must win.

158
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
I'll take the lead on

159
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,680
analyzing our opponents,

160
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,440
and mapping out plans.

161
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,120
Meanwhile, we must prepare for the match

162
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:35,485
by obtaining better equipment.

163
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,560
Stop, that's it!

164
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
If you kill this mob in just 90 seconds,

165
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,760
a skill book will drop from it.

166
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,620
= System Notification: You've obtained a skill book. =

167
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,457
= Strength, Intelligence, Stamina, Magic, SP =

168
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:15,200
It's amazing.

169
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:17,200
I thought the drop rate is random.

170
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,560
Turns out there's a pattern.

171
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,200
After all, as an experienced player,

172
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
I need some unique skills.

173
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,480
I'll make a strategy guide

174
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,994
to help all our teammates

175
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,120
get the maximum skill points,

176
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,560
and ace Jia Shi in no time.

177
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:31,748
Great.

178
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,594
Stop showing your adoration.

179
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
This is the boss that

180
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,960
we have to kill

181
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,120
before we make it to the next.

182
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,440
It might take...

183
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,080
32 minutes and 28 seconds.

184
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,040
Is time enough?

185
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,920
115 342

186
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
I thought he had left.

187
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
What did he say?

188
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,280
It locates a secret path.

189
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:24,708
We've got around the boss,

190
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,011
which cuts the time by 29 minutes.

191
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:29,200
You made it.

192
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
As the most notorious scrap picker,

193
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,062
you know the map very well.

194
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,880
Perhaps...

195
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,142
I could help them write the guide.

196
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:39,880
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

197
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,760
And... in exchange
= Xing Xin Net Cafe =

198
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,160
I'll have my account card.

199
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:45,280
785 013

200
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,651
463 042

201
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,040
Here...

202
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,868
= the Place of Exile Dungeon =

203
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,885
= Strength, Intelligence, Stamina, Magic, SP =

204
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,480
You see?

205
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,320
Great.

206
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,480
Have a rest.

207
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,400
Skill books can increase the max SP of professions.

208
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:45,600
And one skill book

209
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,800
raises that by 10 points.

210
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,720
But the low drop rate of skill books means

211
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
you're trying your luck to get one.

212
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,160
I built a new mathematical model

213
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,314
to calculate how to raise the rate.

214
00:17:05,668 --> 00:17:06,765
What are you whispering, kid?

215
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:08,971
- It's useful. - Nothing.

216
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,617
I wasn't as worthless as you said.

217
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:38,800
For Team Xing Xin, the guide

218
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,200
is crucial for victory.

219
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
For me, it's freedom.

220
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:47,640
I've been looking for you.

221
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,680
For me?

222
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:51,280
What's wrong?

223
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,400
You look pale.

224
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:06,840
Am I?

225
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,388
Is it because of the guide?

226
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
Actually, I...

227
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,365
I understand.

228
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,560
You don't fancy joining us.

229
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:31,805
And I'm not going to force you to do so.

230
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:32,742
So don't be tense.

231
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:35,880
Look at this.

232
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:39,017
I make the tea especially for you.

233
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,000
It can invigorate you.

234
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,480
Thank you...

235
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,342
for pulling all nighters with us for six days.

236
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:48,491
You guys... have made the impossible possible.

237
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
Seems the flowers have died.

238
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,880
Well, drink it while it's hot.

239
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,800
The effects will be better.

240
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:09,565
Don't look at me.

241
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,680
Drink it.

242
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:17,200
Why...

243
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
why do you drink this?

244
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:21,680
This one.

245
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,108
Well, you go on with your work, I'm leaving.

246
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,120
See you.

247
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,880
They are...

248
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,560
very nice to me.

249
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,240
Should I have the guide to myself?

250
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,771
- Captain... - Mo Fan,

251
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,880
we decide to name the guide

252
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:58,868
"The Scroll of Teaching"

253
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,314
for your outstanding contribution.

254
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,154
- How about it? - That sounds good.

255
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,840
Deception...

256
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,760
and his work... "The Scroll of Teaching".

257
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,908
Hey guys, boss's going to treat us to dinner.

258
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,748
Big meals!

259
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Let's go.

260
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,880
Boss...

261
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:19,805
I've expecting so long...

262
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,582
for your treat.

263
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:27,668
I didn't...

264
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,560
Are you blind?

265
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,320
Ah, it's you.

266
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,840
I guess you're a dishwasher here?

267
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Wait, you must say sorry.

268
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Wait, wait...

269
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,640
I just remembered...

270
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:09,880
you're dumb.

271
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:12,640
Well, then you remove the oil stain...

272
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,377
right now.

273
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,400
Hey, Liu,

274
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:19,291
come here.

275
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:22,560
Manager, I'm coming.

276
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,177
Ready?

277
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,800
This is Li, my niece.

278
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,480
- Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

279
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:51,588
Li, this is Liu, who I often told you about.

280
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:53,200
He's generous in everyday life,

281
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
and is responsible in the workplace.

282
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:57,862
Manager helps me a lot.

283
00:21:59,051 --> 00:21:59,691
And to top it off,

284
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
he never plays the field.

285
00:22:05,645 --> 00:22:06,400
Would you excuse me.

286
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,600
I got to take this.

287
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:08,914
Sure.

288
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,908
MT, initiate.

289
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,302
Lure the enemy,

290
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,365
and pull aggro.

291
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,280
Got it.

292
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Hello.

293
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,080
Yes,

294
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll pay the same price for your coffee beans.

295
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,840
I don't care the quality.

296
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:32,480
Anyway, they will be mixed and sold.

297
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:39,400
Are you blind...

298
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:49,960
Do I need to apologize for it?

299
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,960
I failed to hold aggro,

300
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
OT is needed.

301
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,120
OT, enter.

302
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,040
Lay low,

303
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,880
and watch your positioning.

304
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,880
Got it.

305
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,000
Excuse me, miss.

306
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,840
We're seeking pretty ladies,

307
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,400
and giving them presents.

308
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,840
You're the most beautiful one. Congratulations!

309
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:10,760
Me?

310
00:23:11,394 --> 00:23:13,142
We have an fine gift for you.

311
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,914
- Please come with me and take it. - Okay.

312
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:17,960
This way, please.

313
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,422
Miss, this way.

314
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,560
- You come with your girlfriend? - No, no. Of course no.

315
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,480
Those are my uncle and cousin.

316
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:33,142
Well, cousin.

317
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
Threat generation is enough.

318
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,120
Now it's time to attack.

319
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,040
Carry, control your DPS.

320
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,560
Don't pull aggro off him

321
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,280
Got it.

322
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:46,800
Manager Liao?

323
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,720
It's you, Manager Liao.

324
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,645
Who are you?

325
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm Wei.

326
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,977
You don't remember?

327
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:56,148
Liu and me, we are good friends.

328
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:57,725
I sell coffee beans.

329
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,080
Nice to meet you.

330
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,377
How about my beans?

331
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,440
What?

332
00:24:05,097 --> 00:24:06,160
Although they're not good,

333
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,800
they are really cheap.

334
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,520
It's profitable

335
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,160
when you blend mine

336
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
and yours.

337
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,120
Blend?

338
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,240
I've worked with Liu

339
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,280
for years,

340
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:18,400
and have made a big fortune

341
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,811
with just one firm.

342
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,868
If we two join hands...

343
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:24,160
No.

344
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Get away.

345
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm out of combat.

346
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,280
Attack done.

347
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,160
Ghost, give him a Game Over.

348
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,080
An Wenyi.

349
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
have you put enough pickled chillies sauce?

350
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,080
Don't worry.

351
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,640
Spice-laden Sichuan capsicum frutescens,

352
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,080
I put a spoonful of that.

353
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,600
Mister, here you are.

354
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,840
That lady offers you this.

355
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,005
And...

356
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,760
this one is for your uncle,

357
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,960
and this for your cousin.

358
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,125
- Enjoy. - What?

359
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:28,045
- What's your problem? - I'm so sorry.

360
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,240
- What the hell. - I'm sorry, manager.

361
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,137
We always have a good talk.

362
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,240
We've had fun,

363
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,040
and eaten tasty food,

364
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,320
so it's time to focus on training.

365
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,840
Wait for me!

366
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:44,034
Be careful.

367
00:25:44,662 --> 00:25:45,200
What?

368
00:25:46,182 --> 00:25:46,840
You rock.

369
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,068
I guess you want to talk with me.

370
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,360
Here. Take it back.

371
00:26:10,982 --> 00:26:12,120
No tricks this time.

372
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:13,480
Just take it.

373
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,280
# You are as always. #

374
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,320
It's of a lot of fun

375
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,040
to have your teammates to play Glory together.

376
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,080
But being a loner is also a nice option.

377
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,440
Whether you join us or not,

378
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:34,080
whoever you'll be,

379
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,000
hopefully,

380
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,520
we'll get to play Glory together.

381
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,640
It's a lovely day because of you.

382
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,200
# Keep calm even though I have to leave, #

383
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,365
You've never tried.

384
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,851
How can you be so sure?

385
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,960
I made the tea especially for you.

386
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,725
It can invigorate you.

387
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:01,245
Don't look at me.

388
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:02,240
Drink it.

389
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,000
We decide to name the guide

390
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,920
"The Scroll of Teaching"

391
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,400
for your outstanding contribution.

392
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,320
How about it?

393
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,360
Whether you join Team Xing Xin or not,

394
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,160
whoever you'll be,

395
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,200
hopefully,

396
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:19,640
we'll get to play Glory together.

397
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:23,400
# We go through deep and down. #

398
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:26,640
# We stand at the starry summit. #

399
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,120
I never thought I'd be so happy...

400
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:32,000
to be with others.

401
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:35,480
I want to befriend them.

402
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,160
I want to be one of the team.

403
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,960
# I have seen before. #

404
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,320
# The legend. #

405
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,760
I can't find the guide.

406
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:02,400
Luo Ji, have you made a backup?

407
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:05,120
What?

408
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:06,360
The guide.

409
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:08,205
No, I haven't.

410
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:09,885
I thought it's on the computer.

411
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,040
We're done for...

412
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,622
Come and find it.

413
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
It's... gone.

414
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:29,142
I... I feel like I saw Mo Fan.

415
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:32,617
Wait.

416
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,960
It's mine, don't do that.

417
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,480
It's mine.

418
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,662
Stop, stop, what are you doing?

419
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:50,308
It's mine! You don't take it.

420
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,200
You are here.

421
00:29:41,554 --> 00:29:41,920
You hungry?

422
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,520
No?

423
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,530
Uhh... I'm a little bit hungry.

424
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,491
Bao Zi, how about you?

425
00:29:52,182 --> 00:29:53,988
Uhh... I want to eat something,

426
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,691
and collect a package.

427
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,531
I just get this craving for some sunlight...

428
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,920
to help my body absorb calcium.

429
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:08,651
Take some food

430
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,251
before you go sunbathing.

431
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,954
How about Chinese steamed pork buns?

432
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,880
Hi...

433
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,800
We'll face Jia Shi in the next match, need to be ready.

434
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,342
I wonder about their players and roles.

435
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,480
I'm going to do some research...

436
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,765
= Do you know Team Xing Xin? Do you want to play eSports? =

437
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,342
= What's wrong with you? What the hell do you want? =

438
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,960
Surprise!

439
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,800
Welcome to Team Xing Xin.

440
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:26,468
Welcome.

441
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,520
Welcome.

442
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,760
Welcome.

443
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:32,920
Thank...

444
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,520
Be gentle next time.

445
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,022
= Team Xing Xin =

446
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,245
= Ye Xiu, Tang Rou, Qiao Yifan, Bao Zi, Luo Ji, An Wenyi, Wei Chen =
= Team Xing Xin =

447
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,580
= Ye Xiu, Tang Rou, Qiao Yifan, Bao Zi, Luo Ji, An Wenyi, Wei Chen, Mo Fan =
= Team Xing Xin =

448
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,920
When the battle starts,

449
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,960
you guys move to find appropriate positions,

450
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,131
leaving me and Ye Qiu alone.

451
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,148
Zhang Jiaxing, you'd first go to support others.

452
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
I must obliterate Jun Moxiao

453
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,080
in the first seven minutes.

454
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,057
Yes, captain.

455
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,000
There are other players except for Jun Moxiao.

456
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,640
What if they kill our Cleric

457
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:18,960
at the very beginning?

458
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:22,960
Four versus four, you are close competitors.

459
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,822
When Jun Moxiao is out,

460
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:27,394
the remaining players in Team Xing Xin,

461
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,971
are literally at the mercy of us.

462
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,394
What if Jun Moxiao rejects

463
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:32,320
your offer of single combat?

464
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,731
Su Mucheng, I'm the captain.

465
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:37,760
To ask him to fight a duel,

466
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,628
and to defeat him,

467
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:39,520
is not your concern.

468
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,097
What you should care

469
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,640
is whether you're an effective Launcher.

470
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,045
More importantly,

471
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:49,200
did you also contest Ye Qiu

472
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,560
in the same way?

473
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:56,200
At least when he was the captain,

474
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,760
he'd always put aside the personal

475
00:32:58,868 --> 00:32:59,805
when playing team sports.

476
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,880
You don't understand? He has it in for our team.

477
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,857
A player of his age

478
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:10,320
doesn't have to make a comeback.

479
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,691
But he...

480
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,280
he builds a team in the cafe before ours,

481
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:17,680
which is intended to humiliate me

482
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,600
and our team.

483
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,560
Do you think he would let us off the hook

484
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,040
after we stole his Leaf of Autumn?

485
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:28,400
Will you acknowledge me as your captain

486
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,800
if we're beaten?

487
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,960
Captain, there might be some misunderstandings.

488
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,840
Ye Qiu is a professional player,

489
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,880
who is committed to the game.

490
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,771
He resumes his career

491
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:44,914
because of his love for Glory

492
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,080
and for every moment during the matches.

493
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,874
Team Jia Shi, to him,

494
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
is no more than an opponent.

495
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,960
We are basically as ordinary as

496
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,217
any and every team that

497
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:53,474
he has ever triumphed over before.

498
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,948
The only difference is that

499
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,480
we are more competitive.

500
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,537
So he must be more serious

501
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:02,840
and proactive to raise his readiness.

502
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,400
Go for it, guys.

503
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,080
I'm going to get to practice.

504
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,880
Me too.

505
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,080
I'll take it as a yes

506
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,200
now that nobody else raises more questions.

507
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,320
Do you take notes and remember our tactics?

508
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,520
Of course yes.

509
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,360
I agree with captain Sun.

510
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,040
I have an idea.

511
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:43,371
You and I lead two teams to battle.

512
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,960
So everyone in the team

513
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,640
- knows your tactics better. - A good point.

514
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:47,474
Last time,

515
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:48,920
you dodged my Dragon Head Raising.

516
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,862
Today I'm gonna show you

517
00:35:51,885 --> 00:35:53,257
how amazing it is.

518
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,400
I won.

519
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,320
Did you?

520
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,268
Okay, let's call it a day.

521
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,840
You did cast the Dragon Head Raising,

522
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,217
but you still lost the game.

523
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,097
Do you think your version of Leaf of Autumn like that

524
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,468
can be recognized?

525
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,480
What on earth did you mean?

526
00:37:01,565 --> 00:37:02,285
To be frank,

527
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:03,960
Leaf of Autumn

528
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:06,080
merely represents an account card.

529
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,960
What people celebrate

530
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,445
is not the roles in Glory.

531
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,080
Instead, they cheer for the player behind,

532
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,720
who wins the title,

533
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,840
and presents the real Glory to them.

534
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,960
You always want to show us the so-called Dragon Head Raising.

535
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:21,680
But that's only a tool someone used

536
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:23,360
in order to succeed.

537
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
Ye Qiu was that someone.

538
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,360
Now it's you.

539
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,800
Sun Xiang,

540
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,685
if you really think you're much better,

541
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,600
then you have to make a case for it

542
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,320
by leading us to prevail against not only him,

543
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,400
but also other teams.

544
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:51,200
So what we need to do

545
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,160
is to focus on training and matches.

546
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,200
Jun Moxiao

547
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,680
or Team Xing Xin,

548
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,920
deserves a little attention

549
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,880
if we're championship-oriented.

550
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:07,240
Okay now, captain Sun,

551
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,600
have a good rest.

552
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,480
See you.

553
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,160
Why are you eating here?

554
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,280
Because food is not allowed there.

555
00:38:26,754 --> 00:38:27,725
I think it's a pretty big ask

556
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,188
to take Jia Shi forward.

557
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,417
You're right, we've got a formidable competitor.

558
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:36,228
And Ye Qiu's impact on us...

559
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,302
= Jia Shi; Battlemage=

560
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:38,217
is huge.
= Jia Shi; Battlemage=

561
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:38,525
= Jia Shi; Battlemage=

562
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,080
It's hard for our teammates to

563
00:38:40,114 --> 00:38:41,622
be comfortable with the forthcoming battle.

564
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,291
Captain, the information of Dragon Head Raising has been...

565
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,280
Wait, sit.

566
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,120
I want to talk with you.

567
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:08,982
Seems you've been working hard on this.

568
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:10,662
Can I...?

570
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:21,222
I saw you here multiple times.

571
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,497
- Are you seeking captain Sun? - No, I ain't.

572
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:28,777
You offer to investigate

573
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,742
the Dragon Head Raising and Ye Qiu?

574
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,125
How's the guild going?

575
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,034
Good, and quite busy.

576
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,902
Is there anything else wrong with it?

577
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,742
If not, would you excuse me?

578
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,897
Do you still want to join Jia Shi's Team 1?

579
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:55,988
Praisage matters a lot to our team.

580
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,257
Without your assistance,

581
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,582
we'll be short of materials and supplies.

582
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:06,994
However,

583
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,720
if you try to overreach yourself,

584
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,862
intervening in team affairs,

585
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,240
and causing divisions,

586
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,137
I won't hesitate to

587
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,851
send you packing.

588
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,200
Chen,

589
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,400
you've doing a good job as a guild master.

590
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,280
These do nothing for you.

Yes.

are you ready?

598

The killing rate is above 96 per cent.

Are you well-equipped?

600
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:15,131
Of course yes.

601
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:18,440
Okay, then...

602
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,400
let's go.
