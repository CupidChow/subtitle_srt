2
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,300
= Episode 4 =

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,240
This circle drawn by the expert

4
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,440
is to represent that we will fight together.

5
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,891
Inside the circle is the pure land,

6
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,720
outside the circle is the battlefield.

7
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,400
Am I right?

8
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,080
I mean

9
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
do not move out of the circle.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
But

11
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,440
What is his plan?

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,720
How dare he face the monster alone.

13
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,320
Did he killed the monster,

14
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,600
or was he eaten by it?

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll go and check it out.

16
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,000
We need to give him a few more minutes.

17
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
Expert has his own strategy.

18
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,040
We must show our grace.

19
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,040
Then our grace is...

20
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,960
Waiting.

21
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,320
Fifteen minutes have passed.

22
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,160
We've shown our grace well enough.

23
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Of course.

24
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,040
Then, the expert's strategy is...

25
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,040
There is only five minutes left

26
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,600
to break the record.

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,160
If we don't go out of the circle

28
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,400
we could be the biggest joke in the history of Glory.

29
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,992
This is what we called

30
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:00,960
"staying the same and responding to changes."

31
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,720
We are making ourselves a joke.

32
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,480
Guild master.

33
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Everyone, get ready.

34
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,560
Listen to me count down of three.

35
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,640
Then out of the circle.

36
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
Three.

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Three.

38
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,880
Two.

39
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,000
Congratulations to players of Lanxi Pavilion,

40
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,840
Lanhe, Jun Moxiao, Xizhou

41
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
Thunder, and Deng Huaye.

42
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,200
You have broken the record of Frost Forest.

43
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,240
The time is 15'24''11.

44
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,320
He did it! Only 15 minutes.

45
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,200
It is five minutes faster.

46
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,240
What did I say.

47
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,000
This is the expert I invited.

48
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,840
This is called"winning all by staying still."

49
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,640
With Jun Moxiao,

50
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
the world of 10th district

51
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,080
belongs to Lanxi Pavillion.

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

53
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,320
It must be the expert who is coming to me.

54
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,240
Jun Moxiao is out of Lanxi Pavilion.

55
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,000
What?

56
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
It's over.

57
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,680
Go, go, go, go.

58
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,880
Go.

59
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
You get me a cup of coffee.

60
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,560
Be quickly.

61
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,000
You,

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,000
go to water the flowers.

63
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,480
You.

64
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
Forget it.

65
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,053
= Congratulation to Han Yanrou has completed the misson of Novice Village =

66
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,840
Tang,

67
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,240
why don't you choose a Launcher like me?

68
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
I can teach you about it.

69
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,240
But I like to see my opponent

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,640
falling in front of me.

71
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,680
Then choose Battlemage.

72
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,240
My idol, Leaf of Autumn is of this profession.

73
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,440
I, Tang Rou, will never lose to nobody.

74
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,600
Everybody.

75
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,160
Mu Cheng,

76
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,920
today marks the first training

77
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
with Jia Shi's new captain.

78
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,600
This is a new running-in,

79
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,320
and also a mutual understanding.

80
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,240
I believe with Sun Xiang's joining in,

81
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,120
and the efforts of all of you here,

82
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,080
Jia Shi will surely create another brilliant future.

83
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,280
My goal is to

84
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,360
open a new era of Jia Shi.

85
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,880
Starting from today,

86
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,680
Sun Xiang is the core of

87
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,840
Jia Shi Dynasty.

88
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,280
Take the responsibility of captain, in the name of the post,

89
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,320
to complete the captain's mission.

90
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,800
Sun Xiang,

91
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
Jia Shi's future

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
depends on you.

93
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,160
We will fight Lan Yu in the next competition.

94
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,480
Now, start simulation training.

95
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,040
Everyone starts training.

96
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
Congratulations to Boss Tao for getting an excellent talent.

97
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,200
Thank you.

98
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,040
Ye Qiu's revenge on me was personal.

99
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,320
Now, fortunately, the mean guy was driven away.

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,360
Can I return..

101
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,960
Ye Qiu retired voluntarily.

102
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
No one wants to drive him away.

103
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,000
Ye Hui,

104
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,560
you can eat whatever you like,

105
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,440
but should speak carefully.

106
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,200
Sorry. I have no other intentions.

107
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,720
I just want to return.

108
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,880
When Ye Qiu drove you away,

109
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,600
he is still the captain.

110
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,880
Everyone, attack.

111
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,280
Striker in the middle, Qi Master cover him.

112
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,160
Launcher moves faster.

113
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,440
Launcher attacks to cut the rhythm.

114
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,560
Launcher, what's the matter with you?

115
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,160
You are always so slow.

116
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Launcher do not rely on speed to win.

117
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,280
For fast speed, you have Assassin and Ninja.

118
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
Do you mean

119
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,800
there is something wrong with my tactical arrangement?

120
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
Have you arranged tactics?

121
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
Sorry, I didn't see any cooperation.

122
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,320
I only saw everyone following you,

123
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
running all around.

124
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
That's because you can't keep pace with me.

125
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,840
What era is it now?

126
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,760
Launcher still moves behind.

127
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,080
I think you're too comfortable

128
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,400
while Ye Qiu was the captain.

129
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,160
That's why you are not used to the new style of fighting now.

130
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,480
Ye Qiu's tactics are just that

131
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,440
he fights in front and finds good positions.

132
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,720
You hides behind in a blind corner

133
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
to attack.

134
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,520
Over and over again, just a few moves.

135
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,040
It's so boring,

136
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,080
and has no excitement.

137
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,160
Not bad, you answered the phone quickly.

138
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,480
It seems that you've been enjoying good days recently.

139
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,160
I have to.

140
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,080
Recently, friends have called me one after another

141
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
sneering my miserable situation.

142
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,320
When my phone rings,

143
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,640
I will answer it automatically.

144
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,680
You lied.

145
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,240
Your phone has always been in silent mode.

146
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,400
You never answer a call from anyone.

147
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
To look for you,

148
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,520
one has to be in front of you,

149
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
and shout to you face to face.

150
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,200
So, you can shout to me now.

151
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,760
You're not in front of me.

152
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,280
Am I?

153
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,920
The curtains in your room.

154
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,400
Why hasn't it been fixed yet?

155
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,160
You are in my room now?

156
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
I just want to see

157
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,240
if you have changed the password of your room.

158
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
Do you still remember the password of your room?

159
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,600
First, don't blame anyone at the resuming meeting tomorrow.

160
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,320
Second, don't blame me if you want to blame somebody.

161
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
Third, even if you want to blame me.

162
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,480
No more than three sentences.

163
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,880
What about the fourth?

164
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,320
First, at the training meeting

165
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
don't get angry with your new teammate.

166
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,560
Second, don't sulk when you are angry.

167
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
just say it out.

168
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,320
Third, if you sulk,

169
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,160
stop it within three minutes.

170
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,160
Fourth.

171
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,720
Fourth.

172
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,120
When angry and sad,

173
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,320
rush to Jia Shi and shout.

174
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,000
Shout what?

175
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,360
Shout

176
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,000
one, two, three, four.

177
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,640
From now on, don't miss my call.

178
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,080
One, two, three, four,

179
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,280
this string of simple numbers

180
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,080
is all the tacit understanding between us.

181
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,320
But I still want to stand in front of you

182
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
to press these four numbers for you.

183
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,000
My idol.

184
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Boss, I'll come back to you later.

185
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,600
In a few days, it will be Jia Shi's year-end launch event.

186
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,000
Should we organize an activity

187
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,680
to assist Ye Qiu.

188
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,920
The time has come to support my idol.

189
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,080
I'll pay all the expenses. Come on.

190
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,160
Let me show you something big to

191
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,480
interest all of you.

192
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,360
Possibility in impossibility

193
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,440
is the best interpretation of competitive spirit

194
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,000
of my idol, Ye Qiu,

195
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,440
His unique skill Dragon Head Raising

196
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,680
is also a legend in the history of Glory.

197
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,640
First, use the strongest move of Battlemage of the blade level,

198
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,720
Dragon Soaring.

199
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,120
Then use his invincible hand speed

200
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
and micro-operations

201
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,720
to forcibly change the trajectory of Dragon Soaring

202
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,562
which makes it impossible for the opponent

203
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:24,720
to evade the attack at all.

204
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
He has proved with his strength that

205
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,240
there is no the strongest, only stronger.

206
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,040
Such an excellent video still can't attract you guys.

207
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,920
What are you guys doing?

208
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
Boss, what's wrong out there?

209
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,480
So noisy outside.

210
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
I lost the game because of it.

211
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,000
Sorry, sorry.

212
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,400
I'll go out and have a look.

213
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,240
Chu.

214
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I'll take a look.

215
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Over there, over there.

216
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,600
Tear it up.

217
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,160
Lever it.

218
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,440
What are you doing?

219
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,800
Do you know who he is?

220
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,000
Who cares?

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,080
I just work for the money.

222
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,120
Hurry up.

223
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,640
Hurry up and tear it up.

224
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,560
Done.

225
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,680
He is Leaf of Autumn who has the skill of Dragon Head Raising.

226
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,280
# Your old coat feels like an umbrella #

227
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,040
# Give me a blue sky and shield wind and rain #

228
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:17,760
# You are like my private investigator #

229
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,600
# Understand my every move and expression #

230
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,440
# You are the best in my heart #

231
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,560
# Time sometimes flies so fast when we are together #

232
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,400
# Sometimes time becomes so slow #

233
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,520
# You are my dearest in my heart #

234
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,680
# You will always be my support #

235
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,240
# I will care about you forever #

236
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,880
# I think about you every moment #

237
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,320
We won. Nice.

238
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,600
My father is a fan of Ye Qiu.

239
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,120
Such a virtual role

240
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,840
let this group of people of different ages and occupations,

241
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,760
and adults who don't even know each other

242
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
become a group of sincere

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,920
and passionate teenagers.

244
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,760
Father's running this Net Cafe

245
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,920
is more like running a business

246
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,760
about dreams of Glory.

247
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,080
He told me that in one's life

248
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,600
there will be many impossible moments.

249
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,600
We must learn to live in these desperate situations,

250
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,960
and constantly break through oneself

251
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,720
to look for unlimited possibilities

252
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,760
for growth.

253
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,000
After my father died, I refused to sell the Net Cafe.

254
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
I firmly believe that I understand the meaning of Leaf of Autumn.

255
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,520
I can become the real master of Xingxin Net Cafe

256
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,240
and the make my father proud.

257
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,600
But today,

258
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,880
you left,

259
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,520
and was replaced.

260
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,160
my spiritual worship disappears.

261
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,920
# I will care about you forever #

262
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,360
# you are the best in my heart #

263
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,040
# You make every idle moment #

264
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,960
# interesting again #

265
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:57,160
# You are my dearest in my heart #

266
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Dad, you chose the launcher

267
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,480
as my profession in Glory.

268
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,000
You said it does not matter how far away the target is.

269
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,400
As long as I keep my focus and never give up,

270
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,920
I will get the target eventually.

271
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,920
I will not give up,

272
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
not only running the Net Cafe,

273
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,840
but also the Leaf of Autumn.

274
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,520
Tang.

275
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,240
Tang.

276
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,480
You've been watching the strategy all night.

277
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,160
No Leaf of Autumn.

278
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,760
Guoguo.

279
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,920
Can I help you?

280
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,240
This persistent spirit of yours

281
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,520
is very athletic.

282
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,080
I stayed up all night.

283
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,600
But the effect is not significant.

284
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,200
Actually,

285
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,000
this Ye Qiu's style of play

286
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,440
does not fit the newbies

287
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,920
like us.

288
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,760
He is good at creating miracles in the impossibility.

289
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,680
It is called the brilliant tactics.

290
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,440
It can only imagine but can't be mastered.

291
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,320
You know so much about him.

292
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,760
The network manager told me this.

293
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,240
You are telling the truth

294
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,120
but sounds like a lie.

295
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,840
A confident truth is the truth.

296
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,400
Where does your confidence come from?

297
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,400
Confidence.

298
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,160
Network manager.

299
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,520
Network manager, come here.

300
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,840
Boss, wait a minute.

301
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,000
Tang, let me tell you something.

302
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,080
My Network manager imitates Ye Qiu

303
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,160
just like Ye Qiu himself.

304
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
His level is too high for you.

305
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,000
I won't compete with your network manager.

306
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,240
After all, his name is like Ye Qiu,

307
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,400
He wins.

308
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,840
Just by looking at the strategy,

309
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,960
it doesn't work at all.

310
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,000
You need actual combat training.

311
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,520
You practice with him first.

312
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,320
Thank you.

313
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,200
Your network manager

314
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,480
has already played with me.

315
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,160
He is handsome and speaks clearly.

316
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,000
He is also polite. You can let him stay.

317
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,040
I'm talking about the training.

318
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
If you don't want to practice, it's ok. Actually.

319
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,440
Actually what?

320
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,360
Is this a question of training?

321
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,800
It's a question of homework for me

322
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,840
or my control of her.

323
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,840
If she practiced with all her heart,

324
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,560
she won't have time to ask about your lessons.

325
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,000
This is a clever secret tactic.

326
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,200
You flattered me.

327
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,280
Now everything is ready, only the east wind is needed.

328
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,160
Do you know who that east wind is?

329
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,120
It's you.

330
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,080
I can't.

331
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,240
She is in fields beyond my knowledge.

332
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,800
I really don't understand her temper and thoughts.

333
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,360
Too elegant for me.

334
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,240
Sit down.

335
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,400
Sit well.

336
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,280
First, add friends to establish contact.

337
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,280
Come on.

338
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,160
Fine.

339
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,040
You little bastare.

340
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:30,669
= Apply to add Han Yanrou as a friend =

341
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:33,392
= She refused your applicaion =

342
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,800
Look, I was rejected mercilessly.

343
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,160
Wait a minute.

344
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,840
Refusal is a woman's natural privilege.

345
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,280
Grace is a woman's inherent attribute.

346
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,880
As a man, do you know what you should do?

347
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,120
Do it repeatedly.

348
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Keep adding her.

349
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,040
As a man, I have my own dignity.

350
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,840
What?

351
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,160
When the girl is interested

352
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,760
repeatedly adding is called determination.

353
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,240
When she is not,

354
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,400
the more you repeat,

355
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,640
the less opportunity you get.

356
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,480
Really? Who is the boss here.

357
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,200
Now you seems to forget who is the boss

358
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
and who is the network manager.

359
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
How about the debt? Let's figure it out

360
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,280
or you think about it again.

361
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,360
Who is the boss?

362
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,240
I know, I know you are the boss.

363
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,520
How about your dignity?

364
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,120
Little bastard, add her.

365
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
Adding her just like go through an iron wall.

366
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,120
Did you watch the match yesterday.

367
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,080
Yes, I did.

368
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,760
That is amazing.

369
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,840
Very good.

370
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,320
The players have all arrived.

371
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
They are waiting for your decision.

372
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,800
Blood gunman Yager, are you sure of that?

373
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,040
We got the news from our man in Zhong Caotang guild.

374
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,520
The map was refreshed just a minute ago.

375
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,360
Now, Zhong Caotang guild and Chen Qianzi guild

376
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,440
has already arrived.

377
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,000
The Ambitions guild is on its way too.

378
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,960
Okay, hurry up.

379
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,840
Open the computer quickly.

380
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,400
Go, go, go.

381
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,520
Join the game, quickly.

382
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,160
You do it first.

383
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I'll be back soon.

384
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,080
Where are you going?

385
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,280
All of you, focus.

386
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,560
Captain Jiexi is watching you all here.

387
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,840
Zhong Caotang must kill the boss this time.

388
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,680
Captain Jiexi cannot be humiliated.

389
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,720
Do you understand?

390
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,800
Understand.

391
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,280
Everybody, listen up.

392
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,160
Although we won the first kill last time,

393
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,600
it took half an hour.

394
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,960
This kind of mistake

395
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,200
is absolutely not allowed this time.

396
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,840
Yes, guild master.

397
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,160
Tell me your goals.

398
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,480
High Level, High Efficiency and High Concentration.

399
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,120
Okay, here comes the moment

400
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,680
for you to show your strength.

401
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,040
Blood gunman Yager,

402
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,440
it is ours.

403
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,000
Get ready, everyone.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,600
Victory is just ahead.

405
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,640
The Ambitions guild has arrived.

406
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,920
Its leader is

407
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,440
the shameless man called Ye Du Han Tan.

408
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,720
The Zhong Caotang guild has also arrived.

409
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,560
So is the Che Qianzi guild.

410
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
But the two of them haven't launched attacks yet.

411
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,760
The Blood Gunman is too powerful.

412
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
The guild attacks first

413
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,440
will be the first to lose.

414
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,920
Let's see what's their plans.

415
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,520
You come here very fast.

416
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,320
Not as fast as you who can fly.

417
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,000
Who will attack first?

418
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
You, you do it first.

419
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,840
You first, and we Ambitions behind you.

420
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,240
If we attack first,

421
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,360
will you not rob my trophies?

422
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,120
You are right. I don't want to die for the Ambitions guild.

423
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,240
You have no qualification to speak.

424
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,600
As a man dumped by Jun Moxiao,

425
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
it's ashamed of you to be here.

426
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,800
Shame on you.

427
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,560
You must have arranged spy in my guild.

428
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,560
Blue, you were dumped.

429
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,400
So miserable.

430
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,840
I really want to see your green face now.

431
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,640
Not greener than faces of your Zhong Caotang guild.

432
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,600
All right, cut the crap.

433
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,720
Soon, the more guilds come,

434
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
the less chance we have.

435
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,040
Why don't we do this together.

436
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,160
How about it?

437
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,360
OK.

438
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,000
Three.

439
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,520
Two.

440
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
One.

441
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,040
Why don't you move forward?

442
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,800
We are preparing.

443
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,800
And you?

444
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,080
We are also preparing for it.

445
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,480
Who is attacking the monster there?

446
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,800
Facing the shooting of Blood Gunman,

447
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
he is not hurt at all.

448
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,360
Awesome.

449
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,880
So cool.

450
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,320
Where did this Bao Zi, the Invader come from?

451
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,840
Nice knee attack.

452
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,960
Hit back when being attacked.

453
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,280
This war consciousness is great.

454
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,680
Here comes another expert.

455
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Flexibility of action, and attacking just in place.

456
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,840
He moves like dancing.

457
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,600
Is the Throwing Sand skill only resulting in blind

458
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,000
when it hits the eyes?

459
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,800
Why he aims at the head.

460
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,880
Haha, this consciousness is equal to nothing.

461
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,160
That's awesome.

462
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,480
I have never seen such a cool method of suicide before.

463
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,240
I thought it was a big meat bun,

464
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,400
it turns out to be a small white steamed bread without stuffing.

465
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,160
He is a super newbie.

466
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,840
A Glory newbie.

467
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,200
Why don't you two go up and help.

468
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,480
All right, let's go.

469
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,520
I'll cover for you two.

470
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,480
Lao Ye, I know what's in your mind.

471
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,640
Too obvious.

472
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,960
Lao Che and I will not fight with each other

473
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
and let you win easily.

474
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,320
He is losing HP. Bao Zi wouldn't make it.

475
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,240
Are we really just standing here?

476
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,680
Wait.

477
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,000
Wait again?

478
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,000
An expert has his own strategy.

479
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,840
You do it first.

480
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll be back soon.

481
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,000
What are you doing?

482
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
Expert, we are planning to attack Blood Gunman.

483
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
Are you interested?

484
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,200
Yes.

485
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,240
The rule remains the same.

486
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,920
Send me the coordinates.

487
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,440
Expert, you are here.

488
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,600
We are all ready.

489
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,840
Let's fight together later.

490
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,600
We Lanxi Pavilion are under your command.

491
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,080
All the rare materials are yours.

492
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,720
Lao Lan, you cheated and asked for external aid again.

493
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,120
Killing the Blood Gunman is a task

494
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,560
for the capable man.

495
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,720
I have the ability to find external aid.

496
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,880
Am I wrong?

497
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,600
Right. Kill the Boss by you own skills.

498
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,200
What!

499
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,880
Expert, why did you form a team with others again?

500
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,240
Lao Lan, you were dumped again.

501
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,840
Just relax.

502
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,920
What do you know? This is strategy.

503
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,920
You bring in an expert to form a wild team.

504
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,400
Impressive!

505
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Ten o'clock position.

506
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,920
Throwing sand at the Gunman's eyes.

507
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,920
For quick and right,

508
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,760
I suggest you use choose the latter.

509
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,160
Don't stop attacking.

510
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,560
Move to the 6 o'clock position.

511
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
Using brick.

512
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,160
Don't throw it.

513
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,800
Double the damage by directly patting the back of its head.

514
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,360
Hook.

515
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,400
Slow down now.

516
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,880
We have to control the rhythm.

517
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,120
Why?

518
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
Wait for the fishermen.

519
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,040
Dear me! The cooperation is tacit and accuracy.

520
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,320
The newbie is totally different now.

521
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,800
He may pretend just now.

522
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,520
Lao Lan, say something.

523
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,240
What kind of strategy is this? I can't understand it.

524
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,440
Guild master, what's Jun Moxiao's plan?

525
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,600
The Blood Gunman is on the verge of being killed.

526
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,240
Jun Moxiao is decreasing their output.

527
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,600
They're not going to make it.

528
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,320
The timing is perfect.

529
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,600
You cowards.

530
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Just a hard fight.

531
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,480
Nothing to be afraid.

532
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,680
Ambitions guild follow me.

533
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,480
The Zhong Caotang is behind the Ambitions.

534
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,920
Guild master.

535
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,960
Let's do it.

536
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,920
Copy.

537
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,800
Taken the bait.

538
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,840
Bao Zi, full output.

539
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,920
OK.

540
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,640
Hook.

541
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,440
Bao Zi.

542
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,280
At one o'clock direction, hide behind the stone.

543
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,160
Stay safe.

544
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,720
Jun Moxiao and Baozi ran away.

545
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,320
It seems that they have reached the limit of attack.

546
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,880
What did I say?

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,360
The first come, the first die.

548
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,800
That's right, that's right, that's right.

549
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,360
Want to run.

550
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,800
The Blood Gunman is upgrading.

551
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,680
The Blood Gunman is upgrading.

552
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Be careful.

553
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.

554
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,560
Run, run.

555
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,000
Too late.

556
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,040
As a guild master, I lose

557
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
in such a wild place.

558
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,200
Jun Moxiao, you are too bad.

559
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,040
Jun Moxiao.

560
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,440
Don't let me meet you in Glory in the future.

561
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,040
What should we do in case we meet him?

562
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,960
Of course, we will solicit him.

563
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,320
Start our performance.

564
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,600
Congratulations on Jun Moxiao and Bao Zi, the Invader

565
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,480
for the first kill of the Blood Gunman.

566
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,080
This is my first kill.

567
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,000
Expert, you are so great.

568
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,600
You played well, too.

569
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,200
Yes, I also think I played well.

570
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,720
Expert, call me to fight next time.

571
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,480
No problem.

572
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,360
My name is Bao Rongxing. I am a warehouse keeper.

573
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,200
My friends always call me Baozi.

574
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,880
In addition to enjoying the pleasure of my work,

575
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,040
my hobby in leisure time is playing Glory.

576
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,520
I didn't expect today

577
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,080
I got the affirmation of an expert.

578
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,880
My dream is to join a professional team,

579
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,400
play in a real match,

580
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,560
and become a real professional player.

581
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,520
The guild master lost the match just now.

582
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,600
What? Impossible.

583
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,480
I heard that there was an expert.

584
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,720
Expert, you didn't help me.

585
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,600
You said it yourself

586
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,480
the head of Boss belongs to the capable player.

587
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,400
This time

588
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,040
you shamed the Ambition and Zhong Caotang.

589
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,600
They will be revenged on you.

590
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,040
Really? I just talked with them

591
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,840
and have an appointment to fight together next time.

592
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,000
They have no bottom line

593
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,800
and invite you to fight together.

594
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,520
Do you want to?

595
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,560
I do.

596
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,560
Which place?

597
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,360
The Boneyard.

598
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,400
Prepare the materials.

599
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,600
I'll let you know when I have time.

600
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,520
The expert is still on our side.

601
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,480
The material created from fighting

602
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,400
has limited effect on the promotion of the weapon attribute.

603
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,320
But the attribute added by rare materials

604
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,600
can reach the top.

605
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,560
So the best weapon must be rare materials.

606
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,800
The rarity of materials does not lie in the exposure rate

607
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,120
but in the refresh probability of the hidden leader.

608
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
This is the meaning of "rare".

609
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,120
Win again.

610
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,640
Just a little luck.

611
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,520
It is clear that you are powful.

612
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,400
At the time of modesty one must be low-key.

613
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,120
At the time of high-profile one must show off.

614
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,920
I really don't have a strategy.

615
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
You are really experienced.

616
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,800
Adding friends failed and files was rejected.

617
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,960
What can I do? I am also very helpless.

618
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,294
If you failed to add friends,

619
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:19,280
you can teach her by words and deed.

620
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,320
If she don't receive the file, you can change your strategy.

621
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,240
I have no advice for you.

622
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,240
I am also very irritable.

623
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,120
"Irritable" can't solve the problem either.

624
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,760
Are you sure you can't finish the task?

625
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,920
I...

626
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,760
definitely...

627
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,080
can finish the task

628
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,600
under the guidance of you boss.

629
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,160
The deadline is 24 hours.

630
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,440
When the time runs out,

631
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,840
I want to see a successful smile,

632
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,240
not a losing face.
