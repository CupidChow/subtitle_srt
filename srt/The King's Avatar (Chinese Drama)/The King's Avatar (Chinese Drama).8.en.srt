= Episode 8 =

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,520
By the way, Yingjie.

4
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I heard that the restaurant we always go to

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,680
is going to decorate recently.

6
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,360
We may not be able to

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,000
eat their takeout for a long time.

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,160
So you have to help me eat more these days.

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,040
Why this expression?

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,880
I'm just going to train for a few days.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
I will come back.

12
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,800
Come back early.

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,880
Of course, when I come back

14
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,520
you must defeat that Jun Moxiao.

15
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,240
I heard them say

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
that the captain intends to train you to be a successor.

17
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,800
Yingjie, come on.

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
You too, come on.

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,280
Actually, I think it would be nice

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
for Yifan to go to the Glory training camp.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,200
If he stays in our team,

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,480
it's even worse for him to be a servant forever.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,680
Okay, thank you.

25
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,800
Did you see the man's operation yesterday?

26
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,200
This is hilarious.

27
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah, that's funny.

28
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
I never know there can be such a mistake.

29
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,320
Yeah.

30
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
Yifan, it's your report card.

31
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
We know that you've been working very hard.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
And you've also made progress.

33
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,071
But the competition in the team is too intense

34
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:41,280
and places are also limited.

35
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,680
If you go back to Wei Cao with your current scores,

36
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,920
you've got no chance to play either.

37
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,680
We suggest that you continue your study here.

38
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,920
And go back when you have a chance.

39
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,320
Then I'll leave now.

40
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
You've got ideas, but unfortunately,

41
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,640
you didn't realize your problem.

42
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,480
Senior, I'd like to play again.

43
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,120
To defeat me?

44
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,760
Not. To be defeated.

45
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,040
I want to be defeated again by you.

46
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,800
I want to know what my problem is.

47
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,200
Why all my efforts are useless?

48
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
Meet me at the arena.

49
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
I should have escaped that Double Hit

50
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
within ten seconds.

51
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,200
But I still got hit.

52
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,520
Senior deliberately exposed three flaws

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
and I didn't catch them.

54
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,160
Hesitation made me miss the best time.

55
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,240
Throat cutting is not hard enough. Shining Cut is not fast enough.

56
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,680
All the skills in my hands are useless.

57
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,760
I've really got too many problems.

58
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

59
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,280
But you have a very good overall awareness.

60
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
Overall awareness.

61
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,120
But it can't help me

62
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
to kill one more person for the team.

63
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,320
But it can let you help your team win.

64
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,560
This is a very rare trait.

65
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
Senior, can I ask you in person?

66
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
Find me here.

67
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
I hope the guidance from senior

68
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,920
can help me see

69
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,520
where my future path is.

70
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
Don't think that I didn't know.

71
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
Last time, that group of people are from Wei Cao.

72
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,520
The professional lineup has sold you out.

73
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,080
I never expect that you are still playing Glory.

74
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
Wang Jiexi, mind your words.

75
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,080
Though I've retired, I still can play Glory.

76
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,040
You're free anyway.

77
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Let's solo in the arena. I can pay for the materials.

78
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Don't cry when you lose.

79
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,240
There's no need for me do solo with you.

80
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,080
I've got many players who can practice with you.

81
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,560
Don't play tricks with me.

82
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,080
Do I look like someone

83
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,200
who would be your trainer?

84
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,920
Haven't given up yet.

85
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,080
If you stay inside this map for a few more days,

86
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
those novice players

87
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,680
may think you're a non-player character.

88
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Tang got pissed off here,

89
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,760
she's waiting for that guy

90
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
to get her revenge.

91
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
Though it's a bit miserable.

92
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

93
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,880
The world of Glory is so big.

94
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,462
She has to see how great they are

95
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:25,800
before she can catch up with them.

96
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
What do you mean?

97
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,840
She was at the peak of Glory

98
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,880
when she started to play the game in the first place.

99
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,400
If she can't understand this,

100
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
she'll lose her mind after losing a few more matches.

101
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Don't talk if you don't know how to.

102
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,000
Write your homework.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,520
You...

104
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
It doesn't matter if I lose,

105
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
I can fight until I win.

106
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,000
Tang is foolhardy. Maybe one day,

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
it can become her advantage.

108
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,960
Looks like I have to

109
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:00,960
take Wang Jiexi's materials.

110
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,920
It's not impossible to practice with your members.

111
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
But I only ask for one thing.

112
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,560
I've got a friend here.

113
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,920
If you want to fight me, you have to defeat her first.

114
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,080
No problem.

115
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,080
This is the cake I bought for Tang.

116
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
How can you eat it?

117
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Spit it out.

118
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
You wronged me, boss.

119
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Tang is too busy to eat.

120
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
She's still playing?

121
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,080
Almost two hours.

122
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,760
Then why don't you persuade her?

123
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,160
No.

124
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,520
You've got your own mind now,

125
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,774
you dare to talk back to your boss.

126
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:29,340
Go.

127
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,120
Ask her to come here and eat a piece of cake

128
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Fine, if you don't go,

129
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
you don't need to do the work as the network manager.

130
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,280
Okay, I'll go.

131
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,400
You're the one who want her to play Glory every day.

132
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
You're also the one who doesn't want her to do so.

133
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,160
The timing of this transition is really difficult to handle.

134
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,960
What are you whispering about?

135
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,400
What do you want to say?

136
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,320
You're doing good.

137
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
Go and have a rest and drink some water.

138
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Pause is for a better victory.

139
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
You are mocking me.

140
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,080
What's good about losing ten matches
when I only played ten.

141
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
you lost ten times.

142
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440
In the first match, you fought with the Witch.

143
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,760
You were hit by three traps successively in nineteen seconds.

144
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
The second match is with Battlemage.

145
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,680
It only took twenty two seconds.

146
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,840
You fought a counterattack.

147
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,600
The third match is with the Deceitful Sword. You lost in 26 seconds.

148
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,240
Because you didn't see the situation clearly.

149
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
But you cost half of his HP.

150
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,080
The fourth match took 33 seconds.

151
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,200
The fifth match took 41 seconds.

152
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,560
And the tenth match just now,

153
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
you insisted for the whole one and a half minutes.

154
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
Though you lost, you've also made progress.

155
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,920
You won't fall for the same trick for twice.

156
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,480
You can feel that, right?

157
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
My goal is to defeat my opponent.

158
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
Not to talk about how long has the match lasted.

159
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,520
That's difficult.

160
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,560
What do you mean?

161
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,160
In the last match, you were fighting the Witch.

162
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,040
Although you insisted for an unprecedented one and a half minutes,

163
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,120
you fell into his trap successively for three times.

164
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,600
At the beginning, he lured you to use all the tricks.

165
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,080
The Dragon Tooth and Sky-strike were used too early too.

166
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
which were half- blocked by the opponent.

167
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,640
Has anyone ever told you

168
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,920
Chuan-eyebrow can cause arrhythmia.

169
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,480
Nonsense.

170
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,440
In the fight of Glory, apart from skills,

171
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,400
it's actually about psychology in most cases.

172
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,920
Fighting fiercely is your advantage.

173
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,680
But if you're being led by others,

174
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,600
then it will become disadvantage.

175
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,840
There's another battle. You can do it, champ.

176
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,400
Tang, you've been playing for more than two hours.

177
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,600
Take a break and have a piece of cake.

178
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,800
Tang. Now I want to...

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
Let me fight him.

180
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,200
I desperately want to play now.

181
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,600
Let me play. Come on.

182
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,560
Just leave it to me.

183
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,160
You should eat some cakes.

184
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,560
Guoguo, you've been working so hard recently,

185
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
I authorize you not to study for one day, okay?

186
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
If you study everyday, then can you make progress.

187
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
I love studying.

188
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,280
Then...

189
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,800
The weapon you wanted last time in Kongji City,

190
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll buy it for you.

191
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,520
No.

192
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,520
Then I'll make a cake for you myself, okay?

193
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
I don't want to eat.

194
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,520
Guoguo.

195
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,120
I'm really angry.

196
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,400
And it is the kind of anger that you can't make up for.

197
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,880
I can't make up for it?

198
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,760
Then I'll give up.

199
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,920
Then you're not interested in

200
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,000
going out out together either.

201
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
That'll do.

202
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,800
Finally, there's something you want.

203
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,920
It's a deal then.

204
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,360
Wherever you want to go, whatever do you want to eat.

205
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,640
I promise that I'll show up whenever you call me.

206
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,560
I'd like to drink milk tea.

207
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,040
No problem. I'll line up to buy it for you.

208
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,360
I want to eat a cake.

209
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I'll make it for you myself.

210
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,480
I want to eat hot pot.

211
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,240
Then we can go to eat that

212
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,160
whenever we want.

213
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,600
Don't be angry, okay?

214
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,560
Then you have to accompany me more in the future.

215
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,200
You can't keep playing Dungeon.

216
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,760
Do your words counts?

217
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,520
Yes.

218
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,160
Then I have to think about what to eat first.

219
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,200
Thirty five.

220
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Thirty six.

221
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,400
Go left.

222
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,680
Are you stupid?

223
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,640
I told you to go left, then you should go left.

224
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Why did you go right?

225
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,040
Do you have any reaction speed?

226
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,760
I'm telling you, it's good that you met me.

227
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,280
You would've be  extorted if you met someone else.

228
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,320
Do you know that?

229
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,840
Sorry to cause trouble for you.

230
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,703
A mechanical keyboard?

231
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:19,515
you also play eSports?

232
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Do you play Glory? What's your District and Profession?

233
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
Have you ever had a record of Dungeon?

234
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Let me tell you, I'm a very good ranger.

235
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,640
When do you have time? I can take you to play the Dungeon.

236
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,920
What do you think?

237
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,240
By the way, where are you going?

238
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,080
I'm... I'm trying to find a Net Cafe.

239
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,920
Great, let's go. I'll give you a ride.

240
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,800
Let me tell you,

241
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,560
the master says that my reaction speed is fast.

242
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,920
He says that I'm clever and savvy.

243
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,720
It's very suitable for me to be a professional player.

244
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,800
From you appearance,

245
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,240
I think you're a rookie of Glory.

246
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,440
But don't lose your faith.

247
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,400
It was the same for me when I first started playing.

248
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,320
After a period of time,

249
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
the master taught me a lot.

250
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,280
Thank you. I'll just get off there.

251
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,320
Who do you think I am?

252
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,040
Am I the kind of person who gives up halfway?

253
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,840
I told you that I would take you there.

254
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Sit properly.

255
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,760
What's the name of your account? I can add you.

256
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,280
It's okay for you to add me.

257
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,440
Let me tell you. In Glory,

258
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,200
I am a very good ranger.

259
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
My account's name is...

260
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,120
Stop, stop, stop, stop

261
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

262
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,640
Is this Xing Xin Net Cafe?

263
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,240
I am using practical actions

264
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,600
to teach you another trick.

265
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000
It's called going beyond the limit is as bad as falling short.

266
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,360
Be careful in the future.

267
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

268
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,200
Let's keep our friendship.

269
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,240
We shall meet again some day.

270
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,720
Thank you.

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,360
Hello.

272
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,600
Is Junmo laughing here?

273
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
He's inside.

274
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,840
Thank you

275
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,160
Jun Moxiao?

276
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,680
Jun Moxiao.

277
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,000
Jun Moxiao.

278
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Are you Jun Moxiao?

279
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,160
Jun Moxiao. Jun Moxiao.

280
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,080
You are Jun Moxiao.

281
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,920
It's me.

282
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,560
I am Bao Zi.

283
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,320
Boss, this is called predestination.

284
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,200
For you,

285
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,640
it may be just a small encounter.

286
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,840
But for me,

287
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,240
it's an encounter which cost a long time of waiting.

288
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,640
Hello, senior, my name is Qiao Yifan.

289
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
What senior?

290
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,840
This is my boss.

291
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,520
The God can only be ranked second.

292
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,760
Do you understand this?

293
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,320
Come on. Bow to him.

294
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
Hello, senior, my name is Qiao Yifan.

295
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
Aka the Assassin Grey Moon.

296
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,080
I'd like to...

297
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
You want to do the Dungeon with him, right?

298
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,520
No, I want to...

299
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,160
Do you want to see the thousand-machine umbrella?

300
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
No.

301
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,000
Senior, last time you told me.

302
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,760
What?  Last time?

303
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,840
It's not the first you meet each other?

304
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,360
When?

305
00:20:08,362 --> 00:20:09,157
Which year, which month, which day,

306
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,007
which hour, which minute, which second?

307
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,160
Before you get to know me or after?

308
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,200
Boss, I want the precise time.

309
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,280
Do you admit it or not

310
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,680
that I am your first opening apprentice.

311
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,600
Of course.

312
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,120
From now on, I'll give you task

313
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,080
to open the door every morning.

314
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Then that means you admitted

315
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,480
my identity as your first apprentice.

316
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,080
I just admitted that your job was to open the door.

317
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,600
My eldest apprentice Han Yanrou

318
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,800
is there.

319
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,960
Han Yanrou.

320
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,600
No wonder you are so spirited in Glory.

321
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
Brilliant, fresh and free from vulgarity, pretty and intelligent.

322
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Han Yanrou. I knew it.

323
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,440
You must be a man.

324
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,440
Try to be attractive with a female account.

325
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,480
Right?

326
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,120
Who are you?

327
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm Bao Zi.

328
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Bao Zi?

329
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,480
Then I'm Mao Tou, psycho.

330
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,200
Let's go to another place.

331
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,160
Senior, you've been here since your retirement?

332
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,680
Yes, I work as a network manager here.

333
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,120
Why do you work as a network manager?

334
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,160
This is the closest job to Glory.

335
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,840
If I can't get back to Wei Cao this time,

336
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,600
I don't think I would have the courage to log in to Glory.

337
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,760
Then you can watch some teleplays

338
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,120
to relax your mood.

339
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,000
There is a very good teleplay recently.

340
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,840
Have you seen it?

341
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,520
It's called "Escape is useful but shameful".

342
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,080
Senior, I actually don't have much time to watch a teleplay.

343
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Because...

344
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,200
Even if I spend all my time on training,

345
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,760
there is still a big gap between my teammates and I.

346
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,640
I am always the one who hinder them.

347
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,160
So, until now

348
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,000
I've never been to a real battlefield.

349
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,000
But I still want to play.

350
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,160
You sure?

351
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,960
I don't want to give up like this.

352
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:48,755
Then change your profession

353
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,480
and practice Ghosts.

354
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,840
Ghosts?

355
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,440
Find the right direction

356
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,600
is much more important than working hard.

357
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,760
But senior,

358
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't even know how to be an Assassin.

359
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,160
And as my current level,

360
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,200
if I practice a profession from the start, I...

361
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:30,825
Then change your profession

362
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:32,400
and practice Ghosts.

363
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,440
And we've already got a Ghosts in our team.

364
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,320
We don't need a second one.

365
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,880
Find the right direction

366
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,040
is much more important than working hard.

367
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
You are there to change your fate,

368
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,120
not to give it up.

369
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,000
What 's going on with you?

370
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,480
Ask the professional team to help you to do the Dungeon?

371
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,240
Can you afford the loss of losing a match?

372
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,400
Mr. Tao, I admit that

373
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I, Chen Yehui, am sometimes selfish.

374
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,240
But I swear,

375
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,320
I never thought about doing harm to Jia Shi.

376
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,080
In such a big Jia Shi,

377
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,600
no one respects the captain.

378
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,200
It seems that you are really going downhill.

379
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,720
Only those on high can go downhill.

380
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,480
For those have always been on the low spot,

381
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,520
it's called no where to go.

382
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,680
On my first day in Jia Shi,

383
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
you looked down on me

384
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,280
Who is the boss?

385
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,600
Where is the boss?

386
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,080
Where is the boss?

387
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,320
Thank you.

388
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,160
Our net administrator is getting more and more handsome.

389
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,120
Net administrator? What are you doing here?

390
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,800
To be a net administrator.

391
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,840
Yeah.

392
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,880
How do you feel?

393
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,720
Accustomed to being served,

394
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,720
can you get used to serving others now?

395
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Thank you for thinking about me. I get quire used to it.

396
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
That's right. What can you do if you're not used to it?

397
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,680
You shouldn't be so low-key before.

398
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,400
Now without Leaf of Autumn,

399
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
no one seems to know you anymore.

400
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,840
Yeah, I'm not like you.

401
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,800
So high-key. And push yourself forward.

402
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,120
But still no one knows you.

403
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,320
Our captain

404
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,840
has already become the net administrator of Net Cafe.

405
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,000
Why do you still speak so harshly?

406
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
But it doesn't matter.

407
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,280
Presidents like us,

408
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,880
would meet many people every day.

409
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,640
From bosses

410
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,600
to ordinary people like you.

411
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,840
Don't we all have to be polite?

412
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Being a president

413
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,080
is not just by dealing with people.

414
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,920
It depends on strength.

415
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,160
When you were a team member,

416
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,480
you spent too much time on making friends with them.

417
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,920
But forgot to improve your own strength.

418
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,680
That's why you were eliminated by the team.

419
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,280
I didn't expect that after you came to the guild,

420
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,040
you still were working on that.

421
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,840
How can you say that about me?

422
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,640
What have you done after you came to the guild?

423
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,800
How many records of Dungeon did you get?

424
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
What is the increase of membership?

425
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,080
If you're not good at management,

426
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,200
it would be useless

427
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
even the whole team is there for you.

428
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,760
How do you know that?

429
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,280
If you don't regard Glory as something you love,

430
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,160
I suggest that you leave as soon as possible.

431
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,800
Who do you think you are?

432
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,800
You are just a tiny network manager.

433
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,400
You don't get to teach me.

434
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
Open a computer for me.

435
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,520
Network manager Ye.

436
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,760
I'm sorry.

437
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,960
The way to treat a customer my boss has taught me

438
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,560
may not be suitable for a drunk.

439
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,920
Please come again when you're sober.

440
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,840
Okay, then I'll see you soon.

441
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,400
Looking forward to your next visit.

442
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
Okay, I'm almost there.

443
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,160
It's okay.

444
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
Our teammates in the First Canyon

445
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,520
are almost all defeated.

446
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Can you do the Dungeon properly?

447
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,280
Just for those carp-like materials?

448
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,760
Can he show us some manner?

449
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,440
Can he obey the rules?

450
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,200
Jun Moxiao wants more than 'a little bit'.

451
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,720
Because these guilds want to hoard materials,

452
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,640
so they invited Jun Moxiao to do the Dungeon for them.

453
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,720
They almost sent out the elite team

454
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,200
And they would rob whenever they see a boss.

455
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,720
It's not just the First Canyon.

456
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,840
You can have look at any other Dungeon,

457
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
they're all the same.

458
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,720
It is an Acheron.

459
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
This world is in a mess.

460
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Xi Zhou, you...

461
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
Look at it yourself.

462
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,000
Records of Dungeon created by that master

463
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,480
indeed give us a lot of help.

464
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,320
We all can see

465
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
the growth of our membership.

466
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,760
But don't you forget

467
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,800
that the amount of tasks assigned by the top teams

468
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,960
is also increased.

469
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,600
But look at the fact that

470
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,520
we're all defeated everyday,

471
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,200
we may have very bad performances.

472
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,520
Is the what's called Jun Moxiao has made our day,

473
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
but he has also ruined our day.

474
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,840
Don't tell me those stupid words.

475
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,040
How about the feedbacks from those undercover guys

476
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,160
that we arranged on other guilds?

477
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,560
They are having a hard time too.

478
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,280
They're all scratching their heads to find a way.

479
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,400
Master, where are we going?

480
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,400
Go shopping.

481
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,560
Go shopping?

482
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,000
Go shopping.

483
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
This is Kongji City.

484
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
It is one of the main cities on the land of Glory.

485
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,240
All the players can trade equipment here.

486
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,240
Buy supplies.

487
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,400
The most important thing is that

488
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,800
after your character is killed in a battle,

489
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,269
you can choose to return to the city

490
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,482
and continue fighting after you come back to life.

491
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,160
There is a barrier at the gate of the city,

492
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
which is a huge protective shelter.

493
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,760
You're not allowed to fight in the city, but you can fight outside the city.

494
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,560
This Kongji City

495
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,040
is our stronghold from now on.

496
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,280
After such a long time of doing Dungeons,

497
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,440
we can finally enter the city.

498
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,800
Boss, look at this bloodsucking claw I picked.

499
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,040
Isn't it gorgeous?

500
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,934
This Orange equipment which cost me

501
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:24,840
800 gold coins is indeed great.

502
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,240
Of course, you've spend all the gold coins.

503
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,320
Thank you, boss.

504
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,160
I bought you something and now I am your boss?

505
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,040
This is too obvious for, isn't it?

506
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,440
Boss,

507
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,200
you should also buy a weapon for Tang Rou.

508
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,840
She would've been defeated by me without an Orange Equipment.

509
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,840
Weapons are not that important to me.

510
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,760
The examination is about to begin.

511
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,520
I'm exhausted.

512
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,400
Let's go. Come on.

513
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Let's go.

514
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,920
Come on.

515
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,840
You too.

516
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,120
Yifan, training camp's evaluation test is about to begin.

517
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,880
Let's go now.

518
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,400
Okay.

519
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,760
Tang Rou, why do you walk so fast?

520
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,240
Let me show you my new weapon.

521
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,040
Watch out. Ambushes.

522
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,080
They're here just in time.

523
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,400
Let me try my new weapon.

524
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,960
Team Two. Launchers.

525
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
Get ready for the thermal missiles.

526
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,600
Team Two, Roger that. Team Two, Roger that.

527
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,240
Team One. Battlemages.

528
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,400
Get ready for the Flames.

529
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,127
The newly changed equipment

530
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,272
has an influence on attack speed and a moving speed.

531
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:14,240
Pay attention to adaptation.

532
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,800
Roger that.

533
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,600
The attack speed has improved. Choose the right time to fight.

534
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,840
After the Orange Equipment has armed up.

535
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,440
I feel like that I run very fast.

536
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,080
Like there's a rocket under my feet.

537
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,920
Boss, after my character runs out of HP,

538
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,040
my equipments would drop, right?

539
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
I have to guard such good weapons.

540
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,520
They can't be taken by others.

541
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,520
Return to Kongji City first.

542
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,520
Here's another one here to look for abuse.

543
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,280
Yi Cunhui? Ghosts?

544
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,600
Who is he?

545
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,400
Is he here to help us or kill us?

546
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
Bao Zi, attack.

547
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,200
You and Tang should take a 60-degree angle position.

548
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,520
Stagger your time of using the best trick for 30 seconds.

549
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,720
Yifan, watch our attack rhythm,

550
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
and judge the arranging position in advance.

551
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,480
Got it, senior.

552
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,200
Are you that little I brought with me?

553
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,080
You're not bad.

554
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,320
The rhythm is well mastered.

555
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,240
Keep on fighting.

556
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,080
Don't waste your time on formation.

557
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,320
Control your cooling time.

558
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,720
Make sure that you've reached the maximum efficiency.

559
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,600
Yes, senior.

560
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
Cooperate with Han Yanrou.

561
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,240
Not there.

562
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,080
Be careful.

563
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,920
Don't panic and stabilize your hand speed.

564
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,800
Give up the array of ice, and use the Ghost-slash first.

565
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,600
Then moon-slash, don't forget to attack.

566
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Don't panic even if you've made mistakes.

567
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,880
The more urgent the situation is,

568
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,840
the more you can exercise your mind and judgment.

569
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
Got it, senior.

570
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,200
Let's do the array of knife.

571
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
It's the array of Ghosts.

572
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,240
Seize the opportunity. At the same coordinate.

573
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,320
Put another array of Ghosts.

574
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,240
Got it, senior.

575
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,600
Two arrays of Ghosts.

576
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,040
A Ghosts which has only been registered for a few days,

577
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,080
can play two arrays of Ghosts?

578
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,480
President, Team Three has completed all the missions.

579
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,840
Do you need backups?

580
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,880
No, it's just an appetizer. Just want to see what they can do.

581
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
It worked.

582
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Younger Bro Yifan,

583
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,680
your Ghosts is so great.

584
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,280
When can we compete with each other?
