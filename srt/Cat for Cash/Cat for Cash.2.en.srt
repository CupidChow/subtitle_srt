00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,040
(Previously)
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

2
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:04,145
That one is named Lynx. He's my son.

3
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,518
He ran off and became a stray.

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,567
He's a tough nut to crack.

5
00:00:06,614 --> 00:00:08,123
If anyone can make him blink back,

6
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:10,490
I'm ready to give him up, along with this café.

7
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:13,657
Je, Je Meow.

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,130
Je! Je!

9
00:00:15,865 --> 00:00:16,865
Meow~

10
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,307
(Hey! Call an ambulance now!)

11
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:21,609
What happened to me?

12
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:23,382
Yeah, I really can hear them talking.

13
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:24,475
Who are you talking to?

14
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,352
Have you decided what to do with the café?

15
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:30,150
I'm not going to continue it.
You can use it to pay off the debt.

16
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:31,420
Keep running this café.

17
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,412
Your mom loved every cat like her own kids.

18
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:37,677
Your mother and grandfather
each loved their child more than anything.

19
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:42,201
You pay to watch cats sleep, what's so fun about that?

20
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:45,362
To you, this place might just be a café.

21
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:48,410
But to them, it's their whole world.

22
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:49,851
I've signed them all.

23
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:50,994
Just need your signature now.

24
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:54,159
My big boss will send in his son to sign.

25
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:58,252
Now you're my debtor.

26
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,407
If you break the contract, don't say I didn't warn you.

27
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:10,818
(My name is Tiger.)

28
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:12,133
(I'm allergic to cats.)

29
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:14,512
(I can't even pet one.)

30
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:16,319
(So there's no way my family
would let me keep one at home.)

31
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:19,718
(The only place I can get my cat fix is…)

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,390
Kids.

33
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,587
Come hear your today's missions
from this mentor.

34
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:35,046
We'll start with…

35
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:37,530
Jenny.

36
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,745
My pretty head of PR.

37
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:41,346
School has started.

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,133
Use your charm to bring in
more students, okay?

39
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:44,807
(Okay~)

40
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:46,062
Aww. So cute.

41
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,854
John Wick, my cool head of security.

42
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,722
We've got some new cats in the house.

43
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:52,646
Help me keep things under control.

44
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,718
(Roger that.)

45
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:54,999
Captain Jiro.

46
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:57,098
It's our first day doing deliveries.

47
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,694
Help me check that the orders
are queued properly.

48
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:01,045
Jumbo,

49
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:02,349
you'd better be on your
best behavior today, alright?

50
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,097
(Jumbo's always on his best behavior.)

51
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,006
Granny Juu,

52
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,093
just stay in your little circle
and wish me luck, okay?

53
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:10,926
Ready to handle your missions?

54
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,483
(Yes!)

55
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:20,111
Granny Juu, let's see
who our first customer's gonna be.

56
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,215
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

57
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,468
Come on, Jumbo.

58
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,410
Why don't you come down
and play with customers?

59
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,258
Hey, shut the door.
The cats are gonna run out.

60
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,157
Oi, oi.

61
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,113
It hurts.

62
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,659
Oi. Argh.

63
00:02:58,706 --> 00:02:59,630
Jumbo, you're hurting me.

64
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:00,544
Jumbo.

65
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,936
You're just gonna stand there?
Help me.

66
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,602
-Oi, Jumbo.
-How?

67
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,417
-I'm allergic to cat fur.
-Come on, Jumbo.

68
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,277
You want my shirt that bad?
Fine, take it.

69
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,008
Hey. Hey!

70
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:31,629
What are you looking at?

71
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:40,205
I got scratched all over, Jumbo!

72
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,403
Put your shirt back on.

73
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,047
How did your mom do
to get the cats downstairs?

74
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:09,075
Ask them.

75
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,209
If I knew, I'd have done it already.

76
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:15,409
Don't tell me…
you don't know how to run this café.

77
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:16,852
Hey.

78
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:18,877
This is my mom's café, not mine.

79
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:22,500
Does every noodle shop kid
know how to make noodles?

80
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,370
Fair enough.

81
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:36,744
Well then…
do you want me to help?

82
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,701
I've been eating here all the time.

83
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,632
No, thank you.

84
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:45,183
I've got someone who can help me.

85
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:46,954
Your partner?

86
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,462
ChatGPT.

87
00:04:58,386 --> 00:05:02,270
How do you run a cat café
if you hate cats?

88
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:08,915
Your mom didn't raise you
with ChatGPT, did she?

89
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:11,958
To work with living beings,

90
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:14,898
you've got to give your heart first.

91
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,401
If you want to add them as a friend,
you have to…

92
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:26,514
Blink, right?

93
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,096
I've tried so much
my eyes are about to get stuck.

94
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:30,388
It didn't work.

95
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,804
If that didn't work,
how about you "shake hands" with them?

96
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:44,859
I mean…
people greet with handshakes.

97
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,758
Cats greet with nose bumps.

98
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:51,123
They won't even make eye contact with me.

99
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:52,812
Do you want me to bump noses with them?

100
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:53,896
Not that.

101
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,403
I mean, you can just
point your finger like this.

102
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,101
Hey, what are you doing?

103
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,198
Now we're friends.

104
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,616
Who said I wanted to be your friend?

105
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:21,108
That was just practice.

106
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,297
Alright then.

107
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:26,218
Why don't you do it
for real now, Coach?

108
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,006
He's leaning back to sleep.

109
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:04,092
It didn't work.

110
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:08,449
At least,
he didn't bite you.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,100
"Cat for Cash"
(Episode 2)

112
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,699
Like food.

113
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:28,971
Don't people come here for the cats?

114
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,792
I can serve some easy fried or frozen stuff.

115
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,107
Don't let your mom hear you say that.

116
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,414
The signature dish of this café
is Meow Meow Rice.

117
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:42,051
(Your Cat-Cheer Café isn't just about the cats.)

118
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,675
(It's also known for its heavenly tasty food.)

119
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,098
(And the signature dish here
is made with crispy fried mackerel,)

120
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,297
(mashed into freshly cooked rice,)

121
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,096
(seasoned with fresh ingredients,)

122
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,240
(and served with the café's secret fish sauce dip.)

123
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,097
(This dish is called Meow Meow Rice.)

124
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:06,813
Do you know the recipe?

125
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,686
I actually don't.

126
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:15,823
But I ate it every day.

127
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,594
I might be able to guess it.

128
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:22,786
Show me how to make Meow Meow Rice.

129
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,440
(I'm the one who taught Je Meow this dish.)

130
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,535
Ah, right.

131
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,387
Jiro used to be a restaurant cat.

132
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:33,195
Who are you talking to?

133
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:34,392
(Oops, meow!)

134
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:36,949
No one.

135
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:41,608
I just remembered
your mom used to teach me.

136
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,217
I think it starts with…

137
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,166
what was it?

138
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,509
(Get the mackerel and pat the skin dry.)

139
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,102
Get the mackerel and pat the skin dry.

140
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:56,880
It starts with taking the mackerel out
and patting the skin dry.

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,033
Pat the skin dry, and then…

142
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,680
what's next?

143
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:10,508
What kind of person likes to talk to himself?

144
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:12,914
(Will he get it done today?)

145
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,652
Oh, it's hot.

146
00:10:31,795 --> 00:10:32,820
Take it easy there.

147
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:35,205
You have such a cat's tongue.

148
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:24,273
So? Is it good?

149
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:26,745
Mhm.

150
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:29,686
It's good.

151
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,106
But I don't know if it's the same
as what Mom made.

152
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,297
Je Meow never made it for you?

153
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:41,957
She did.

154
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:45,407
But I couldn't remember.

155
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
It was too long ago.

156
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,805
Now I know
why the cats ignore you.

157
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,150
That's not it.

158
00:11:53,402 --> 00:11:54,699
I'm Granny Juu's kid, you know.

159
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,602
When I was little,
Granny Juu raised me.

160
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,185
When I was little,

161
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:02,502
my dad always dragged me along
to collect debts.

162
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,413
Don't you have to go collect debts today?

163
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:06,309
Why are you here helping
a debtor like me?

164
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,094
Because if I don't,

165
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,611
do you really think you can
run this café on your own?

166
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,402
I thought you were helping
out of fondness.

167
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:20,893
Fondness? For what?

168
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,631
The cats.

169
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:26,533
Yes, I'm fond of cats.

170
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,004
The cats in this café…
are cute.

171
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:38,004
For this first period,

172
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:42,473
I think I'm going to skip
the complicated dishes.

173
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:44,700
I'll go with simple ones first.

174
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:47,033
I'm all by myself.

175
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:49,298
I don't think I can handle
everything alone.

176
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:51,928
Well…

177
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:56,931
don't you think about
finding someone to help?

178
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,004
(Tiger! Everything's gone completely off the rails!)

179
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,293
(This isn't the dish we used to have.)

180
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:30,386
(It smells weird and tastes bland.)

181
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:31,700
(Go get the chef.)

182
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,413
Did you change the cat food?

183
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Yes.

184
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,353
Not only that,

185
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,420
I changed the litter too.

186
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,193
(I don't like this litter.)

187
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
(It's dusty and rough.)

188
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,000
Why did you change them?

189
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,506
The old ones were fine.

190
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:48,406
That's why Mom couldn't pay you off.

191
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,720
Even though I cut costs,
the quality is the same.

192
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,433
(No, it's not!)

193
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:54,923
But you know, cats are—

194
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,158
Shh.

195
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:10,498
I'm doing all this for a creditor like you.

196
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:23,605
You guys, give it a try.

197
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,911
You might just not be used to
the new stuff yet.

198
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:31,538
(Hey, you need to push back,
not take his side.)

199
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,705
Knock yourselves out.

200
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:36,555
Tomorrow's reopening day.

201
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:37,794
You'll need energy.

202
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:42,166
(Fine. You'll be using plenty of energy too.)

203
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:00,211
Getting them out here isn't that hard.

204
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:02,394
Just give them food.

205
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:13,872
Cat-Cheer Café—

206
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,437
What's with that face?

207
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:21,183
Aren't you glad?

208
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,008
I'm your first customer.

209
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,116
Customer, or creditor here to nitpick me?

210
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:29,111
Speaking of nitpicking,

211
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:31,811
this is the time you should
block the cats now.

212
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:34,327
Make way for the Cold Prince.

213
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:36,205
Hey, close the door first.

214
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,527
Hi, P'Tiger.

215
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,294
Please forgive me.

216
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:47,116
I didn't know you were from
a prominent family.

217
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:48,505
Come on, Krapor.

218
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,216
Just call me Tiger like before.

219
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:51,483
We're all cat lovers.

220
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:53,616
Just Tiger like before?

221
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,600
I'll take that as permission, dude.

222
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,194
I'm kidding!
I'm just kidding

223
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:03,433
Anyway, bro.

224
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:08,311
I want to spoil Jenny
with two or three creamy treats.

225
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:12,911
Why are they all hiding today?

226
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:18,394
(If you want us to get out there,
change everything back to how it was.)

227
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:22,711
Lynx.

228
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:28,038
I think they're protesting
because you changed their stuff.

229
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:32,794
Can't you guys just behave?

230
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:37,822
How about this?

231
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:43,605
Premium creamy cat treats
made with high-quality ingredients.

232
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,788
It smells good, and it tastes even better!

233
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,055
(Everyone, stay calm.)

234
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,300
(I've been through this game before.)

235
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,477
(Ugh! You bunch of furballs!)

236
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,433
(I can't trust any of you.)

237
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,633
Jiro, it's almost gone.

238
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:07,616
(A cat like me would rather work up a sweat,
than shed tears over a cat treat.)

239
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:09,436
-(Hmph, I won't look.)
-Hey, Jiro.

240
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,305
Wanna play with this?

241
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,433
Tiger told me
this is your favorite toy, right?

242
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:22,261
(Stay strong, Jiro.)

243
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:23,900
(It's just a plastic bag.)

244
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:26,988
(Hehe~)

245
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:29,817
Looks like…

246
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,688
I'm gonna pay off my debt
faster than I thought.

247
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:38,694
Awesome.

248
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:45,394
Are you tired, Granny Juu?

249
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:47,500
You've been working all day.
Your fur's a mess.

250
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:05,422
What are you looking at?

251
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,422
Are you happy seeing me
being a cat servant?

252
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,950
No.

253
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm just jealous.

254
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:22,705
You want some brushing too?

255
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:25,899
I'm jealous of you.

256
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,994
For someone allergic to cat fur like me,

257
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:33,823
I'd trade anything

258
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,083
to sit where you are.

259
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,816
I'd trade anything too

260
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,605
to just curl up and stay right here.

261
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,005
Your fur's all messed up.

262
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:22,199
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

263
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:24,627
Let's get to work, Granny Juu.

264
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:31,456
What can I get you?

265
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,667
Cocoa?

266
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,805
Matcha too? Please wait a moment.

267
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,416
Look, you really enjoy it.

268
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:43,622
Thought you said this brand wasn't good.

269
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,911
(After dealing with customers all day,
I'm eating whatever's here.)

270
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:57,955
Hey, Lynx.

271
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:00,811
What are you doing?

272
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,811
Are you switching to a fan
instead of the AC?

273
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:04,994
Cats get hot easily, you know?

274
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:08,911
I'm not that mean. Come on.

275
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:10,500
I asked ChatGPT.

276
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:13,899
It says if you set the AC to 27 and use a fan,

277
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:15,905
it saves on the electricity bill.

278
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,022
(Hey! Don't you know anything at all?)

279
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,800
(Wind sounds like an eagle hunting!)

280
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:31,011
I don't think the cats like it.

281
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:32,722
Please take it away.

282
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:37,407
And how do you know what they think?

283
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:39,122
Did they tell you?

284
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:41,750
I just know.

285
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,516
You think you're the only one who knows?

286
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:47,394
You can talk to cats?

287
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:51,866
Yes.

288
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:01,794
Just using this cat-translation app I just downloaded,

289
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,633
I can talk to them.

290
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:07,316
Kids, you like the fan, right?

291
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,511
(Noooooo~)

292
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:14,905
The app translated, "It feels so good~"

293
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:18,427
(How could he believe that app?)

294
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,605
(Meowwww~)

295
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,537
Hey.

296
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:30,806
Hey!

297
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,161
Yes?

298
00:21:37,144 --> 00:21:38,144
Thanks for today.

299
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:44,199
For what? I didn't do anything today.

300
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,455
Exactly for that.

301
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,616
You're my creditor,
but you haven't asked me to pay.

302
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,544
Who says I haven't?

303
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,111
I'm waiting to collect interest.

304
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,616
Once things settle down here,

305
00:21:58,702 --> 00:21:59,716
I'm coming for you.

306
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:05,877
Then can I pay
today's interest with this first?

307
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:10,427
I just saw we have cat stickers for sale too.

308
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:13,605
If it's this version of cats,
you won't be allergic, right?

309
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,250
Do you know

310
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:26,911
what your mom used these stickers for?

311
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:31,577
For sticking on stuff, right?

312
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:37,905
Your mom put these cat stickers on cups

313
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:40,711
and wrote sweet little messages for customers.

314
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:44,627
She once wrote one for me,

315
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,899
"Hope you find your favorite cat."

316
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,439
Can I have one?

317
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,650
Drive safe.

318
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:47,127
GIVE ME A BRUSHING :)

319
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:56,217
Bro.

320
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:58,771
Hey, bro.

321
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:00,622
Tiger, bro!

322
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,399
What are you smiling about?

323
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Where to next?

324
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,079
The cat café.

325
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:10,397
I heard it's open again.

326
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:12,303
He should have some cash
to pay us back now.

327
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,722
You may go. Leave this one to me.

328
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:20,533
Huh?

329
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:24,927
Just go.

330
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,300
Cat-Cheer Café. How may I help you?

331
00:24:35,444 --> 00:24:37,327
(Hi there. It's me, Tiger.)

332
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,105
How are things over there?

333
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:45,127
It's… fine. Why did you ask?

334
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:48,611
You used the fan yesterday,

335
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,938
so I was worried the cats would protest.

336
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:54,216
Protest what?

337
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:58,183
The app still says
they're all "feeling so good."

338
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,500
(We're all gonna be "feeling good" for sure.)

339
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:09,338
(Aha, the door's open?
Excuse me, I'm going to feel good outside.)

340
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,811
Gotcha!

341
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:16,322
Good try, but you're still a noob, Jiro.

342
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:18,505
No wonder you've been acting all proper.

343
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,111
You had a plan all along.

344
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:23,811
Jenny, don't go!

345
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Hey, Krapor.

346
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:27,510
Where are the other cats?

347
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,205
I thought you had them blocked off.

348
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:32,350
Once I opened the door,
they all dashed out.

349
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,705
I was about to close it, but…

350
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,550
Hey, you lured me out there on purpose?

351
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:43,844
(Haven't you heard?

352
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,716
Even the earth is shaking,
don't mess with my AC!)

353
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:47,789
Hey, Jiro!

354
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,322
Krapor, catch him!

355
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:50,428
(I'm going. Bye!)

356
00:25:50,522 --> 00:25:52,572
-Jiro!
-Come back in.

357
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,738
Krapor told me everything.

358
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:35,394
You didn't mean to.

359
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,088
Don't beat yourself up.

360
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,783
But didn't they run off
because they were mad at me?

361
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:44,916
I'm still the one to blame.

362
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,007
Meow~

363
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:51,853
Meow~

364
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Meow~

365
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,300
All other cats have left, Granny Juu.

366
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,899
You can go too if you want.

367
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:11,578
I understand you.

368
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:26,022
When I was little, my mom went to work

369
00:27:29,244 --> 00:27:30,622
and left me home alone.

370
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,016
I only had the TV to kill my loneliness.

371
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:42,505
Then one day, something rubbed
against my leg like just now.

372
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:48,144
I looked down…

373
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:50,144
It got abandoned.

374
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:51,522
…and met a new friend.

375
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,316
Can I keep it?

376
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:56,772
Please.

377
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:00,133
Please.

378
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,272
Lynx, dear.

379
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:04,533
Taking care of a pet isn't easy.

380
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:08,200
You need to give it love and warmth
and feed it well.

381
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,405
You might love it now.

382
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,611
But if one day you get bored of it,
how would it live?

383
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:15,505
You can't just abandon it.

384
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:20,805
I won't get bored of it.

385
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,822
Look. It's really cute.

386
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:30,122
I want to keep it too.

387
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,327
But I can barely take care of you properly.

388
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:40,649
If I have to take care of it too—

389
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,527
I'm not asking you to raise it.

390
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:45,105
I'm asking to raise it myself.

391
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:47,428
Please, Mom.

392
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,211
I promise.

393
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,811
I'll take the best care of it.

394
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:58,739
Please, Mom.

395
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,811
Please.

396
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:05,355
-Okay!
-Yay!

397
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:07,122
I'm sorry, Granny Juu.

398
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,644
I'm sorry I broke my promise.

399
00:29:17,894 --> 00:29:20,716
(Lynx, why are you crying, dear?)

400
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,722
(Who made you cry? You can tell me.)

401
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,811
You don't need to apologize to her.

402
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:31,922
Granny Juu won't go anywhere.

403
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:35,916
She doesn't want to see you sad.

404
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:52,411
If you want to keep your promise,

405
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:56,427
let's go bring Granny Juu's family back.

406
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,911
Do you know where to look for them?

407
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:02,616
(I know.)

408
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,916
I think I know.

409
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,037
Cats like to hide in narrow spaces.

410
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:19,688
But it varies from cat to cat.

411
00:30:20,144 --> 00:30:21,399
They all have different tastes.

412
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,461
They sit in everything except the cat bed.

413
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:24,988
I'm gonna sell all the cat beds off.

414
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:28,377
Jumbo is the youngest.

415
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:30,188
He likes toys.

416
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,122
If it's toys, I'm all ready.

417
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:36,533
For Gen Alpha cats with busy parents,

418
00:30:37,288 --> 00:30:38,305
they like to play this.

419
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:42,661
Wow. They have games for cats now?

420
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,911
(Next is John Wick, a mysterious cat.)

421
00:30:46,983 --> 00:30:48,305
(No one knows his background.)

422
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:49,950
(He always finds hiding spots.)

423
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:51,627
(The only way to lure him out is…)

424
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:53,506
What's that?

425
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:55,734
(Ooh, laser!)

426
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,744
-John Wick!
-(I despise you~)

427
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:02,266
Next is Jenny.

428
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:04,705
She used to belong to a beauty blogger.

429
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:06,399
She's a total beauty queen.

430
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:08,194
And she loves pretty boys.

431
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:10,399
You should've told me sooner.

432
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:12,416
Let me call Krapor.

433
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:13,806
Stop.

434
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,705
You've never seen me
in my golden form, have you?

435
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:48,055
(Hello there. You looking good~)

436
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:50,261
Jenny!

437
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:56,811
Now it's just Jiro left.

438
00:31:57,394 --> 00:31:59,311
He used to live at a restaurant.

439
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,699
He met tons of people and
knows a lot of things.

440
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,516
He's a total boss cat of the café.

441
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:07,011
What should I do?

442
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:08,805
Should I post again?

443
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,388
I already did.

444
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,433
But I think…

445
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:16,010
I've got a better idea.

446
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:18,494
Hey, handsome.

447
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:20,144
Handsome boy.

448
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,339
Help me out.

449
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:23,905
Have you seen Jiro?

450
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:29,211
If you see him,
tell him to come home.

451
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:30,327
We've forgiven him.

452
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:35,599
(I'm not a radio station, but fine, I'll help.
All because you called me handsome.)

453
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:36,733
Thanks, handsome.

454
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:39,522
What are you doing?

455
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,694
Haven't you heard?

456
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:46,394
When a cat goes missing,
try asking the strays to help you look.

457
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:47,543
You might find it.

458
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:49,605
Is that really gonna work?

459
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,666
How do you know he even understands you?

460
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,516
If this doesn't work,

461
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:00,900
there's one more way left.

462
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,119
What is it? I'll do it.

463
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:10,016
They say you put a pot on your head
and walk around yelling the cat's name.

464
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:13,405
Yeah, you do that silly way yourself.

465
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,911
(Found him.)

466
00:33:17,983 --> 00:33:19,399
(The orange dude is over there.)

467
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,366
(Shh! Don't blow my cover!)

468
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:26,967
Jiro!

469
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:32,189
Jiro!

470
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:33,722
Jiro!

471
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,106
Jiro!

472
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:36,477
-Jiro!
-Jiro!

473
00:33:37,122 --> 00:33:38,680
Jiro!

474
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,420
(Good try, but you're still a noob.)

475
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:53,113
Let me take a quick break,
then we'll go find him again.

476
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:01,800
How about we try again tomorrow?

477
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:04,794
You've been searching all day.

478
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:15,288
Don't be so hard on yourself.

479
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:19,611
You already did really well.

480
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,400
You got a bunch of them back.

481
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:35,083
I'll wait down here then,
in case Jiro comes back.

482
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:43,517
Then…

483
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:46,783
I'll stay and keep you company.

484
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,294
Who made you my companion?

485
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,294
I meant Jiro.

486
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,677
He already "added" me as a friend.

487
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:04,494
We did this.

488
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,161
Here.

489
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:36,711
HOPE YOU FIND YOUR MISSING CAT :)

490
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:43,077
Thank you.

491
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,311
Why do you love cats so much?

492
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,600
Are there people on this planet

493
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:06,922
who don't love cats,
besides you?

494
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:11,711
Others get to pat their heads,
scratch their chins,

495
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,788
but you can only watch from afar.

496
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,805
Don't you feel bad?

497
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:20,811
Why do I have to feel bad?

498
00:36:21,906 --> 00:36:24,411
When you love someone,

499
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:27,805
don't you want something in return?

500
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,250
I think…

501
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:39,394
I do get something in return.

502
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,000
Even though I don't get to scratch their chins,

503
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:43,494
rub their bellies,

504
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:45,622
or brush them like other people,

505
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:50,377
just seeing them eat and sleep well,

506
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,488
seeing Jumbo cling to you with his claws,

507
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,405
that already makes me happy.

508
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:59,287
To put it simply,

509
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,183
I'm in one-sided love with cats.

510
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,494
HOPE YOU FIND YOUR MISSING CAT :)

511
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:24,289
Lynx.

512
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,139
Lynx!

513
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,877
What's up, Krapor?

514
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:35,116
This morning I was delivering ice in this alley
and heard dogs barking at something.

515
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:36,255
Then I found this.

516
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:42,192
Jiro's collar.

517
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:45,511
I don't know if he's okay.

518
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:50,661
(I almost didn't make it this morning.
Thanks for saving me.)

519
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,044
(I've never seen you before.
Which house did you escape from?)

520
00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:56,744
(I'm not a house cat. I was born a stray.)

521
00:38:56,828 --> 00:38:59,527
(Your face is way too shiny to be a stray.)

522
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:03,405
(Go home already.
Your human is probably worried sick.)

523
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:07,194
(I don't have one.
The one who worried about me is gone.)

524
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:09,494
(The one who's there doesn't like me.)

525
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,133
Jiro!

526
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,822
Have you seen an orange cat
that looks like this?

527
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,189
Have you?

528
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,411
If this doesn't work,

529
00:39:27,494 --> 00:39:28,911
there's one more way left.

530
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,569
What is it? I'll do it.

531
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:37,511
They say you put a pot on your head
and walk around yelling the cat's name.

532
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:40,816
Yeah, you do that silly way yourself.

533
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,822
Jiro! Let's go home.

534
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:50,561
Jiro!

535
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,722
Jiro, come out already.

536
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,550
Jiro!

537
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,133
Jiro!

538
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:03,687
Jiro.

539
00:40:03,772 --> 00:40:06,039
Look, he keeps calling Jiro, Jiro.

540
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:11,094
What are you laughing at?

541
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:12,500
Is it that funny?

542
00:40:14,128 --> 00:40:15,128
Jiro.

543
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:17,205
Jiro, let's go home.

544
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:21,411
(Ugh… people still believe this kind of myth?)

545
00:40:21,644 --> 00:40:25,172
(Why not just post online
instead of wasting time like this?)

546
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:26,710
(It doesn't work.)

547
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,505
(No, it does work.)

548
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,950
Jiro.

549
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,539
Jiro!

550
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:36,989
Jiro.

551
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,140
Meow~

552
00:40:38,507 --> 00:40:39,507
Meow~

553
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:41,953
Meow~

554
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,233
Jiro!

555
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,116
Are you hurt anywhere?

556
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:52,139
Hm?

557
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:35,900
It's yummy, isn't it?

558
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,113
I believe you now.
Not all cat food is the same.

559
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,220
Eat up, everyone.

560
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,602
So you'll be strong
and stay with me for a long time.

561
00:41:57,311 --> 00:41:58,322
Granny Juu.

562
00:41:59,432 --> 00:42:01,021
I wasn't planning on keeping the café.

563
00:42:03,236 --> 00:42:05,194
But seeing you all miss Mom too,

564
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:10,086
I wanted to keep going.

565
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:14,798
Even so…

566
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:20,808
I overlooked how you would feel.

567
00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:29,743
I'm sorry.

568
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:33,920
From now on, I promise.

569
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,708
I'll take the best care of you all.

570
00:42:39,497 --> 00:42:40,796
I'll use the same brand of food,

571
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:44,086
the same litter,

572
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,443
do everything the way Mom did.

573
00:42:55,584 --> 00:42:57,497
Can you all give me one more chance?

574
00:43:09,382 --> 00:43:10,382
Just once more.

575
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,653
(So, kids.)

576
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:13,812
(Will you trust Lynx again?)

577
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,530
Jenny, this evening we've got a reservation
from a group of football boys.

578
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:06,306
Work your charm, okay?

579
00:44:08,351 --> 00:44:09,351
Deal?

580
00:44:10,603 --> 00:44:11,603
John Wick,

581
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:15,222
if any customer gets loud,
give them your death stare.

582
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,710
Jiro, today's the first day
I'm making Meow Meow Rice.

583
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:22,842
It might be a little slow,

584
00:44:23,398 --> 00:44:26,414
so if any customer gets hungry,
go play with them and buy me some time.

585
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:28,464
Okay?

586
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,022
And Granny Juu,

587
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,841
wish me luck.

588
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:53,004
Granny Juu.

589
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,410
Who do you think will be
our first customer today?

590
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:57,805
Cat-Cheer Café, wel—

591
00:45:13,374 --> 00:45:14,374
You again.

592
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,410
Don't you have anything better to do?

593
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:21,003
Granny, this one doesn't count.

594
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,416
He's the creditor, not our customer.

595
00:45:33,868 --> 00:45:37,708
The café owner's washing dishes himself?

596
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:40,948
I told you, didn't I?

597
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,992
I can handle this place on my own just fine.

598
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,460
Pick it up for me.

599
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:00,224
Come on.

600
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:09,673
Cat-Cheer Café, how may I help you?

601
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:13,927
Chin, table for four at 4 PM?

602
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,630
Got it.

603
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,357
Thank you.

604
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,190
Fine.

605
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,782
I do need help,

606
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,503
but I don't even have money
to pay you back right now.

607
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:40,076
Then let me help you.

608
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,112
I won't charge you.

609
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:46,600
Are you that free?

610
00:46:47,242 --> 00:46:48,443
Go mess around somewhere else.

611
00:46:48,788 --> 00:46:52,201
I'm not messing around. I'm serious.

612
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:55,127
You know I love cats,

613
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:56,725
but I'm allergic to them.

614
00:46:57,954 --> 00:47:00,287
The only place I can get my cat fix

615
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
is here.

616
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:05,296
But I can't just take free labor from you.

617
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,270
Then…

618
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:13,081
I've got a proposal.

619
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:15,931
What?

620
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:18,178
I help you run this café,

621
00:47:19,232 --> 00:47:20,687
and in return, I get to be the cats' dad.

622
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,428
Anything about them,

623
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:25,604
you must ask me.

624
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:27,415
If you're their dad,

625
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,116
who am I to them?

626
00:47:30,783 --> 00:47:31,783
The cats' papa.

627
00:47:33,156 --> 00:47:35,031
Nah, they're all yours.

628
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:42,508
Wash the dishes, not your face.

629
00:47:45,602 --> 00:47:46,602
Where?

630
00:47:47,172 --> 00:47:48,172
On your nose.

631
00:47:50,072 --> 00:47:51,072
No, right here.

632
00:47:52,018 --> 00:47:52,828
Where?

633
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:53,997
Your nose.

634
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:56,273
Ugh!

635
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:06,222
(My name is Tiger.
I have allergic reactions to cats.)

636
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:11,020
(And today… my heart is having a reaction to another cat.)

637
00:48:12,148 --> 00:48:13,810
(I just hope with this cat…)

638
00:48:13,963 --> 00:48:17,099
(it won't be one-sided love like all the others.)

639
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:35,988
(Next Episode)
I'm the new staff. Please give me advice, Mr. Lynx.

640
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:37,583
-Ouch!
-Lynx! You okay?

641
00:48:38,144 --> 00:48:40,125
Do you know cats copy their owners?

642
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,212
I want to see if cats really copy their owners.

643
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,871
My mom used to make me come here a few times.

644
00:48:46,077 --> 00:48:48,602
Then I stopped coming. Uncle Vet here is scary.

645
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:50,515
Not just cats, even I'm scared.

646
00:48:50,883 --> 00:48:53,811
Here, if the cats behave, the vet won't be harsh with them.

647
00:48:54,116 --> 00:48:55,523
Hey, Dr. Pom.

648
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,770
Who is he?
