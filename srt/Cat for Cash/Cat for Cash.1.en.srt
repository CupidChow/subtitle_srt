00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,462
Hey!

3
00:00:58,352 --> 00:00:59,673
I know you’re in there.

4
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:00,991
Are you going to open the door or not?

5
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:02,082
If not…

6
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:10,761
Ti… Tiger, please don’t hurt me.

7
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,402
My kid just started school.

8
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:13,887
I can’t come up with the money in time.

9
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,356
You can’t come up with the money,
or you can’t stop spinning the slots? Huh?

10
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,001
I’m really sorry.

11
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,351
Please don’t hurt me.

12
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,999
I’ll do anything you want.

13
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,436
I’m sorry. I really am.

14
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:37,577
I’m sorry.

15
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:38,324
I’m sorry, bro.

16
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,163
I’m really sorry. Please don’t hurt me.

17
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:41,826
I’m sorry. I beg you.

18
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,325
I’m sorry.

19
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,011
Argh!

20
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:02,984
If you don’t pay me by tomorrow,

21
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:06,206
you’ll end up like this phone.

22
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:11,010
Understood.

23
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,487
This is the last stop.

24
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,662
Boss said this one’s the toughest.

25
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:18,961
I don’t know why.

26
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,190
Anyone who walks in here goes soft

27
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,167
and never comes back with the payoff.

28
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, well, well.

29
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,638
They’ve got money to open a cat café,

30
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:27,980
but they can’t pay off their debt.

31
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,978
What’s wrong with them?

32
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,744
Hey, Dong.

33
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,553
You can go back first.

34
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:06,413
What?

35
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:10,562
I’ll take care of this case.

36
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:23,464
You can hold him.

37
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:25,688
Go ahead.

38
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,391
You can hold any of my cats here.

39
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,674
Just don’t take them home.

40
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:34,987
Well, I…

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,165
I’m allergic to cat fur.

42
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:38,804
Oh, really?

43
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,023
But you’re okay just looking at them, right?

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,085
Jiro,

45
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,982
keep your distance.

46
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,331
Social dis-cat-ing, dear.

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,727
There he goes.

48
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:04,791
Well…

49
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:06,234
actually, I’m here for—

50
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:07,602
Are you here for a cat fix?

51
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:12,834
You must take off your shoes first.

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,858
Welcome.

53
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,461
Every cat here is a stray 
that was abandoned.

54
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:30,495
Cats are like people, you know?

55
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,382
Even if they’re the same breed,
they all have different personalities.

56
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:36,000
(Most of them like being alone, though.)

57
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,299
(Cats like things neat and orderly.)

58
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,622
(Looking good is their top priority.)

59
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:08,196
(People usually think 
cats don’t understand us,)

60
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:10,078
(but they actually understand 
everything we say.)

61
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,801
(It’s totally up to them
whether they feel like responding.)

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,084
I feel truly honored to visit Thailand.

63
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,792
I love the racetracks here,

64
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,928
Thai food, and Thai massages.

65
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,769
But what I love most is…

66
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:27,227
the Thai smile.

67
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,280
My work here is done.

68
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:41,554
You can freely enjoy the party, Mr. Enrique.

69
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:42,933
Have fun.

70
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,183
Aren’t you coming with me?

71
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:52,295
I still want to talk to you.

72
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:55,412
(When you talk to cats,
you need to listen with your eyes.)

73
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,847
(They respond to us 
through their body language.)

74
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,227
(If cats get angry, they flick their tails.)

75
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,027
(You’d better run, 
or they might scratch you.)

76
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:05,656
Do you want to add a cat to your friend list?

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,343
Huh?

78
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:10,990
Make eye contact and blink slowly.

79
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,659
If they blink back, it means
they’ve accepted your friend request.

80
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:22,279
Or if you want to go somewhere else with me,
I’m fine with that too.

81
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,393
How about coming to my room?

82
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:35,253
My partner, who’s an F1 fan, is waiting for me.

83
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:38,906
I’m sure you’ll spend
the whole night talking together.

84
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:55,016
Looks like his friend list is full.

85
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:56,420
It’s alright.

86
00:06:58,072 --> 00:06:59,392
I’ll go find you a new boss.

87
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:05,522
HOPE YOU FIND YOUR FAVORITE CAT.

88
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:08,556
I’ve got plenty of cat bosses for you
to choose from.

89
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:09,294
Come here.

90
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,557
Go ahead, make your pick.

91
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:14,921
Which boss do you like?

92
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,663
JUMBO, JIRO,

93
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:18,760
JENNIE

94
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,532
LYNX

95
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,610
That one is named Lynx. He’s my son.

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,509
He ran off and became a stray.

97
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:39,170
He’s a tough nut to crack.

98
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,492
If anyone can make him blink back,

99
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:43,909
I’m ready to give him up,
along with this café.

100
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:51,529
LYNX.

101
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,913
Je Meow, your ice is here.

102
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,350
Close the door for me, Krapor.

103
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,239
The cats might sneak out.

104
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,148
Oops, I forgot.

105
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:09,865
I knew it.

106
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,712
This cold guy is yours.

107
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,223
My whole arm’s already numb.

108
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,538
Then hurry up and fill it.

109
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:19,754
So cold.

110
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,174
Always with an intro.

111
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,033
You’re such a punctual guy.

112
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,935
No wonder Jennie loves you so much.

113
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:28,712
Sadhu.

114
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,763
I’ve spent a fortune on her cat treats.

115
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:32,412
Still, she won’t even let me hold her paws.

116
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,712
That’s why this song was written,

117
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:38,123
♪ I shed my tears at a cat café ♪

118
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,145
Don’t give up just yet.

119
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:39,758
Why, Sis?

120
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:40,767
Just wait and see this man.

121
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,436
Who?

122
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:43,516
Here he is.

123
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:45,017

124
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,939

127
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:55,238
Welcome to Cat-Cheer Café.

128
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:58,137
Jiro.

129
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,037
Jiro, my boy.

130
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,783
I’ve got to respect Tiger’s dedication.

131
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,116
He’s been here, same time, same place,
every day for three months.

132
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:05,825
Jiro still hasn’t blinked back at him.

133
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:08,874
At first, he was like a sugar cat daddy.

134
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:13,145
When treats didn’t work,
he spoiled him with gadgets instead.

135
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,609
But lately, he’s been coming in empty-handed.

136
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,872
He’s probably given up.

137
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,078
Said who?

138
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,333
He’s been wearing the same old shirt
for like a month.

139
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:28,833
Huh?

140
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:33,441
He must’ve heard 
cats recognize people by scent.

141
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,854
Let’s see if he finally gets recognized.

142
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:41,638
Jiro.

143
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:46,486
Jiro,

144
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:48,631
let’s be friends.

145
00:10:58,493 --> 00:10:59,110
Yes!

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,602
Jiro finally accepted his friend request.

147
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:02,523
Let’s go over there.

148
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,217
Yes!

149
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:07,171
That was amazing, Tiger.

150
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,815
Jiro finally accepted your friend request.

151
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,915
Hey, Je Meow.

152
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:14,526
This isn’t Jiro.

153
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,003
Huh?

154
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,522
They look really similar,

155
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,761
but Jiro has bigger eyes
and chubbier cheeks.

156
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,623
Come on, no drama.

157
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:30,105
I’m just messing with you.

158
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,109
You’re good, though. 
You remembered Jiro.

159
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:34,514
This is another orange cat 
someone’s letting me look after for now.

160
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,514
So I rotated him in with Jiro.

161
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,601
Here you go.

162
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,625
There he is.

163
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:44,986
Your Jiro.

164
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:45,724
Jiro.

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,028
Tiger’s here.

166
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:49,185
Tiger could remember you.

167
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,246
Give him a reward.

168
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:04,962
This is the real Jiro, 
with the verified blue checkmark.

169
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:06,072
Congrats.

170
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:08,679
Je Meow.

171
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:12,130
Can I take a picture of Jiro 
for my phone wallpaper?

172
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,179
Sure. Go ahead.

173
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,737
How about I take it for you?

174
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,660
Make sure Jiro looks handsome.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,005
Nice.

176
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:33,857
(Our condo doesn’t allow cats,
in case someone here didn’t know.)

177
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:38,196
What’s up?

178
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:42,149
(Hey, Lynx. We’re all here. 
Where the hell are you?)

179
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:44,881
On my way.

180
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,861
(Be real. Aren’t you still at home
and standing us up?)

181
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:51,141
Good. If you already know, I’m hanging up.

182
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:55,289
(Hold on. Remember telling me
you were looking for a full-time job?)

183
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:59,481
(One of my clients is looking for
a full-time interpreter in Melbourne.)

184
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:03,129
(It’s tough work, but the pay’s huge.)

185
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,331
When does it start?

186
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,461
(Next month.)

187
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:08,731
(It’s a long-term contract, though.)

188
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,330
(If I could stand being away from my bae,
I’d go myself.)

189
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:38,798
Tiger!

190
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:41,559
Hi, Je Meow.

191
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,462
Those are for Jiro?

192
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,463
Yes.

193
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:47,788
I’m not sure which one he’ll like.

194
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,608
Pick the blue one.

195
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,393
Jiro told me he likes blue.

196
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,578
You can talk to cats?

197
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:57,726
Shhh.

198
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,748
Yes, I can talk to cats.

199
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,286
Kidding.

200
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,734
Cats see blue better than red.

201
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:14,730
Oh.

202
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,989
It’s in their nature.

203
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:17,808
I see.

204
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:22,582
He’s gonna like it.

205
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:25,744
After you.

206
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,464
Thanks for helping me carry these bags.

207
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:33,700
Why did you buy so much stuff?

208
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:38,176
I bought ingredients
to make fried noodles for Lynx.

209
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:39,560
It’s his favorite.

210
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,812
He’s dropping by.

211
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,974
I bought enough to make extra for you too.

212
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,991
I saw you always checking out 
Lynx’s pictures.

213
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,492
No, I didn’t.

214
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:52,626
Come on, I’m kidding.

215
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,372
I actually wanted to cook for you

216
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:59,350
to thank you for going easy on me
about the debt.

217
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:00,531
So…

218
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,235
you already knew who I was?

219
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:06,713
I did.

220
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:10,541
I’m sorry for paying back late.

221
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,130
I haven’t been well,
so I had to close the café a lot.

222
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,318
But I promise
I’ll pay off the debt as soon as I can.

223
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay.

224
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:21,893
Why didn’t you ask Lynx to help you out?

225
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:27,506
Oi, I was already glad 
he even picked up my calls.

226
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,392
We haven’t talked in three years.

227
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,451
I don’t know if something’s going on.

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,133
My son’s a tough case, right?

229
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,910
Want to give it a shot?

230
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,402
If you win him over, 
the cat café’s included.

231
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:42,588
I’ll give it to you.

232
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,377
You’re interested, right?

233
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:48,983
Let’s go.

234
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,108
Oi.

235
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:01,905
Are you alright?

236
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,405
You okay?

237
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:09,695
I’m okay.

238
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,497
I’ll be fine.

239
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:13,477
Just something that comes with age.

240
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:19,032
Let’s go.

241
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:19,931
I’m okay now.

242
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,759
Let’s go eat fried noodles.

243
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:33,119
Oh!

244
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:35,244
What time is it already?

245
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,905
Gosh, Lynx still isn’t here?

246
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:42,943
Should you call him?

247
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,392
He probably had something urgent.

248
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:49,496
It’s fine.

249
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:57,689
No matter how urgent, he could’ve called.

250
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,550
It’s alright.

251
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,366
Just knowing he’d come
already makes me happy.

252
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:13,723
I even thought he’d never
step foot in here again.

253
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:19,791
Cat owners get used to being ignored by cats.

254
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,461
But when it’s your own kid,

255
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,675
no matter how long it’s been,

256
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:28,957
you never get used to it.

257
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:37,049
It’s pretty late now, Tiger.

258
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:38,948
You should head home.

259
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,683
I’ll pack you my Korat fried noodles.

260
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:43,944
You’ll love it.

261
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,440
You don’t have to.

262
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,645
Come on, my cooking’s really good.

263
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,124
I don’t want to trouble you.

264
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:50,168
Try them.

265
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:24,083
Je!

266
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,586
Je Meow!

267
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:29,942
Je, Je Meow.

268
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,166
Je!

269
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:33,426
Je!

270
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,804
Meow~

271
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:56,662
(Hey! Call an ambulance now!)

272
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:59,560
- (What do we do?) 
- (What happened?)

273
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,896
- (What's wrong?) 
- (What's wrong with Je Meow?)

274
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:08,458
- (Je Meow, wake up.) 
- (Why is Je Meow on the floor?)

275
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,419
(Have you called an ambulance?)

276
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:12,270
(Call an ambulance. Call it now.)

277
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,177
Hello, someone passed out.

278
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,043
Please send an ambulance right away.

279
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,782
PUNARI VILAWONG
8 AUGUST 1980 – 23 MARCH 2025

280
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:45,467
Where the hell were you that night?

281
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,046
Do you know your mother…

282
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,270
waited for you until her last breath?

283
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:16,344
Hey!

284
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:18,389
Hey!

285
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:19,592
Hey!

286
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,499
(Hey, lil' bro. Your fly's open.)

287
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:24,864
What happened to me? I really can hear them talking.

288
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:26,367
Who are you talking to?
