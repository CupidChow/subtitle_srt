00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,693
EPISODE 13

3
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,992
This is our house. Come on in.

4
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,274
Okay. This is my secret room.

5
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:57,200
When I open this handle
and press this button…

6
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,856
Okay. What do you think?

7
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,576
It's empty.

8
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,828
Look here.

9
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,872
It looks like something has been moved.

10
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,291
The marks look fresh.

11
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,918
Gosh, my dear father.

12
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,631
He must've secretly stashed it here,
but I guess that bitch got to it again.

13
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,721
He didn't even tell
his own children about this secret room.

14
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,665
Did you send him off well?

15
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,127
It was you, wasn't it?
You killed our father.

16
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,921
-Why would I?
-Because you didn't need him

17
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,214
after taking his money.

18
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,758
Where is it?

19
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,885
I don't know what you're saying.

20
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,137
Your father is dead,
and you still want his money.

21
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,015
-Your poor father.
-Cut the nonsense.

22
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,976
Leave this house right now.

23
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,062
You have no right to be here anymore.

24
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,106
I'm a legal resident here.

25
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,568
If you want to kick me out,
the court needs to order it first.

26
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,279
Aren't you aware of this, Attorney Baek?

27
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,406
Is this true? We can't just kick her out?

28
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,451
There's a procedure,
but you'll have to leave.

29
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,161
We'll see about that.

30
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,414
We're moving back in.

31
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,416
-Do you still want to stay?
-Why not?

32
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,377
We've been living together
for over 20 years.

33
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,711
You said we were family.

34
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,171
-But--
-Suit yourself.

35
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,882
We'll be back soon.

36
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,342
Let's see if you can bear it.

37
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,751
Hae-in.

38
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,091
Grandfather?

39
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,678
I would've loved to speak to you

40
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,179
in person.

41
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,515
But still,

42
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,811
I'm glad I can talk to you like this.

43
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,022
Thank you.

44
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,656
I briefly come to my senses
every now and then

45
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,493
like a basement
that receives limited sunlight.

46
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:32,040
But there's not much I can do.

47
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,126
I don't remember much either.

48
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,004
I'm just full of regrets.

49
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,841
I've been a money-grubber all my life.

50
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,801
I did everything in my power

51
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,055
to keep the money I gathered.

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,559
I wasted most of my years doing that.

53
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,939
What am I left with?

54
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:02,278
I'd like you all to know that I regret

55
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,823
the life I led.

56
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,450
FORMER CHAIRMAN HONG MAN-DAE

57
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,370
I hope you live differently.

58
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,831
I truly hope

59
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,252
that you won't look back in futility

60
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,213
at the end of the road.

61
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,232
Dad…

62
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,655
Dad…

63
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,890
I love you all.

64
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,809
And…

65
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,576
You need to eat even if you're not hungry.

67
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,558
Do you want to go
inside the car if you're cold?

68
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,476
It's okay.

69
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,694
This feels

70
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,738
very strange.

71
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,617
It feels like I'm doing a rehearsal.

72
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,577
A rehearsal?

73
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,204
A death rehearsal.

74
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,796
I didn't know

75
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,132
a funeral was so complex.

76
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,720
They dig a hole in the ground,
place the coffin,

77
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,682
have some rice soup in a tent,
and mourn by the grave.

78
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,809
Then when it's time,

79
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,979
they'll all go home.

80
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,983
And I'll be all by myself.

81
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:54,408
You know that the three months
I've been given

82
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,160
have already passed.

83
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,500
I could even die tonight.

84
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,295
But my family
would have to mourn again if I died.

85
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,047
That wouldn't

86
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,633
look good for our family, right?

87
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,468
Was that

88
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,805
what you've been worrying about?

89
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,516
That your family would mourn again?

90
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,185
No.

91
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,191
I kept thinking that I wanted to live.

92
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,703
It's sunny.

93
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,206
The clouds look pretty,
and the birds are chirping.

94
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,169
This world is annoyingly beautiful.

95
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,384
So, of course, I want to live.

96
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,259
CHECKING ID
PLEASE WAIT

97
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,908
How did you find it?

98
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,245
DREAMLAND THEME PARK

99
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,849
Okay. This is my secret room.

100
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,565
When I open this handle
and press this button…

101
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,197
Thank you.

102
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,618
I told you.

103
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,204
I loved you in my own way.

104
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,337
This money will keep you safe.

105
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,182
His daughter is sick,

106
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,808
and now, he lost his father.

107
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,395
Mr. Hong must be devastated.

108
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,397
Right.

109
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,817
But you can say
things are looking up for his family

110
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,903
after the chairman passed away.

111
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,946
-Is that so?
-Gosh.

112
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,532
Hear me out.

113
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,659
Look.

114
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,661
Chairman Hong had entrusted
21% of his shares

115
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,748
to that woman, Moh Seul-hee.

116
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,458
But now that he's passed away,

117
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,419
-his family received it.
-I see.

118
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,548
Yoon Eun-sung's total shares were 59.1%.

119
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,551
But now, it has plummeted to 38.1%.

120
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,222
Once our in-laws get hold
of their frozen shares,

121
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,308
-they'll have 34.7% in total.
-I see.

122
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,936
Then the gap will be 3.4%.

123
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,771
-That's quite neck and neck.
-Right.

124
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,606
How do you know this so well?

125
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,274
-I'm a club member.
-What club?

126
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,817
The Queens Minor Stockholders' Club.

127
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:44,281
We're waiting for the management
feud results with bated breath.

128
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,326
What for?

129
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,371
I know I'm being calculating.

130
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,580
But what do you think

131
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,415
-will happen to Hyun-woo?
-What do you mean?

132
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,334
Let's be honest. He's been doing

133
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,837
his utmost best to help them
after everything.

134
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,714
Perhaps, they'll thank him in some way.

135
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:05,469
Maybe they'll give him some shares
or appoint him as a CEO later on.

136
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,389
I don't ask for much,

137
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,476
but could you do me this one favor?

138
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,478
Sure.

139
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,396
What is it?

140
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,857
If someone asks you who your father is,

141
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,277
please don't tell them it's me.

142
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,445
Jeez.

143
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,780
Why not?

144
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,616
Why not? Hey, wait for me.

145
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,544
Thank you for everything.

146
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,796
Gosh, don't mention it.

147
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,718
Things will look up
once you return to Seoul.

148
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,803
Do you think so?

149
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,357
You see…

150
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,320
These persimmons

151
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,739
used to be very bitter.

152
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,618
But there's a way
to turn this awfully bitter fruit

153
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,036
-into a sweet one.
-How?

154
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,038
It's by soaking them.

155
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,708
You pour some soju on top,

156
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,503
wrap the bodies,
then let them sit for some time.

157
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,088
Then they become sweet.

158
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,509
Here. Try it.

159
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,308
It's sweet.

160
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,814
Life can be bitter
just like these persimmons.

161
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,151
Life is tough as is,

162
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,528
so imagine pouring
some bitter soju on top.

163
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,365
Gosh, it'd be utterly unbearable.

164
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,450
But if you endure it,

165
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,911
life will become sweet again.

166
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,913
And that'll motivate you to stay strong.

167
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,289
Don't you think so?

168
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,001
Right.

169
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,089
Hey, come and have a drink with us.

170
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,382
Sure.

171
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,427
INTERNATIONAL CALL

172
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,263
I got a call from Germany. Excuse me.

173
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,423
Does that mean she can receive surgery?

174
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,091
Yes.

175
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,635
Thank God.

176
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,807
Her case was a difficult one
since they couldn't open up her brain.

177
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,977
But they can destroy the tumor cells

178
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,730
using high-intensity ultrasound.

179
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,648
They had a successful case recently too.

180
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,692
Good. Things are looking up now.

181
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,153
Thanks, Hyun-woo. Does Hae-in know?

182
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,738
-I should tell her.
-However…

183
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,115
there's a problem.

184
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,496
Goodness, Hae-in. This feels like a dream.

185
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,999
Gosh, this must be a gift

186
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,834
from Father.

187
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,752
Is it true?

188
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,588
-Can she receive surgery?
-Yes.

189
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,966
I'm so happy for you.

190
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,217
Goodness.

191
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,511
I'm so grateful.

192
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,138
Congratulations.

193
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,098
Congratulations, sweetie.

194
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,786
How did they reach you? Via email? Phone?

195
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,037
Was it a video call?

196
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,205
They called me.

197
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,123
A phone call?

198
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,086
You don't think
they were scammers, do you?

199
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,003
No, they weren't.

200
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,004
I see.

201
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,798
Okay. Good night.

202
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:59,263
By the way, are you sure
the surgery works in rare cases like mine?

203
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,389
Yes.

204
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,890
I'm sure.

205
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,975
I see.

206
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,396
And the date?

207
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,981
Tell them I can go right away.

208
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,107
I did.

209
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,234
Good then.

210
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,662
Are you saying

211
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,998
that this surgery

212
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,293
will save my life?

213
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,297
Does Hae-in know?

214
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,798
I should tell her.

215
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,716
However…

216
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,093
there's a problem.

217
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,429
A part of the hippocampus will be damaged

218
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,931
-during the process.
-And?

219
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,976
It's highly likely…

220
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,147
that she'll lose her long-term memory.

221
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,483
Hold on.

222
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,986
What are you saying?

223
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,863
She could lose all her memory

224
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,782
from before the surgery.

225
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,833
But this is our only choice

226
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,585
if we want her

227
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,503
to live.

228
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,173
Her WBC isn't going up quickly,

229
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,592
so she can't receive the clinical test.

230
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,928
We really have no time now.

231
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,722
She might refuse the surgery

232
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,017
if she hears about the side effects.

233
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,560
But what if

234
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,564
she runs out of time?

235
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,483
Hyun-woo.

236
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,818
Keep this a secret.

237
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,406
Why don't you take her to Germany first,
then persuade her there?

238
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,784
I beg you.

239
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,121
She needs the surgery to live.

240
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,374
Will I be able to live then?

241
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,419
What is it?

242
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,507
Yes, you will.

243
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,218
Don't worry.

244
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,058
All right.

245
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,644
Night.

246
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,093
Hae-in.

247
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,861
It's okay.

248
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,613
I'm fine. I really am.

249
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,242
It's just been ages since I felt fine.

250
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,078
These are tears of joy.

251
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,624
Yes, I know.

252
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,297
It feels like

253
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,051
I woke up from a long nightmare.

254
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,316
You're okay now.

255
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,929
Let's go to bed.

256
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,914
HAE-IN
HYUN-WOO

257
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,078
You don't have to go to work today, right?

258
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:00,957
No.

259
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,335
Then let's hang out.

260
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:08,924
Okay, let's do that.

261
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,224
GURANG-RI STATION

262
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,315
TICKET OFFICE

263
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,775
Two people.

264
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,237
All right.

265
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,682
-Okay, good.
-What?

266
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:22,789
Other than our honeymoon,
isn't this our first trip?

267
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,749
You're right.

268
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,960
I've been too much of a workaholic.

269
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,797
Let's go on many trips
after I receive surgery.

270
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,091
Promise.

271
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,594
Okay.

272
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,417
Listen.

273
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,462
I want everything to be smooth
before I receive surgery.

274
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,424
You know I only drink extracted juice
for the same reason, right?

275
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,635
I do. What's on your mind?

276
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,805
I wasn't planning on hiding them,

277
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,932
but there are three things
I kept from you.

278
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,059
Three?

279
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,227
I'll come clean before I go.

280
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,979
I'll tell you one for today.

281
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,482
Sure. What is it?

282
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,150
You said

283
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,528
that you found this MP3.

284
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:36,946
I did.

285
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,074
It's mine.

286
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,619
-What?
-Do you see this "H"?

287
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,162
It stands for "Hae-in".

288
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:48,500
I had lost it in our schoolyard
before going abroad for my studies.

289
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,168
And look where it is now.

290
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,466
That can't be.

291
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,301
It sure can.

292
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,643
I don't believe it.

293
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,646
Something unbelievable happened to us.

294
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,067
It may not mean much to you

295
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,278
since I was just a nobody in your life.

296
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,739
No, you're wrong.

297
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,534
Listen. I actually--

298
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,494
Don't be afraid.

299
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,162
I'm not scolding you. Why?

300
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,289
Because I'm not the old me.

301
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,959
I'll be reborn soon.

302
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,631
I'm going to be optimistic

303
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,174
and only see the good in life.

304
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,762
Is that so?

305
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,680
Yes.

306
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,474
This MP3
is a living witness to our history.

307
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,853
So I'm only going to focus
on that positive point.

308
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,984
That's good.

309
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,903
Eun-sung told me

310
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,072
how he had saved me in the past

311
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,575
and made it seem like we were fated.

312
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,076
What? Fated?

313
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,870
Jeez.

314
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,664
Has he gone crazy or what?
How dare he say that?

315
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,418
So what? We have our own movie-like story.

316
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,129
When I saw you at the schoolyard,

317
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,013
I thought, "Does this handsome kid
go to my school?

318
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,849
I can't believe I'm leaving.

319
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,976
I feel terrible."

320
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,603
That's what I thought.

321
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,355
Black slip-ons.

322
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,608
You were wearing

323
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,402
black slip-ons.

324
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,821
You had white socks

325
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,449
and very fair skin.

326
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:49,329
And your hair was in a high ponytail.

327
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,124
I did wear ponytails often back then.

328
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,001
The moment I saw you, I thought,

329
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:56,878
"I found her."

330
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,713
"My dream girl."

331
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,843
I looked everywhere for you
starting the next day.

332
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,388
I didn't have a chance
to look at your name tag.

333
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,849
-Really?
-Yeah.

334
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,726
You were like Cinderella.

335
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,103
You had only left behind your MP3.

336
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,104
It drove me crazy.

337
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,482
But look at us now.

338
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,401
We crossed paths again, got married…

339
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,280
We did get divorced, but still.

340
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,952
This is what you call true fate.

341
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,869
All right.

342
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,498
Since I'm your dream woman,

343
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,250
and this is fate…

344
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,334
From now on…

345
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,174
I didn't know

346
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,136
that phrase was this beautiful.

347
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,517
I'm getting teary-eyed.

348
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,360
I thought I wouldn't be
a part of your future.

349
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,238
But now, we have a future together.

350
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,290
Speaking of which…

351
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,217
I'll withdraw our divorce like you asked.

352
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,395
What's with that face?

353
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,198
Don't take it back.

354
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,200
I run a department store.

355
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,954
I hate customers
who return things and demand a refund.

356
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,334
You can't take this back

357
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,086
even if you wake up one day

358
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,340
and dislike me.

359
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,761
A change of mind is not a valid reason
to get a refund. That's a given.

360
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,683
Even if we get

361
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,853
into huge fights

362
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,980
and you're sick of me…

363
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,902
Even if you claim that you don't remember
making this promise,

364
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,236
there's no taking back.

365
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,614
I'll still be by your side.

366
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,574
All right. Fine. Do that.

367
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:34,911
So stop talking.

368
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,174
I love it the most

369
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,428
when I can just focus on your heartbeat.

370
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,002
I did some calculations.

371
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,796
Five percent would be
forty-five billion won.

372
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,506
But I'll just ask for 40 billion.

373
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,384
I even have a car waiting outside
in case it's cash.

374
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,011
-A big one.
-Are you a creditor?

375
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,848
I may sound rude for saying this,

376
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:41,060
but perhaps our history
made me into who I am today.

377
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,731
I was betrayed several times
after doing all the work.

378
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,118
Check.

379
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,248
KO JEONG-JA

380
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,004
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

381
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,966
I respect you, ma'am.

382
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,053
A gorgeous face, a silver tongue,
and alluring charisma.

383
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,555
It's rare for one to have all of them.

384
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,017
I want to live wisely like you.

385
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,186
-The payment is suspended.
-Sorry?

386
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,855
You can only spend that money
when I let you.

387
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,939
Ma'am.

388
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,359
Our history made you
into who you are today?

389
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,613
Likewise. I was betrayed several times.

390
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,782
-Look.
-I'll lift the suspension

391
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,452
once I'm content with your work.
Then you can take it.

392
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,536
Goodness.

393
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,747
You sure are wise.

394
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,084
Mom!

395
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,087
What's all this?
It's not even kimchi-making season!

396
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,589
Hae-in's family is leaving,
but I have nothing to give.

397
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,424
I'll give them
some pear extract and kimchi.

398
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,343
This isn't little at all.

399
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,054
I thought I could share with our neighbors

400
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,430
and the elderly.

401
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,099
You can't do this alone.

402
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,226
Then go get some gloves and help out.

403
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,603
Well, I need these hands to make a living.

404
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,897
Let me help.

405
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,525
-Should I slice the radish?
-That'd be great.

406
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,072
Jeez, she's so fast.

407
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,700
She knows how to chop.

408
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,456
Her chopping skills
were out of this world.

409
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,707
-I see.
-I see.

410
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,210
-And she has guts.
-Why?

411
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,137
Hey.

412
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,514
Do you think
I'll take you back if you do this?

413
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,016
I don't expect you to.

414
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,102
I'm going to leave once I'm done here.

415
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,354
Don't worry, Mother.

416
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,232
Yet you still call me that.

417
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,609
Are you teasing me? Don't call me that.

418
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,486
But I'd like to.

419
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,573
What?

420
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,119
You're the first person
I ever called "Mother."

421
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,579
So please let me do that.

422
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,587
-Here you go.
-Hey.

423
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,880
-Are you done?
-Anything else?

424
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,298
That's enough.

425
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,550
I'll chop the green onions.

426
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,763
Unbelievable.

427
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,600
-I kind of like her.
-Why?

428
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,769
I like how she's not intimidated
and speaks her mind

429
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,521
in front of her mother-in-law.

430
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,778
Hae-in.

431
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,156
Come sit. They all heard

432
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,783
about your surgery and were happy for you.

433
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,826
I'm so happy for you.

434
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,870
-I'm glad.
-It all worked out.

435
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,871
Thank you.

436
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,456
By the way,

437
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,751
what were you doing?

438
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,963
Right. Have you done this before?
Dyeing your nails with balsam?

439
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,217
-No.
-Legend has it that if your nails

440
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,303
are still colored by the first snow,
your first love will come true.

441
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:06,015
That's why Bang-sil here always dyes hers
in the fall, not summer.

442
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:07,975
How romantic.

443
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,354
Actually, I'd say
she has an ulterior motive.

444
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,357
I wouldn't say it's an ulterior motive.

445
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,567
He happens to be divorced.

446
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,820
-Hey.
-I didn't feel like this before,

447
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,615
but we've been running
into each other often lately.

448
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,574
So my feelings…

449
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,159
Shut that mouth of yours.

450
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,452
-That's enough.
-Stop.

451
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,954
-Shut it.
-Sorry.

452
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,958
I guess I was too blunt.
I hope you're not offended, Ms. Hong.

453
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,210
-Why would I be?
-You see…

454
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,046
Hyun-woo used to flirt a lot with me

455
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:40,049
at church back when he was in high school.

456
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,343
When did he ever do that?

457
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,719
Didn't you know?

458
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,347
They used to hand out snacks at church,

459
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,227
and he'd always give me more than one

460
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,353
in front of everyone.

461
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,356
That's because
you always ate other kids' snacks.

462
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,109
Hae-in, please don't misunderstand.

463
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,861
Don't talk such nonsense, Bang-sil.

464
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,118
Until the first snow, was it?

465
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,745
-Check this out.
-Balsam?

466
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,247
It's not that simple.

467
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,417
-Then?
-It signifies my excitement, hope,

468
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,879
and anticipation for the first snow
that I thought I'd never see.

469
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,882
I didn't think I'd ever see winter again

470
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,551
let alone the first snow.

471
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,470
But it's possible now.

472
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,390
Of course.

473
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:16,020
And it'll come true
if the color still remains by then.

474
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,481
-What will come true?
-My first love.

475
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,443
By "first love,"

476
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,447
do you mean that guy
on the bus or taxi from before?

477
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,784
You're happy to watch them from afar.
You can't stop thinking about them.

478
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,244
You take a detour
just to see them once more.

479
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,080
You were happy to watch him from afar.

480
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,956
You couldn't stop thinking about him.

481
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,542
And you took a detour
just to see him once more.

482
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,336
That bastard?

483
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,213
Why are you cursing him?

484
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,049
Fine.

485
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,842
-That guy?
-Yes.

486
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,596
I hope it'll snow sooner

487
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,181
this year.

488
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,603
Hae-in, you even took my ring back.

489
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,730
Your first love shouldn't come true,

490
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,690
or it'll really complicate things.

491
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,567
Are you listening?

492
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,112
Hae-in.

493
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,416
-Michael met with Hong Beom-seok?
-Yes, as the CEO of Ever H.

494
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,002
I guess the eldest son wants to return
now that his father is dead.

495
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,129
Ever H recently appeared

496
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,965
on the stockholder's list
as a non-institutional investor.

497
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,801
He must've been gathering stocks
ever since they plummeted.

498
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,970
He's been asking
the anchor LPs for my spot.

499
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,223
He can try, but you'll be safe
with what I've given you.

500
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,267
As you said,

501
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,936
we founded paper companies
in Hong Kong and Switzerland

502
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,356
and opened up an IEBC business account.

503
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,776
You're the only one who can manage it.

504
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,076
-What will your first transaction be?
-Make it 2.1% in CD.

505
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,619
CD(CAREFUL DISCRETION): BUYING SMALL
AMOUNTS OF STOCK AT REGULAR INTERVALS

506
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,246
-Yes, sir.
-He took the bait.

507
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,248
He's finally using the secret fund.

508
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,752
He's probably worried
that my uncle might take his spot.

509
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,422
Is Mr. Hong still in New York?

510
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,382
Yes, he's still meeting with the LPs.

511
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,135
Keep Eun-sung in the loop

512
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,013
so that he'll feel anxious
and use the secret fund to buy stocks.

513
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,848
-Yes, sir.
-Once we have concrete proof,

514
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,976
we can charge him for embezzlement,
malpractice, and violating

515
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,519
foreign exchange transaction laws.

516
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,646
By the way,

517
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,815
about that guy, Pyeon Seong-uk…

518
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,568
Isn't he the land broker
who kidnapped you?

519
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,695
Yes, he had agreed to hand over

520
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,531
the double contract
and information on Director Jo.

521
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,909
But he never showed up,
and I can't reach him.

522
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,412
He hasn't been spending any money
or using his phone for over a week now.

523
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,789
Maybe he stowed away.

524
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,339
Oh, God!

525
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,091
A man, presumably in his 40s,
was found dead last night

526
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,303
near the Sambang Reservoir
in Yeongjin-gun, Gyeonggi Province.

527
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,971
He had been stabbed with a weapon,

528
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,058
and his identity remains unknown
due to severe decomposition--

529
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,320
How could this be mine,
but not mine at the same time?

530
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,872
Ms. Kim!

531
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,458
The amazing Grace is here!

532
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,085
Jeez, why is she back?

533
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,003
What are you doing?

534
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,922
Can't you see?
I'm making dried persimmons.

535
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:30,881
Goodness.

536
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,051
Your hands have gotten rough.

537
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,011
Look at those dark circles.

538
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,139
All the freckles
I worked hard to erase are back.

539
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,062
You'll be making a comeback soon.

540
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,814
It's a battlefield there.

541
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,233
Everyone will take sides between Ms. Moh,

542
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,943
that sly fox, and you.

543
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,904
What's the best way
to intimidate your opponent?

544
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,533
With your face, of course.
Lie down right now.

545
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,035
You need to look tight and radiant.

546
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,421
I've never done this before.
It's ticklish.

547
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:14,008
Don't smile, or you'll get wrinkles.
Keep these words in mind.

548
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,052
Whitening, resilience,
recovery, and comeback.

549
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,264
The best way to make a comeback
is through recovery and resilience.

550
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,183
Don't worry.
Everything will go back to its place.

551
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,269
We'll return to Queens,

552
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,771
and Hae-in will get surgery
and become healthy again.

553
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,232
Is she getting surgery?

554
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,693
I thought surgery wasn't an option.

555
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,945
We found a hospital that could do it.

556
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,947
She'll be leaving for Germany soon.

557
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,948
Is that so?

558
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,993
I'm so glad.

559
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,245
-Right?
-Right?

560
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,063
Hello, I wanted to see you.

561
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,939
-See me?
-Yes.

562
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,692
-I have something for you.
-What is it?

563
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,612
But I didn't think I'd run into you,
so it's at home.

564
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,821
Shall we meet tonight?

565
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,074
-At night?
-Yes.

566
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,619
Sure then.

567
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,004
Why does he want to meet at this hour?

568
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,176
He's such a go-getter.

569
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,302
He's dangerous.

570
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,143
You were here already.

571
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,232
Yes.

572
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,403
-So I--
-Let me go first.

573
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,529
Okay. I'm listening.

574
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,530
I'll be leaving

575
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,366
tomorrow.

576
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,952
And I don't know when I'll ever revisit.

577
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,204
I heard that you were leaving so--

578
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,872
I know what you want to say.

579
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,419
I caught onto it

580
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,213
from the mulberry incident.

581
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,674
-But no.
-Sorry?

582
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,175
What do you--

583
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,301
I have

584
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,220
a lot on my plate.

585
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,181
Not only do I have movable assets,
real estate, stocks, and bonds,

586
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,767
but I also have three ex-husbands.

587
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,020
I had no idea.

588
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,022
Right?

589
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,357
Anyway…

590
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,442
I'm complicated

591
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,611
and carry many burdens.

592
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,697
So I can't

593
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,574
accept it.

594
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,369
I hope you still will.

595
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:49,955
What is this?

596
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,083
Did you write a letter?

597
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,172
You really shouldn't…

598
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,256
CONDOLENCES
KIM YEONG-SONG

599
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,757
It's condolence money.

600
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,509
I heard about your father.

601
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,892
I don't need this.

602
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,143
-I should go.
-No, wait.

603
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,228
Come on. This isn't right.

604
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,189
This isn't for you.

605
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,608
It's for your father.

606
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:22,529
Even the wealthiest
start off with no money in the afterlife.

607
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,660
It's not much, but I'm sure

608
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,164
he'll be able to enjoy
some rice soup and drinks tonight

609
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,749
with his friends.

610
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,839
He'll be enjoying good food

611
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,134
and having a great time with his friends.

612
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,969
So don't be too sad.

613
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:50,974
Thank you.

614
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,561
Goodbye.

615
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,908
Goodbye.

616
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,136
What do you mean?

617
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,013
You want to stay here?

618
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,349
I'm dumbfounded.

619
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,935
It's temporary.
Just until we find a place in Seoul.

620
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,646
Your mother doesn't understand
why you need to find a place.

621
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,858
I've had two training wheels
throughout my whole life.

622
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:42,776
One was you.

623
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,737
And the other one was you.

624
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,155
What are you saying?

625
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,032
But now,

626
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,786
I want to remove them
and stand on my own two feet.

627
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,163
Don't be ridiculous.

628
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,249
Hey, did you persuade him?

629
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,626
-Did you urge him again?
-Honey, be quiet.

630
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,003
Don't say a thing.

631
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,296
Plead the Fifth.

632
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,507
You're forbidden
from speaking to her directly.

633
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,342
-If you want, speak to our attorney.
-What?

634
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,012
-Please do that, Hyun-woo.
-Sorry, but I refuse.

635
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,098
Hey, you can take care
of your own family issues.

636
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,392
Since we're on this topic,
let me say something too.

637
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,769
I'm not going home either.

638
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,313
You too?

639
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,982
We're moving
into his studio apartment in Seoul.

640
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,402
We'll be leaving for Germany soon,
and it's closer to the airport.

641
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,195
No, it's actually farther from there.

642
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,323
Best of all, it's newly built
and fully furnished.

643
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,450
It has everything we need
in that small area.

644
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,909
But back home,

645
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,037
we need to take the elevator
to reach the kitchen.

646
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,664
It just takes way too long.

647
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,708
Hey, your excuses are lengthier.

648
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,044
You just want some alone time.

649
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,170
Yes, ma'am.

650
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,839
I'd like to spend
some time with her alone.

651
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,802
Please let us do that.

652
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,764
Sure, if that's more comfortable for you.

653
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,307
Sure, you can do that.

654
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,809
Let me know if you need anything.

655
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,811
Gosh.

656
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,064
Is this what discrimination feels like?

657
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,483
This is my first time experiencing it.

658
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,942
It's something new, though.

659
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,487
They're packing up and returning tomorrow.

660
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,197
You should be ready for them.

661
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,533
I also met with Da-hye.

662
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,079
What is this?

663
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,330
Why did you come back?

664
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,207
Don't let Ms. Moh know.

665
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,416
You idiot.

666
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,294
She was the one who told me you were here.

667
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,253
Seriously?

668
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,339
She knows how you came here

669
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,425
in a taxi with the golden Buddha
in the middle of the night.

670
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,302
Her men are watching you.

671
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,262
So tell me. Why are you here?

672
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,889
Is it guilt or a grudge?

673
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,642
What grudge could I have?

674
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,851
It's my conscience.

675
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,228
I didn't know you had one.

676
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,438
Me neither.

677
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,317
He was the first person
to love me for who I was, and I felt bad.

678
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,610
Goodness.

679
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,736
Unbelievable.

680
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,196
He grew on her.

681
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:55,242
I'm sure you know
that those feelings can't be stopped.

682
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,036
How dare she betray me
after all I've done for her?

683
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,789
This is exactly why
you shouldn't trust people.

684
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,583
And about Hae-in…

685
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,044
She might be able to save herself.

686
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,713
She's getting surgery.

687
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,297
Hyun-woo looked everywhere for help,

688
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,466
and they finally found
a hospital that can help.

689
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,677
They're leaving for Germany next week.

690
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,309
You startled me.

691
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,189
Find out which hospital
and what kind of surgery she's receiving.

692
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,654
What are you doing?

693
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,572
Nothing much.

694
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,699
I can see many stars.

695
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,793
I even saw a shooting star recently.

696
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,212
Really?

697
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,508
I dreamed of one
when I was pregnant with you.

698
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,845
I always wanted a pretty daughter.

699
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,805
I was ecstatic…

700
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,559
after having that dream.

701
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,072
I don't know which attitude to take.

702
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,869
We were like cats and dogs
for over 20 years,

703
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:24,372
so I feel awkward to suddenly act
so affectionate toward you.

704
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,708
But deep down,

705
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,253
I feel so guilty

706
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,714
and regretful.

707
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,924
I want to treat you well.

708
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,010
This is good enough.

709
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,224
Is it?

710
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:45,143
I'd feel awkward, too,
if you suddenly changed your ways.

711
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,771
We'll have a lot of time,

712
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,231
so let's take it slowly.

713
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,110
This will do for now.

714
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:55,862
All right.

715
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:02,160
Once you return from Germany,
we can gradually warm up to each other.

716
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,550
I didn't know it was this suffocating

717
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,176
to act as a mediator.

718
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,930
Right. They say it's just as stressful
as joining the military.

719
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,016
We need to move out of the house
if I want to protect Da-hye

720
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,726
from my mom.

721
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,689
Gosh. What's taking them so long?

722
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,482
Mom, Dad.

723
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,192
I packed your stuff.

724
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,735
Really? Okay.

725
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,490
You'll run into traffic soon,
so you should go now. Hurry.

726
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,955
I'm sorry for all the inconvenience,

727
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:50,041
but I feel the most guilty
about leaving him behind.

728
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,377
It feels like leaving

729
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,838
a bag of trash behind after a trip.

730
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,756
-Father--
-Gosh, don't worry.

731
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,759
And why are you in a hurry?

732
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,761
Have lunch with us.

733
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,762
Should we?

734
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,515
No! Our house has been empty
for over a month now.

735
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,933
There's a lot to take care of.

736
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,644
-I was going to make kimchi pancakes.
-It's okay.

737
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:10,645
Kimchi pancakes?

738
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:14,399
How about some crispy kimchi pancakes
and delicious makgeolli?

739
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,693
That's ridiculous. He needs to drive.

740
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,361
I can drive instead.

741
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,616
Or better yet, you can leave tomorrow.

742
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,618
-You should.
-We could.

743
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,371
Do you know how beautiful it is

744
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,332
to know when to leave?

745
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,750
Must I know that?

746
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,585
We'll get going first.

747
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,046
We don't want to run into traffic.

748
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,506
Okay, you should go before then.

749
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,010
Thank you for everything. Goodbye.

750
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,306
Good luck with the surgery.

751
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,224
Hae-in.

752
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,893
Let's meet again.

753
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,198
Hyun-woo.

754
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,950
I trust you.

755
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,202
Don't worry.

756
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,745
Here.

757
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,874
Your mom made
some kimchi and pear extract.

758
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,959
Carry it for him.

759
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,627
Should I? Give it to me.

760
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,836
Goodbye.

761
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:27,639
Mom, your handbag…

762
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,738
You're the bachelor on the 11th floor.

763
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:44,823
-Hello.
-Hi.

764
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,495
He's not a bachelor.

765
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,915
I'm his wife.

766
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,460
Didn't you say

767
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,462
you were living here by yourself?

768
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,923
Did you get married recently?

769
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,427
-Yes.
-Goodness!

770
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,346
You're newlyweds!

771
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,683
You must be so happy.

772
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,560
Yes, we are.

773
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,666
It's official that we're newlyweds now.

774
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,669
Why is it official?

775
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,421
Because of that lady.

776
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,884
A woman like her will tell everyone
in this building about us by tomorrow.

777
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:51,973
"The bachelor on the 11th floor
married a gorgeous woman."

778
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,853
Okay. So?

779
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:03,026
We should act like newlyweds then.

780
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,240
How?

781
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,432
Normally, newlyweds in love

782
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,851
are always touching each other somehow.

783
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,243
It could be their hands, feet,

784
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,586
or shoulders.

785
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,882
Anything.

786
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,637
They stick by each other

787
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,765
and spend their everyday lives together.

788
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,768
We're bound to run
into hardships again one day.

789
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,436
I'm nervous. Did you smile?

790
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,230
Then we can pull out these happy memories

791
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:26,109
as if they're candies in a candy jar

792
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,112
and endure those moments.

793
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,948
That's why we need to gather

794
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,242
as many good memories
as possible right now.

795
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,545
That looks tasty.

796
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,028
I'm going to focus more
on collecting happy memories

797
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,906
than stocks or money from now on.

798
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,033
The most important thing for me now

799
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,410
is filling up my candy jar.

800
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,627
Why did you come here so often?

801
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,253
Is baseball that fun?

802
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,507
That's not why.

803
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:34,802
All I need to focus on
is hitting the ball.

804
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,346
That's what I liked.

805
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:39,891
Does that

806
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,435
make you feel better?

807
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:48,650
Well… It was nice to focus on one thing
when things were complicated.

808
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,737
I just need to concentrate

809
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,406
on what's the most important.

810
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,075
And what is that

811
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,369
right now?

812
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,583
Saving you, of course.

813
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,838
That's all that matters.

814
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,425
I'll only focus on that.

815
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:36,114
Soo-cheol is staying
in Yongdu-ri for some time.

816
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:39,200
Hae-in decided to stay with Hyun-woo too.

817
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,370
Only the vice-chairman
and his wife are returning.

818
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:43,997
The vice-chairman?

819
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,207
I'm sorry.

820
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,210
But now that they have their shares,

821
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,380
wouldn't he want
to take back his position?

822
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,383
Says who?

823
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,429
They'll regret coming back here.

824
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,859
I was meaning to see you.

825
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,028
Can we talk?

826
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,489
I heard Hae-in
is getting surgery in Germany.

827
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,200
Don't be so alarmed.

828
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,660
I'm just happy for her.

829
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,913
Is that so?

830
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:26,831
Of course.

831
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:31,085
I have feelings for her,
so it's natural for me to be happy

832
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,086
that she can live.

833
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,965
I heard you're going with her.
Please take care of her.

834
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,760
Okay.

835
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,846
Can I leave now?

836
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,682
I found out

837
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,977
that the surgery has a side effect.

838
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:54,942
Does she know?

839
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,074
Of course not.

840
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,494
Given her personality, she'd refuse
to get the surgery if she knew.

841
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,914
So she probably doesn't know.

842
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,957
What are you getting at?

843
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,877
Make sure you keep that secret

844
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,673
so she gets the surgery.

845
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,258
I told you.

846
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,552
I want her to live.

847
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,439
Remove all of their belongings.

848
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,233
And give Mr. Baek back what's his.

849
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,177
You wanted to come here
as a customer instead of the CEO,

850
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,721
so I even took a leave.

851
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,305
Yes, I'm here as a customer.

852
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,808
-What'll you buy?
-I'm just looking.

853
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,644
Didn't you hate those
who didn't buy anything?

854
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,189
Is this a sauna?

855
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,568
Why are they chatting
and not spending any money here?

856
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,861
-Get rid of the chairs.
-Mom!

857
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,155
-Mom!
-Mom!

858
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,199
Why are they running around?

859
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,994
They should do that at an amusement park.

860
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,329
That's why
we got rid of all the rest zones.

861
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,247
Fine.

862
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,583
I'll spend some money then.

863
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,044
Do you want anything?

864
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,255
-What do you need?
-Lip balm.

865
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,591
My lips are dry.

866
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,600
Why am I so tired after shopping?

867
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,518
Are you tired?

868
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,145
That's not good.

869
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,813
Let's go rest somewhere.

870
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,939
No.

871
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,692
This is good.

872
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,737
The layout is incredible.
There's no time to rest.

873
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,822
We shopped for lip balm
and bought cream too.

874
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,074
We shopped for some knitwear
and bought a coat too.

875
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,828
We didn't even plan on buying a muffler
or gloves, but we got them too.

876
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,664
And now, the smell
of perfumes is alluring us.

877
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,374
That was your strategy.

878
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,002
You wanted to keep the customers busy.

879
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,463
That's why you set up
so many pop-up stores.

880
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,217
When I get reinstated,
I'm going to get rid of them.

881
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,426
-Why?
-It's tiring.

882
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,346
I feel stupid for spending money.

883
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,263
I feel duped.

884
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,015
Would you want to come back here?

885
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:35,353
I'll get rid of them
and set up chairs once again.

886
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,854
Expensive and comfortable ones.

887
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,317
I'll renovate the square
on the first floor and hold concerts.

888
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,195
There will be an area
where kids can run around.

889
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,112
What?

890
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,156
And a place for couples.

891
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,658
The parents can bring

892
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,536
their kids here
when it's cold or hot outside.

893
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,496
It'd be nice.

894
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,623
I will give them happiness.

895
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,041
Seriously?

896
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,876
Seriously.

897
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,878
You better not take that back
after the surgery.

898
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:01,796
Why would I?

899
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,422
I saw it in the movies.

900
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,384
Your personality can change
or you can lose your memory

901
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,802
after a brain surgery.

902
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:11,848
You're wrong. I just simply want
to become a slightly better person

903
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,432
to reciprocate

904
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,519
for being able to live longer.

905
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,816
Mother.

906
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:29,866
Isn't that your wife?

907
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:38,833
Hello, Mother.

908
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:42,503
Sweetie, what is that modest look
in your eyes?

909
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,880
You're making me anxious.

910
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:46,924
-Mother--
-I can't fix him.

911
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,467
You can't return him!

912
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,719
I'm sorry.

913
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,721
I tried to keep our promise,

914
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,973
but I'm afraid it's time.

915
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,103
Fine.

916
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,272
Let me hear your reason.

917
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,648
-Tell her.
-Me?

918
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,028
Right.

919
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:10,740
I lied to you about attending a funeral
and spent the night gaming with friends.

920
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,578
No? It's not that, Mom.

921
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,457
Right.

922
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,001
Did you find my game console?
It's secondhand. It's cheap.

923
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,628
You even bought a game console?

924
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:29,592
Can't you just tell me what it is?

925
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,888
Mother, Hyeon-tae spent
our savings on buying stocks.

926
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:37,850
He lost half of it.

927
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:39,435
Hey!

928
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,438
He even invested in cryptocurrency.

929
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,649
It's minus 90% now.

930
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,900
You lunatic.

931
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,320
I'm sorry.

932
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,074
Hyeon-suk.

933
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,700
I don't know what to say.

934
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,829
Return him to me, and I'll get rid of him.

935
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,289
You should go on your way

936
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,208
-while you still have time.
-Mom…

937
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,292
Still,

938
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,212
I'll text you when I make kimchi.

939
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,546
So make sure you come.

940
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,384
Even I think someone as wise
and pretty as you is out of his league.

941
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,011
I'm truly sorry, Hyeon-suk.

942
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,722
Mother…

943
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,146
You need to come to your senses!

944
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:31,946
Honey, I--

945
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,030
Let me go!

946
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:43,374
Honey, I think I'll be getting some money!

947
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:47,628
Hae-in had bought a building,
but didn't have time to look at it.

948
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:49,797
This must be it.

949
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,842
Yes. I cleaned and swept
the building twice a day,

950
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:55,469
waxed and washed all the signs,

951
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:57,138
and disinfected the septic tanks.

952
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,515
I'm also going to paint the building soon.

953
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,433
I see.

954
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:05,021
There's a good floating population
and visibility due to the two-lane road.

955
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,689
It'd be easy to get rents.

956
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:07,690
Yes, you're right.

957
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,150
It's not bad at all.

958
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:10,234
But why do you ask?

959
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,028
Do you plan on selling it?

960
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,489
I spoke with Hae-in.

961
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:19,493
We'd like to gift the building to you.

962
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,207
What did you say?

963
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,378
Our tax accountant
will contact you once we go to Seoul

964
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,672
and tell you what documents to prepare.

965
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,007
But still,

966
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,925
it's an entire building.

967
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,343
It's a thank-you gift.

968
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,724
Gosh, it's a huge gift.

969
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,852
My parents will become building owners!

970
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,520
Will you still return me?

971
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:51,275
Honey.

972
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,235
-You shouldn't be here.
-What?

973
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:57,490
Go to the building owners.

974
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,412
Hurry.

975
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,083
I'm thinking
about renovating the first floor

976
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,502
and setting up a fitness center.

977
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,213
Hey, just focus on your current gym.

978
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,675
Mom, I've been wanting
to relocate my hair salon.

979
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,385
The first floor would be perfect.

980
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:23,265
Don't butt in.
I was the one who cleaned and swept--

981
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,435
I removed all the stickers on the stairs.
And you have the third floor.

982
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,104
-Hyeon-tae.
-Yes, Mom?

983
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,064
Get rid of the gym as soon as you can.

984
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:33,025
Mom, that's a harsh joke.

985
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,861
It's not a joke.
You haven't been paying rent.

986
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,071
Come on, Mom.

987
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,864
-Dad.
-Son.

988
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,449
Yes?

989
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,582
This is when a contract becomes useful.

990
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,754
"If a tenant fails to pay rent
two times or more,

991
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,422
the contract can be terminated."

992
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,383
-Do you want to see?
-So what?

993
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,510
-Are you kicking me out?
-No.

994
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,221
I'm telling you to pay up.

995
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,140
Pay on the tenth of every month.

996
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,058
Dad.

997
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,351
What about me?

998
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,478
What about me?

999
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,274
The first floor costs a million.
Move in if you can manage it.

1000
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,985
That's more expensive
than my current rent.

1001
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,528
Our building has a better location.

1002
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:20,072
Anyway, we look forward

1003
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,116
to this new tension between us,

1004
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,160
thanks to this building.

1005
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,161
We're very excited.

1006
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,328
Come on, Dad.

1007
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,873
We don't need tension in this family.

1008
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,124
I do!

1009
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:33,919
There were times
when I felt like you were impudent.

1010
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,548
This building will prove

1011
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,758
your loyalty to us.

1012
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,387
-You're wrong.
-What?

1013
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,182
I just want to receive rent.

1014
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,683
Did you now?

1015
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,768
You should've told me so.

1016
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,562
Anyway…

1017
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:52,813
-Our Dubong Building--
-What?

1018
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,191
-What is that?
-Du-gwan and Bong-ae's building.

1019
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,152
-Oh, my God.
-How tacky.

1020
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:01,405
We expect you to pay rent religiously

1021
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:04,658
despite being our children.

1022
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:06,952
Keep that in mind.

1023
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,165
It's only October,
but they're preparing for Christmas.

1024
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,083
It was your order.

1025
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:15,586
Mine?

1026
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:18,380
Are you going to relax
because Chuseok is over?

1027
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,382
Christmas is upcoming. Winter is coming.

1028
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,676
We should liven up the mood

1029
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,637
so they'll want to buy winter jackets.

1030
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,931
We shouldn't wait
until the other stores begin.

1031
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:30,142
We need to prepare in advance
and start the Christmas sale

1032
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,686
right after Halloween.

1033
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,189
Right.

1034
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,484
-Are they testing the lights?
-Yes.

1035
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,487
The Installation and Marketing Teams
have been busy today.

1036
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,641
Am I hallucinating

1037
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,811
the snow?

1038
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,104
I see it too.

1039
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,483
But isn't this just a rehearsal?

1040
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:20,651
One minute.

1041
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,922
It's snowing in the fall.

1042
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,176
You wanted to see snow sooner.

1043
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,762
Your wish came true.

1044
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,472
You're right.

1045
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,933
Things are looking up.
All my wishes are coming true.

1046
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,396
I think my first love will come true too.

1047
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:42,900
Well…

1048
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,570
I don't think
that's what this snow is for.

1049
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:47,821
Why not?

1050
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,865
I bet it'll come true.

1051
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,576
Who the hell is he

1052
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,746
that you're so hell-bent on it?

1053
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:03,128
I wasn't ever going to tell you

1054
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,214
in case you'd become too arrogant.

1055
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:07,132
But here's my second secret.

1056
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,303
-What is it?
-Was it bus number 372?

1057
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,389
-What do you mean?
-The bus you took

1058
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:15,599
back home after work.

1059
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,728
Right. Yes.

1060
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:20,938
You're right.

1061
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:23,524
And you always sat
in the back next to the window.

1062
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:26,902
Yes, I did. How did you know that?

1063
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,237
How do you think I know?

1064
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,663
I followed your bus home

1065
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,416
and crossed the Han River numerous times

1066
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:44,461
despite all the traffic.
It took 1.5 hours.

1067
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:46,880
Why?

1068
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:00,519
That bus I told you about
was bus number 372.

1069
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,187
And the guy is you.

1070
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,314
Okay.

1071
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,402
How did you even get into SNU?

1072
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,117
What?

1073
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,034
So it's me?

1074
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,997
Me? I was the guy on the bus?

1075
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,123
Yes, it was you.

1076
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,625
How lovey-dovey.

1077
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:27,171
By the way, why did
the Installation Team sprinkle snow?

1078
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:28,964
It was Director Baek's request.

1079
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:32,551
Sir, please test the snowmaker
during the rehearsal.

1080
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,722
I don't think that's necessary.

1081
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:40,642
The Legal Team
needs to prepare themselves.

1082
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,978
You know it'd be an issue
if a customer slipped and fell.

1083
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:46,690
I need to determine
how slippery it'll get.

1084
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,151
Sure, if you must.

1085
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:51,987
I'd like big snowflakes if possible.

1086
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,031
All right then.

1087
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:55,616
-Thank you, sir.
-No problem.

1088
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:00,954
I sense love in the air.

1089
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:01,955
Right?

1090
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,208
Divorce then remarriage.

1091
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:06,835
It's possible?

1092
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,337
Was it really me?

1093
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,839
Was I your first love?

1094
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,428
They must've left already.

1095
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,222
I wonder when they'll arrive.

1096
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,812
It'll take some time.

1097
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,898
My morning prayers were answered.

1098
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:31,985
Hae-in will get better after the surgery

1099
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,655
and be happy with Hyun-woo.

1100
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,324
You see…

1101
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:40,869
There's a problem.

1102
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:43,580
What problem?

1103
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,582
After receiving surgery…

1104
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,043
Oh, dear.

1105
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:51,713
She might lose her memory.

1106
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:54,967
What do you mean?

1107
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,053
That could be a side effect.

1108
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,264
But what choice do we have?

1109
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:01,890
She needs to live.

1110
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,075
We had no choice.

1111
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,870
I asked Hyun-woo to keep it a secret.

1112
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,041
That was…

1113
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,461
wise of you.

1114
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:36,091
She has a terrible personality
since she takes after me.

1115
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,303
So she might've refused
to get the surgery.

1116
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:40,762
But…

1117
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:42,973
Still…

1118
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,727
What'll we do about our poor baby?

1119
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:02,993
Poor baby…

1120
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:21,845
Are you okay?

1121
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:25,432
Of course I am.

1122
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:27,434
Don't worry.

1123
01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:52,542
Are you going to Frankfurt?

1124
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,044
Yes.

1125
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:05,597
BODY FOUND NEAR SAMBANG RESERVOIR
IDENTIFIED AS LAND BROKER, MR. PYEON

1126
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,670
What's the third one?

1127
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,089
What do you mean?

1128
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,884
You had three secrets
to tell me before the surgery.

1129
01:18:43,635 --> 01:18:45,053
You only told me two so far.

1130
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,304
Oh, that?

1131
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,101
The third one is…

1132
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,272
-Yeong-suk.
-Yeong-suk?

1133
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,066
-The raccoon on the rooftop?
-Yes.

1134
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,113
I never got to see her.

1135
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:04,156
Seriously.

1136
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,699
Not even once.

1137
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,827
-What about her?
-I made it up.

1138
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:17,586
How could a raccoon live there?
Did you really believe that?

1139
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:22,966
Gosh.

1140
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:26,303
You duped me for four years.

1141
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,848
I called out her name
every time I was up there.

1142
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,433
You fool.

1143
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:58,418
Is this it?

1144
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,505
Hae-in.

1145
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:03,507
What is it?

1146
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:05,383
There's something

1147
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,136
I didn't tell you as well.

1148
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:09,638
What is it?

1149
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,520
Tell me.

1150
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:18,897
Is something wrong?

1151
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,443
Can they not operate

1152
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:25,237
on me?

1153
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:27,948
No, that's not it.

1154
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:32,953
It's…

1155
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,330
highly likely

1156
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:41,294
that you'll lose your memory
after the surgery.

1157
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:43,547
What do you mean?

1158
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:46,258
What memory?

1159
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:49,553
Probably…

1160
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:51,930
all of it.

1161
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,766
You'll forget

1162
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:58,812
everyone, the places you've been,

1163
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,315
and all the experiences you've had.

1164
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,827
Even still, this is

1165
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,371
your only chance

1166
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,039
to live.

1167
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:27,007
So…

1168
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:29,968
you're telling me

1169
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,597
to make a decision?

1170
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:39,352
I'll lose my memory if I get it
and die if I don't.

1171
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,355
Are you telling me
to pick the lesser evil?

1172
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:45,901
No.

1173
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,110
Then what?

1174
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:50,238
Forget it.

1175
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,993
I'll pretend like
this was all a good dream.

1176
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,303
Let me go. I said, let go.

1177
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:16,473
Don't make a choice.

1178
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,725
Don't think.

1179
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:21,269
Just listen to me.

1180
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,148
Just… live.

1181
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,069
Do that.

1182
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,197
Please…

1183
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:34,115
live.

1184
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:36,785
Okay?

1185
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,061
Hi, Hae-in.

1186
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:50,734
I'm Baek Hyun-woo.

1187
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,489
I'm your husband.

1188
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,201
You must be confused and scared.

1189
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,202
Me too.

1190
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,329
You don't remember anything

1191
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:05,498
and a stranger
is claiming to be your husband.

1192
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:06,916
You must be so confused.

1193
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:20,930
But…

1194
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:23,475
this is good news.

1195
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:25,268
You…

1196
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:27,145
You were very sick,

1197
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,688
but you're better now.

1198
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:36,988
You must be curious
about what kind of person you used to be.

1199
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,408
It must be upsetting

1200
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:42,744
that you can't remember.

1201
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,206
But don't worry.

1202
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,792
Because I…

1203
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,046
I remember everything.

1204
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:56,382
I'll tell you everything…

1205
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,303
that I know.

1206
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,726
I shouldn't cry.

1207
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,940
This will be the first time

1208
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,609
you see my face.

1209
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,033
And let me warn you.

1210
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:27,622
Even if I'm not your ideal type,

1211
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:31,000
I'm sorry, but I can't break up with you.

1212
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:32,919
Because we agreed

1213
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:36,923
not to part ways just because

1214
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:38,758
of a change of mind.

1215
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,511
Even if you don't like me…

1216
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:45,014
No matter what happens…

1217
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:47,600
Even if…

1218
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:54,315
you forget

1219
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,734
the promise we made,

1220
01:25:58,736 --> 01:25:59,571
I promised

1221
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:02,407
to be…

1222
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,119
by your side.

1223
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,750
Let's welcome the first snow,

1224
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,586
stick by each other,

1225
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,089
and spend our everyday lives together.

1226
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,342
Let's fill up

1227
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:24,637
that empty candy jar

1228
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:27,432
of yours.

1229
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,061
We can do it.

1230
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:35,565
Because it was fate
that brought us together.

1231
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,654
I love…

1232
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:47,368
I love you, Hae-in.

1233
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:51,873
I've always loved you…

1234
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:56,836
and will continue to do so.

1235
01:27:04,844 --> 01:27:07,680
QUEEN OF TEARS

1236
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:39,879
I still remember

1237
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:41,756
the smell,

1238
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:43,800
the moon, and the wind of that day.

1239
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:45,718
Don't pray

1240
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,095
about dying.

1241
01:27:47,178 --> 01:27:49,597
That so-called family of yours
will get hurt.

1242
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:51,599
Da-hye…

1243
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,184
I lived as myself,

1244
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:54,602
and I'll die as such

1245
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:56,229
I won't let that happen.

1246
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:59,274
That's how he found that hospital.

1247
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,358
I'll help you.

1248
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,193
Don't do this to me.

1249
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,821
Don't make me want to live.

1250
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:06,990
Hae-in!

1251
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:14,038
