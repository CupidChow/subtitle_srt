00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,319
EPISODE 10

3
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,083
Hey!

4
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,628
QUEEN'S BOXING GYM

5
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,301
You found the right place.

6
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,721
This building has the best wi-fi in town.

7
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,972
Come by whenever you want.

8
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,266
Thank you.

9
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,435
WINNER
BOYS YOUTH GROUP, BAEK HYUN-WOO

10
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,438
"Baek Hyun-woo"?

11
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,440
Did he use to box?

12
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,525
Yes.

13
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,276
And he was good at it.

14
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,240
He's so smart
that he uses his brain when boxing.

15
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,660
He predicts his opponent's movements.

16
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,710
Simply put, he's a living simulator.

17
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,967
He lures you in, then dodges your moves.

18
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:20,390
He waits until you're exhausted,
and then he lands his punches on you.

19
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,559
You become powerless.

20
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,394
He even knocked me out too.

21
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,318
I couldn't locate you,
so I couldn't send you the papers.

22
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,072
Here you go.

23
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,408
Make sure you hire an attorney.

24
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,243
What?

25
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,121
I called them
before hopping out of my car.

26
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,711
You've been caught in the act,
so you'll be taken to the station.

27
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,464
POLICE FOR THE PEOPLE

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
MR. YOON EUN-SUNG

29
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,974
MR. PYEON

30
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,604
Hyun-woo?

31
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,007
Have you been lying low
at your ex-husband's of all places?

32
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,091
I'm disappointed.

33
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,468
Disappointed?

34
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,261
That's rich coming from you.

35
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,348
How did you find me?

36
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,976
You should know by now
that I do anything I set my mind to.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,561
It was easy to find you.

38
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,271
So, Hae-in.

39
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,814
Don't turn me any more evil.

40
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,070
Are you threatening me?

41
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,530
Yes, I am.

42
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,825
But here comes
the real threat, so listen up.

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,078
I saw your doctor's diagnosis.

44
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,040
But your doctor refuses to elaborate

45
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,458
since I'm not your guardian.

46
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,460
So…

47
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm going to be just that.

48
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,672
Are you crazy?

49
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,674
Yes, I think I am a little.

50
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,264
I know you don't have much time.

51
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,517
So I don't either,
and that drives me nuts.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,060
I have nothing to fear.

53
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,397
Fine, do as you please.

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,023
I have nothing to fear either.

55
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,652
Your parents don't know that you're ill.

56
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,239
Why haven't you told them?

57
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,490
Because you're scared.

58
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,077
I understand.
They already lost a son once.

59
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,499
Hey, Eun-sung.

60
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,042
Keep acting this way

61
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,462
if you want me to make those
you love miserable.

62
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,339
If you don't,

63
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,134
come back soon.

64
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,053
Your position is still available.

65
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,513
You have two days.

66
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,433
I'll hold a press conference then.

67
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,434
See you there.

68
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,355
Leave it all up to me.

69
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,318
The one who'll save you…

70
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,571
is me, not Hyun-woo.

71
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,534
You bastard!

72
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,454
How could you do this to us?

73
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,289
How could you do this to me?

74
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,583
I'm going to kill you!

75
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,296
Gosh, Soo-cheol.

76
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,801
Hey, are you okay?

77
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,388
Our family is ruined

78
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,973
because I was fooled by you.

79
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:49,891
I'm to blame.

80
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:53,895
You idiot.

81
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,355
It's not your fault.

82
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,691
Anyone would've been deceived.

83
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,360
It's not your fault, so stop crying.

84
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,406
Where's Da-hye?

85
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,908
Where is she?

86
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,452
Just tell me

87
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,829
if she's doing fine.

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,249
Please.

89
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,188
You just tripped on a stone and fell

90
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,773
while running in the dark.

91
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,690
Why would I?

92
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,359
Because you were drunk.

93
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,693
I didn't drink.

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,448
I'm saying the others shouldn't know
that Eun-sung was here.

95
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,283
Why was he here?

96
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,124
I should know why that bastard came here.

97
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,167
There's something

98
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,755
I need to do,
so don't tell our parents just yet.

99
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,676
Answer me.

100
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,178
Fine.

101
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,724
I have night blindness,
so I couldn't see anything.

102
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,106
You know I can catch
mosquitoes in the dark.

103
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,525
Yes, seeing in the dark
is your sole talent.

104
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,820
Exactly, and it was this guy.

105
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,698
The new chairman of Queens.

106
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,907
-Really?
-Yeah.

107
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,576
That means he's their sworn enemy.

108
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,910
Exactly.

109
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,247
What? Do you know him?

110
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,331
He's my type.

111
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,308
YOON EUN-SUNG

112
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,018
Damn it.

113
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,020
Took you long enough.

114
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,106
Did you delete your Korean number,
email, and social media?

115
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,024
Of course.

116
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,942
I'm moving in under a fake name too.

117
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,027
Good.

118
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,487
Let's not call each other.

119
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,447
-Only call if it's urgent for now.
-Okay.

120
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,949
By the way,

121
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,202
did you see Soo-cheol?

122
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,205
Why?

123
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,207
No reason.

124
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,875
He's very weak-minded.

125
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,126
I'm sure he's shocked.

126
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,961
So? Are you worried?

127
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,631
Why would I be?

128
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,299
I'm just curious. That's all.

129
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,134
Soo-cheol…

130
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,179
is furious at you.

131
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,682
Is that so?

132
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,435
He's going to make you pay
if he finds you,

133
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,270
so lie low.

134
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,813
Okay. Bye.

135
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,819
Of course, he's mad.

136
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,615
I would be too.

137
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,827
He's finally matured up.

138
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,871
He wasn't a complete fool after all.

139
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,873
Da-hye…

140
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,214
Da-hye…

141
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,092
Da-hye…

142
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,686
BAEK HYUN-WOO

143
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,105
The person you dialed is unavailable.

144
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,191
Please leave a message after the beep.
You may need to pay…

145
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,928
What happened?

146
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,972
You got off work hours ago,
so why are you late?

147
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,057
And what happened to your face?

148
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,392
I just…

149
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,019
Well…

150
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,107
-Did you get hit?
-No, I didn't.

151
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,319
How badly hurt are you?

152
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,195
Hae-in, let me explain.

153
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,822
Hae-in. Please?

154
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,619
Let me talk. Hold on. Let me--

155
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,080
Stay still.

156
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,752
Stop it.

157
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,462
Come here. Let me check.

158
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,884
Why is this red?
Did you get clubbed or something?

159
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,303
Let me…

160
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,972
explain.

161
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,724
I wasn't beaten up.

162
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,184
Open your mouth.

163
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,731
Did you bite your tongue?

164
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,066
No.

165
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,569
I didn't bite my tongue or get beaten up.

166
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,197
Look. I'm perfectly fine.

167
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,785
I just got some scratches and a split lip.

168
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,578
And why exactly?

169
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,346
Stay still.

170
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,105
I'm not trying to brag,

171
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,689
but I was up against three men.

172
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,652
It wasn't an easy fight.

173
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,612
And they

174
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,030
even carried

175
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,867
batons and other weapons
when they came for me.

176
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,285
And you weren't armed?

177
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,745
Well…

178
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,250
You probably didn't know,
but I used to box when I was little.

179
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,419
I can take blows well,

180
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,421
so it didn't hurt one bit.

181
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,463
Hold on.

182
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,093
It just stung.

183
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,972
Who was it? Which lunatic did this to you?

184
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,015
Remember that land broker

185
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,017
who's on the No Fly List?

186
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:07,935
So…

187
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,272
you were mobbed
while tracking the scammer down?

188
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,399
But I won.

189
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,568
I'm not impressed.

190
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,864
You should've run away
if you were outnumbered.

191
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,449
He was arrested though.

192
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,910
We can turn the tables
if he's proven guilty--

193
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,828
Shut up.

194
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,712
If this ever happens again,

195
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,464
just run away.

196
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,007
Promise me.

197
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,971
Answer me.

198
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,973
You said to shut up.

199
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,226
But promise me.

200
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,981
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,484
I can't do that.

202
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,571
I've made a promise already.

203
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,948
What promise?

204
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,118
It's about you.

205
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,205
Anyway…

206
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,373
It's a promise to myself.

207
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,046
Don't make promises

208
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,298
about me.

209
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,347
Only married couples do that. And…

210
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,518
We're divorced, so we don't have to.

211
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,161
Come back beaten up like this again,

212
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,665
and I'll kill you myself.

213
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,875
Got that?

214
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,461
I wasn't beaten--

215
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,173
Okay.

216
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,107
Let's eat.

217
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,241
What happened to your face?

218
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,789
I fell last night.

219
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,999
What happened?

220
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,922
Gosh, what happened to you?

221
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,052
I tripped and fell.

222
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,138
So you both fell?

223
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,182
-Did you guys fight?
-I wouldn't dare.

224
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,392
I heard

225
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,477
that he used to box.

226
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,563
About that…

227
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,148
So you heard.

228
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,858
He visited my gym yesterday.

229
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,818
He was shocked at your trophies.

230
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,528
-I see.
-Did you play sports?

231
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,447
-Yes.
-Gosh.

232
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,367
I can finally say this now,
but it wasn't easy raising him.

233
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,953
He won every contest

234
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,456
and was always
in the top ten in the country

235
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,250
after every exam.

236
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,712
We didn't know which path
to encourage him to take.

237
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,172
You're just perfect.

238
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,092
-No.
-It sounds like I'm bragging about my son.

239
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,595
But it's the truth.

240
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,265
He definitely took after me.

241
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,644
No, Hyeon-tae is the one
who took after you.

242
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,730
Everyone said Hyun-woo
was the odd member of our family.

243
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,483
I take after my mom, so I can't lie.

244
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,822
What about you?

245
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,783
He doesn't take after me.

246
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,203
Why not? Of course, I do.

247
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,169
As for Hae-in,

248
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,089
she's beautiful

249
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,049
just like her mother.

250
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,900
Hyun-woo.

251
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,319
What is it?

252
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,737
Actually…

253
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,700
Hae-in told me not to tell you but--

254
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,867
About what?

255
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,625
-What?
-What?

256
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,460
You had something to say.

257
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,837
-Did I?
-No?

258
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,548
I thought you did.

259
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,550
Go on, then.

260
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,390
What's with him?

261
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,434
Ignore him.

262
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,104
Have you applied ointment this morning?

263
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,941
No, I was in a rush.

264
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,776
Let me see your face.

265
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,627
-You need to apply this often.
-But I'm okay now.

266
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,921
No, you're not.

267
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,090
Apply ointment

268
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,387
and replace the bandage often,
so it won't scar.

269
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:49,902
There.

270
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,695
Go.

271
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,613
Okay.

272
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,116
All right, then.

273
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,286
I'll be leaving now.

274
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,497
Okay.

275
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,666
Drive safely.

276
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:37,991
What is it?

277
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,372
It's rush hour right now,

278
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,959
so I think I should wait

279
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,585
five minutes.

280
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,215
Well…

281
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,801
It's always best to avoid traffic.

282
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,555
Yes, exactly.

283
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,558
Right.

284
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,070
YONGDU-RI SUPERMARKET

285
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,802
What if we had done just that?

286
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,597
What do you mean?

287
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,099
If we had applied ointment on time,

288
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,517
disinfected our wounds,

289
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,603
and replaced our bandages every time,

290
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,105
would things have been different?

291
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,775
No, before that.

292
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,986
What if we had broken up

293
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,405
around the time when we had ice cream

294
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,406
right here?

295
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,744
If we hadn't gotten married,
we would've cherished

296
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,247
the memories even to this day.

297
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,958
There would've been no need

298
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,752
for wounds

299
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,087
to fester

300
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,423
or scars to form.

301
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,175
You'd have met someone

302
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,512
who was kinder, warmer,

303
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,599
and better than me.

304
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,644
You'd be happily living together.

305
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,896
Probably not.

306
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,400
If we had broken up,

307
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,318
you probably

308
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,779
wouldn't have known how I was doing.

309
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,116
But I would've known what you were up to.

310
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,034
And I probably

311
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,787
would've been regretful.

312
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,832
But if you knew how things would end up--

313
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,000
Even still,

314
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,004
I would've made the same choice.

315
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,680
But had I known then what I know now,

316
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,890
I would've asked you more often.

317
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,808
Ask what?

318
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,768
How your day went.

319
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,400
"Is there anything

320
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,318
that's troubling you?"

321
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,196
I regret

322
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,865
not asking you such questions.

323
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,171
What time did you come home last night?

324
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,841
Is the chairman okay?

325
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,390
I understand

326
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,100
what you mean.

327
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,227
But first,

328
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,896
bring the chairman back.

329
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,981
Then we can discuss.

330
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,149
We don't need to.

331
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,111
I'm going to marry Hae-in
as soon as I can.

332
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,321
What? Marry her?

333
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,366
Did she agree to it?

334
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,243
Do you still not know me?

335
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,830
I'll make it happen.

336
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,679
INTRANET

337
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,767
NEW PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT

338
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,896
BAEK HYUN-WOO
REMOVAL FROM POSITION DUE TO MALPRACTICE

339
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,233
Did you read it?

340
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,278
What's going on?

341
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,988
Is something up?

342
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,392
It's smaller than I thought.

343
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,647
It's just right for one person.

344
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,859
You must be shocked
by the sudden announcement.

345
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,903
I did somewhat see it coming.

346
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,613
But…

347
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,240
"malpractice"?

348
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,700
Do you have proof?

349
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,411
Of course. A personnel committee
will be scheduled soon.

350
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,579
Find out for yourself then.

351
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,124
I was surprised.

352
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,834
Yongdu-ri, was it?

353
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,502
The air was fresh.

354
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,506
Even still, how could you take her there?

355
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,221
I guess you didn't hear.

356
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,768
I saw her yesterday.

357
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,479
Did she not tell you?

358
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,857
We had no time.

359
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,276
I was quite busy.

360
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,028
Mr. Pyeon was arrested yesterday.

361
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,615
I see.

362
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,617
I guess you didn't hear.

363
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,494
I don't understand.

364
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,664
From what I heard,

365
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,416
he's also feigning ignorance right now.

366
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,668
But don't worry. I have a knack

367
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,630
for revealing truths.

368
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,969
Is that so?

369
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,471
Good.

370
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,973
Let's do what we do best then.

371
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,518
Bye.

372
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,543
Shouldn't we say hi?

373
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,964
Let's not. He's like Crown Prince Sado
in that rice chest.

374
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,966
-What do you mean?
-Didn't you watch the movie?

375
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,259
Instead of firing him,

376
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,470
they placed him
in front of everyone to see.

377
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,014
They want to see who's on his side.

378
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,392
Jeez, is that why they put him
next to the smoking room?

379
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,894
They want to see who he's close with.

380
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,562
Let's go.

381
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,325
I didn't think you'd pick up my call.

382
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,578
Right.

383
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,833
I don't delete numbers
that haven't been settled yet.

384
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,378
There are always those
who refuse to pay the matchmaking fee.

385
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:32,549
I chase them to the ends of the earth
and make sure they suffer.

386
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,593
That's my way of settling things.

387
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,725
Yes, I know.

388
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,269
But I'm pretty precise
about my settlements.

389
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,270
What?

390
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:49,274
Maybe you didn't get what you wanted
because you didn't earn it.

391
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,985
Are you saying I didn't do my job?

392
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,197
Did you dedicate decades of your life
and slave away under this roof?

393
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,826
Or did you live abroad alone
for many years like Eun-sung?

394
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,537
It's not like you worked for free either.

395
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,872
So I'm a bit dumbfounded

396
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,458
that you demanded to be the CEO
after doing a few chores.

397
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,128
Even still, you're telling me to go abroad

398
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,046
with little money.

399
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:12,797
Isn't that too harsh?

400
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,799
I'll let you be the CEO then.

401
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,635
But do your money's worth.

402
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,430
How?

403
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,684
Find Hong Man-dae.

404
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,602
What?

405
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,270
What do you…

406
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,745
There aren't many hospitals
that are fully staffed around the clock

407
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,955
and have a VVIP room

408
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,541
that covers an entire floor.

409
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,086
All right. Let's begin.

410
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,295
Okay.

411
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,464
Hello.

412
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,800
Is this the VIP room administration
at Hanju Hospital?

413
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,345
Our CEO wants
to receive stem cell therapy.

414
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,390
Is your VIP room
on the 23rd floor available?

415
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,058
What? He did what to my father?

416
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,312
Where did he take him?

417
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,647
I'm still looking into it.

418
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,233
According to the nurse,
Seul-hee wasn't involved.

419
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,318
Eun-sung did it single-handedly.

420
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,528
Damn it.

421
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,696
I'm going to make them pay.

422
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,615
You wait. I called a taxi.

423
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,325
I'll be in Seoul soon.

424
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,578
I'm hanging up.

425
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,623
Hey, you're my mom's daughter.

426
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,668
She tricked me that day.

427
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,294
I was meaning to return this.

428
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,338
Here.

429
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,092
Your mother lent it to me that day.

430
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,009
But…

431
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,053
why did she?

432
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,096
So that…

433
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,725
I could wipe off what I had spilled.

434
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,059
What did you spill?

435
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,485
Why are you crying?

436
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,737
Well…

437
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,159
Gosh, I almost told you.

438
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,660
What's it to you?

439
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,537
Anyway, give that back to her.

440
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,875
Only the biggest fools cry
when times are tough.

441
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,252
What did you say?

442
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,045
I didn't cry.

443
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,922
And only the average fools endure it.

444
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,885
Then what do the wisest do?

445
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,222
They eat meat when times are tough.

446
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:35,106
Next time, have meat
instead of crying like a fool.

447
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,451
What is he saying?

448
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,995
Meat, my foot.

449
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,626
Jeez, this town is so weird.

450
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,463
VILLAGE HEAD

451
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,771
Looking good, Du-gwan.

452
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,440
Why are you guys here?

453
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,776
We're seeing you off for the last time.

454
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,694
Hey.

455
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,279
Am I dying or something?

456
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,455
I'm Park Seok-hun, the new village head.

457
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,791
INAUGURATION OF PARK SEOK-HUN,
THE NEW VILLAGE HEAD

458
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,544
It's a great day today. Enjoy yourselves.

459
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,295
The inauguration party will take place

460
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,422
at my pork and rice soup restaurant.

461
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,342
Please come by and have some.
I promise to do well!

462
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,010
Please watch me!

463
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,848
-Park Seok-hun!
-Park Seok-hun!

464
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,685
-Park Seok-hun!
-Park Seok-hun!

465
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,978
Let's go eat.

466
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,107
By the way,

467
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,317
where's Chun-sik?

468
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,696
She's his daughter.

469
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,408
We know everyone in this town.
Should we have hired foreigners?

470
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,826
And last time…

471
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,746
Tell me in detail.

472
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,915
What did Seok-hun's men say to you?

473
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,877
Remember we went drinking
during the farm succession gathering?

474
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,129
And the receipt went missing.

475
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,590
-That's why?
-That's not all.

476
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,508
They also brought
all the part-time resumes

477
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,678
from the urban-rural bazaar two years ago

478
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,514
and claimed the part-timers
were chosen out of favor.

479
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,558
I can't believe them.

480
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,727
Calm down.

481
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,856
There are two things
that don't exist in this world.

482
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,774
One, freebies.

483
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,651
Two,

484
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,111
a peaceful transfer of power.

485
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:48,072
That's true, Du-gwan.

486
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,408
Those are worldwide facts.

487
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,453
They're doing what they all do.

488
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,121
When a new power takes over,

489
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,291
they torment those closest
to the previous one.

490
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,337
Goodness.

491
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,088
That's not all.

492
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,634
They'll be erasing all traces
of the previous regime soon.

493
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,136
Erasing traces?

494
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,684
Paint more. I can still see it.
Here, use this.

495
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,852
-Okay.
-Okay.

496
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,853
-Thank you.
-Sure.

497
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,858
VILLAGE HEAD

498
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,943
Seok-hun.

499
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,736
The pears are innocent.

500
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,654
What?

501
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,114
What you want to erase aren't those pears.

502
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,117
It's my presence in this village.

503
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,454
You want to erase my reputation
as the wisest village head.

504
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,747
That's not true.

505
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,124
Yongdu-ri's new catchphrase will be

506
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,669
"The Pretty Apple Village."

507
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,295
So we need to draw them.

508
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,215
There are tons of walls around here.

509
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,134
Did you have to use this one?

510
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,137
We're not asking you
to treat us as if we're still in power.

511
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,556
Just treat us with some respect.

512
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,560
Are you going to keep watching?

513
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,230
It's uncomfortable.

514
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,618

516
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,319
Where are you?

517
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,405
-I'm behind the tree.
-I see.

518
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,410
Thanks, honey. You saved me.

519
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,494
Stay focused.

520
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,372
-Use your poisoned darts.
-I have none. I only have a hatchet.

521
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,876
I told you to upgrade
your weapons when you get money.

522
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,377
Who uses a hatchet nowadays?

523
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,004
Even a Vulcan isn't enough.

524
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,088
I don't have any money.

525
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,759
I need to hunt to get some,
but I've been too busy to go hunting.

526
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,930
Look behind you.

527
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,600
You keep getting hit
because you only look ahead.

528
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,519
You see, they come from the front
when I look back.

529
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,771
Look behind you!

530
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,235
Are you mad that I'm bad at this?

531
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,281
We live in a dog-eat-dog world,

532
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,575
so you have to be more cautious.

533
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,217
FRIEND LIST
GEONUMAMA

534
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,928

OFFLINE
2 HOURS, 3 MINUTES, 4 SECONDS

536
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,602
Da-hye…

537
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,940
was online two hours ago.

538
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,485
Thank you so much.

539
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,986
Seriously. Thank you.

540
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,781
Thank you so much.

541
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,199
Go home safely, ma'am.

542
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,575
Bye.

543
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,541
Hello, ma'am.

544
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,002
I just met with the Sama Medical Center
director's wife.

545
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:36,092
Chairman Ryu Seong-gwang's mistress
is at their VIP room.

546
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,719
She's resting
after getting her breasts done--

547
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,475
Yes.

548
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,770
Okay. I'll call you back later.

549
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,900
What brings you here?

550
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,120
I remember you telling me
that you knew little

551
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,872
about legal matters

552
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,584
since you've been in the beauty industry
and matchmaking wealthy families

553
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,627
all your life.

554
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,048
-So?
-So I'm here to tell you something.

555
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,466
You're managing

556
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,179
thirteen unregistered branches
of your spa.

557
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,471
You shouldn't do that.

558
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,016
Look.

559
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,311
You're nitpicking over the fact
that I worked harder than others.

560
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,854
That hurts my feelings.

561
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:33,399
Not only did you work hard,
but you also dodged a hefty sum of taxes.

562
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,985
Gosh, how much tax is all this?

563
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,320
How much--

564
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,739
By the way, who are you?

565
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,823
Right.

566
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,745
This is me.

567
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:47,997
ATTORNEY
KIM YANG-GI

568
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,415
Ms. Ko.

569
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:53,794
You're like a celebrity in our field,
so I'm a bit starstruck right now.

570
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,255
Why am I famous?

571
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,592
Because you're an excellent matchmaker
and homewrecker.

572
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,261
You'd do everything
in your power to split couples up

573
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,013
if they didn't pay you well.

574
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,183
You'd make false reports anonymously
and hire people to seduce them.

575
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,728
Thanks to you, I got some work.

576
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,396
These are all the clients

577
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,649
at our firm.

578
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,402
This has nothing to do with you,
so why do you care?

579
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,154
These divorced couples

580
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,075
won't sit still
if they find out the truth.

581
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,286
They're all hot-tempered

582
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,372
and from influential backgrounds.

583
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,874
The National Assembly,
Prosecutors' Office, the court…

584
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,626
Goodness.

585
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,420
This chairman

586
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,256
was a former gangster.

587
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,676
I get it, so be quiet.

588
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,303
Why are you doing this?

589
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,306
I was on your side deep down.

590
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,892
Then you should prove it.

591
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,066
But you see…

592
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,318
Sentiments don't move me.

593
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,405
Only cash does.

594
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,572
I'll be honest.

595
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,827
They offered me a wonderful deal,
so I'm hesitant to refuse it.

596
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,832
So first, let me see what you can offer--

597
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,874
Damn it!

598
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,377
You have no right to bargain.

599
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,045
Are you a calculator?

600
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,547
You're very quick-thinking.

601
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,882
How could you think of striking a deal?

602
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,842
Jeez.

603
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,218
That's so harsh.

604
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,888
Don't compare me to an object.

605
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:37,106
You know me, right?
I never hesitate to get my hands dirty.

606
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,235
Quit calculating
unless you want to go to prison.

607
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,820
Speaking from experience,

608
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,448
you're the type those ladies

609
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,949
hate the most.

610
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,673
Yoon Eun-sung is very thorough.

611
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,384
There was nothing on the dashcam.

612
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,679
I came up with a list
of high-level general hospitals

613
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,850
that allow security guards
and have VIP rooms with private elevators

614
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,852
where you can rent out an entire floor.

615
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,646
-I've been looking into them.
-So? Did you find him?

616
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,608
It'll take a few days.

617
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,529
I think we should search
within an hour driving radius from Seoul.

618
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,864
Why?

619
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,407
Chairman Hong is critically ill.

620
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,493
Most ambulances don't have oxygen tanks,

621
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,496
which means the medical team
must've had to manually give him oxygen.

622
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,915
They could've only done that for an hour.

623
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,333
Yes, that's plausible.

624
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,711
Then that rules out five of these.

625
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,839
I'll ask around and check the rest.

626
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,009
Let's share the list and look into it too.

627
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,761
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,347
You're like a family.

629
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,182
I'm loving this vibe.

630
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,810
The other side wasn't friendly at all.

631
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,776
Do you think I was happy to kick you out?

632
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,070
How have you all been?

633
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,407
How is Ms. Kim doing?

634
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,741
Wait.

635
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,578
I'm sorry, Mi-seon. I should just leave.

636
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,914
Goodness, we're already here though.

637
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,458
They're all in there
and waiting to apologize.

638
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,669
I already know what they're going to say.

639
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,921
"We didn't know you were present."

640
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,258
"We weren't trying to hurt you.
We're sorry."

641
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,301
We didn't know you were here.

642
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,929
We weren't trying to offend you.

643
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,098
Anyway, we're really sorry.

644
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,437
Right? You're sorry.

645
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,897
They just don't know the full story.

646
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,318
Exactly. We only read
about how you were ruined.

647
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,823
-Right?
-But still, we didn't believe the media.

648
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,783
"No way. They'll probably still prosper

649
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,577
-for another three years."
-That's right.

650
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,829
-Yes.
-We wanted to check the facts.

651
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,248
And share the truth.

652
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,750
I understand.

653
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,252
I'm at fault too.

654
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,837
I should've told you I was here.

655
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,505
-I was only listening in.
-I'm relieved.

656
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:11,010
We'll be seeing each other often,
so I'm glad we reconciled.

657
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,636
That's right.

658
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,555
It won't be for that long.

659
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,474
We're just taking a break.

660
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,559
We're only here to rest.

661
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:23,772
We've been to places like Bali,
Hawaii, and Cancún way too often.

662
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:28,611
So we thought we'd visit
an unusual place this time.

663
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:31,947
"Unusual"?

664
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,326
Compared to Cancún? Definitely.

665
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,536
Yongdu-ri is unique,
and there's no ocean either.

666
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:42,416
It's a bit uncomfortable,
but I think this is a good experience.

667
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,628
When will I get
to stay at a place like this ever again?

668
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,380
No amount of money
can buy this experience.

669
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,591
Right, and you're broke too.

670
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,969
-Sorry?
-It's true that you're poor for now.

671
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,013
Their assets are frozen, right?

672
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,766
Yes, but they'll get them later.

673
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,143
Right, but they don't know

674
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,146
if they'll still be alive by then.

675
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,191
Our family owns 50,000 pyeongs' worth
of land that's been a green belt

676
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,400
for 50 years.

677
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,318
Exactly.

678
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,530
All right, then.

679
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,951
How about you guys all leave
now that you've reconciled?

680
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,579
I've never seen anyone leave our town

681
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,666
after saying that they would.

682
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,627
Excuse me, but what are you getting at?

683
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,546
I just have a hunch

684
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,924
that we'll be seeing each other often
for a very long time.

685
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,175
And I'm happy about that.

686
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,345
Let's go then.

687
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,846
-Go?
-Yes, go.

688
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,682
-Right now?
-Yes, right now.

689
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,600
-Bye.
-We're going now.

690
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,435
What…

691
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,854
Goodness.

692
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,606
I'm so stressed.

693
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,149
Caffeine.

694
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,818
Caffeine!

695
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:58,117
JUNE'S GARDEN

696
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,785
PLEASE PAY IN ADVANCE

697
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,514
I'd like to order.

698
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:22,766
Please take my order.

699
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,102
We take orders up here.

700
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,612
Two shots of espresso.

701
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,489
That'll be 3,200 won.

702
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,533
-Do you have an affiliated card?
-It's okay.

703
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,451
Here.

704
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,832
It doesn't work.

705
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,465
How will you pay, ma'am?

706
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:00,054
Look. I'm in dire need of some coffee.

707
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,515
Can I drink some first,
then pay you later?

708
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,976
Drink first, pay later.

709
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,479
May I do that?

710
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,774
I'm sorry, but there's a line.

711
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,067
Could you step aside?

712
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,156
Hello.

713
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,699
Ten iced Americanos,

714
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,036
ten iced lattes, a container of syrup,

715
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,704
and another one full of ice cubes.

716
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,414
-Okay?
-Sure. I know.

717
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,834
Also, I'd like to pay for hers too.

718
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:31,794
Okay.

719
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,423
Why are you having coffee
when you can't sleep well?

720
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,678
Anyway, thanks for the coffee.

721
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:43,847
No need to thank me.

722
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,767
It's not free.

723
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,492
All right, let's begin.

724
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,244
-Okay.
-Natasha.

725
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,161
Yes?

726
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,414
Be her mentor for the day.

727
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,665
Okay.

728
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:14,795
Nepotism?

729
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,299
Are you talking to me, young lady?

730
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,927
Yes, I'm talking to you.

731
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,555
Why are you speaking casually?
I'm older than you.

732
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,598
I'm not a young lady. I'm your senior.

733
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,933
Do you know what that means?

734
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,436
Yes, times have changed.

735
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,814
I didn't even dare to step
on my seniors' shadows back in the day.

736
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,649
What? What shadow?

737
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,109
Is she a boomer or what?

738
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,069
Do you not want to learn? Forget it.

739
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,488
Fine. What am I supposed to do?

740
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,823
Follow me.

741
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,283
Hurry up.

742
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,701
Come on.

743
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,411
I'll only demonstrate once.

744
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,913
Do this. Then this.

745
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,291
Then like this.

746
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,585
Your turn.

747
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,800
Like this?

748
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,969
Hold this part.

749
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:07,014
No, not like that.

750
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,557
You told me to hold it!

751
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,560
Is Korean that hard?
Do you not understand?

752
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,146
Hold it like this.

753
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,985
Ms. Jeon!

754
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,613
You should fire her. She's a lost cause.

755
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,075
-Jeez.
-What? You are.

756
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,744
There sure was nepotism involved.

757
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,953
Gosh!

758
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,122
Look at you.

759
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,850
You didn't get lost.

760
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,228
So? Do you want a hug?

761
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,938
No, thanks. Did you bring it?

762
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,733
You know this is a violation
of the labor law, right?

763
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,158
I should be at a farm right now,

764
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,827
baking pizza with organic cheese.

765
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,167
Do you want a hug?

766
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,044
No, thanks.

767
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,256
I just don't get it.

768
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,967
Why did you choose to stay
at your former in-laws'?

769
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,638
We were in a rush
and just happened to stay here for a bit.

770
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,390
Still, I wouldn't have come here.

771
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,850
Let's say I had to choose
between prison and my in-laws.

772
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,978
-I'd choose the former.
-No way.

773
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,439
At least I wouldn't have
to cook in prison.

774
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,944
My mother-in-law cooks everything.
We had japchae and ribs for breakfast.

775
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,446
Gosh, you said "mother-in-law."

776
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,657
Be honest. Is the divorce fake?

777
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,743
-What are you saying?
-If not, how could you be so affectionate?

778
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,121
I'm not affectionate. You're mistaken.

779
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:59,293
Why do you think Mr. Baek is still at work
even after the humiliation he received?

780
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,169
What humiliation did he get?

781
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,714
I guess you didn't hear.

782
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,465
I heard on my way here.

783
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,634
He's waiting to be reassigned.

784
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,803
Waiting to be reassigned? What for?

785
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,889
Some malpractice or something.

786
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,100
They'll hold a personnel committee soon.

787
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,145
Malpractice?

788
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,813
What kind?

789
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,899
The Audit Team
couldn't find anything on him.

790
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,360
He received bribes from a law firm.

791
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,528
What?

792
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,779
Hold on.

793
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,615
Did he embezzle money from labor costs?

794
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,367
He gave a rival company
a list of our VIP customers.

795
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,286
There are many more
that I can come up with.

796
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,955
So you're going to make false accusations?

797
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:38,665
Is that it?

798
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,127
I'm debating which one to use.

799
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,339
But whatever it is,
he'll become an ex-convict.

800
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,474
Hey, you're coming home together.

801
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,683
Right.

802
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,812
I had an appointment in Seoul.

803
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,108
Hey.

804
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,195
I thought long and hard.

805
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,821
-"Should I tell him this?"
-Then don't.

806
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,199
Do you know who came by last night?

807
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,116
I do.

808
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,995
You do? So you know
Yoon Eun-sung visited Hae-in.

809
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:17,996
I do.

810
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,000
But why did he secretly visit her
in the middle of the night?

811
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,919
Is something going on between them?

812
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,088
Don't be ridiculous.

813
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,881
Don't snap at me.

814
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,635
I didn't snap at you,
and there's nothing going on.

815
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,637
There's absolutely nothing going on.

816
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,930
You don't know anything.

817
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,267
What's his problem?

818
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,687
No way.

819
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,939
Is he jealous?

820
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,775
Hae-in didn't even budge
after hearing about So-yeong.

821
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,360
But Hyun-woo…

822
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,736
Gosh.

823
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,862
What an idiot.

824
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,322
Jeez.

825
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,118
Great job today!

826
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,119
Thank you!

827
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,539
-Let's start with Natasha.
-Okay.

828
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,750
You picked 4,000
which makes the total 280,000 won.

829
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,752
But I'll give you 300,000 won.

830
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,424
As for you, you picked 70 which makes

831
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,008
the total 4,900 won.

832
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,761
You owe me coffee,
so you'll get 1,700 in total.

833
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,013
-Ms. Lee Su-gyeong?
-Here.

834
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,807
-Good work.
-Thank you!

835
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,100
-Ms. Park Seon-nyeo?
-Here.

836
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,059
-Great job.
-Goodness.

837
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,293
Honey, here are your sleeping pills.

838
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,476
Goodness, honey.

839
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,937
You haven't slept so well
without any medication in a long time.

840
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,098
Why are you drinking alone at this hour?

841
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,016
Well…

842
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,977
I feel gloomy now that
I've stepped down from my position.

843
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,189
I was only the village head
of this tiny neighborhood.

844
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,907
I can understand.

845
00:51:58,990 --> 00:51:59,825
Gosh.

846
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,952
-Really?
-Take a look.

847
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,872
My battery is still half full at this hour

848
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,040
since no one has called me.

849
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,459
I see.

850
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,919
No one's picking up either.

851
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:15,048
When I used to be the vice-chairman,
I almost never heard the message

852
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,551
that played when you didn't pick up.

853
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,386
But I hear it every day now.

854
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,140
Gosh.

855
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,518
This is the end of our reign.

856
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,731
I agree with the saying
that even your shadow abandons you

857
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,983
in dark times.

858
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,450
Goodness.

859
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,999
Do you have any makgeolli?

860
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,961
Father! You said Chemicals
and Motors were mine.

861
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,087
Then break up with her.

862
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,716
If not, you'll never get my companies!

863
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,843
No, I refuse to break up with her.

864
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,177
What did you say?

865
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,846
-Never.
-How dare you?

866
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,806
Stop! Stop right there!

867
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,435
CEO JANG AND HIS THREE SONS

868
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,644
Come on, now.

869
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,480
They always end it at the best parts.

870
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,398
Goodness.

871
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,359
Do they really do that?

872
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,445
Sorry?

873
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,989
Is that how the rich live?

874
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,074
I beg to differ.

875
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,327
Those dramas make me think

876
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,288
the writers didn't do
their research properly.

877
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,372
How come?

878
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,959
The characters
are often seen grabbing their necks.

879
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:37,088
But the rich are very strict
about their blood pressure.

880
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:41,051
-After all, we have a live-in doctor.
-A live-in doctor?

881
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,262
They remove sodium from our diet
if our blood pressure rises even a bit.

882
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,847
They remove it all.

883
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,644
And the houses
all have stairs in the living room.

884
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,230
Exactly. You don't all have them, do you?

885
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,815
It's not the Opera House.

886
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,653
We all do, and we often use them
to go upstairs.

887
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,989
But we take the elevator
when going down to protect our knees.

888
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,369
The writers need to do better research.

889
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,625
This is just right.

890
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,100
Are you sleeping?

891
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,277
Hae-in, are you asleep?

892
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:52,622
What is it?

893
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,959
Say what you need to say.

894
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,172
I heard Eun-sung came by yesterday.

895
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,049
Did Soo-cheol tell you?

896
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,718
That's not important.

897
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,554
What did he say?

898
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,306
He just asked why I was here.

899
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,268
What's it to him?

900
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,478
What else?

901
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,563
He also told me

902
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,356
to work again

903
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,983
and come home.

904
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,317
Come home?

905
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,444
Yes.

906
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,280
Will he move out if you do?

907
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,616
He'll stay?

908
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,534
Well…

909
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,953
We didn't talk in detail.

910
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,122
Does he want to live with you?

911
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,623
You two aren't together.

912
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,333
Neither are we, but look at us.

913
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,669
No, we're different. We were…

914
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,299
married.

915
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,675
But not anymore.

916
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,138
You've helped me so far,
and I think you've done enough.

917
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,557
What are you saying?

918
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,517
I heard you're waiting to be assigned.

919
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,311
Why didn't you tell me?

920
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,396
It's nothing.

921
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,648
How is it nothing
when the reason is malpractice?

922
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,901
Who knows on what documents
they forged your signature?

923
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,487
Embezzlement? Something illegal?
He's capable of anything.

924
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,655
You're in no position to worry about me.

925
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,200
You didn't want to worry about me.

926
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,660
Same goes for me.

927
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,331
I'll take care of my own issues.

928
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,126
I feel uncomfortable

929
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,337
that you're suffering uselessly
because of me.

930
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,969
Don't be so cold.

931
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,931
I'm just doing it for you--

932
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,724
Don't do anything for me.

933
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,729
I'll find my own solutions.

934
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,845
Hello, Doctor.

935
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,890
Yes, I'm taking the medication.

936
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,226
But I've been getting
a lot of headaches lately.

937
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,605
I've been giving myself
the WBC injection every day.

938
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,694
The tumor didn't seem
to have grown in the latest photos.

939
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,279
Could it be something else?

940
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:13,907
Hyun-woo.

941
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,074
Wake up.

942
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,202
Wake up right now.

943
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,997
What is it?

944
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,833
Tell me the truth.

945
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,544
Hae-in is sick, isn't she?

946
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,341
Tell me. She's been acting strange lately.

947
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,009
She also fainted last time.

948
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,220
I think she's injecting herself too.

949
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,013
I think something is up.

950
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,478
She wants it to be a secret.

951
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,147
But…

952
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,818
I need you to take care of her
when I'm away,

953
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,153
so I'll confide in you.

954
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,321
What is it?

955
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,247
She has…

956
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,000
a brain tumor.

957
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:09,671
But…

958
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,756
it's big,

959
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,134
and it's a rare case.

960
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,388
So she can't get surgery right now.

961
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,140
She's monitoring it
while taking medication.

962
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,732
But the rate

963
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,609
isn't high.

964
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,696
What rate?

965
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,781
Do you mean

966
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,118
the survival rate?

967
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,381
Goodness.

968
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,632
I can't believe this.

969
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,801
She's still so young.

970
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,053
No one in her family knows

971
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,722
except for her aunt.

972
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,349
Not even her parents?

973
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,310
No.

974
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:09,439
They should still know about this.

975
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,983
When did you find out?

976
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,240
Do you remember that day when I visited

977
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,243
and said I wanted to divorce her?

978
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,371
I found out that day
after returning to Seoul.

979
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,542
What do you mean?

980
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,835
So…

981
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,714
you were determined to divorce her,

982
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,175
then suddenly had
a change of heart because…

983
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:43,848
Yes.

984
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:49,896
After finding out about it,
I had decided to maintain our marriage.

985
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,236
You scumbag.

986
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,529
You should know better.

987
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:00,990
Oh, dear.

988
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,201
I had no idea

989
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,912
and only pitied you.

990
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,916
How could you?

991
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,586
I know.

992
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,423
I'm a scumbag.

993
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:22,512
Hae-in found out about everything
yet still came here when I told her to.

994
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,474
So, Mom…

995
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,145
please take…

996
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,107
good care of her

997
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,901
when I'm away.

998
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:39,570
I beg you.

999
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,455
Mom.

1000
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:38,421
What is it?

1001
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,798
I came by for some kimchi.

1002
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,259
Your mom is crying.

1003
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,888
-Why?
-Isn't it obvious?

1004
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:50,016
She was always against it
and wanted me to quit.

1005
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,936
But now that I've stepped down,
she must be upset.

1006
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,648
What? She said she was relieved
that you were no longer the village head.

1007
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,611
She didn't mean it.

1008
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,987
Goodness.

1009
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:03,905
Mom.

1010
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,491
Just go. Come back later.

1011
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,578
This is a feast.

1012
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,830
I should just eat here today.

1013
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,124
Tell Hae-in to come and eat.

1014
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,001
Okay.

1015
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,174
Honey.

1016
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,384
What's with you? Move.

1017
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,763
I know what you're going through.

1018
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:30,807
But…

1019
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,141
you see…

1020
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,561
Why don't you think like this?

1021
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,233
I, Baek Du-gwan,
used to belong to the people.

1022
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:43,736
But now, I'm all yours.

1023
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,490
Why would I ever want that?

1024
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,993
Is that so?

1025
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,459
Goodness, we're feasting for breakfast.

1026
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,711
What's the occasion?

1027
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,256
Please help yourselves.

1028
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,306
Hae-in, come and eat.

1029
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,224
Okay.

1030
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,897
Where's your sister?

1031
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,109
Beom-ja left for Seoul
in the morning to run some errands.

1032
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,068
I see.

1033
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:27,363
Gosh, it would've been nice
had she eaten with us.

1034
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,282
Let's eat.

1035
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,507
By the way, where's Soo-cheol?

1036
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,601
QUEEN'S BOXING GYM

1037
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,727
GEONUMAMA HAS LOGGED IN

1038
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,108
Da-hye.

1039
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,492
-Da-hye.
-Gosh.

1040
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,494
Why is he playing this?

1041
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,413
I kept my character
because of all the items.

1042
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,332
-Jeez.
-Let me just say one thing.

1043
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,042
Forget it. You'll just swear at me.

1044
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,168
GEONUPAPA SENT A MESSAGE

1045
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,586
What is this?

1046
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,297
This is Geon-u's vaccination record
in English and Korean.

1047
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,258
He needs his second round of MMR vaccine
and chicken pox vaccine.

1048
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,594
Make sure he gets them wherever you are.

1049
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,555
Make sure you sing
"Baby Shark" when he gets them.

1050
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:39,769
Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo

1051
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:43,314
Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo
Baby shark

1052
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:49,779
Mommy Shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo

1053
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,781
All done.

1054
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,115
-Thank you.
-Gosh.

1055
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,742
Gosh, Geon-u.

1056
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,243
Did it hurt?

1057
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,244
Well done.

1058
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,497
He didn't even cry.

1059
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,000
Come on.

1060
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,685
GEONUMAMA HAS LOGGED OUT

1061
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,795
Going somewhere?

1062
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:50,006
-Seoul.
-All of a sudden?

1063
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,259
Look.

1064
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,595
Even Beom-ja left for Seoul.
Why are you all going there?

1065
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:00,057
Do you want the reporters to see you?
We're in hiding, you know?

1066
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,643
There's something I must do.

1067
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,812
I heard Eun-sung visited.

1068
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,316
What kind of plans are you having
Soo-cheol keep secret?

1069
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,444
Are you going to meet him today too?

1070
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,282
For what? Are you going
to beg him to spare at least you?

1071
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,410
Of course, I should.

1072
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,871
Should we all go down together?

1073
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,623
What? I can't believe you.

1074
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,377
Don't tell me you'll work for him.

1075
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,629
That was my spot from the get-go.

1076
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,260
Don't tell me you two colluded
so you could kick your family out

1077
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:39,638
and take over the company all by yourself.

1078
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,522
Think however you want.

1079
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:49,607
Hey!

1080
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:08,334
Sweetie, are you going to Seoul?

1081
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,251
Yes.

1082
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:12,171
You won't get any taxis here.

1083
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,464
I'll drive you. Hop on.

1084
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:21,639
Hold tight.

1085
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,612
Mother.

1086
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:37,822
Yes?

1087
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,033
Thank you for everything.

1088
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:46,080
Are you going somewhere far away?
That's odd for you to say.

1089
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,513
The wind must be strong.

1090
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:04,974
My eyes are getting watery.

1091
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,321
Of course. I know this is forbidden.

1092
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:26,370
But we've never kept
any secrets from each other.

1093
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:29,665
Remember when your youngest son
fled to Sokcho because he couldn't forget

1094
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,835
his first love
and I went there to get him?

1095
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,712
We can laugh about it now.

1096
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,881
He was in so much pain.

1097
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,132
Las Vegas, was it?

1098
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:40,718
He went there to do drugs--

1099
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,722
Exactly.

1100
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,057
So will you tell me?

1101
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,560
Of course.
No one will know that you told me.

1102
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,357
Who?

1103
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,820
I see. Chairman Hong Man-dae from Queens?

1104
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:04,033
So that's where he is.

1105
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:54,708
Does Mr. Baek know that Ms. Hong is here?

1106
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:55,626
I don't think so.

1107
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:57,711
Right, she left him.

1108
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,470
-Where are you rushing to?
-As you know, it's an emergency.

1109
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:07,721
What's going on?

1110
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,723
You haven't heard.

1111
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,475
Let's keep it that way.

1112
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,539
Welcome back.

1113
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,541
I didn't return because of your threats.

1114
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,626
I know you won't return what was ours.

1115
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,712
So if I can't get it back,

1116
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:42,589
I guess I'll have to share.

1117
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,389
So keep your word.

1118
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:25,841
The press conference will begin soon.

1119
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:28,677
Like we mentioned before,
we won't answer any questions.

1120
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,727
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR THE INAUGURATION
OF YOON EUN-SUNG AT QUEENS GROUP

1121
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,235
Hae-in.

1122
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,029
How did you know?

1123
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,489
Why are you here?

1124
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,325
I told you.

1125
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,410
I'll find my own solutions.

1126
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,661
And this…

1127
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,168
-is your solution?
-Yes.

1128
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:04,421
I like things to be certain and quick.

1129
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,674
Let's go. It's almost time.

1130
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,663
-Are you sure this is it?
-I'm telling you.

1131
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,165
I double-checked. I'm positive.

1132
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:46,463
MS. MOH SEUL-HEE

1133
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,054
-Hello, ma'am.
-Have you found him yet?

1134
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:58,308
No, ma'am.
I searched all throughout Seoul.

1135
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,186
Maybe he's in a rural area.

1136
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,065
Of course.

1137
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,443
I'll call you as soon as I find him.

1138
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,947
Did you see that? I turned my back on her.

1139
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,298
Yes, his condition is the same.

1140
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,215
Yes.

1141
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,601
The major economic newspapers, dailies,

1142
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:43,562
live media, and ones overseas
have made additional requests,

1143
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,439
so we're getting them in order.

1144
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,316
The PR Team
has already handed out a guide.

1145
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,527
You can follow this guide,
and we'll release it

1146
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,904
without an embargo.

1147
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,866
We'll have a teleprompter,
so you can relax and read the words.

1148
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,535
What about your wedding announcement?

1149
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:00,913
Don't include that.

1150
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,040
I'll announce it at the end.

1151
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,082
Yes, sir.

1152
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:07,669
Is that okay?

1153
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,528
Hello, I'm Yoon Eun-sung.

1154
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:37,616
Pione Investment has become
Queens' second biggest shareholder.

1155
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,535
And I became the new chairman
of Queens Group

1156
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:42,162
after holding
an extraordinary general meeting.

1157
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,207
This decision was inevitable
since the former chairman fell ill,

1158
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,126
and we had to stop the fall of our stocks.

1159
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,506
In addition, I've had a lot
of experience in saving companies

1160
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,259
from crises and restabilizing them.

1161
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:56,802
Despite everything, however,

1162
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:59,429
I was tormented by groundless assumptions

1163
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:01,056
and fake accusations

1164
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,600
about how I betrayed the former chairman,

1165
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,727
kicked out his family,

1166
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:10,440
stole from them, confined them,
and stowed them away in Southeast Asia.

1167
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,405
One thing for sure is

1168
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,574
this was exactly
what the former chairman wanted.

1169
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,119
To prove this
and clear up the misunderstandings,

1170
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:25,247
I'd like to make a big announcement today.

1171
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:32,879
I will reappoint Ms. Hong Hae-in,
my longtime friend

1172
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,383
and talented businesswoman,
as the CEO of Queens Department Store.

1173
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,678
During the past three years,
the store made

1174
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,930
all-time record profits
under her management.

1175
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,099
That just shows how competent she is.

1176
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,518
Now, let's hear from her.

1177
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,702
Hello, I'm Hong Hae-in.

1178
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,705
Like Chairman Yoon just said,

1179
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,167
he and I have been friends
since university.

1180
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,210
And Mr. Yoon…

1181
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,840
MR. YOON AND I WILL DO OUR BEST
TO TAKE A NEW LEAP FORWARD

1182
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:17,883
He…

1183
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:21,595
threatened me.

1184
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,315
He threatened to falsely charge
and put Mr. Baek Hyun-woo,

1185
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:37,694
my husband
and former legal director, behind bars.

1186
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:40,864
I have a recording as proof.

1187
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:44,868
Wait, Hae-in.

1188
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:47,704
Furthermore, I can't return to my position

1189
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,331
as the CEO of my department store.

1190
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:51,708
Because…

1191
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,002
I was told…

1192
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,257
that I have little time left to live.

1193
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,244
Drink up! Bottoms up!

1194
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:10,954
FOUR YEARS AGO

1195
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,748
Bottoms up!

1196
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,957
Nice!

1197
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,503
Why is our intern, Hae-in, not drinking?

1198
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:19,880
Drink up!

1199
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,300
I already told you that I wasn't drinking.

1200
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:30,056
Is that so? Then let's do a love shot.

1201
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,057
Come on.

1202
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:32,809
Okay. Drink up.

1203
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,811
-Love shot.
-Okay. Drink up.

1204
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,980
-Love shot.
-Who's that?

1205
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,065
What are you doing?

1206
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:42,194
I'm drinking instead of her.

1207
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,945
What are you doing?

1208
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:44,863
What is this?

1209
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:58,251
Why don't you do the love shot with me?

1210
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,897
Ms. Hong, why are you so upset?

1211
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,149
Did I make you uncomfortable back there?

1212
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,109
Yes, extremely.

1213
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,361
I was just--

1214
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:25,904
You were just too cute.

1215
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,950
-What?
-You're too adorable when you're drunk.

1216
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,118
But you still got drunk and acted cute

1217
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,787
in front of other women.

1218
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:35,997
How dare you?

1219
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:38,917
It won't happen again.

1220
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,876
Don't forget.

1221
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,170
You make people's hearts race

1222
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:43,839
when you're drunk.

1223
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,424
That's your special move.

1224
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:49,177
So don't do it in front of others.

1225
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,554
Okay.

1226
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,144
I won't do it.

1227
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,835
That's what she said.

1228
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:23,712
LAST NIGHT

1229
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,256
Hae-in said I made her heart race

1230
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:27,883
when I got drunk.

1231
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:28,800
Let's go home.

1232
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,010
You're drunk.

1233
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,514
Do you think she still feels the same way?

1234
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,893
Will her heart still race
even now if I got drunk

1235
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,603
and acted cute?

1236
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,522
She wouldn't have divorced you then.

1237
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:47,235
Why does my heart race when I look at her?

1238
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:50,572
-It does?
-Yes, it does.

1239
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:56,494
I get butterflies,
and I'm happy when I look at her.

1240
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,789
I miss her when she's gone.

1241
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,167
And when I look at her,

1242
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,796
I'm terrified

1243
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:10,175
that I won't ever see her again.

1244
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:11,593
Goodness.

1245
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:18,016
But she doesn't want me…

1246
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:22,270
to do anything

1247
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,148
for her anymore.

1248
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:27,734
I make her uncomfortable.

1249
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:29,319
She must not like you anymore.

1250
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,656
But she put this bandage on me

1251
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,909
and even applied ointment for me.

1252
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:39,120
Really? Then does she still like you?

1253
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,538
It's confusing.

1254
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,499
Just ask her.

1255
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:49,839
She likes me.

1256
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,801
She likes me not.

1257
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,345
She likes me.

1258
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:57,639
She likes me not.

1259
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:00,892
She likes me.

1260
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:05,730
She likes me not.

1261
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,281
She likes me.

1262
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,659
She likes me not.

1263
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:19,869
She likes me.

1264
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,080
She likes me.

1265
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:24,749
She likes me not.

1266
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,128
She likes me.

1267
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,839
She likes me not.

1268
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:32,882
She likes me.

1269
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,051
She likes me not.

1270
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:37,345
She likes me.

1271
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:39,848
She likes me not.

1272
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,023
She likes me?

1273
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:53,319
Really?

1274
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,034
Gosh.

1275
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,079
But that's not the case for me.

1276
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:06,541
I…

1277
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,505
love her.

1278
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,818
I love you, Hae-in.

1279
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,978
QUEEN OF TEARS

1280
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,010
I'll give you anything you want…

1281
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:43,179
I'll be with her.

1282
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:48,017
I'm happy as long as you dry my hair
with the broken hair dryer.

1283
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:50,728
Please teach me how to box.

1284
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,898
-Berries?
-Shall we meet tonight?

1285
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:54,941
At night?

1286
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:56,776
He's looking
for the chairman's secret fund.

1287
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,528
I'm going to find it first.

1288
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:00,155
Get rid

1289
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:01,739
of Baek Hyun-woo.

1290
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,491
I can't die yet.

1291
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,869
I haven't told you yet.

1292
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:07,078
I love you.

1293
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,502
