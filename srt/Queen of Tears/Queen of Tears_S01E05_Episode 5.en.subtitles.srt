1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,611
I'm sorry I yelled.

3
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,204
The truth is…

4
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,832
I don't remember.

5
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,253
I don't remember at all why I was there.

6
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,551
I was in front of your house,

7
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,846
then suddenly I was somewhere else.

8
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,394
I don't know when I went there

9
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,315
or how.

10
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,195
I have no idea.

11
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,573
I was…

12
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,830
so scared.

13
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,353
By the way,
why did you come here by yourself?

14
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,150
Your sister texted me.

15
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,487
She said your father
was losing the election.

16
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,115
His rival was winning
the voters over with food.

17
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,287
That's why you came?

18
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,625
I mean, he was losing

19
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,377
to pork and rice soup.

20
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,379
How could I sit still?

21
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,049
So that's why you counterattacked
with beef and lobster?

22
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,386
You should've witnessed

23
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,972
how I mercilessly beat 200 bowls of soup.

24
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,251
Hae-in!

25
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,961
-Hae-in!
-Hae-in!

26
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,504
Hae-in!

27
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,880
Is she there?

28
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,799
No, she's not.

29
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,634
-Hae-in!
-You haven't found her yet?

30
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,844
Where is she?

31
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,220
Where could she be?

32
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,430
My poor Hae-in!

33
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,806
Call the police!

34
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,599
-We have to!
-Hae-in!

35
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,184
-Hae-in!
-Where are you?

36
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,352
Hae-in!

37
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,021
-Hae-in!
-Hae-in!

38
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:13,980
Hae-in!

39
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,064
-Hae-in!
-Hae-in!

40
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,191
-Hae-in!
-Where did she go?

41
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,110
-Hae-in!
-Hae-in!

42
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,404
-Hae-in!
-Hae-in!

43
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,363
Hae-in!

44
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,657
Gosh!

45
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,409
Goodness.

46
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,786
Goodness, my poor baby!

47
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,331
Goodness! Here you were!

48
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,837
EPISODE 5

49
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,131
We were really startled.

50
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,133
Where were you?

51
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,138
Stop asking her.

52
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,307
Father, you should sleep.

53
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,308
Okay.

54
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,351
Don't mind us.

55
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,271
People here go to bed early.

56
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,398
-So make yourself at home.
-He's right.

57
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,150
-Consider us invisible.
-Right.

58
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,443
Unbelievable.

59
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,820
How can you be invisible
when you're here? Go.

60
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,864
-Let's go. Night.
-Night.

61
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,948
Good night.

62
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,259
I need to dry my hair.

63
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,638
Is there a hair dryer?

64
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,056
One minute.

65
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,982
This is pretty old.

66
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,068
It's okay.

67
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,535
It's not working.

68
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,747
You need to press down on the bottom.

69
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,249
Like this?

70
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,127
Hold the cable.

71
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,880
Let me do it.

72
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,512
There's a way to do this.

73
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,338
-It's all dry now.
-Right.

74
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,008
I think you're good.

75
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,565
Mom!

76
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,194
Check this out.

77
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,696
People don't change that easily.
What's with her?

78
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,780
What is it?

79
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,242
Hae-in must've visited her in-laws
out of the blue.

80
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,620
-What for?
-That's why I'm dumbfounded.

81
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,538
Hillbillies are unbelievable.

82
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,124
They filmed this and uploaded it.

83
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,417
Upload what?

84
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,253
What are you doing here?

85
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,005
I'm glad you're all here.

86
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,591
I missed your last birthday,

87
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,261
so I came to treat
the villagers to a meal.

88
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,346
BEAUTIFUL CEO HONG HAE-IN

89
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,516
She's never surprised me on my birthday.

90
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,809
How unbelievable.

91
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,902
Are you hungry?

92
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,946
Do you want to eat something?

93
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,115
I already ate a lot.

94
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,493
Have some of this, will you?

95
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,745
This is soy sauce marinated crab.

96
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,622
It's full of roe.

97
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,333
We're known for our soy sauce.

98
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,752
This is frozen pork belly
grilled over briquettes.

99
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,921
Have some before it gets cold.

100
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,173
I'm eating them one by one,
so please wait.

101
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,384
-What's next?
-Try this too.

102
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,844
Move over, will you?
You're suffocating my baby.

103
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,638
Don't be so ridiculous.

104
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,558
Chew slowly,
or you'll have an upset stomach.

105
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,351
Drink some water too.

106
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,314
Give her some of the eggs.

107
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,692
Let me do it.

108
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,403
Why are they making her so uncomfortable?

109
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,990
And why is she eating everything
they're giving her?

110
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,825
Frozen pork belly is best when hot.

111
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,909
What?

112
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,537
How does this video
have over 300,000 views?

113
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,582
Why is she eating so much?

114
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:47,169
Beef, pork, chicken, duck, and fish.

115
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,672
I had all kinds of meat.

116
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,632
I think I've gained weight.

117
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,260
-Really?
-I mean…

118
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,805
A woman offered me chicken that she'd
never even made for her son-in-law.

119
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,060
I think the villagers like me.

120
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,700
They seem to be doing well,
so don't you dare mention the divorce.

121
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,285
You got it.

122
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,828
Have you told anyone so far?

123
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,040
Come on, Mom. I'd be an idiot if I did.

124
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,423
-Why are you so quiet?
-What?

125
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,009
Goodness. Who was it? Who did you tell?

126
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,178
I was having makgeolli
with Yeong-song and…

127
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,179
-What?
-What?

128
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,722
You told him that--

129
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,392
You told him that Hyun-woo
almost got divorced?

130
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:48,230
Well, Yeong-song is like
a marriage counselor of this village,

131
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,775
so I consulted him.

132
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,485
I lamented.

133
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,444
That was all.

134
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,364
What if he told others?

135
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,074
-Yes.
-Word will spread quickly.

136
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,161
Consultation is all about confidentiality.

137
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,956
He doesn't need to keep it a secret
since he's not a licensed doctor.

138
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,213
Jeez. Even still…

139
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,799
You and your big mouth.

140
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,426
Come on.

141
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,144
You were worried,
so you came here at this hour?

142
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,772
Did you tell anyone?

143
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,856
Of course not.

144
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,777
I only told my mother.

145
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
Why would you?

146
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,031
Du-gwan, she's the only family I have.

147
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,033
We share everything.

148
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,912
And you know her condition.

149
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,298
When did you come home, honey?
Why are you always away?

150
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,634
Where are you sleeping these days?

151
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,261
Mom, go to bed.

152
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,846
Who are you?

153
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,141
See? So don't worry about her

154
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,393
and worry about your son and his wife.

155
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,437
There's nothing to worry about.

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,896
Despite being so busy,

157
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,315
Hae-in came all the way here
to aid my campaign.

158
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,900
-What does that mean?
-What?

159
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,654
It means the two are madly in love.

160
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,494
What's this? How cute.

161
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,539
It's always been my favorite.

162
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,588
Your hand.

163
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,139
You shouldn't be alone anymore.

164
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,267
You always get hurt.

165
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,077
I heard this is your lifeline.

166
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,581
Why is mine so short?

167
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,624
I'm offended.

168
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,043
Come on.

169
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,295
Do you believe in palm reading?

170
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,589
No, but it doesn't feel nice.

171
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,592
I'm terminally ill,
and my lifeline is short.

172
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,803
You're not terminally ill.

173
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,097
You didn't want to be a patient.

174
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,682
You said you'd get better.

175
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,977
You said God was on your side
and that a miracle would happen.

176
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,818
You said the best cancer center
in Europe would cure everything!

177
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,453
I never said they'd cure everything.

178
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,706
I'm just saying.

179
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,960
There's a reason they're the best.

180
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,212
Do you think so?

181
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,929
Will you…

182
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,391
come with me?

183
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,064
It's not that I'm scared of going alone.

184
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,651
You're just the only person
who knows that I'm sick.

185
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,123
Are you serious?

186
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,127
That's a given.

187
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,427
Does it still sting?

188
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,166
Have you gone insane?

189
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,126
What were you trying to do?

190
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,711
Don't tell me

191
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,005
you wanted to kiss her.

192
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,883
Jesus.

193
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,218
You're crazy.

194
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,303
You're insane.

195
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,893
But still,

196
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,854
you shouldn't have left her hanging.

197
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,565
She must be startled.

198
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,571
You're going back in?

199
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,241
What will you say to her?
What will you do?

200
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,911
Do you think you can come back outside?

201
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,540
No, you can't.

202
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,877
No. I won't be able to leave

203
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,629
if I go back.

204
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,173
I can't.

205
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:00,978
Did he run away?

206
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,398
No.

207
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,191
I'm sure

208
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,153
he had something to do.

209
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,281
Maybe he had to go to the toilet
or make a call.

210
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,376
But for this long?

211
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,883
Can you please quiet down?

212
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,302
Jeez, you're so noisy.

213
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,344
Shut up!

214
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,931
Did you and Hae-in argue?

215
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,058
No.

216
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,518
It's the opposite.

217
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,104
Then are you being punished?

218
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,191
Did she tell you to go outside
and self-reflect for an hour?

219
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,778
-Have you ever done that?
-Many times.

220
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,531
But she'll get even more upset
if you do as she says.

221
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,452
She'll forgive you
if you hurry back and apologize.

222
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,497
That's hot.

223
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,294
So get a grip and go back inside.

224
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,506
I'm only here

225
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,634
so I can come to my senses.

226
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,720
I can't think straight at home.

227
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,763
Why not?

228
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,566
I don't know. I just can't.

229
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:50,963
BAEK HYUN-WOO

230
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,304
Where are you?

231
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,689
Why isn't he reading it?

232
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,608
Hey, he read it.

233
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,040
Go to bed first.

234
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,418
"Go to bed first"?

235
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,379
He wants me to sleep first?

236
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,174
By myself?

237
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,059
Fine.

238
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,603
That's what he wants.

239
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,314
Go to bed.

240
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,648
Go to bed first.

241
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,613
Damn it.

242
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,448
So he did run away.

243
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,118
Why? Does he think I'll eat him alive?
Is he afraid of me?

244
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,208
Be quiet!

245
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,966
Why is he afraid of me?

246
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,677
How am I scary?

247
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,681
Even the dogs are sleeping.

248
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,683
Let's go back home now.

249
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,810
I'll stay out a bit longer.

250
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,396
Hae-in will sleep alone then.

251
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,941
Yes, that's why.

252
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,485
I'll go back once she does.

253
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,532
Jeez, you idiot.

254
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,243
Why?

255
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,869
Why will you wait until then?

256
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,210
Because I might…

257
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,129
make a mistake.

258
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,965
What do you mean?

259
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,008
You only make mistakes when you're drunk.

260
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,261
You shouldn't have drunk in that case.

261
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,512
No.

262
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,555
I won't make any mistakes

263
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,141
if I drink and pass out.

264
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,477
I have no idea what you're saying.

265
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,605
Listen carefully.

266
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,234
I'm going to drink more

267
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,362
and get totally wasted.

268
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,990
Just do me one favor.

269
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,075
-What is it?
-Don't…

270
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,494
put me…

271
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,539
back in my room.

272
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,298
I'm so lost.

273
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,218
Do you want ramyeon? I'll make some.

274
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:49,641
I used to be so scared of my wife.

275
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,237
I used to be

276
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,740
okay.

277
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,745
I was sure that I'd be unfazed

278
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,581
no matter what happened to her.

279
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,085
Why? Because I didn't like her.

280
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,009
Just like I've done so far,

281
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,845
I just need to continue disliking,

282
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,388
resenting,

283
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,140
and being tired of her.

284
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,601
I just need to anticipate
the day we part ways.

285
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,521
I don't need to like her.

286
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,191
It's simple.

287
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,735
I've been doing it all along.

288
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,551
But…

289
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,304
strangely enough,

290
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,642
I can't do it anymore.

291
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,824
Fine.

292
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,952
We don't need to sleep together.

293
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,871
We've been sleeping separately for years.

294
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,251
TWO YEARS AGO

295
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,839
What are you doing?

296
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,466
Ms. Hong told us to clean out the room.

297
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,725
The Product Team is in charge
of picking and removing brands.

298
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,270
The Sales Team needs to focus
on the brands' performance.

299
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,692
Hold on.

300
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,694
What is it?

301
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,321
The nursery.

302
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,825
-Are you cleaning out?
-What's the use of it?

303
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,952
It only gets on my nerves.

304
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,917
It gets on your nerves?

305
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,669
We don't need it anymore.

306
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:39,019
The Product Team can't attract
good brands with poor performance.

307
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,604
Isn't that obvious?

308
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,650
Yes.

309
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,911
Please move my belongings into this room.

310
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,162
Sorry?

311
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,413
I need a bed too.

312
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,666
I'll stay here for now.

313
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,626
Yes, sir.

314
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,907
Don't cry.

315
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,535
You have no right.

316
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,527
You're up early.

317
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,572
Does it look like I slept?

318
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,532
Did you not sleep at all?

319
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:07,912
What's it to you?

320
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,549
Ho-yeol, shouldn't you go to school?

321
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,427
Dad, why does that matter?

322
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,970
My life mentor

323
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,264
is right here.

324
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,934
What do you mean? Who's your mentor?

325
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,228
She's the family's pillar
who came in a supercar.

326
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,607
It's my aunt,
a building owner and my role model.

327
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,817
There she comes.

328
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,696
-Come on out.
-Gosh, Hae-in.

329
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,239
Thank you.

330
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,658
You did so much.

331
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,910
Go home safely.

332
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,286
Goodbye.

333
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,457
-Hyun-woo.
-Hello, ma'am.

334
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,958
-Goodbye.
-Yes, ma'am.

335
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,253
Your mother is sane again.

336
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,547
Yeong-song, she's all better now.

337
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,757
Goodness, Mother.

338
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,425
Stay strong.

339
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,718
Thank you.

340
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,638
Divorce is nothing.

341
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,224
I wanted to get a divorce too.

342
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,142
I should have when I had the chance.

343
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,229
Goodness, Mother.

344
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,773
Gosh, ma'am.

345
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,651
I think she's out of it again.

346
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,611
You should hurry home.

347
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,112
Let's go.

348
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,241
Honey, did you sleep here last night?

349
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,829
This is exactly why I want a divorce.

350
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,790
Let's just go home.

351
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,376
-I should've divorced you!
-Let's go!

352
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,545
-You should go.
-She's a villager.

353
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,671
She's a bit demented.

354
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,257
Goodbye, honey.

355
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,348
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

356
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,474
All right then.

357
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,561
-Goodbye.
-Gosh, you weren't an inconvenience.

358
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,647
This isn't much.

359
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,567
But I used no pesticides,
so make sure you eat them.

360
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,327
Hae-in, I know work is important.

361
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,538
But your health comes first.

362
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,208
You should go.

363
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,626
Thank you.

364
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,838
Okay, get home safely.

365
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,051
-Let's go.
-Thanks, Hae-in.

366
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,637
-Goodbye.
-Go.

367
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,683
We'll get going then.

368
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,476
-Okay.
-Okay.

369
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,979
Call me.

370
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,122
Do you have cigarettes?

371
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,626
No.

372
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,590
Do you think she caught on?

373
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,175
Who knows?

374
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,218
I don't think she did,

375
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,263
but there was cold air
between them even before then.

376
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,766
They even avoided eye contact
before hopping in.

377
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,100
You shouldn't have talked

378
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,519
about how he received
love letters in the past

379
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,315
and how the principal's daughter
had a crush on him. All that useless talk.

380
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,192
-It must've upset her.
-What?

381
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,194
It was just a joke.

382
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,403
Was it funny?

383
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,740
-Are you serious?
-He didn't sleep in his room last night.

384
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,075
-What?
-What?

385
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,409
Then what did he do?

386
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,411
We drank together at the store.

387
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,829
That hurts.

388
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,289
You insisted, didn't you?

389
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,999
No, he didn't want to go.

390
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,377
I guess sleeping separately
made it awkward.

391
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,384
How could their love die?

392
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,470
They used to be madly in love.

393
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,139
I'm sorry for this abrupt meeting.

394
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,226
You sure are dressed up for an intern.

395
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,396
You must like luxury brands. I do too.

396
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,064
FOUR YEARS AGO

397
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,818
Mr. Baek is on his way back
from working outside.

398
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,362
I know. That's why I called you.

399
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,698
What is this?

400
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,660
About Hyun-woo…

401
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,495
I know.

402
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,706
He's decent. I'm sure you want him.

403
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,041
He's smart and handsome.

404
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,627
Did he tell you how many cows we own?

405
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,130
-Yes.
-As well as the size of our orchard?

406
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,382
And that we own the only store in town?

407
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,095
What about his house in Seoul?

408
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,513
He signed a two-year lease.

409
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,141
Then you must know.

410
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,980
I didn't know I was materialistic,
but I can't help it since he's family.

411
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,317
I heard you're poor

412
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,195
and that you wear shabby clothes.

413
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,406
No, they're all special vintage…

414
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,951
What does he know anyway?

415
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,704
That's true. Anyway…

416
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,247
Can you stop seeing him?

417
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,041
I will never break up with him.

418
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,126
And that's final.

419
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,753
You're quite selfish.

420
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,089
All the ladies who want to date him
are successful individuals

421
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,967
such as civil servants
and major company employees.

422
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,844
I know it's cruel, but it's reality.

423
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,138
-Mi-seon!
-Goodness.

424
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,098
What are you doing?

425
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,767
What did you say to Hae-in?

426
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,686
-I didn't say much. I--
-Jeez.

427
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,730
I told you to stop watching dramas!

428
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,399
The money is quite little
unlike the dramas.

429
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,820
Hey, I just want you to break up
before you grow on each other.

430
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,406
And let's be honest. She's not your type.

431
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,622
-Let me go.
-Okay.

432
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,338
What exactly is his type?

433
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,672
Soft and pure ladies.

434
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,175
Not someone with a temper like yours.

435
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,385
Someone who needs protection.

436
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,472
He's always said so
ever since high school.

437
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,015
Is that so, Mr. Baek?

438
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,769
Yes, that used to be my type.

439
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,064
But…

440
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,858
the woman I love right now

441
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,944
is you.

442
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,739
So…

443
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,825
don't bother listening to her.

444
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,285
Let's go.

445
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,372
Let's go.

446
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,382
That was impressive.

447
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,468
I can't believe you did that.

448
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,846
Simply put, I helped them get together.

449
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:43,474
They seemed to grow closer
after that incident.

450
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,518
Gosh.

451
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,894
What in the world

452
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,188
happened to them?

453
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,626
It's okay. Let me do it.

454
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,919
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

455
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,004
No problem.

456
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,939
I wasn't waiting.

457
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,610
Don't think I was waiting for you
just because I stayed up.

458
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,030
I don't think that way. Let's go inside.

459
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,407
It's cold.

460
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,287
I just couldn't sleep.

461
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,873
It wasn't my own bed,
the dogs were all barking,

462
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,209
and I didn't have my sleeping pills.
That's why.

463
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,669
All right.
I don't think you waited either.

464
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,880
You've never waited for me before.

465
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,217
You're right. I'm not the type who'd wait.

466
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,011
Yes, I know that better than anyone else.

467
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,369
Hold the umbrella properly.

468
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,749
Okay, so let's just go inside.

469
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,793
It's pouring. You'll catch a cold.

470
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,544
We can talk at home.

471
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,879
I'm done talking.

472
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,600
Where's your umbrella?

473
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,851
Why are you here?

474
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,854
Let's talk inside.

475
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,692
Come on.

476
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,894
Let me get changed.

477
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,104
Okay.

478
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,443
Do you want some tea?

479
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,320
No, thank you.

480
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,823
I feel like the owner here.

481
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,704
By the way, why are you here?

482
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,706
Right.

483
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,583
Hae-in's mother invited me over.

484
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,959
She must've felt bad

485
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,919
that I had to eat alone at the hotel.

486
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,796
So she offered me the guest house.

487
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,673
Hae-in and I have business to do,

488
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,801
so staying here
will be more convenient for us.

489
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,514
-Are you uncomfortable?
-Would you leave if I said yes?

490
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:11,932
No.

491
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,229
Then there's no point in answering.

492
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,242
What's this?

493
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,911
When did this happen?

494
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,673
What? Why won't it wash off?

495
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,808
Drink. You'll catch a cold.

496
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,602
Where is he?

497
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,521
Mr. Baek?

498
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,647
He went upstairs.

499
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,608
-I see.
-Wasn't he in the room?

500
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,903
No.

501
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,241
Do you sleep separately?

502
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,497
How's their marriage?

503
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,666
Terrible.

504
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,501
They've been sleeping separately.

505
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,586
But it's strange.

506
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:27,508
It's obvious that Hyun-woo
is sick and tired of his in-laws.

507
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,385
But he keeps saying the right things.

508
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:30,803
And you know what?

509
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,304
Chairman Hong

510
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,766
actually listens to what he has to say.

511
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,019
Hae-in and Hyun-woo argue
whenever they're together.

512
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,064
But oddly enough, she listens to him too.

513
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,901
So Hyun-woo is helping them
come to their senses?

514
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,653
Exactly.

515
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,074
He could cause problems in our plan.

516
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,367
It's best

517
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,995
to kick him out of the house
as soon as possible.

518
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,038
Are you guys okay?

519
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,167
What?

520
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,751
This is quite unusual.

521
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:07,506
The husband would be bothered
if his wife's male friend

522
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,633
moved into their house.

523
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,759
But?

524
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,553
I asked him

525
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,139
if he was uncomfortable
with me staying here,

526
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,351
and he didn't mind.

527
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,160
Why would he move out of the hotel?

528
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,622
What was my mother-in-law thinking?

529
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,166
Hae-in and I

530
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,295
had a good relationship in the past.

531
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,214
They had a good relationship.

532
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:52,384
He's not someone who should be here.

533
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,387
Jeez. What kind of good relationship?

534
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,810
Would I look pathetic…

535
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,606
if I asked her about it now?

536
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,368
So they're all connected down here.

537
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,412
We've never revealed this to the media.

538
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,832
It may look like
our houses are all separated,

539
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,002
but they're actually
all connected in the basement.

540
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,463
Our grandfather
deliberately designed it this way.

541
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,714
I see.

542
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,551
So you have access
to all houses down here.

543
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,594
Yes, and we also have that room.

544
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,805
You know the movie
with a secret room, Shock Room?

545
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,598
It's Panic Room, you idiot.

546
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,183
-I know.
-Then get it right.

547
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,189
Don't be so harsh on him.

548
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,693
They'll bring our dinners down here,
so let's eat together.

549
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,695
You guys can eat. I'm going to rest.

550
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,119
Why? You ate so well at your in-laws

551
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,745
whom you rarely meet.

552
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,541
You ate everything
and smiled from ear to ear.

553
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,835
You know that video became viral,
don't you?

554
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,463
Our PR Team worked hard today
to deal with that.

555
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,674
Why are you so upset?

556
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,634
Because I visited them?

557
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,012
Because I ate everything
and smiled so much?

558
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,263
Or…

559
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,306
was it the video?

560
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,391
Because the PR Team had to cover for me?

561
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,603
I'm not upset.

562
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,562
Then what?

563
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,730
I'm just fascinated.

564
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,731
With what?

565
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,900
I rarely see you smile like that.

566
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,779
I rarely see you smile at me either.

567
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,036
We don't have much to smile about, do we?

568
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,662
Exactly.

569
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,414
So eat without me.

570
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,667
Have a lovely time.

571
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,223
You must've been surprised.

572
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,310
I'll apologize on her behalf.

573
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,354
That's okay.

574
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,400
It's a regular thing.

575
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,903
Can you see how much I'm struggling here?

576
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,321
Right.

577
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,491
But I understand Hae-in.

578
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,079
I'm sure you already know,
but she has a terrible temper.

579
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:30,376
I'm sure her insecurities toward me
played a part.

580
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,630
I don't think she feels that way though.

581
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:39,093
She has no idea
that I'm pacing myself for her.

582
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,516
I didn't know you were pacing yourself.

583
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,853
It's not easy to sit on Queens' throne.
There's a lot to do.

584
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,190
Don't you see what's on my shoulders?

585
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,236
Burdens and responsibilities.

586
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,073
They're the reason
why I'm ten centimeters shorter.

587
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,035
Both my fate and Hae-in
are weighing me down.

588
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,663
Hae-in weighs you down?

589
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,916
She recently punched me in the stomach,

590
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,210
and I couldn't breathe for a good minute.

591
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,463
My mom was so shocked,
and they argued so much.

592
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,800
So my mom visited someone.

593
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,927
Who?

594
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,348
She knew who'd become president
and even predicted COVID-19.

595
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,351
She also warned my grandfather
not to go hunting.

596
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,186
Right, the great shaman.

597
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,187
Yes, her.

598
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,608
She paid her a hefty sum and got this.

599
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,322
A talisman?

600
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,992
This will keep me safe.

601
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,245
The shaman said

602
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:52,249
this would help me subdue Hae-in
so I can spread my wings and fly.

603
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,750
I see.

604
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:57,045
Jeez, I don't believe her.
It's all superstition.

605
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:00,174
But my mom checks if I keep it on me.

606
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,259
I don't think it works though.

607
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,887
Hae-in is still just as strong.

608
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,932
The treatment
that the German laboratory proposed

609
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,267
uses CAR-T cells

610
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,312
to treat immune cells.

611
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,981
It's a type of cancer treatment
where they extract immune cells

612
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:20,068
from your blood, transform them
into CAR-T cells that have the ability

613
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,071
to remove tumor cells,
and inject them back into your body.

614
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,616
This treatment
has often been proven effective

615
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,701
for those with leukemia,

616
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,329
but not with brain tumors just yet.

617
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,540
But…

618
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,085
they said the success rate was over 50%.

619
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:40,756
I believe they gave you that figure
after seeing good prognoses

620
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,133
in brain tumor patients

621
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,470
who were given this treatment
in recent years.

622
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,556
But you shouldn't consider that
a full recovery.

623
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,308
I will.

624
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,602
I told you many times.

625
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,522
I will find a way.

626
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,524
Even if I have to search the world,

627
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,734
I'll find a way to live.

628
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,445
So don't tell me…

629
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,825
that it won't work.

630
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,338
Their baby is in an incubator.

631
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,756
I felt bad so…

632
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,144
How's your baby?

633
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,939
Hello, ma'am.

634
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,649
What brings you to the hospital?

635
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,150
Is it still in the incubator?

636
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,486
No, not anymore.

637
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,072
-But our baby is in the ICU.
-What's the baby's name?

638
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,783
We haven't registered the birth.

639
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,578
But Cho-rong is the nickname.

640
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:58,375
I used to drink
vegetable juice every morning.

641
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,920
But I've been busy lately,
so I've been forgetting.

642
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:02,838
Sorry?

643
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,383
I want to order juice from you regularly.

644
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,551
Thank you, ma'am.

645
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,054
I'll deliver one to you
starting tomorrow--

646
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,349
It'd look cheap if I had it by myself,
so bring a few more.

647
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,351
Yes, ma'am. How many more do you want?

648
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,311
Well…

649
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,689
If all my employees were to get one,
then about 250.

650
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,733
Sorry?

651
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,653
Thank you, ma'am!

652
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,281
Thank you!

653
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,036
Sir, this is the blueprint
I've been telling you about.

654
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,248
It's the complex resort that will become
the palace of our Queens empire.

655
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,668
It includes two five-star hotels,
duty-free shops, casinos for foreigners,

656
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,296
an arena, a convention center,
a family waterpark--

657
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,964
And how much will it cost?

658
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,175
One trillion…

659
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,972
-And 700 to 900 billion won.
-Do it.

660
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,059
With your money.

661
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,144
Grandfather, I'm not asking
for your money.

662
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:02,648
We just need to secure a site,
and Eun-sung will invest in us.

663
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,774
Who?

664
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,108
Mr. Yoon Eun-sung.

665
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,361
We've gotten pretty close
since he moved in.

666
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,280
Are you saying he agreed to this?

667
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,784
We're still in the early stages,
but you could say so.

668
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,619
I'm embarrassed to say this,

669
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,120
but he's head over heels for me.

670
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,498
He's not as cold-hearted as I thought.

671
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,084
He's extremely affectionate
once you grow on him.

672
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,085
Is that so?

673
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,087
He must've taken a liking to you.

674
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,505
It's more than that.

675
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:31,218
He's eager to listen to what I want to do.

676
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,303
Is he?

677
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,474
Father, Mr. Yoon's funds
come from Middle Eastern oil money,

678
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,142
so he's reliable.

679
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,185
Is that so?

680
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,728
-In that case--
-Hold on.

681
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,314
I think we should do
a site validity check first.

682
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,901
We've had many feasibility studies done
on our sites in the past.

683
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,529
However, none of them
were settled due to several risks.

684
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,448
We need government licenses
for duty-free shops and casinos.

685
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,491
As for the licensing…

686
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,036
You know we have our person
in the Ministry of Land.

687
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,915
We can trust him
since he received our scholarships.

688
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,918
But people can change.

689
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:08,630
It's risky to rely on him and start
a business worth 1.9 trillion won.

690
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,595
That's a fair point, isn't it?

691
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,641
Yes, Father. He knows what's important.

692
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,726
Father?

693
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,812
Review the risks first.

694
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,943
There's nothing wrong
with reviewing, Soo-cheol.

695
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,828
Hyun-woo.

696
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,580
Hello, sir.

697
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,465
You told me to call
if I recalled anything.

698
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,010
A gas deliveryman came by that day.

699
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,179
The dashcam?

700
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,974
Yes, he had one.

701
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,934
I received it.

702
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,855
But its memory size is small,
so footage from that day is gone.

703
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,566
It's okay. I'll try to restore it.

704
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,527
I'll send a deliveryman over
to pick it up.

705
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,529
Thank you.

706
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,407
This is from a dashcam.

707
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,659
The old footage has been deleted.

708
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,244
How long will restoring it take?

709
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,622
Well, I'd say at least three to four days.

710
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,706
But no guarantees.

711
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,042
It's important footage,
so please restore it well.

712
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,585
Okay.

713
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,215
Doctor, our chairman has been interested
in sweet potatoes this past week

714
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,634
since that was
Lessie Brown's favorite food

715
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,093
until her death at 114.

716
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:41,223
I heard that he was interested in berries
last week because they were

717
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,642
Christina Wahara's favorite food
until her death at 102.

718
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,768
Correct.

719
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:51,107
But since Brown lived
12 years longer than Wahara--

720
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,027
Then dried sweet potatoes?
He likes sweet food.

721
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,030
No, he has high blood sugar.
You should boil them.

722
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,365
He won't like that.

723
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,366
It can't be helped.

724
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:04,412
Please serve him chicken breast,
beans, and egg whites for now.

725
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:05,997
Are you serious?

726
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,376
Egg whites, chicken breast,

727
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,628
and beans? Come on.

728
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,422
He chews ribs whenever he's upset.

729
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,632
He might as well die.

730
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,967
Watch what you say.

731
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,051
What's your department?

732
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,220
-Family medicine, ma'am.
-Mr. Jang.

733
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,515
My father's psychiatrist
should be here too,

734
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,892
so he can take
his mental state into consideration.

735
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,769
Yes, ma'am.

736
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,812
Also…

737
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,193
I can't entrust you

738
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,364
with preparing my father's meals.

739
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,241
I heard you make the condiments yourself.

740
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:45,537
He only wants the soy sauce that I make.

741
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,706
Exactly. Who knows what you put inside?

742
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:54,504
I want you to try all his food
in front of me before serving it to him.

743
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,381
Like those court ladies did.

744
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,550
No, you'd be his concubine.

745
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,180
That'll be all for today.

746
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,765
You may go.

747
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,312
What do we do?

748
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,273
What if Beom-ja hits her again?

749
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,817
Should I wait and treat her afterward?

750
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,863
Why are you locking it?

751
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,615
Planning to beg me or something?

752
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,784
What are you doing?

753
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,836
What was that?

754
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,048
Beom-ja.

755
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,132
"Beom-ja"?

756
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:42,135
You've been cheeky with me
for the past 20 years

757
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,511
and will continue to do so.

758
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,931
But guess what? I no longer find it cute.

759
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,726
Are you crazy?
How dare you talk to me like that?

760
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,021
"Cute"? Do you want more slipped discs?

761
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,859
Wait! That hurts!

762
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,862
I'm counting to three. One, two, three!

763
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,037
Clench your jaw.

764
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,747
-Why?
-Or you'll bite your tongue.

765
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,132
That bitch hit me!

766
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,134
In my stomach! Like this!

767
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,219
Damn it.

768
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,179
I bet you hit her.

769
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,348
No, I didn't!

770
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,849
I hit her.

771
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,937
I hit her out of rage.

772
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,565
-I'm sorry.
-See? You heard her!

773
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,071
Do you think I'd believe her?

774
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,072
Why not?

775
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,533
You may not believe me,
but you believe her.

776
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,463
Believe her!

777
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,387
A regular decaf
with an extra shot. Correct?

778
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,599
-You didn't forget.
-Of course not. You're our savior.

779
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,978
We were nothing but thugs 15 years ago.

780
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,438
But we quickly became

781
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,732
top secret affair professionals,
thanks to you.

782
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,816
You're right.

783
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,110
I saw how your office grew…

784
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,737
MZ DETECTIVE AGENCY

785
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,155
…every time I got a divorce.

786
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:28,867
We're no longer a simple detective agency.
We're licensed and even pay tax.

787
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:30,952
I know.

788
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,663
Your sign changed,
so I almost couldn't find you.

789
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,165
So what are you now?

790
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,126
We're a PIA that passed

791
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,128
the state-certified test.

792
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,796
A private investigation office.

793
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,757
Then what should I call you?

794
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,258
Can I keep calling you Mr. Park?

795
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,926
Call me Conan. Conan Park.

796
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,473
Conan, it is.

797
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,602
Do a background check on her.

798
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,941
Which category is it?

799
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,570
The investigation method differs
depending on what you want to look for.

800
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:11,451
I want to know everything about her.

801
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,246
I had only been hating her
for the past 20 years.

802
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,792
I finally came to my senses
after she hit me.

803
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,919
I need to know

804
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,629
who she is.

805
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,966
Damn it.

806
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,396
YOON EUN-SUNG

807
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,191
Are you ready?

808
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,443
Hercyna's Due Diligence Team
will be here in five.

809
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,154
Yes, my people are already there.

810
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,364
I'm leaving now.

811
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,146
I was waiting for you.

812
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,648
Are you okay?

813
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,816
Yes, I'm fine.

814
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,404
We're running late.

815
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,908
Sorry, they must be waiting.

816
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,203
You don't look well.
Do you want to rest today?

817
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,079
We can reschedule.

818
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,040
No, there's no need.

819
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,376
Let's go.

820
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,004
Okay.

821
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,116
What's wrong?

822
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,243
Don't mind me.

823
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,010
Thanks.

824
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,638
Your face is still pale.

825
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,974
If you're sick--

826
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:21,891
I'm not.

827
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,353
But I wish I was, so I can rest.

828
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:47,584
Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming.
My name is Hong Hae-in.

829
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,716
Has Hae-in been getting
her medical checkups?

830
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,970
It's been a while
since she joined her family

831
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,638
with the checkups.

832
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,224
Maybe she's doing it elsewhere.

833
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,894
Please find out where.

834
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:07,812
Okay.

835
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:12,400
I think you should postpone
your trip to Germany.

836
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,694
Why? What for?

837
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:19,032
Your white blood cell count is too low.

838
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,534
They need to extract
and transform your cells

839
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,494
for the immune cell treatment.

840
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:27,206
But they can't do that
when your WBC is too low.

841
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,836
That laboratory in Germany
will refuse to do it with this result.

842
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,548
Are you telling me to give up then?

843
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,216
That's not what I mean.

844
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,511
You should wait until your WBC increases--

845
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,264
"Wait"?

846
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,226
I don't have time for that.

847
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,439
Wait, Ms. Hong.

848
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,073
Sir, I'm doing fine.

849
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,283
I barely feel any pain.

850
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:07,038
I would've found
this damn tumor sooner had I been in pain.

851
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,456
But…

852
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:21,427
I…

853
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,472
I came by for this cast.

854
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,226
By the way…

855
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,483
Why were you in there?

856
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,702
Do you know Mi-yeong?

857
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,078
Who's that?

858
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,371
My friend.

859
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,164
She also had a brain tumor.

860
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,709
It was about five years ago.

861
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,212
She called her friends over
and cried a river when she found out.

862
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,547
But what about her?

863
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,133
She's fine now.
She's the healthiest one among us.

864
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,427
She goes golfing all the time. She's well.

865
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,264
We have more than enough money.
Incurable illnesses don't exist anymore.

866
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,766
So don't you worry about a thing.

867
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:14,772
Aunt, I don't worry about getting better.
I'm just worried you'll tell others.

868
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,941
Does no one know?

869
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,526
Not even your husband?

870
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,737
Only he knows.

871
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,448
Really? I see.

872
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,203
Hey, it's fine as long as he knows.
It's nothing serious.

873
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,497
Exactly. It's not serious.

874
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,498
Aunt.

875
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,416
Yes?

876
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,417
I'm going to Germany.

877
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,378
Their lab found a new type
of treatment that can cure me.

878
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,963
That's why I came here today.

879
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:41,466
Really? Is that true?

880
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,218
So don't tell anyone.

881
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,887
Hey! I won't.

882
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,638
I don't want to cause a scene.

883
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,017
I'll trust you.

884
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,060
Yes, you can.

885
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,687
Aren't you leaving?

886
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,731
I should go now.

887
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,659
Hey.

888
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,912
I'm sure you were shocked.

889
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:17,043
I know it's nothing serious,
but I bet you were still shocked.

890
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,392
MI-YEONG

891
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,855
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

892
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:52,578
Suk-hui.

893
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,288
Did Mi-yeong change her number?

894
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:57,124
-Who?
-Mi-yeong. Jang Mi-yeong.

895
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,168
What? Didn't you hear?

896
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,381
Right. You were in jail.

897
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,842
Why? Did something happen to her?

898
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,051
She died.

899
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:08,803
She died?

900
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,179
Why?

901
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,974
What do you think? She relapsed.

902
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,936
Why?

903
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,897
I heard the surgery went well
and that she was fine.

904
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,818
I heard she golfed all the time,
so why did she die?

905
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:28,322
How would I know?
I guess it was a tough one to beat.

906
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,869
Why would she die?

907
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,039
Why would she?

908
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,166
Hey, are you crying?

909
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,211
Were you guys that close?

910
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,174
Why would she die?

911
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:59,228
In 2014, the royal family of Monaco
auctioned off their Napoleon relics

912
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,064
before repairing their palace.

913
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:07,737
This is the dress sword
Chairman Hong purchased at that auction.

914
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,196
Gosh.

915
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,450
This sword is worth
over three million dollars.

916
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,370
I've seen a similar sword
at a museum in London,

917
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,205
but not in a house.

918
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:21,626
Napoleon is my favorite figure.

919
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,962
Don't you think
it's a miracle that a country boy

920
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,714
from an island south of France

921
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:28,633
became an emperor?

922
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:34,430
I was dirt poor
and always hungry as a teenager.

923
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:38,100
That's when I came across
Napoleon's biography

924
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,435
and started dreaming.

925
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:43,356
He also overcame poverty
and achieved his dream.

926
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,733
You can do the same.

927
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:48,319
Dream big if you want
to become greatly successful.

928
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:49,862
Let's give him a hand.

929
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,355
I have Jacques-Louis David's portrait
of Napoleon

930
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:25,898
at my house in New York.

931
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:30,319
It's a painting of him
in his military uniform in 1813.

932
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,030
If I may, I'd like to gift it to you.

933
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:37,910
To me?

934
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,456
I feel like you deserve it.

935
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,752
You experienced a miracle
just like he did.

936
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,467
Right, when I first came to Seoul,

937
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,053
I was a shoeshiner
in front of a department store.

938
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,682
But now, I'm the owner
of that department store.

939
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,142
It's a miracle, isn't it?

940
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,226
Of course.

941
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,744
You're suddenly leaving
for Germany by yourself?

942
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,830
Why isn't Hyun-woo coming?

943
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:24,832
He's busy.

944
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:25,916
And this is nothing.

945
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:27,710
Should I come?

946
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,296
I just need my passport. I'll tag along.

947
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,506
-Aunt.
-Yes?

948
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,550
I prefer going alone.

949
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:36,927
I'll be fine.

950
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,361
Hyun-woo.

951
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,948
Why did Hae-in go to Germany by herself?

952
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,117
Sorry?

953
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,785
Didn't you know she left?

954
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:45,955
She said only you knew about her illness.

955
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,042
So why didn't you go?

956
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:54,088
She said only you had to know,
so why did she go alone?

957
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:56,799
Why did you let her go alone?

958
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:18,154
POWER OFF

959
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:33,919
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable…

960
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,798
HONG HAE-IN

961
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,988
Cheers!

962
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:06,327
I know a great stream in Gapyeong.

963
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,537
The lodging is great,
with water sports activities.

964
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,664
So let's go and have a barbecue.

965
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,749
That sounds nice.

966
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,959
Hold on. Let me invite everyone.

967
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:14,919
Yes, you should.

968
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,837
-I'll post it on our group chat.
-Okay.

969
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,507
Seok-jun is coming.

970
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,428
Dae-ho is canceling
his golf plans to come.

971
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,473
Is Cheol-seung crazy?
He wants to bring his wife?

972
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,099
What an idiot.

973
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:30,184
Blocked.

974
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,480
Are you listening?

975
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,732
-Of course.
-Then why aren't you excited?

976
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,069
No, I'm excited. I can't wait.

977
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:42,988
Barbecue. Oh, yeah.

978
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,074
Water sports. Got it.

979
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,326
This isn't right.

980
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,622
Where's the old Hyun-woo
who used to down three cups of espresso

981
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:55,209
to stay up all night partying
when his wife went abroad?

982
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:57,878
I'm here.

983
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,172
No, you're not here.

984
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,508
You're in Germany.

985
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,760
Why are you checking their weather?

986
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:06,804
Are you worried about your wife?

987
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,139
Of course not.

988
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,143
Did you try so hard to pretend to like her

989
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,145
that you actually fell in love?

990
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,064
No.

991
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:19,483
I suspected you
ever since the peanut cake incident.

992
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:21,402
-You're wrong.
-Right?

993
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:22,486
No, right?

994
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,989
Yes, get a grip.

995
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,116
Don't get too into it.

996
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,158
Okay?

997
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,160
All right! Let's do that again!

998
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:34,164
THE QUEEN

999
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:37,793
Yes, honey.

1000
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:39,503
It's not fun.

1001
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:41,797
This isn't fun at all.

1002
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,216
Of course not.

1003
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,180
Anyway, he's been a romantic ever since.

1004
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,934
That's how our love story began.

1005
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,770
Here's my last question.

1006
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,814
What is your dream?

1007
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:07,651
I'd have to say
surpassing one trillion won in sales

1008
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,278
at my department store.

1009
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:12,406
I'm working on it, and it'll happen soon.

1010
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,991
Congratulations in advance.

1011
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:15,742
What's your next dream?

1012
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:20,664
I guess I'll aim
for a higher number in sales.

1013
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,459
What about
after you achieve all your goals?

1014
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:26,545
I've never thought that far before.

1015
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:31,258
By then…

1016
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,012
I'd like to take a break.

1017
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,475
I'd like to travel with my husband.

1018
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,562
Our first and last trip was our honeymoon.

1019
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:46,148
I'd like to go

1020
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:47,900
on walks,

1021
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:51,069
drink tea, eat, chat,

1022
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:53,655
and do some catching up again.

1023
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,659
That'd be nice.

1024
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,373
I wish I could do that…

1025
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,418
every day.

1026
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:16,053
I wish I could do that…

1027
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,223
every day.

1028
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:51,898
Why do they all want me to wait?

1029
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,110
Why do they talk as if time is on my side?

1030
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:57,904
I don't have time.

1031
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,200
I don't.

1032
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,323
"No worries"?

1033
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:26,660
I'm already worried
about walking down these stairs.

1034
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,459
Why are there so many of them?

1035
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:51,643
Hong Hae-in!

1036
01:18:58,233 --> 01:18:59,234
What was that?

1037
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,864
Am I hearing things now?

1038
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:40,942
Didn't I tell you
to wear comfortable shoes?

1039
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:44,738
You really don't listen.

1040
01:19:58,752 --> 01:20:00,003
How did you know I was here?

1041
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:01,129
Your phone was off.

1042
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:04,007
They said you left the hospital
after being rejected.

1043
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:07,135
But Secretary Na said
you didn't catch a flight back.

1044
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,180
So I thought long and hard.

1045
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,892
And this place came to mind.

1046
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,771
You enjoyed our honeymoon here.

1047
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:19,773
You liked the name.

1048
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,696
I never said that.

1049
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,864
I said it was a lie.

1050
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,493
"A place of no worries or tears."

1051
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,663
They're just lying to lure tourists.

1052
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,585
You're the one who lied.

1053
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,797
-What did I do?
-Don't you remember?

1054
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,132
What did you say to me when you proposed?

1055
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,802
You promised not to make me cry.

1056
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:50,929
You told me to trust you.

1057
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:52,889
But guess what?

1058
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,308
I cried a lot during our marriage.

1059
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:58,019
I cried while driving,

1060
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,396
washing my face,

1061
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,314
and at the car wash.

1062
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,276
I liked sleeping separately

1063
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,237
since I could cry myself to sleep.

1064
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:12,909
Back then,

1065
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:16,788
I just said whatever so I could marry you.

1066
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:19,624
And now, we're married.

1067
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,211
So I should be…

1068
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:26,214
by your side

1069
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,342
at times like this.

1070
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,022
Did I ever tell you not to?

1071
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,150
I wanted you

1072
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:47,652
to be by my side.

1073
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,282
I didn't want to be alone.

1074
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,411
Ever.

1075
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,418
I'm sorry.

1076
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:10,008
I'm really sorry.

1077
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:29,569
Let's go home.

1078
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,075
I thought I'd find it here.

1079
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,162
A miraculous way to live.

1080
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,707
Or a place of no sadness.

1081
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:48,296
But there was none.

1082
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,091
All I wanted

1083
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:55,178
was to go home with you.

1084
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,783
I heard this is your lifeline.

1085
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:41,910
Why is mine so short?

1086
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:43,036
I'm offended.

1087
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:53,630
Is this

1088
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:56,299
short?

1089
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:05,558
I guess…

1090
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,478
it kind of is.

1091
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,039
How about this much?

1092
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:35,338
About this much.

1093
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:05,535
QUEEN OF TEARS

1094
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:36,316
I'm truly blessed with a good husband.

1095
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:39,277
-Can I sleep in your room?
-Just sleep wherever you want.

1096
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,487
Do as you want. Follow your heart.

1097
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,239
Unbelievable.

1098
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,950
Why would you
when she's already so strong?

1099
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,078
Stop being greedy if you've had it
for that long, you scumbag!

1100
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,788
Yongdu-ri has become famous.

1101
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:54,250
A relationship
is bound to crumble with a secret.

1102
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,794
-I just saw someone.
-Hae-in!

1103
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,838
When you're about to die…

1104
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:00,882
Maybe he came

1105
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:02,884
because it's time.

1106
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,600
