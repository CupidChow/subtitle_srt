1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,654
Tell me this isn't true.

3
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,034
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

4
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,786
Say it.

5
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,121
Deny it.

6
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,333
-Hae-in--
-Say it.

7
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,251
Tell me it's not true.

8
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,839
Tell me it wasn't you.

9
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,352
No.

10
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,648
It was me.

11
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,153
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

12
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,756
When?

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,592
When…

14
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,346
When did you prepare this?

15
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,434
I have…

16
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,772
something to say.

17
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,983
Was it

18
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,860
that day?

19
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,530
The day I told you I was dying?

20
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,827
Yes.

21
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,547
Is that why

22
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,507
you kept

23
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,385
your mouth shut

24
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,929
and didn't tell me?

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,432
Because I was going to die soon anyway?

26
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,934
Yes.

27
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,533
So…

28
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,788
you lied all along?

29
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,675
What's wrong?

30
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,137
You've lied through your teeth.

31
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,433
So what's stopping you now?

32
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,865
I found it…

33
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,869
on my way here.

34
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,832
Our lock is still here.

35
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,644
Hae-in.

36
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,908
It's too late to go anywhere.

37
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,333
Stay here. I'll go.

38
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,668
Just…

39
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,171
let me be.

40
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,424
I don't even have

41
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,927
the energy to get mad.

42
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,806
Just hear me out.

43
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,894
I'll tell you why I did that,

44
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,687
what I was feeling,

45
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,689
and what my plan was.

46
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,071
No, forget it.

47
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,656
I'm not curious.

48
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,658
I love you, Hong Hae-in.

49
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,577
I love you.

50
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,839
Are you okay?

51
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,834
What are you doing here?

52
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,213
Don't you know you should be more careful?

53
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,055
Let's go inside.

54
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,975
I'll explain everything.

55
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,853
And then,

56
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,105
I'll do as you say.

57
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,691
-So--
-Hyun-woo.

58
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,909
If this ever happens again,

59
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,581
don't save me.

60
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,416
I'm so shocked.

61
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,376
Hyun-woo was normal.

62
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,752
What do you mean?

63
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,171
I thought he'd been out of his mind lately

64
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,507
since he seemed to truly love Hae-in.

65
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,594
But he was just like any other guy.

66
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,220
I was surprised too.

67
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,056
Who knew he was planning
to divorce her in secret?

68
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,854
-I wonder when it all began.
-What?

69
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,732
Someone must've encouraged him.

70
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,650
I've been suspecting someone too.

71
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,735
Who?

72
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,616
My aunt.

73
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,451
I see.

74
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,203
What?

75
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,957
She's been getting in my way
and talking nonsense lately

76
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,376
about Hyun-woo
being more handsome than me.

77
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,008
Recently, it seemed like
those two were sharing a secret.

78
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,468
I saw them last time.

79
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,596
The biggest priority of this business…

80
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,768
-What's going on?
-So why didn't you go?

81
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,061
Why did she go alone?

82
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,814
Why did you let her go alone?

83
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,524
-Send who alone?
-Why?

84
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,613
What? Why is she crying?

85
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,242
They were having a serious talk in secret.

86
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,827
Really?

87
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,829
I wonder what it's about.

88
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,320
Where are you going?

89
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,281
The treatment fell through, so what?

90
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,993
What he means is that we need time.

91
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,745
Let's go back to Korea,
raise your WBC, then return--

92
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,456
You're despicable.

93
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:34,420
I know you're happy that I'm dying
and have given up everything.

94
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,635
You've given up everything?

95
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,004
So you won't bother trying anymore?

96
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,927
What about a lawsuit?

97
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,597
I'd be grateful if you divorced me

98
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,807
without filing a suit.

99
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,730
-What?
-You know everything now.

100
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,149
So?

101
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,694
You wouldn't let me go that easily.

102
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,657
It was unbearable to live with you anyway.

103
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,119
Don't act like you had no idea, Hae-in.

104
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,206
You know what kind of person you are.

105
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,085
No wonder I chose to do so.

106
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,798
I could've lived
a comfortable and wealthy life,

107
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,883
so why did I want to run away?

108
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,349
Because I hated living with you
more than anything!

109
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,396
Hey.

110
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,732
-Baek Hyun-woo.
-Yes, you're right.

111
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,401
I'll be honest.

112
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,487
When I heard that you'd be dying soon,

113
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,491
I was relieved deep down.

114
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,620
We'd have a clean divorce
if I put up with you

115
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,289
for the next three months.

116
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,166
But I got caught.

117
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,379
Everything's ruined.

118
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,344
So if you choose

119
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,223
not to take any action at all
and just divorce me,

120
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,768
then honestly,

121
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,812
I'd be grateful.

122
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,192
Will you do that?

123
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,990
What should I do?

124
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,993
Should I pack up and leave once we return?

125
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,453
Or…

126
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:17,207
If I continue to grovel at your feet,
will you revise your will?

127
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,093
Are you sure you can handle this?

128
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,099
Do you think you can handle my rage?

129
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,897
Then bring it on!

130
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,150
What will you do?

131
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,694
Do something if you can!

132
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,852
Mr. Song has gone through
his first round of interrogations,

133
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:23,357
but our attorneys doubt
that the prosecution will stop here.

134
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,943
If that's how
the prosecution will proceed,

135
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,113
then it'll only be a matter of time
until they summon you.

136
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,490
Look at this mess we're in
thanks to Hyun-woo.

137
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,035
I'm worried about them summoning you.

138
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,204
You need to take your medications on time.

139
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,206
Then you can go instead.

140
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,041
-Sorry?
-What's wrong?

141
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:45,754
I was behind bars for ten months
when I was Soo-cheol's age.

142
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,007
Gosh.

143
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,676
If only I was as young as Soo-cheol.

144
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,809
Why are you looking at me?

145
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,356
This is an experience
that you can't even buy with money.

146
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,566
I'm not interested.

147
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:10,195
If you appear in his stead,
people will think you're the heir.

148
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,281
But if you don't,
they'll think you're terrible.

149
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,199
I have a family to protect.

150
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,076
And so do I.

151
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,037
Yes, that's me. You should protect me.

152
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,538
What are you saying?

153
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,789
Be quiet!

154
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,586
The problem is that we have
an important investment deal coming up.

155
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,922
If the investors find out,
the deal might fall through.

156
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,467
He's right, sir.
We should hasten the deal.

157
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,344
We have a whole feast
prepared in front of us

158
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,013
that could be taken by Chairman Yeom.

159
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,390
The reporters
will find out sooner or later.

160
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,561
Mr. Yoon will opt out immediately then.
And that's what Chairman Yeom wants.

161
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,898
First, we need to secure the deal.

162
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:48,901
Grandfather!

163
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,289
QUEENS MART ENTERS NEW RESORT BUSINESS

164
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,752
Once the construction begins,

165
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,422
we'll insinuate the licensing issue
related to altitude restrictions

166
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,174
to the investors.

167
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,677
Then the investors and stock firms
who gave out loans

168
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,638
will choose the pre-payment option.

169
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,641
Soo-cheol, that coward, will be shocked.

170
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,809
He might even cry.

171
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,271
That's when I'll offer
to invest the amount

172
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,691
that the investors have pulled out
and suggest convertible bonds.

173
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,652
And this is when
the prosecution will investigate?

174
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,653
Correct.

175
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,656
Once the embezzlement news gets out
and the Hong family goes to jail,

176
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,034
I'll use the convertible bonds
to purchase Queens' stocks.

177
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,497
Then I'll combine that with the 4.9%
that I previously purchased

178
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,208
and become the biggest shareholder.

179
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,588
Everything is panning out.

180
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,174
Even Hyun-woo is out of the picture now.

181
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,428
Who knew we'd find
the divorce papers at this perfect timing?

182
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,347
Did Hyun-woo admit to it?

183
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,057
Did he sign the divorce papers?

184
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,685
Why bother asking? Of course, it was him.

185
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,020
How could he do this?

186
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,771
Why do you even wonder?

187
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,565
They should just divorce.

188
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:55,527
He bugged your room
and gave the tapes to the prosecution.

189
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,362
But I can look past them.

190
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,530
Why would you?

191
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,284
Our family is awfully tolerant
of their parents' sufferings.

192
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,494
One thing I don't understand

193
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,790
is that the scumbag
wanted to divorce her first.

194
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,751
That's the one thing I understand.

195
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,128
I'm sure there's someone.

196
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,631
Perhaps, a mistress.

197
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,550
-Father, I'll look into it.
-No.

198
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,428
-The Audit Team will.
-They will?

199
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,848
He'll leave Queens after the divorce.
I need to find out before then.

200
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,602
I'll look through his computer,
financial documents, phone, and account.

201
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,853
I'll track his funds.

202
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,023
I'll find out whom he met
and what he's been up to.

203
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,943
The moment I find
any embezzlement or illegal act,

204
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,238
I will report him
and file a claim for damages.

205
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,575
-You'll go that far?
-Yes, I will.

206
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,999
I'll take care of it,
so please don't get in the way.

207
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,719
She sure is merciless.

208
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,306
I said I'd pick you up at the airport.

209
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,307
Are you okay?

210
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,559
Hey, are you hurt?

211
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,687
Can you hear me?

212
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,108
Your eardrums can pop when you get beaten.
It happens to many of my clients.

213
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,901
Can you hear me?

214
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,486
That's enough.

215
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,155
So you're okay. You're fine.

216
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,157
Gosh. Well done.

217
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,910
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

218
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,128
You should've feigned innocence
since you were acting anyway.

219
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,713
"The divorce papers are nothing.

220
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,007
I was just practicing
to become a divorce attorney."

221
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,426
Couldn't you have improvised?

222
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,846
She must be livid.
I bet she's even more terrifying now.

223
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,223
I bet you're dispirited.

224
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,433
AVAILABLE FOR MONTHLY RENT

225
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,727
You worked so hard
pretending to be in love.

226
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,186
You must feel hopeless now.

227
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,022
You're wrong.

228
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,815
-What do you mean?
-She wasn't mad.

229
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,066
-No?
-No.

230
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,528
And I don't feel hopeless.

231
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,990
-I'm upset.
-Hey.

232
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,783
You're in no position to feel that way.

233
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,076
Hae-in cried.

234
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,703
She did.

235
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,164
And it drove me insane

236
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,584
seeing her crying.

237
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,920
What in the world…

238
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,883
did I do to her?

239
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,139
What's with him?

240
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:32,309
I thought he couldn't stand
being next to her.

241
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,561
Does he have feelings for her or what?

242
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,898
So what's your next move?

243
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,691
-What move?
-Do you have no plan?

244
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,569
She's probably planning something.

245
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,112
Of course, she is.

246
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,574
You upset her big time,
so I bet she's thinking of the best way

247
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,867
to take revenge.

248
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,910
Exactly.

249
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,079
-She should.
-What do you mean?

250
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,582
She needs that motivation.
She needs to focus on something.

251
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,960
So you purposely let her focus
on ruining your life?

252
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,295
Are you a sacrifice?

253
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,256
Are you a soldier
running into a losing battle?

254
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,758
If this ever happens again,

255
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,927
don't save me.

256
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,388
This is the only way she'll live.

257
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,034
Hyun-woo.

258
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,453
Why did you do it?

259
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,206
I'm on my way to see your grandfather.
Let's talk later.

260
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,290
It'll be me anyway.

261
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,752
-What do you mean?
-Try all you want.

262
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,004
But the heir will always be me!

263
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,009
Do you still not get it?

264
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,512
Were you that jealous of me
that you'd bug his room?

265
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,598
Did you want to know
all the conversations that we were having?

266
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,058
No, I didn't.

267
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,060
-I didn't bug his room.
-I get it.

268
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,353
Get what?

269
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,648
I knew you were up to something
when you put up

270
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,108
with everything Hae-in did.

271
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,485
But what now? You got caught.

272
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,243
I was planning to give you something
once this resort deal became a success.

273
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,037
"I should set up a branch
in Yufuin or Cancún

274
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,331
and send him there.

275
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,500
No, Yufuin is too near.

276
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,752
Hae-in would just need to fly an hour.

277
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,880
He should go to Cancún
if he wants freedom."

278
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,299
That's how much I cared about you.

279
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,262
What?

280
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,347
You need to halt the resort construction.

281
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,434
The consulting firm
that Mr. Yoon introduced

282
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:41,771
predicted an annual profit of 500 billion,
but the actual figure was 89 billion won.

283
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,191
That's less than 20%. Isn't that odd?

284
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,152
You signed the contract
even before the validity test--

285
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,196
You're trying to get in the way again!

286
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,532
Stop worrying about my success.

287
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,582
Don't forget! It'll be me!

288
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,841
I'm sorry for worrying you.

289
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,218
Okay, do explain.

290
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,637
Why did you hide the divorce papers?

291
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,348
Were you going to surprise us
with it later on?

292
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,684
Is that why you've been nitpicking
my words and disobeying me?

293
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,228
Just because of those papers?

294
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,440
Sir, the chairman wants to see you.

295
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,524
Okay.

296
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,443
Please leave all your electronics outside.

297
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,986
Yes, do so.

298
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,696
You could be recording even now.

299
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,870
Come in.

300
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,593
What did Chairman Yeom promise you?

301
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,512
-Sorry?
-The divorce.

302
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,764
I couldn't care less about it.

303
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,266
You chose to ruin your luck.

304
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,767
I'm sorry.

305
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,144
But if you bugged my room

306
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,648
and Chairman Yeom handed it over
to the prosecution,

307
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,024
I won't allow that.

308
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:11,403
Did you scheme
Mr. Song's embezzlement too?

309
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,238
Were you targeting me?

310
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,741
It's true that the embezzlement
was targeted at you.

311
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,410
Are you playing smart with me?

312
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,996
I'm asking if you were behind it!

313
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,046
Director Jo Hyeon-myeong approved
Mr. Song's embezzlement files.

314
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,882
The man next to him has been in charge
of Queens' external audit.

315
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,385
He's Hwang Byeong-u
who has his own accounting firm.

316
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,762
-They went to the same university.
-So what?

317
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,807
He's been doing yearly audits,

318
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,310
so it's odd
that he found no issues until now.

319
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,686
Has his accounting firm

320
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,814
truly been unaware of Mr. Song's
embezzlement for the past five years?

321
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:03,830
So you're telling me
that Jo Hyeon-myeong schemed with his firm

322
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,250
and turned a blind eye
to the embezzlement?

323
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,169
So that I'd be investigated?

324
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,337
No, sir.

325
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,465
Director Jo didn't do this alone.
Someone ordered him.

326
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:20,388
I believe that individual bugged your room
and planted the transmitter in mine.

327
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,223
And who is this person?

328
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,105
I haven't found out yet.

329
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,148
What?

330
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,316
You're not even sure,

331
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:36,196
yet you want me to believe you
after what you did to my granddaughter?

332
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,530
Do you?

333
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,531
Director Jo.

334
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,034
You should hurry.

335
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,873
Why? Because Baek Hyun-woo is after you.

336
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,719
ESTIMATED ASSETS
2,386,690

337
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,101
Are you doing stocks again?

338
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,477
The market is a mess.

339
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,357
It doesn't matter how blue it gets
as long as my baby is red.

340
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,317
QUEENS DEPARTMENT STORE

341
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,820
-It's red.
-What is it?

342
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,405
-Who's your baby?
-No.

343
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,281
-Come on. Tell me.
-No.

344
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,283
No!

345
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,285
Stop that!

346
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,870
Are you crazy?

347
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,997
You bought Queens' stocks?

348
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,958
Mom will kill me, so be quiet!

349
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,377
Why would you buy them?

350
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,298
I had them in the past, but I sold them.

351
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,343
-When?
-When Hyun-woo mentioned the divorce.

352
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,596
I couldn't ignore the owner's risk.

353
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,851
Nothing good would've come out
of the media mentioning their divorce.

354
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,728
How sly of you.

355
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,231
Then you bought them again
when Hyun-woo decided not to divorce?

356
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,233
Right. Check this out.

357
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,110
-It's going up, right?
-Jeez.

358
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,071
Mom.

359
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,491
It's unlike you to take a nap.

360
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,784
I had a bad dream.

361
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,495
-Gosh.
-What was it about?

362
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,705
It was ambiguous.

363
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,249
What was it?
Maybe it was a conception dream.

364
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,208
Hyun-woo's a dad?

365
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,294
It wasn't anything cute like that.

366
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,513
MOM

367
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,062
-Hello?
-Hello?

368
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,107
Isn't this Mr. Baek Hyun-woo's phone?

369
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,567
Yes, it is.

370
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
I'm Hae-in's mother.

371
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,197
Hello, Ms. Kim. How have you been?

372
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,784
I guess Hyun-woo left his phone behind.

373
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,619
-But why are you--
-Yes.

374
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,330
He's speaking with my father-in-law.

375
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,041
I don't know if you know,

376
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,668
but Hyun-woo
turned our family upside down.

377
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,086
What? What happened?

378
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,464
My father-in-law's room was bugged…

379
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,676
Forget it.

380
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,137
Did you know Hyun-woo wanted a divorce?

381
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,017
He did mention it before.

382
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,021
But it's normal for a married couple
to go through rough patches.

383
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,524
I thought they had resolved it.

384
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,275
She knows about the divorce.

385
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,735
Look…

386
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,572
You should hear them out first.

387
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,533
You told me not to get in their way

388
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,368
on the day they got married.

389
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,163
But you see,
I will make sure they part ways.

390
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,623
So don't get in my way.

391
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,335
Mom, what did she say?

392
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,420
What do I do?

393
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,800
Goodness. What do I do?

394
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,593
Unbelievable.

395
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,305
Mom.

396
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,353
It must be a mess.

397
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,981
What if he really gets a divorce?

398
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,239
You bastard.

399
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,324
SELL

400
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,534
YOUR ORDER IS COMPLETE

401
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,120
I sold them.

402
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,831
It's nothing complicated.

403
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,667
Just do what they did with the apples.

404
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,336
Ms. Hong can take a bite
of your pear and say,

405
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,464
"Gosh, that's sweet."
That's all she needs to do.

406
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,966
I should ask her for help again?

407
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,051
She was supposed to help us.

408
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,429
They're the ones who took advantage of it.

409
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,015
What's your take on this?

410
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,850
It's already incredible

411
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,811
that she made time
to come down here and flex.

412
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,314
And you want to ask her for help again?

413
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,399
It won't be easy.

414
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,735
-Exactly.
-You'll lose face.

415
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,278
Right?

416
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,740
Then will you let
Park Seok-hun take everything?

417
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:52,160
You're always so extreme.

418
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,703
Are you an INFP?

419
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,707
What do you mean? I'm Park Chun-sik.

420
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,793
I'm talking about your goals.
Will you do anything to reach them?

421
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,503
Or does the process matter more?

422
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,881
INFP or ENFJ.

423
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,803
In that case…

424
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,680
I'm an INFP.

425
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,184
Then feed her some pears
and tell her to comment on it.

426
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,603
First, we need to remove
the video of her eating the apple.

427
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,772
If you don't want enemies
stealing your food,

428
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,108
-don't set the table in front of them.
-That does make sense.

429
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,403
Dad, why haven't you been picking up?

430
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,239
It's out of battery. I'm glad you're here.

431
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,909
Take down that video of Hae-in
eating the apple.

432
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,035
I already have.

433
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,329
That's not the issue. I have bad news.

434
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,413
What is it?

435
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,708
Gosh.

436
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,962
You'll all find out eventually.

437
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,299
Hyun-woo…

438
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,261
Goodness. What do we do?

439
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,680
They're getting a divorce?

440
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,015
Hyeon-tae, do you have any anxiety pills?

441
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,851
-Of course not.
-That's not the problem.

442
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,478
He should overcome it.

443
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,313
Damn it!

444
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,067
Is this entertaining for you?

445
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,238
You see, I'd like to use Dr. Oh's solution
in this situation.

446
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,824
It was Episode 58,
the one with Nancy Lang.

447
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,952
Dr. Oh mentioned three steps
to overcome hardships in life.

448
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,996
-I saw it but forgot.
-Step one.

449
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,955
Acknowledgement.

450
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,375
Accurately assess the current crisis.

451
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,545
Did they hand in the divorce papers?

452
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,422
I don't think so.

453
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,258
Step two. Self-awareness.

454
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,887
Find out how bad the situation is
and how much worse it could get.

455
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,432
Were there any articles or tabloids?

456
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,685
Not yet. But it'll only be
a matter of time, right?

457
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,769
Of course.

458
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,772
And lastly, sorting it out.

459
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,234
Decide what you'll give up on
and what you'll keep. Then act on it.

460
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,240
Who cares about the election anymore?

461
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,450
Forget it.

462
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,495
-Where are you going?
-Where's your mom?

463
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,998
She just left.
I don't know where she went.

464
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,960
Did you have to mention
the election right now?

465
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,045
Sorry.

466
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,379
I'm an INTP.

467
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,552
YONGDU-RI SUPERMARKET

468
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,638
What is he talking about?

469
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,142
Hyun-woo's mom knew everything
and lied to us.

470
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,312
How dare they upload that video
of Hae-in when she knew nothing?

471
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,105
Calm down.

472
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,899
Be calm as her mom.

473
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,609
Imagine how Hae-in must feel.

474
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,028
Seon-hwa!

475
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,529
What's going on?

476
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,073
Did Hyun-woo really do that?

477
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,658
You were always defending him.

478
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,077
What did I tell you?

479
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,331
You're such a poor judge of character.
No wonder you're always betrayed.

480
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,500
Don't blame me.

481
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,130
You'll always be duped
if someone is determined to trick you.

482
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,509
Why shouldn't I tell anyone?

483
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,636
That bitch has been deceiving us
for over 20 years!

484
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,678
Exactly.

485
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,473
That just proves how savage she is.

486
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,517
If you don't have proof,

487
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,977
she'll just deny it
and turn you into a fool.

488
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,940
Let's be patient. She has a son,
so she must be sending him money.

489
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,233
Let's find him first.

490
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,777
In the meantime,
keep your temper under control.

491
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,654
You must.

492
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,996
I wouldn't be able to relate
since I'm not a mom.

493
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,667
But then again,
I guess the same goes for you.

494
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,005
You don't need to be a mom to relate.

495
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,591
I can imagine how she must feel.

496
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,261
Still, think twice about the divorce.

497
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,470
I know times have changed,

498
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,807
but Hae-in will suffer
more than him if they divorce.

499
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,142
Take her for example.

500
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,062
Why are you looking at me?

501
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,149
Unlike her ex-husbands
who have all happily remarried,

502
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,817
Beom-ja is still single.

503
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,068
What do you mean?

504
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,112
I remarried right away too.

505
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,030
And you divorced just as quickly.

506
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,161
Seon-hwa, that's not
the problem right now.

507
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,912
Where's Hae-in? What's she doing?

508
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,207
Gosh, she's already struggling as is.

509
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,004
She's already struggling?
Is something going on with her?

510
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,047
No.

511
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,134
She's just a workaholic.

512
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,054
She needs to take a breather. Damn it.

513
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,055
Jeez.

514
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,683
What is she saying?

515
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,651
There. I signed it too.

516
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,030
But it's up to me
when I'll submit it and how.

517
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,950
Okay.

518
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,953
I can finally understand why

519
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,622
my aunt beat her ex-husbands
to a pulp before the divorce.

520
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,959
I'll hire much more competent attorneys
than she did.

521
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,461
You won't leave this house unscathed.

522
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,505
You will be kicked out mercilessly.

523
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,466
Okay.

524
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,219
I get it.

525
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,022
But please keep your distance
from Yoon Eun-sung.

526
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,235
What's it to you?

527
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,571
He was out of touch for a long time
then suddenly appeared.

528
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,700
Then he gifted Soo-cheol and you
a hefty investment

529
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,201
and the Hercyna deal.

530
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,995
He must have a motive.

531
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,038
-He's suspicious too.
-How so?

532
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,128
There was dashcam footage
of the hunting ground incident.

533
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,755
I gave the SD card
to a data restoring company.

534
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,550
Mr. Yoon visited them,
and the owner has disappeared.

535
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,766
So? How does that prove anything?

536
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,477
He could've simply been another client.

537
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,980
And even if he has
something up his sleeve,

538
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,982
he won't fool me that easily.

539
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,025
But I did.

540
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,825
Just don't make the same mistake.

541
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,436
We've prepared pine mushroom porridge
for breakfast.

542
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,812
-Would you like some?
-No.

543
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,731
I want beef.

544
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,796
Ms. Hong's diamond necklace blinded me.

545
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,466
We have a peacock at large.

546
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,093
-Brace yourselves.
-Yes, ma'am.

547
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,887
I'm sorry, but what peacock?

548
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,306
Right. You're a newbie here.

549
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,766
How did Ms. Hong look?

550
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,767
Gorgeous.

551
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,852
That's true.

552
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,064
Okay, just remember this.

553
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,275
The more upset she is,
the fancier she dresses.

554
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,736
She looked like a fabulous peacock today.

555
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,405
It means we're all dead meat.

556
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,574
Then what should we do?

557
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,825
There's…

558
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,243
no solution.

559
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,498
Natural disasters and Ms. Hong's moodiness
are two things humans can't control.

560
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,716
Gosh, I'm sorry!

561
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,593
I'll reprint these documents and--

562
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,011
It's okay.

563
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,555
Sorry?

564
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,514
What did you…

565
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,142
It's okay.
It's not a life-or-death situation.

566
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,186
Don't feel so bad about spilling.

567
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,229
It's okay. You may go.

568
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,150
Ms. Hong, are you very upset?

569
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,489
No, I have something
that enrages me much more.

570
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,407
This is nothing.

571
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,326
Look.

572
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,830
Even this sloppy report

573
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,708
doesn't enrage me.

574
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,006
She was so terrifying even when not mad.

575
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,425
I wonder what she's enraged about.

576
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,180
We're from the Audit Team.

577
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,641
We're conducting an investigation

578
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,477
after receiving a report
on the illegal use of expenses.

579
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,938
Please stand up.

580
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,732
Do not shred any documents.

581
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,860
Do not destroy or move anything.

582
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,584
Gosh, this is total bloodshed.

583
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,878
Has the Hong-Baek Battle begun once again?

584
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,213
This will be a disaster.

585
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,673
Let's go.

586
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,058
-All of them?
-Yes.

587
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,726
-You're going to reject them?
-Yes.

588
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,437
But you already confirmed them
before going to Germany.

589
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,647
I know.

590
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,692
-All of them?
-Yes.

591
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,443
She rejected them all.

592
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,487
It usually lasts a week.

593
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,823
The duration isn't the problem
this time around.

594
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,950
The intensity is on another level.

595
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,786
What in the world happened in Germany?

596
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,788
Let's share their schedules.

597
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,290
Don't let them run into each other.

598
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,460
What? The lunch meeting.
We're having sushi at J Hotel too.

599
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,255
Change it. I'll follow
your schedule for the elevator rides.

600
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,506
Okay.

601
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,426
BAEK HYUN-WOO

602
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,019
QUEENS DEPARTMENT STORE INC.

603
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,147
"We have already reviewed the contracts
for the soon-to-be-closed stores,

604
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,064
so you can proceed.

605
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,984
We have already discussed this,
so you cannot change it.

606
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,987
You'll have to pay triple
the penalty fee if you do.

607
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,655
Please approve it so we can proceed.

608
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,032
Goodbye then."

609
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,619
That's what he said.

610
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,625
"The Legal Team can take care
of penalty issues. I can't approve this.

611
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,627
Shouldn't you have come up

612
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,463
with different scenarios
regarding the possible issues,

613
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,965
run simulations,
and then reported them to me? Again."

614
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,468
That's what she said.

615
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,096
-How feisty.
-Sorry?

616
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,724
Never mind.

617
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,227
Aren't we having sushi at J Hotel today?

618
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,395
Let's go.

619
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,358
How about the Chinese restaurant instead?

620
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,652
Why?

621
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,780
It'd cost a lot for all of us
to have sushi omakase.

622
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,783
It's okay. It's my treat.

623
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,786
I know how hard you've been working.

624
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,207
Let's just have Chinese, sir.

625
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,168
Their sweet
and sour pork lunch set is delicious.

626
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,628
Why all of a sudden?

627
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,630
Is there another reason?

628
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,340
No, not at all.

629
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,134
They all prefer to have Chinese instead.

630
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,058
What's with Mr. Kim's face?

631
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,185
He's going to kill us if we choose sushi.

632
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,188
I bet it's because Ms. Hong
is going there.

633
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,982
I think Mr. Baek caught onto it.
I thought he loved jajangmyeon.

634
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,192
This is entertaining.

635
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,362
I don't care what we have.
I just want to watch the rich argue.

636
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,279
ME TOO
ME TOO

637
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,159
The Owl has switched to Chinese.

638
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,287
Okay. The Eagle is headed
to the elevator in Building A.

639
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,500
The Owl is headed to Building B.

640
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,007
It's running late. Let's go to Building B.

641
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,844
But it'll be here soon.

642
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,931
The Eagle has changed course.
Approaching Building B in three minutes.

643
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,395
Should we walk instead?

644
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,149
-It's very healthy to take the stairs.
-Not if you're going down.

645
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,072
Emergency.

646
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,658
Ms. Hong is coming this way! Help!

647
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,962
I'm in the chatroom too.

648
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,674
I'm sorry.

649
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,562
You guys must be eating out together.

650
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,522
You must not have much to do.

651
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,150
I'm treating them
since they have a lot of work.

652
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,401
Sure.

653
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,944
You should do better.

654
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,530
And while you're at it,
give me an analysis report

655
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,115
on the cases you've repeatedly lost

656
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,160
in the past three years
and find out how to improve.

657
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,662
Yes, ma'am.

658
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,372
But when you review it,

659
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,460
I hope you leave out
any personal feelings you have.

660
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,878
I guess you didn't know.

661
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,296
I'm pretty much an AI

662
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,840
when it comes to work,
so don't worry about that.

663
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,550
Is that so? I didn't know.

664
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,927
That ignorance of yours

665
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,721
is the reason
why you keep losing those cases.

666
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,584
Should we take the stairs?

667
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,919
-Sure.
-Let's go.

668
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,513
Did you read the news?

669
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,348
NSFA's new biotechnology was fabricated?

670
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,726
-We invested in them.
-Did you use your shares as collateral?

671
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,354
It was impossible
to get the money in cash.

672
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,357
I even signed
a foreclosure agreement with the bank.

673
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,192
Me too.

674
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,988
What if the bank confiscates our shares?

675
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,448
Can you reach Director Jo?

676
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,120
Gosh, it's sad to see you leave.

677
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,415
-People grow on me so easily.
-Stay healthy.

678
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,166
Your kids will be happy to see you.

679
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,460
Even more so since you're rich now.

680
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,006
I'm starting afresh,
so I'm going to do many good deeds

681
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,048
and help others.

682
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,593
Sure.

683
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,387
The statute of limitations

684
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,390
for financial fraud
of 100 million or more is 25 years.

685
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,059
You can't help others if you're in prison.

686
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,603
So don't get caught.

687
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,441
You bet. I'll stay far away
from Korean marts and restaurants.

688
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,692
I'll live well.

689
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,612
Goodbye then.

690
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,033
What a filthy scumbag.

691
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,537
How is he so brazen after sucking
his long-time colleagues dry?

692
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,083
Goodbye. Go on.

693
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,422
What a dirt bag.

694
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,858
SUNGMIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

695
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,953
BAEK HYUN-WOO

696
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,591
Hae-in.

697
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,984
Contact Sungmin Medical Center.
I need to check something.

698
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,573
Goodness, Mr. Baek.

699
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,701
How have you been? What brings you here?

700
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,619
I had a question.

701
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,247
Do you recognize this watch?

702
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,415
I see.

703
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:05,293
It's a limited edition
for Ronde de Frédic's 101st anniversary.

704
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,087
-Only 101 of them were made.
-I see.

705
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,965
But this one is preordered.

706
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,633
Do you see this yellow diamond?

707
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:15,887
This diamond was only added to the dials
of the ten preordered watches.

708
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,974
I know it's a lot to ask,

709
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,727
but may I know
who bought those ten watches?

710
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,937
Sure, I can help you.

711
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,941
You helped my mom resolve
the medical malpractice incident.

712
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,569
I'm close with HQ's team leader.

713
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,945
Don't worry.

714
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:32,904
Thank you.

715
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,573
I'll turn now.

716
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,741
Look far ahead.

717
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,908
-Slowly.
-Good.

718
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,910
Straighten your back.

719
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,454
Step on the pedal. That's it.

720
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,373
Good, turn. Yes, slowly.

721
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,293
Slowly. That was good.

722
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,335
Turn smoothly.

723
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,087
-Like this?
-Yes, that's right.

724
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,381
-You're doing great.
-Okay.

725
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,428
You're terrific.
Are you really a beginner?

726
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,723
I don't need these extra wheels,
but he kept insisting.

727
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,601
You know him, right?
He's a bronze medalist.

728
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,978
-Yes.
-I should listen to the pro.

729
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,938
Everyone uses
the training wheels at first.

730
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,483
I'd be flying without them.

731
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,276
Watch me.

732
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:15,030
-I'll go faster.
-Okay, but relax.

733
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,907
Slowly. That's it.

734
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,450
-Like this?
-That's right.

735
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,076
Go in a straight line.

736
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,705
Are you okay?

737
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,291
Goodness, my son! Soo-cheol!

738
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,210
Oh, dear!

739
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,212
You're bleeding!

740
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,798
Why didn't you guys stop him?

741
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,299
Why would they need to?

742
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:38,637
Can't you see all this dirt and cement?
Why would you ride here? It's dangerous.

743
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,223
-Don't ride this.
-Come on, Mom!

744
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:48,104
Skateboards, bicycles,
skis, rollerblades, and kick scooters.

745
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,067
I can't ride any of them because of you.

746
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,654
You didn't even let me ride steep slides,
so I've had no experience.

747
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,572
Because you might fall--

748
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,199
Exactly. I've never fallen before.

749
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,493
That's right.

750
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,162
Now, do you understand
how much I doted on you?

751
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,248
Why must you fall?

752
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,582
Mom.

753
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,917
As his dad,

754
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,379
I should at least teach Geon-u
how to ride a bicycle.

755
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,465
So it's just to teach
your son how to ride?

756
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,550
-That's why?
-Yes.

757
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,759
I'm going to teach him

758
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,429
how to ride bicycles,
rollerblades, kick scooters,

759
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,599
skateboards, and skis.

760
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,687
You can just hire someone to teach him.

761
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,690
Why would you
put yourself in danger like that?

762
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,401
Dads are supposed
to teach their kids these things.

763
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:35,986
I'll begin.

764
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,698
-All right.
-No, Soo-cheol. You'll fall.

765
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,868
-Soo-cheol--
-Mr. Kim, move the car!

766
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,452
-Mom, come on.
-Get off.

767
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,330
Move the car, or I'll crash into it.

768
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,832
Hello?

769
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,084
Hello, this is Kevin from Manhattan.

770
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,085
Hello.

771
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:56,172
It's about the Upper West Side apartment.
The owner wants to sell it.

772
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,428
That's great.

773
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,807
Then I'll proceed. The contract
will be valid until the end of the month.

774
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,893
Will you be here by then?

775
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,687
You need to sign it yourself.

776
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,318
I'll be there in two weeks.

777
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,863
Ma'am, there's something odd
I found out about Mr. Baek.

778
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,239
What is it?

779
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,868
He kept calling a woman's name
on the rooftop garden.

780
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:25,911
A woman's name?

781
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,885
Yeong-suk.

782
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:48,892
Yeong-suk?

783
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:54,522
Yeong--

784
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,614
Come out if you're here.

785
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,075
Her name is Yeong-suk.

786
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,286
Oh, that?

787
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,830
He keeps telling her to come out.

788
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,123
Forget it.

789
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,834
I recognize that name.

790
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,545
Yes, ma'am.

791
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,284
Did you find anything?

792
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,080
We've been keeping a close eye
on Mr. Baek around the clock lately.

793
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,750
This is what he's been doing every hour.

794
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,672
The places he went to weren't typical.

795
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,298
What has he been up to?

796
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,802
What? "Coin baseball"?

797
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,804
Yes, five balls for five hundred won.

798
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,723
He always goes there after work.

799
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:10,932
-With whom?
-Alone.

800
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,233
Forget it. Next.

801
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,277
What is "Grandma's Home Cooking"?

802
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,071
They sell home-cooked meals.
He has dinner there every day.

803
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,114
-With whom?
-Alone.

804
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,706
I tried their food for research purposes.

805
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,001
It was delicious. I'd go there alone too.

806
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,628
Why would he act pitifully and eat alone?

807
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,338
He can always eat at home.

808
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,135
What about two days ago?
He came home at midnight.

809
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,429
Right. He enjoyed some pork bulgogi

810
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,557
at Grandma's Home Cooking for dinner,

811
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,601
bought two water bottles
at a convenience store,

812
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,728
and went to an elementary school nearby.

813
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,814
At that hour? Was it a secret rendezvous?

814
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:00,774
No, he was alone.

815
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,985
-What did he do there by himself?
-He ran.

816
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,696
-He ran?
-Yes.

817
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,075
You know teachers punish their students
by making them do laps.

818
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,786
That's what he was doing.

819
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,204
-What for?
-Beats me.

820
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:19,167
It's not like he's an athlete,
but he even sang and shouted.

821
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,002
I was a bit spooked.

822
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,378
Would you like to see?

823
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:38,895
Don't ask me why I'm leaving

824
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,730
I was

825
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:44,359
Such a fool

826
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,735
What's wrong with him?

827
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,029
I told you, sir. He's not typical.

828
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,157
He met up with a stray cat
on his way home.

829
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,451
He said hello and gave it a snack.

830
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,370
I didn't expect a mistress,

831
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,372
but I did expect to see some tycoons.

832
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,082
Did you do your job properly?

833
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,876
I don't want to brag, but you see…

834
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,547
I'm so competent that I can locate
a target even in North Korea.

835
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,841
That's true. He's very tenacious.

836
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,426
As the legal director of Queens,

837
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,388
his only rendezvous was with a cat?

838
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,931
It's Aeong.

839
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,307
-What is?
-The cat's name.

840
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,018
It's the most ferocious cat
in this neighborhood.

841
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,479
But he named it, and it listens to him.

842
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:25,942
I also hired a former-CSI hacker
to hack his phone.

843
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,153
There were many photos of Aeong.

844
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,747
Strange, right? We thought the same thing.

845
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,877
What kind of man takes such pretty photos
of his woman whom he wants to divorce?

846
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,256
If you look closely,
this photo makes her legs look long.

847
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,925
This photo requires
a lot of concentration.

848
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,594
-This is true love.
-Totally.

849
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,484
I don't think he has a woman on the side.

850
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,985
This doesn't prove anything.

851
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,155
You've put a tail on him many times.

852
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,200
He knows to behave well
at times like this.

853
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,618
Do you think so?

854
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,745
The numbers will tell.

855
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,456
The audit results will come out soon.

856
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,628
They couldn't find anything at all.

857
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,130
They did a thorough check
from his consultation fee

858
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,424
to the litigation expenses
and found nothing.

859
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,261
I checked his card details and account,
and he surprisingly doesn't spend much.

860
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,472
He just often goes to the car wash.

861
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,557
-But…
-But what?

862
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,644
He'd withdraw millions in cash
every now and then.

863
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,354
-Is that so?
-Yes.

864
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,941
Another odd thing is that
he'd always spend 300,000 won

865
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,110
at Moulin Rouge
on the day of his withdrawal.

866
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,530
Moulin Rouge?

867
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,949
-A bar?
-A flower shop.

868
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:16,844
He spent 300,000 won today
and sent the flowers to a Kim Min-ji.

869
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,763
That's a female name.

870
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,182
-I believe so.
-I see.

871
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,144
So he bought some flowers
and withdrew some cash

872
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,355
before meeting this Kim Min-ji?

873
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,275
Where?

874
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,944
Where is she right now?

875
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,990
KIM MIN-JI
GANGJU-GU, SEOUL

876
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,616
DAUGHTERS
KIM MIN-JI

877
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,744
CEO HONG HAE-IN OF QUEENS DEPARTMENT STORE

878
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,042
Ms. Hong.

879
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,089
Ms. Hong.

880
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,300
Ms. Kim Min-ji?

881
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,094
Deal with our customers only.

882
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,058
The company already helped
with the funeral.

883
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:08,396
You personally sent us flowers
and gave us a lot of condolence money.

884
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,231
And you even made time to visit.

885
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,734
I don't know how to thank…

886
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:54,233
I guess Mr. Baek has been sending
condolence flowers under your name.

887
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,570
I'm a bit touched.

888
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,200
I like it.

889
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,202
Like what?

890
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,412
All funeral halls are the same.

891
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,123
But this place is clean and modern.

892
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,002
There aren't just chrysanthemums,
but dahlias and tulips as well.

893
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,796
It brightens up the room.

894
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,839
Are those angels?

895
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,717
Rococo style. I like it.

896
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,429
I also like how they
have halogen lamps here,

897
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,848
but pin lights over her photo.

898
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,311
Are you looking for a funeral hall?

899
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:33,773
What?

900
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,651
I mean, you're looking around so closely.

901
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,655
I was just looking around.

902
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,657
I see.

903
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,953
It's been a while
since we came to a funeral like this one.

904
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,331
Most of the funerals we go to

905
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,668
rarely have family members
weeping like them.

906
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:00,007
They're busy consulting
their attorneys or accountants

907
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,135
about their inheritance or gift tax.

908
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,139
Mom…

909
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:07,849
You're right.

910
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,979
They're genuinely mourning.

911
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,546
Why did you send flowers?

912
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,882
And the condolence money?

913
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,969
Stop playing. You disgust me.

914
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:49,098
Even if I lose my memory down the road,

915
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,350
I will never forget what you did to me.

916
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,520
You let go of my hand when I was

917
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:56,355
the most helpless.

918
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:02,069
I will never forgive you.

919
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,906
Try all you want,

920
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,826
but I will resent you
until my last breath.

921
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,789
So all you need to do

922
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,166
is stay still…

923
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,670
and get lost when I tell you to.

924
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,902
-That was quick.
-Of course, it was.

925
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,992
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

926
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:53,830
-I don't want to add fuel to the fire.
-No, let me hear it.

927
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:55,832
What is it?

928
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,210
Did you know that Secretary Kim
and I have become quite close?

929
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,378
We just spoke on the phone.

930
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,005
"How are they doing?
Do you think they reconciled?

931
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,883
Where are they going after work?
Don't let them cross paths."

932
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,469
-That's what secretaries--
-It's not just us.

933
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,763
All the workers are dying too.

934
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,890
They liked it better when you didn't care.

935
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,977
But you've been having
good and bad days lately.

936
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,521
Enough. It's best that I don't hear it.

937
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,982
You made me talk.

938
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,068
Anyway, there's one thing
you can do for us.

939
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,778
-Remaining amicable.
-Enough.

940
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,530
It'd be best if you went on a trip.

941
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,615
-Abroad if possible.
-Aren't you busy?

942
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,118
Of course, I am. I'm your secretary.

943
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,246
You're having dinner with Mr. Yoon.

944
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,540
You're seeing him often.

945
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:41,919
Isn't it great?

946
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,380
No split levels.

947
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:48,551
An entry fee of 8% is not bad.

948
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:53,306
But why does he want Hercyna
to hire their own employees?

949
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,515
That's his rule.

950
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,518
-The workers need to be 27 or younger.
-I know, but why?

951
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:01,147
He doesn't want old employees
to sell his products.

952
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,358
Unbelievable.

953
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,528
What's so terrible about aging?
It's actually a blessing.

954
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,614
It's great and something to vie for.

955
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,032
It's beautiful.

956
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:15,369
He's obnoxious.

957
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:21,083
So will you give up then?
He accepted almost all of our conditions.

958
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:22,627
"Our"?

959
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,510
Your conditions.

960
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:35,306
Yes, he accepted my conditions

961
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:38,267
for your sake.

962
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,435
So tell me.

963
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,439
What do you want?

964
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,901
I know I owe you one.

965
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:50,696
I feel uneasy
since you're not asking me for a favor.

966
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:54,533
If it's something I can do right now,
then I'll do it.

967
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,288
-Divorce him.
-What?

968
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,793
Divorce Baek Hyun-woo.

969
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,629
That's what I want.

970
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,177
He was planning to leave you.
Will you still keep him?

971
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:25,564
That's my business.

972
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,402
You're crossing the line again.

973
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,657
Should I really cross the line this time?

974
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,660
What if I…

975
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:41,914
replaced him?

976
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,558
I'd be crossing the line
if I really asked you that.

977
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,165
I can't eat.

978
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:29,545
I can't digest food well
when I'm offended.

979
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,336
He was adopted by a Korean family at 12.

980
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,713
The US may be vast,
but the Korean community is small.

981
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:17,093
Our new international attorney
used to live in his neighborhood.

982
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,887
They weren't close,
but his family was well-known.

983
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,056
-How so?
-It was soon after he was adopted.

984
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,058
His adoptive parents moved
to a bigger house.

985
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,685
Then they sent him
to the most expensive private school.

986
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,395
Hill Crawford Academy.

987
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:31,273
The annual tuition costs over $60,000.

988
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,192
But his parents weren't rich.

989
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,194
Can you reach his parents?

990
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,237
I did look into it.

991
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,989
They both passed away.

992
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,033
It was a drunk driving accident.

993
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,452
But people thought it was odd

994
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,330
since neither of them were drinkers.

995
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,127
You shouldn't be here.

996
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,923
How is this place?
It was empty for a long time.

997
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,717
You should go.

998
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,554
I feel reassured to know that my son
is living under the same roof as me.

999
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,599
I told you to leave.

1000
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:52,229
-You need to be more careful, Ms. Moh.
-Don't call me that. Call me Mom.

1001
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:57,401
You told me not to call you that,
so I held myself back all along.

1002
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,695
Now, I can't even say it anymore.

1003
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:02,364
Right.

1004
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:06,744
We had quite a past.

1005
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,749
But I don't regret it.

1006
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,378
Really? When this is your life right now?

1007
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,049
She's a housekeeper.

1008
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,592
She's been here for a while.

1009
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,093
You could say she's like

1010
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,638
the head housekeeper
whom Grandfather relies on.

1011
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:26,764
Don't mind her.

1012
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:27,723
She's a nobody.

1013
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,683
And over there…

1014
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:35,898
Gosh, that's salty.

1015
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,566
Ms. Moh has lost her touch.

1016
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,110
Why is this so salty?

1017
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:43,197
That's why
you should kick her out this instant.

1018
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,408
I would've done that already
if it was up to me.

1019
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,578
-Eat up. The other dishes are fine.
-Okay.

1020
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,210
Don't you remember everything you've lost
in the past 30 years?

1021
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,546
Of course, I do.

1022
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,674
I wanted to keep my son close

1023
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,134
and raise him myself.

1024
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:08,055
But if I did, you wouldn't
have gotten nice birthday meals

1025
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:11,016
or brand-new school uniforms.

1026
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,601
We would've been dirt-poor.

1027
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,187
I would've said,
"We're a family. Hang in there."

1028
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,939
"Things will look up soon."

1029
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:21,068
But that wouldn't have happened.

1030
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:26,365
It's a nice house, isn't it?

1031
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,702
Chairman Hong is very meticulous.

1032
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,579
It took him five years
to build this house,

1033
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,623
when it would've taken others one year.

1034
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,168
He even chose which stones
to put in the garden.

1035
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,507
But soon,

1036
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,884
we'll kick them all out

1037
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,720
and have this house to ourselves.

1038
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,433
Don't think it's unfair.

1039
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,937
We're just changing the order of things.

1040
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,565
This family had everything
they ever wanted.

1041
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,983
They were happy.

1042
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:01,984
And now,

1043
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:04,445
we will take over

1044
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:06,947
and become happy.

1045
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,618
You're more careless than I thought.

1046
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:13,746
Do you think it'll be easy?

1047
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,166
-I--
-No, there it goes.

1048
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:18,459
Kick the ball to me.

1049
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:19,918
I want to do it too.

1050
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,503
It's over there.

1051
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,047
Guys, have a drink.

1052
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,007
Mommy brought drinks.

1053
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,718
-Let's go.
-Can we have it now?

1054
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:28,886
Can we really drink it?

1055
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,387
Come here!

1056
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:37,227
Goodness, my princess.

1057
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,771
Are you up?

1058
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:42,900
Goodness, you're so pretty.

1059
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,695
Goodness.

1060
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,281
Beom-jun, be careful.

1061
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,742
Guys, look here.

1062
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,452
-Carry me.
-Sure.

1063
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,662
Chairman Hong enjoyed
his happiness before us,

1064
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,539
and he still remembers those times.

1065
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,291
We've yet to take them away.

1066
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,292
You won't fall.

1067
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,502
We shouldn't be

1068
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,213
complacent like this.

1069
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,185
-What is this?
-Use it however you want.

1070
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:21,563
Where can I possibly use this?

1071
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:26,276
Secretary Jang told me that you'll
be investigated for the secret fund.

1072
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,530
Your son or grandson
can't go to prison for you

1073
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,740
since they have a lot on their plate.

1074
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,992
-So?
-I'll go instead.

1075
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,455
Let's say I secretly embezzled
your secret fund

1076
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,374
through the scholarship foundation.

1077
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,254
I'm neither a board member
nor your family by law.

1078
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:49,466
If I take responsibility, you won't have
to worry about the owner's risk.

1079
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,387
Even if the media covers it,
I can take the fall alone.

1080
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,848
There's no honor I need to keep,

1081
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:57,516
so it's okay.

1082
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,603
I'll be interrogated
and go to prison instead.

1083
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:03,856
Don't you worry.

1084
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,033
You're much better

1085
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,829
than all my children combined.

1086
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,752
Hae-in.

1087
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:15,010
Why are you out in the cold?
Where's your car?

1088
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,388
Where is it? Where's Mr. Oh?

1089
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:35,781
I'm not sure.

1090
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:39,785
How did I get here?

1091
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,126
I keep finding myself
like this these days.

1092
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:52,047
Time keeps slipping away
when I'm running out of time as is.

1093
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,594
What about you?

1094
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,555
How did you know I was here?

1095
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,312
Did you recognize this umbrella?

1096
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,524
Do you remember giving it to me?

1097
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,736
I was really dumbfounded back then.

1098
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,115
Hae-in.

1099
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,536
Don't give me that look.

1100
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:24,329
There's a 51% chance.

1101
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,665
I can go to Germany and receive treatment.

1102
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,137
Hae-in.

1103
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,597
Why do you keep calling me?

1104
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:13,795
Right. You know Ye-na, right?
She got into a car accident two days ago.

1105
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,256
She fainted and went to the ER.

1106
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,759
She fainted and went to the ER.

1107
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,636
Then, her husband…

1108
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,056
Then, her husband
and her attorney rushed over.

1109
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:28,560
He caused a scene
and said she had to revise her will.

1110
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,147
He was so noisy that she woke up.

1111
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,742
Are you crying?

1112
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:48,747
I'm sorry.

1113
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,001
About what?

1114
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,095
Are you that worried?

1115
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:10,227
Don't you worry.

1116
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:26,702
Baek Hyun-woo.

1117
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:30,747
I love you.

1118
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,050
-Her name is Yeong-suk.
-Forget it.

1119
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:26,344
-I recognize that name.
-Yes, ma'am.

1120
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,852
That was ages ago.

1121
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,105
He's still calling for her?

1122
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:40,650
QUEENS DEPARTMENT STORE
GUIDE MAP

1123
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,195
Mr. Baek, did you know?

1124
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,989
A raccoon lives on our rooftop garden.

1125
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:48,074
That can't be.

1126
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,327
There are no raccoons in Seoul.

1127
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,369
I saw her.

1128
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,455
Many times.

1129
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,457
-Really?
-Yes.

1130
01:19:56,082 --> 01:19:59,169
She only comes out of hiding
when it's empty and you call her name.

1131
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,131
She comes out?

1132
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,803
That's impossible.

1133
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,972
You must take me for a fool.

1134
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:12,974
I'm serious.

1135
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,645
Her name is Yeong-suk.

1136
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,193
You're lying, aren't you?

1137
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,154
Call out her name when no one's around.

1138
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:29,199
But she only comes out when she wants to.

1139
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,625
Come on. Don't lie.

1140
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,294
You're lying.

1141
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,713
She's so adorable.

1142
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:53,014
You're fooling me again.

1143
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,517
You're lying.

1144
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:57,519
She has big, round eyes.

1145
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,563
I know you'll love her too.

1146
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,949
I'm sorry, but you're not fooling me.

1147
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:14,870
He is a fool. He still believes it.

1148
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,582
Does he believe everything I say?

1149
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:29,092
No wonder he married me after I said

1150
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,512
I'd make him happy.

1151
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:39,769
Yeong-suk.

1152
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,647
Come out if you're here.

1153
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:45,859
Yeong-suk?

1154
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,252
Yeong-suk!

1155
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,428
I want to see you, Yeong-suk.

1156
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:20,352
QUEEN OF TEARS

1157
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,135
He ran laps, and had rice soup again.

1158
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,595
Is this fun?

1159
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:58,473
How could I possibly leave her?

1160
01:22:58,556 --> 01:22:59,516
Get out.

1161
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:02,602
A reunion? A bar? There's only one answer.

1162
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,062
A mistress.

1163
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,691
Why are you still here
and letting them humiliate you?

1164
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,484
That today will be

1165
01:23:09,567 --> 01:23:12,404
the best day of my life.

1166
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,572
She'll choose me anyway.

1167
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,366
You! Let her go!

1168
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,451
And if you try to harm her,

1169
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,245
I'll do the same to you.

1170
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,837
