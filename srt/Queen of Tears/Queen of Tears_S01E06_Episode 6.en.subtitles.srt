00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,277
EPISODE 6

3
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,872
Why did Hae-in suddenly go to Germany?

4
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,875
Beats me.
She just said it was a private matter.

5
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,194
What are you doing?

6
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,781
I can't smoke
since there are cameras everywhere.

7
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,325
All the cameras are off,
and the helpers are gone.

8
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,412
This is my only chance.
Let me smoke one and have a glass.

9
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,748
Let's do that next time, okay?

10
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,923
Take your time. The night is young.

11
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,676
Hae-in is gone, and Hyun-woo left too.

12
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,628
It may look like they don't get along,

13
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,881
but I beg to differ.

14
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,804
They like each other,

15
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,057
but they don't know that.

16
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,810
That's why they're never
on the same page. Fools.

17
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,928
Hong Hae-in!

18
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,349
Dream on if your plan is to find something
on Hyun-woo and kick him out.

19
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,102
Grace has been watching him
for three years

20
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,395
and has found nothing.

21
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,814
-Really?
-I'm telling you.

22
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,576
But someone who's clean
wouldn't have something like this.

23
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,754
Mr. Kim, why are you calling me?

24
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,091
We shouldn't call each other
when our bosses are on vacation.

25
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,259
Where are you? Jeju Island?

26
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,260
Somewhere better.

27
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,679
Get to the point.
I'll hang up if you talk shop.

28
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,056
Is Ms. Hong in Frankfurt?

29
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,517
I think Mr. Baek flew out yesterday,

30
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,519
but he didn't tell me his destination.

31
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,771
How would I know where your boss went?

32
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,024
Why did Ms. Hong go to Germany?

33
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,568
Why are you curious?

34
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,737
Both of them suddenly left,

35
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,697
and I'm in the dark.

36
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,825
Don't bother looking for them
if they don't tell you.

37
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,868
It's wrong.

38
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,413
Plus, I haven't had
a week-long break in years.

39
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,334
So don't call me for trivial
or important matters. Okay?

40
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,088
I'm sure

41
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,424
that something's up.

42
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,303
Where in the world are they?

43
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,390
Let's go home.

44
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,441
I thought I'd find it here.

45
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,737
A miraculous way to live.

46
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,823
Or a place of no sadness.

47
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,579
But there was none.

48
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,373
All I wanted

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,252
was to go home with you.

50
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,563
You two must be madly in love.

51
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:23,109
But do you think
you can do that somewhere else?

52
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:27,738
My lovely wife is also waiting for me

53
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,659
back home.

54
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,026
I wonder what secret he's hiding.

55
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,319
It might be nothing.

56
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,570
It doesn't matter.

57
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,864
A relationship
is bound to crumble with a secret.

58
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,324
That's the power of it.

59
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,254
Why cup noodles out of the blue?

60
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,801
I want to give it a try.

61
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,513
I know it's full of chemicals and MSG,

62
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,682
but I'd be upset if I died
without having a taste.

63
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,186
Just wait three minutes.

64
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,690
Then I'll talk in the meantime.

65
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,026
I'll talk while we wait so it won't seem

66
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,528
too serious.

67
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,321
About what?

68
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,740
Things I'd like you to do.

69
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,701
I'm listening.

70
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,621
Don't hold

71
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,082
memorial services for me.

72
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,252
I don't like any of the food.

73
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,170
If you want to commemorate me,

74
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,840
just think of me while having
some wine at a nice place.

75
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,385
And place a few Hercyna handbags
on the table.

76
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,265
Are you being like this
because the clinic rejected you?

77
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,226
They could call you back
with good news down the road.

78
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,062
Write up a nice obituary as well.

79
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,940
Add some moving stories about me.

80
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,484
There are none.

81
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,902
No, I'm sure there are some.

82
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,028
Also…

83
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,572
There's more?

84
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,575
Stay alert at my funeral.

85
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,286
Everyone who disliked me will attend.

86
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,914
Hyeon-ju, Jeong-mi, Eun-jin, and Ye-na.

87
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,832
Listen carefully

88
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,917
to what they say.

89
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,377
And?

90
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,046
Sue them all if they bad-mouth me.

91
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,757
Sue them for defaming the dead.

92
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,342
-Me?
-Then, should I?

93
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,553
-I'll be in the coffin.
-Come on.

94
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,392
I don't think anyone would mourn.

95
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,729
So, you should.

96
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,607
You'll cry, right?

97
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,321
Cry when there are many people.

98
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,531
It's better if there are cameras around.

99
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,743
Do you want me

100
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,203
to cry?

101
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,043
Yes and no.

102
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,630
I want you to feel sad.

103
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,547
But I don't want you

104
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,884
to be too sad.

105
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,305
I'd feel uneasy
if you remembered me forever,

106
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,516
but I'd be enraged
if you moved on quickly.

107
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,102
Then what should I do?

108
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:47,938
I'd…

109
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,733
like you

110
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,944
to think it's a shame.

111
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,700
I'd like you to pity

112
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,620
that I'm no longer around.

113
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,666
That's enough.

114
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,128
Your three minutes are up.

115
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,555
Last one.

116
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,185
I have a will.

117
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,063
I wrote it before we got married.

118
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,858
My mom refused to give us
her blessings if I didn't write one.

119
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,028
You won't inherit anything.

120
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,280
That's what it says. But…

121
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,032
I'm going to revise it.

122
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,285
I didn't know this day would come so soon.

123
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,415
I just wrote it so we could get married.

124
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,294
What's wrong?

125
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,005
Are you upset?

126
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,093
No.

127
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,429
I'm thankful

128
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,806
that you'd do that.

129
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,017
Please do that.

130
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,979
But…

131
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,231
not right now.

132
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,483
I won't allow it.

133
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,028
Then when?

134
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,030
Later.

135
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,410
Once you're fully recovered,

136
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,953
you can do that.

137
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,585
But for now…

138
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,845
Let's eat.

139
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,473
It's been over three minutes.

140
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
They'll get soggy.

141
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,717
JUSEONG TECH 24

142
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,356
Put that back. We need to go.

143
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,651
I couldn't buy this
even after waiting for months.

144
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,611
But she has it stashed in her closet.

145
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:45,783
Hey, how would things have turned out
had we been rich like this?

146
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,078
Would our lives have been different?

147
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,621
Are you envious?

148
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,334
I know I would've been smarter
than Soo-cheol.

149
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,503
How is he so dumb?

150
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:01,215
I've never met anyone
who was easier to fool than him.

151
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,176
That's why you could marry him.

152
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,138
Do you know what he said to me?

153
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,021
I don't like Lee Seung-gi,
despite his fame.

154
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:16,939
Why?

155
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,108
He sang about a woman older than him.

156
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,361
I don't like women who are older than me.

157
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,738
My sister's bullied me
ever since I was little,

158
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,949
so I'm traumatized.

159
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,117
I see.

160
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,411
My body reacts first
when I meet an older woman.

161
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,329
I get goosebumps and rashes.

162
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,456
Even I'm fascinated by myself.

163
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,417
I'm like an age detector.

164
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,463
How do you think he'll react

165
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,259
if he finds out that his wife
is actually five years older than him?

166
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:57,771
Goodness.

167
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,691
You don't touch the head with iron.
Bring me the bamboo knife.

168
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,775
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,777
What is that?

170
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,529
This? It's wild ginseng.

171
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,449
It's not just any wild ginseng.
It's a century old.

172
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,620
This gift from God
can even bring the dead back to life.

173
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,996
Are you serious?

174
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,457
Figuratively speaking.

175
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,879
Soo-cheol's anxiety and excessive sweating
are due to his weak energy.

176
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,756
So he needs to eat this regularly.

177
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,051
The entire length
of this wild ginseng is 1.3 meters.

178
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,180
I've had wild ginseng for 20 years now,
but I've never seen one this big before.

179
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,349
Hey, give this to me.

180
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,850
Don't be silly.

181
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,268
Do you like wild ginseng?

182
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,271
Seon-hwa, how much was this?
I'll pay you more.

183
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,275
I bought this for no one else but my son.

184
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,443
I can't do that.

185
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,279
It's not for me.

186
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,199
It's for your other child, Hae-in.

187
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,743
What? Why would you
when she's already so strong?

188
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,703
Do you want her to become Superwoman?

189
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,122
She's not strong!

190
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,418
She could get sick too.

191
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,757
Hae-in has rarely caught a cold
in her lifetime, so don't worry about her.

192
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,716
Seon-hwa.

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,721
You can never guarantee one's health.
It doesn't mean she'll be healthy forever.

194
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,182
Let me take care of my children's health.

195
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,648
Hey, you said this was 1.3 meters long.

196
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,609
Why don't you split it with Hae-in?

197
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,696
It's not that I don't want to share.

198
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,199
Wild ginseng is only effective
if you have it whole.

199
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,243
Okay, then let Hae-in have it all.

200
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,997
You haven't said anything
for the past 20 years, so why now?

201
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,500
Stop being greedy if you've had it
for that long, you scumbag!

202
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,340
Goodness. What's the matter with her?

203
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,842
I think it's menopause.

204
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,720
Hey, eat it before she comes back.

205
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,304
Take it.

206
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,348
-Please chop it into thirds.
-Okay.

207
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,357
Beom-jun.

208
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,028
Hey, Beom-ja.

209
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,906
Beom-seok left for Hawaii last night.

210
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,368
We never got to get together.

211
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,248
What are you doing?

212
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,585
What is that?

213
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,004
Are you feeding the snail right now?

214
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,842
Paengsun's shell broke.
She must be in so much pain.

215
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,845
She needs to eat eggshells
for more calcium,

216
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,598
but she just won't eat any.

217
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,604
What's it to you if that snail
broke its shell and has no appetite?

218
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,065
There you go again.

219
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,025
When a snail loses its shell--

220
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,694
I don't care!
It'll probably turn into a slug!

221
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,281
She'll die without her shell.

222
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,077
Simply put,
she's suffering from an incurable illness.

223
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,161
She's terminally ill.

224
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,422
-What's wrong?
-Beom-jun.

225
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,346
What is it?

226
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,391
Who is it this time?

227
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,812
My poor Beom-jun…

228
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,938
Beom-ja.

229
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,774
I'm sorry to say this.

230
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,612
But you're our most pitiful family member
after Paengsun.

231
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,535
Beom-jun.

232
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,328
Have a glass.

233
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,759
You're just dying to drink, aren't you?

234
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,686
What should I do with my poor brother?

235
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,295
They're all in German.

236
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,549
We're in Germany after all.

237
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,346
Should I turn it off?

238
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,857
I'll sleep in that room.

239
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,694
You can sleep wherever you want.

240
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,616
Do you want me to take that room?

241
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,707
That's not what I said.
Just sleep wherever you want.

242
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,500
Do as you want. Follow your heart.

243
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,900
What is it?

244
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,276
Can I…

245
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,987
I mean, from today on…

246
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,325
Can I sleep in your room?

247
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,374
I guess

248
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,834
you're still uncomfortable.

249
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,632
I never said that.

250
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,260
I didn't say anything.

251
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,055
Don't jump to conclusions. I'm…

252
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,390
thinking about it.

253
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,475
Okay.

254
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,478
All right.

255
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,480
Think about it.

256
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,986
So…

257
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,070
just today?

258
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,447
Or from now on?

259
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,284
From this day until forever?

260
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,828
Yes, this day until forever.

261
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,583
Deal.

262
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,716
-Deal.
-I see. "Deal"?

263
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,802
That's what you said, right?

264
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,056
Unbelievable.

265
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,456
Do you know Kim Ye-na?

266
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,709
The CEO of Royal,
whom we met at the Hercyna party.

267
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,419
Yes, I do.

268
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,338
She got

269
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,882
into a car accident last week.

270
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,595
She fainted and went to the ER.

271
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,389
Then, her husband
and her attorney rushed over.

272
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,724
-Her attorney?
-Yes.

273
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:35,228
Her husband thought she was dying,
so he wanted her to sign a few things.

274
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,481
I see.

275
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:45,781
He desperately told the doctor
that she couldn't die just yet

276
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,325
because she had to sign something.

277
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,329
He caused a scene
and said she had to revise her will.

278
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,956
He was so noisy that she woke up.

279
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:56,917
I see.

280
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,796
I saw it coming.

281
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,964
He looks like a human version of Shrek.

282
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,550
How could that monster be so heinous?

283
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,845
His wife is on the brink of death,
and he only cares for her money?

284
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,264
He deserves to die.

285
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,063
Don't talk so harshly.

286
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,566
Right. It's not just him.

287
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,195
The first thing people ask
when they hear about someone's death is,

288
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,156
"So who's receiving all the inheritance?"

289
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,159
"The cash? Real estate?
Stocks? Inheritance tax?"

290
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,162
Some even say there are husbands
who laugh in the toilet

291
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,539
at their wife's funeral.

292
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,880
Not everyone…

293
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,970
is like you.

294
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,597
What? Like me?

295
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,519
Do you remember the first thing you said
when I said I was sick?

296
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,314
I love you, Hong Hae-in.

297
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,525
I love you.

298
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,693
"I love you."

299
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,113
Oh, did I?

300
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:12,784
Did you know
that those words comforted me so much?

301
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,495
Well…

302
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,040
Don't put too much emphasis
on what I said--

303
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,918
You wanted to see if I was breathing well.

304
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,254
Good morning.

305
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,797
You panicked when I coughed.

306
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,092
Are you okay? Please call the ambulance.

307
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:33,388
You didn't care about my will
or the fortune you'd get.

308
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,556
You never asked.

309
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,060
You stayed up all night worrying about me.

310
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,484
That's my husband.

311
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,111
You're one of a kind.

312
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,238
Yes.

313
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,741
You're right.

314
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,702
There's no one like me.

315
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,915
And now,
you flew across the world just for me.

316
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,335
It was only possible

317
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,921
thanks to the direct flight.

318
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,549
I'm truly blessed with a good husband.

319
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,764
No.

320
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,642
That's one thing you don't have.

321
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,766
Hyun-woo, where are you?
You haven't been picking up.

322
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,725
Sorry, I can't go.

323
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,894
I should've told you, but I was too busy.

324
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,355
Where are you?

325
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,190
I can't say right now. Later.

326
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,860
Just answer me "yes" or "no."
Are you being held against your will?

327
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,945
What are you saying? No, I'm not.

328
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,614
Then why can't you come?

329
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,949
Cheol-seung told his wife
she couldn't come,

330
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,744
and she hit him with a slipper.
But he still came.

331
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,245
-She hit my head.
-So where are you?

332
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,830
We're having a blast.

333
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:46,790
-Dae-ho--
-I know.

334
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,834
He probably brought crates
full of soju and beer.

335
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,545
Yeong-beom and Sang-pil
are probably lighting the wood,

336
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,214
and you're holding a pair of tongs.

337
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,548
-Who bought this meat?
-Gosh.

338
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,844
Cheol-seung probably bought pork shoulder
since it's chewier than pork belly.

339
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,472
We even have pork neck.
It's juicy and soft.

340
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,351
Yes, there's juicy pork neck,
chewy pork shoulder,

341
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,645
beer, and soju.

342
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,481
But we wouldn't have finished them
if I was there.

343
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,525
I would've ruined the mood.

344
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,151
So where are you?

345
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,244
Germany.

346
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,996
So you ended up going.

347
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,289
You better not regret it.

348
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,793
We're going to dip
some grilled pork neck in red pepper paste

349
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,044
and mix some alcohol too.

350
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,629
Okay, have fun.

351
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,466
Hae-in and I will have beer
and schweinshaxe.

352
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,010
-Hey, what's "schweinshaxe"?
-Isn't that German pig feet?

353
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,596
I don't care. You'll pay for this.

354
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,099
I'm not returning your entry fee.

355
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,100
What is it?

356
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,268
Hyun-woo can't come.

357
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,477
-Did he get caught?
-Did he?

358
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,645
No.

359
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,483
He's changed.

360
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,529
He's totally changed.

361
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,119
Honey, look at this.

362
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,750
The lab reached out.

363
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,580
There's this treatment called
the Filgrastim shot.

364
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,833
They want to raise my WBC with that
even though it's not guaranteed.

365
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,835
They still want to try.

366
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,183
Hey, that's great.

367
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,311
See? I told you there'd be good news.

368
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,688
You're right.

369
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,025
Maintaining a good immune system
is crucial for this treatment.

370
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,194
Maintain a good body temperature
so you won't catch a cold.

371
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,530
Make sure you have protein too.

372
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,450
And stay away from raw foods
in case of blood poisoning.

373
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,701
I see.

374
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,078
How do you know these things?

375
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,790
It's common sense.

376
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,293
Since when?

377
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,524
JUSEONG TECH 24

378
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,161
Hello. How may I help you?

379
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,873
Yes, you do need to help me.

380
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,083
Pardon?

381
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,801
How was it?

382
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,636
-It was great.
-I'm glad.

383
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,596
Thank you, ma'am.

384
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,358
Stay alert, will you?

385
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,235
-What's wrong?
-"What's wrong?"

386
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,612
Hey.

387
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,280
Look at this.

388
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,324
You're on the dashcam footage.

389
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,244
Why am I…

390
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,830
Yes, you idiot. You could've been caught.

391
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,707
Why do I look so fat?

392
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,001
Is that important?

393
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,629
Why were you standing there
when there were cars driving around?

394
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,631
-Is it my fault?
-Then is it mine?

395
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,174
Aren't we on the same team?

396
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,428
You should support me
so I can do well out there.

397
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,512
But what is this?

398
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,599
I did all the work and almost got caught,
thanks to your incompetence.

399
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,517
Be quiet.

400
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,894
What if Mr. Yoon hadn't found this?

401
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,814
Stay alert.

402
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,357
We're almost there.

403
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,235
Almost where?

404
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,487
Will Eun-sung bring the big shots

405
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,740
and swallow Queens whole?

406
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,159
It's none of your business.

407
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,869
Just take your share and leave.

408
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,662
That's true.

409
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,000
But what'll happen to the family
once he takes over Queens?

410
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,212
Don't tell me you're worried
about Soo-cheol?

411
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,090
Me?

412
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,425
Stay professional.

413
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,676
That was insulting.

414
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,554
Do you think
I have feelings for that idiot?

415
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,597
Forget it then.

416
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,434
Don't forget. You're not a rich madam
just because people treat you like one.

417
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,936
Whatever. I don't even want to become one.

418
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,814
I can't even smoke in peace.

419
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,275
Right. Quit smoking, will you?

420
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,903
I had to learn how to edit videos
so I could erase

421
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,489
footage of you smoking in the garden!

422
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,617
That's great.
Become a YouTuber once you retire.

423
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,287
Hey!

424
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,542
Mother.

425
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,794
Hello, ma'am.

426
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,545
When did you arrive?

427
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,590
Who were you shouting at?

428
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,966
Sorry? Who?

429
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,676
It was your voice.

430
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,303
I didn't say anything.

431
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,473
Ma'am, did you hear something?

432
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,392
No, I didn't hear anything.

433
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,604
Mother, you're scaring me.

434
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,361
I have a headache
since I couldn't sleep last night.

435
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,403
Oh, dear.

436
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,198
You need a scalp massage.

437
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,284
You should dip your body
in some pink salt first.

438
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,828
After you.

439
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:39,220
You're the best masseuse ever.

440
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,390
I feel much better already.

441
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,477
By the way,

442
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,564
I heard Mr. Baek went to Germany.

443
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,648
I guess so.

444
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,109
I see.

445
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,235
Why?

446
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,780
It's nothing.

447
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,990
Tell me.

448
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,075
To be honest,

449
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,703
I made a mistake.

450
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,330
What mistake?

451
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,419
A few days ago,

452
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,880
I accidentally told Mr. Baek
about Ms. Hong's will.

453
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,423
What?

454
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:20,344
He said he heard everything
and demanded me to tell the truth.

455
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,262
So?

456
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,182
I knew he'd eventually find out,
so I told him roughly.

457
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,895
And he's been causing
issues at work ever since.

458
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:29,812
Hyun-woo?

459
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,733
Mr. Hong is doing his utmost best

460
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,652
to carry out
an investment project with Mr. Yoon.

461
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,156
But Mr. Baek said they had
to get a validity test first,

462
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,202
so the project is at risk
of getting canceled.

463
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,870
What did you say?

464
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,873
We're on a time crunch, Grandfather.

465
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,625
What if Mr. Yoon changes his mind?

466
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,211
So? Business is about being tenacious.

467
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,754
You shouldn't be anxious.

468
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,340
Come on. We're not the ones investing.

469
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:02,553
He's the investor here,
so why are we being calculating?

470
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,180
I'm so frustrated.

471
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,640
We should be.

472
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,017
Do you think his money is free, you fool?

473
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,771
Hyun-woo is careful
and meticulous, if anything.

474
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,813
So do as he says.

475
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,196
Hyun-woo is so annoying.

476
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,745
Chairman Hong.

477
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,248
The scholarship ceremony will soon begin.

478
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,541
Soo-cheol, play with your friends.

479
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,503
This way.

480
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,173
But they're not my friends.

481
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,029
Hey, how dare you
throw a ball at my brother's head?

482
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,365
He's already dumb as is.

483
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,075
What if he becomes even dumber?

484
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,952
What's your name?

485
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,911
Hong Hae-in. Why?

486
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,500
What's his deal?

487
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:17,837
Stop crying.

488
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,256
You're so noisy.

489
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,018
Hey.

490
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,228
Yes?

491
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,688
Are you the chairman's grandson?

492
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,814
Yes.

493
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,150
And is she your older sister?

494
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,401
Yes.

495
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,529
Are you the only son?

496
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,489
I used to have an older brother

497
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,615
but not anymore.

498
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,661
I see. So you're the only son.

499
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,249
Blow into it.

500
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,337
Let's get married later.

501
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,130
-No.
-Why not?

502
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,715
You little…

503
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,303
Grandfather!

504
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,475
Don't only listen to him.
Hear me out too. I…

505
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,978
I thought long and hard
before bringing this up.

506
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,813
-So why would you…
-What an idiot.

507
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,868
By the way, how is Geon-u

508
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,161
so handsome?

509
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,829
Thank you.

510
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,706
He doesn't take after you.

511
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,792
What do you mean? We're practically twins.

512
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,838
Did he take a DNA test?

513
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,715
Of course. As soon as he was born.

514
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,509
You saw the result.

515
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,302
They're 99.99% a match.

516
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,346
Do you not see Da-hye here?

517
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,681
Hey, the DNA test is a formality.

518
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,475
You all took one.

519
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,477
Don't be rude to your grandfather.

520
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,189
I was only joking since Geon-u
is so handsome and smart.

521
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,942
I can put up with people

522
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,528
bad-mouthing my parents,

523
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,197
but not my wife or son.

524
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,741
I don't think I can eat.

525
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,743
Let's go, honey.

526
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,416
What a terrible son.

527
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,210
Yes, he can put up well
with people bad-mouthing his parents.

528
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,802
Look at his eyebrows.
I had the same ones as a baby.

529
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,262
They thickened with time.

530
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,556
And look at his nose.

531
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,558
I hit my nose while playing soccer,

532
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,934
so it's a bit low.

533
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,185
But I had the same nose.

534
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,437
My nose bridge was so high.

535
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,272
-People thought I was mixed.
-I see.

536
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,485
His thick hair and his toes…

537
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,112
I feel bad for you.

538
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,323
Our family must have strong genes.
He doesn't resemble you.

539
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,083
I'm sorry.

540
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,296
-About what?
-I'm the weakest one in the family.

541
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,883
My sister bosses me around,
and my grandfather scolds me all the time.

542
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,969
That's why you're being mistreated.

543
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,180
I'll do better

544
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,765
so that no one will dare mistreat you.

545
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,648
The resort complex project will be a hit.
I'll do my best for your sake.

546
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,817
Trust me.

547
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,239
It's a bit undercooked.

548
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,451
It'll cook more as we eat.

549
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,120
Hello, sir. Can I ask you for directions?

550
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,293
Goodness, you found the right guy.

551
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,464
I know all the paved
and unpaved roads around here.

552
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,424
I know where the dogs go

553
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,636
and even where the birds fly.
I know everything.

554
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,513
-So ask me.
-Okay.

555
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,264
It's a place that was on YouTube.

556
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,099
-Do you know where it is?
-YouTube?

557
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,520
Was our village on YouTube?

558
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,273
Which area was it?

559
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,192
-Here.
-Hold on.

560
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,033
This must be it.

561
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,993
Didn't Hong Hae-in sit here?

562
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,245
Hong Hae-in.

563
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,704
You look pretty.

564
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,001
What are they all doing there?

565
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,380
That's where Hae-in sat.
A conglomerate heiress's seat.

566
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,091
And that's the wall she leaned on.

567
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,635
It's like posing
in front of the Berlin Wall.

568
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,011
Something like that.

569
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,263
What do you mean?

570
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,100
They're copying what Hae-in did
in her free time.

571
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,271
Isn't that the dog?

572
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,898
Hae-in, please say something.

573
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,442
Hello. I'm Hong Hae-in of Queens Group.

574
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,571
He's the best leader.

575
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,114
Isn't this the dog?

576
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,073
Yes, it is.

577
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,366
We were right.

578
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,284
Smile.

579
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,494
Father, Yongdu-ri has become famous.

580
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,290
HONG HAE-IN VISITED

581
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,007
HONG HAE-IN WAS HERE

582
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,883
Hae-in was here.

583
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,553
Why won't they let us in?

584
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,597
Hae-in took one bite of their duck.

585
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,141
Now, people line up to eat here

586
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:26,061
in the early morning,
but still can't get in.

587
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,856
Both the marinated crab
and frozen pork belly restaurants

588
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,233
are fully booked
and delivering everywhere.

589
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,735
It's crazy.

590
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,278
Why are they doing this?

591
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,447
Well… They may not be able
to dress like the rich,

592
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,699
so they want to at least eat like them.

593
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,743
I guess it's something like that.

594
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,245
Hae-in is the best.

595
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:49,710
I strived for decades
to make Yongdu-ri known.

596
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,880
But she achieved that in less than a day.

597
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,925
It's safe to say that you have
the upper hand in the election.

598
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,137
Your daughter-in-law
is helping our economy.

599
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,515
What is Seok-hun up to?

600
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,768
I bet he feels defeated.

601
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,772
Maybe he wishes Hae-in would visit
his mother's restaurant.

602
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:16,904
I doubt it.

603
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:21,158
Chew slowly,
or you'll have an upset stomach.

604
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,285
Apples are best for indigestion.

605
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,205
Why?

606
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,001
Why would she eat that?

607
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,337
She should've had pears instead.

608
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,423
So why apples?

609
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,677
Seok-hun, that sly scumbag.

610
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,430
Yongdu-ri has become home to apples
to outsiders

611
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,891
just because Hae-in took a bite.

612
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,602
I think it's game over.

613
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,480
YONGDU-RI EQUALS DELICIOUS APPLES

614
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,148
Let's hurry.

615
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,234
You're finally busy now.

616
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,362
What a great day.

617
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,075
Take the entire box.

618
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,746
-The video is trending.
-Yes.

619
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,706
It's reached over 500,000 views.

620
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,710
Mi-seon, I became a fan
of Ms. Hong after her visit.

621
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,171
How was there a halo around her

622
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,133
when she introduced herself
as the family's daughter-in-law?

623
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,927
There was a lobster truck behind her.
Maybe that was it.

624
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,888
Here. Check this out.

625
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,975
Someone from Jeju ordered
our marinated crab.

626
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,728
Goodness, my crabs
will get to visit Jeju before I do.

627
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,024
-Lucky you.
-Right.

628
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,320
Hold on.

629
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,114
-What's wrong?
-What do you mean?

630
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,824
You look like a famished woman

631
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,244
who's disappointed
to find no rice in the cooker.

632
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,541
Seok-hun has been promoting his apples,

633
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,751
so how could you upload a video
of Hae-in eating one?

634
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:55,919
-Did you?
-Did I?

635
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,213
Sorry, I'll edit it out.

636
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,257
Forget it. Over 500,000 people watched it.

637
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,425
It's too late now!

638
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,303
Then let's ask Hae-in to visit again.

639
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,345
-Yes.
-She should come.

640
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,931
She can do an eating show
with your dad's pears

641
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,225
and strut down Hong Hae-in's Path.

642
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,143
What path?

643
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,312
The women's association began
a new project.

644
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,147
Since our village has become famous,

645
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:19,276
we'll decorate the entrance
and call it "Hong Hae-in's Path."

646
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,612
-That's right.
-We'll get the portrait rights.

647
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,239
Then, we'll display
a photo of her and Hyun-woo.

648
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,034
Also known as "Yongdu-ri Queen's Path."

649
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,328
"Walk down this path,
and your love will come true."

650
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,370
Let's add that too.

651
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,418
-Get out!
-Goodness!

652
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,462
Get out and don't visit anytime soon!

653
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,588
Goodness.

654
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,465
Gosh.

655
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,634
What?

656
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,594
QUEEN'S HAIR SALON

657
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,568
Too late. He's married.

658
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,904
You should've come five years sooner.

659
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,156
Just go away, will you?

660
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,965
People here
easily say hello if you lock eyes.

661
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,009
It's a nice culture.

662
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,887
You must be happy

663
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,764
that you're popular with all women,

664
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,559
including
the Yongdu-ri principal's daughter.

665
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,686
The principal's daughter?

666
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,689
So-yeong?

667
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:42,526
I see. Is that her name?

668
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,445
I heard she was kind and pretty.

669
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,115
Well…

670
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,409
She was cute and had short hair.

671
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,370
Yes, she did.

672
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,332
I see.

673
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,710
Is she your first love
that Mi-seon mentioned?

674
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,628
She wasn't my first love.

675
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,635
If your entire family knew her,

676
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,470
does that mean you were engaged?

677
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,680
Come on.

678
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,432
That's ridiculous.

679
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,017
We never even had lunch.

680
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,728
We never did anything,
so how's she my first love?

681
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,563
You don't have to do anything.

682
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:24,318
You're happy to watch them from afar.
You can't stop thinking about them.

683
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,154
You take a detour
just to see them once more.

684
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,365
If you did those for the first time,
then that's your first love.

685
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,998
That was quite specific.

686
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,084
Speaking from experience?

687
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,629
You could say that.

688
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,051
You were happy to see him from afar.

689
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,719
You couldn't stop thinking about him.

690
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,888
And you even took a detour?

691
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,390
Right.

692
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,562
Who was he?

693
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,233
Every girl falls in love with one
at least once.

694
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,985
A guy on the bus.

695
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,737
A guy on the bus?

696
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,989
Did you take the bus to school?

697
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,367
That can't be.

698
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,100
Who are they?

699
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:41,812
The CCTV cameras have been malfunctioning
lately, and they're the repairmen.

700
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,272
It'll take about an hour, sir.

701
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,043
It's all done.

702
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,557
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

703
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,893
Yes, I'm sure it was tough for you too.
You stayed around long enough.

704
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,749
Did you find it?

705
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,459
No.

706
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,378
-Are you sure this is it?
-I think so.

707
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,383
It was three years ago.
Maybe they threw it away.

708
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,095
Do you think so?

709
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,585
It's good.

710
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,317
Do they have that much time?

711
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,990
Those people are doing nothing
in front of that fountain.

712
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,784
They're just wasting time sunbathing.

713
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:04,079
They're just feeding the pigeons.

714
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,624
They're resting
while doing meaningless things.

715
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,461
Exactly. They're wasting time
doing meaningless things.

716
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,588
Are they bragging
about the time they have?

717
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,632
How extravagant.

718
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,574
Trying to make money off
of common four-leaf clovers?

719
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,075
What a fraud.

720
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,202
What kind of fool would buy such things?

721
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,105
Are you getting one?

722
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,941
Yeah. Just for fun.

723
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,575
That's expensive for some leaves.

724
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,193
What's wrong?

725
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,780
I'm a bit stunned right now.

726
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,699
Why? What's wrong?

727
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,576
-My weight…
-Your weight?

728
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,245
It went up by 3 kg.

729
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,957
I've gained 3 kg
since my hospital visit in Korea.

730
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,751
-What?
-Don't you normally lose weight when sick?

731
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,379
Is that important right now?

732
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:21,549
What do you know? No one has ever told you
that you had three months left to live.

733
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:30,308
I've been pretty all my life,
so what if I turn ugly?

734
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,310
You'll only remember my ugly face.

735
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,105
I won't allow that.

736
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,440
Well…

737
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,903
You won't believe me
if I said you're pretty

738
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:44,823
no matter your weight, will you?

739
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:47,909
So…

740
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,577
I have gained weight.

741
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,747
-That's not what I meant.
-Just watch.

742
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,376
I'm going to be gorgeous until I die.

743
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,470
I'll be back.

744
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,270
I'm hungry.

745
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,759
How long were you looking for me?

746
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,219
For about an hour.

747
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,097
Time keeps fading away.

748
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,391
I don't have much time as is.

749
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,312
Do you not remember again?

750
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:46,856
No, I do.

751
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,818
-I just saw someone.
-Who?

752
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,533
My older brother.

753
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,565
When I was nine,

754
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,818
we went on a boat ride
during our summer vacation.

755
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,153
We got into a mysterious accident.

756
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,133
-There!
-Hae-in!

757
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,302
Hae-in! Goodness!

758
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,596
Gosh, Hae-in!

759
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,098
Are you okay?

760
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,726
-Are you all right?
-Mom, where's Su-wan?

761
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,352
He saved me.

762
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:08,980
Su-wan?

763
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,026
He was just…

764
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,112
Su-wan!

765
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:17,864
Su-wan!

766
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,491
Su-wan!

767
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,369
Please save my boy!

768
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,163
-Su-wan!
-One, two, three, four.

769
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,040
-Five, six, seven, eight, nine…
-Su-wan!

770
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,000
That's how

771
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,836
he died.

772
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,298
After losing her son,

773
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,258
my mom couldn't

774
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,802
eat, sleep, or forgive me

775
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,472
for a very long time.

776
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,016
And I felt bad

777
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,726
for Su-wan.

778
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,812
It wasn't your fault.

779
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:57,862
I know.

780
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,698
But I couldn't shake off the guilt.

781
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,369
Because it felt like

782
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,871
I stole his life.

783
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,753
I heard this somewhere.

784
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,880
When you're about to die,

785
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,216
the person who loved you the most
picks you up

786
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,551
in the form of an angel.

787
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,637
Su-wan…

788
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,640
who sacrificed his life for me…

789
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,606
Maybe he came

790
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,401
because it's time.

791
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:49,455
Delirium is one of the many side effects
of your injection.

792
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,542
It's a hallucination. It's not an angel.

793
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:55,712
Is that so?

794
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,382
It's part of the treatment.

795
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,564
It's not easy

796
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,733
to survive an illness.

797
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,359
But…

798
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,447
you must pull through, Hae-in.

799
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,036
You're right.

800
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:30,872
And I will.

801
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,291
But…

802
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,919
let's say a lot of time passed,

803
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,381
and you died.

804
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,803
Then I'll become an angel and pick you up.

805
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,688
If I show up,

806
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,356
it'll be less scary for you.

807
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:04,947
Are you sure?

808
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,450
That it'll be less scary?

809
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:10,620
Of course. I'll be the prettiest angel.

810
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,006
What is it?

811
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:24,717
Okay.

812
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:26,636
You do that.

813
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,058
But for now,

814
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,228
let's dig in.

815
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:43,778
What?

816
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,243
Let's eat up

817
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:52,453
and stay strong.

818
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,132
JUSEONG TECH

819
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,928
The number you have dialed
is not in service…

820
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:20,064
JUSEONG TECH 24

821
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:23,150
CLOSED

822
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,570
DATA RECOVERY
JUSEONG TECH 24

823
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,323
WE HAVE SHUT DOWN FOR PERSONAL REASONS

824
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:31,284
Yes. That's perfect.

825
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,913
This is northwest.

826
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:39,792
This is the direction that's in charge
of money, success, and luck.

827
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,670
It's great that you put up
an enterprising painting

828
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:43,713
like this here.

829
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,340
It finally found its owner.
It looks much better here.

830
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,428
You've given me such a huge gift.

831
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,263
How can I repay you?

832
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,599
There's no need.

833
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,143
I only gave it to you out of respect.

834
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,270
Right.

835
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,564
About that resort complex…

836
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:05,735
I heard a consulting firm is checking
its validity and profitability.

837
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:09,030
Yes, my grandson-in-law
advised me to do so.

838
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:10,698
I'm glad. It's good to be sure.

839
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,492
I'm talking to other companies too,
so don't feel pressured.

840
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:19,916
What? Other companies? I heard
Chairman Yeom has been busy lately.

841
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,417
Are you speaking with him too?

842
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,961
Gosh, I hope Chairman Yeom

843
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:27,381
doesn't steal
this great opportunity from us.

844
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,633
That can't happen.

845
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,638
-Sir.
-What is it?

846
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,934
How much money did Mr. Song embezzle?

847
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,226
Thirteen billion won, sir.

848
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,062
And no one knew?

849
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,648
-This whole time?
-I'm sorry.

850
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,191
He set the workers' wages

851
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,902
higher than normal
or manipulated financial statements

852
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:50,196
based on the certificates of deposit.

853
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,073
Will he keep his mouth shut?

854
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:55,117
Our attorneys are present
while the prosecution interrogates him.

855
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,411
He won't tell a soul.

856
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,579
But here's the problem.

857
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:04,168
It was quite a hefty sum,
so the higher-ups will be involved.

858
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,630
They could summon you too,
so you should brace yourself.

859
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:11,884
But of course, our law firm
will do their best to prevent that.

860
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:12,802
Beom-jun.

861
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:13,844
Yes, Father.

862
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,013
This isn't

863
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,099
about Mr. Song.

864
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,141
They were after me!

865
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,268
Who the hell did it?

866
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,689
Who told the prosecution about it?

867
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,484
It must've been someone very close to you.

868
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,194
I'll find them.

869
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,404
They will pay for this.

870
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:36,993
Goodness.

871
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:43,582
What is that?

872
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,794
What is it?

873
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,173
It's an RF transmitter
VOX listening device.

874
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:55,052
It's only activated when it hears
a certain level of noise or human voice.

875
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:58,180
Who the hell was brazen enough to do this?

876
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,683
Given the size of this device,

877
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,520
I think we can find
a microwave receiver in a 2-km radius.

878
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,996
We can wire the 30 billion
to Mr. Jin's account.

879
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,291
Then, sell the stocks under borrowed names
and send them in small chunks.

880
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,710
Yes, do that and inform Mr. Jin.

881
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:10,753
-Hold on.
-Yes, sir.

882
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,546
Why was this in Hyun-woo's office?

883
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:16,258
Anything else?

884
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,135
There was a safe in Mr. Baek's room.

885
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,721
Open it.

886
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,690
Why can't I get a hold of you?

887
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,026
Do you know what happened last night?

888
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,946
Your grandfather's study was bugged.

889
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:38,364
He's already on edge

890
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,741
because his financial manager
was accused of embezzlement.

891
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,451
-So?
-"So?"

892
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,121
Your husband set up the bug.

893
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,624
Do you have proof?

894
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,751
That's exactly why I'm calling.

895
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,962
We found a receiver in his room.

896
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:56,090
Anyone could've placed it there
while we were gone.

897
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,842
The house was empty for days.

898
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,677
Are you all stupid?

899
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,470
Don't take his side.

900
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:05,933
I had found it odd that Hyun-woo
was so against Soo-cheol's business idea.

901
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:09,353
Check the CCTV cameras
before pointing your finger at him.

902
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,314
MOM

903
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,871
See? I'm all you got, aren't I?

904
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:27,872
Just admit it.

905
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,499
Yes, I'm here.

906
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,252
The store is closed.

907
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,589
No, for good. They've shut down.

908
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,215
What did you give them?

909
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,800
Then look across the street.

910
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:40,843
My car is there.

911
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,136
PUBLIC PARKING LOT

912
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:44,722
What? You weren't lying.

913
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:45,890
Why did you park here?

914
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,850
The key is on the front right wheel.

915
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,813
What's going on?

916
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:56,025
Send me my dashcam's SD card.

917
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:59,111
And find out when the store closed.

918
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,197
Is this a case? With a suspect?

919
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,532
Something like that. Thanks in advance.

920
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,951
I may be a divorce attorney,

921
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:08,245
but I've always wanted
to work on criminal cases.

922
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,166
Don't you worry.

923
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:26,889
Where'd you go?

924
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,058
I was on the phone.

925
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:30,851
What's it about?

926
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,770
I was calling Yang-gi.

927
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,232
Did anyone else call you?

928
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:38,609
Like who?

929
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,779
My mom or others.

930
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,950
Don't pick up any calls from my family.

931
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,701
Why not?

932
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:48,702
Just don't.

933
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:51,997
MOTHER-IN-LAW

934
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,090
Don't answer it.

935
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:04,510
I can't be stressed
when taking the injections.

936
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,638
POWER OFF

937
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,734
This is Moh Seul-hee.

938
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,111
It's Oh Sun-yeong.

939
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,905
What do you mean? It's Seul-hee.

940
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,618
She's Oh Sun-yeong
who died thirty years ago.

941
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:37,084
So this Oh Sun-yeong died 30 years ago.

942
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,336
-And she's actually Moh Seul-hee?
-Exactly.

943
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,675
Then where is the real Moh Seul-hee?

944
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,760
I'm not sure. However…

945
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:55,102
Sun-yeong was arrested for adultery
three years prior to her death,

946
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,438
and she gave birth behind bars.

947
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:00,482
She has a child?

948
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,320
Unbelievable.

949
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,822
IMPRISONED WHEN 4 MONTHS PREGNANT
GAVE BIRTH TO A BOY

950
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,286
Father, we should wait
until Hyun-woo comes.

951
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,746
Be quiet!

952
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,262
What?

953
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,348
-How dare he?
-What is it?

954
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,065
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

955
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:41,982
Goodness.

956
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,942
SIGNED BAEK HYUN-WOO
HONG HAE-IN

957
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:52,993
Do I need to pray?

958
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,332
The therapy results come out tomorrow.

959
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,210
I need all the luck I can get.

960
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:05,547
Why is there a long line?

961
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:08,425
Should we check it out?

962
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,844
You don't like to wait in line.

963
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,555
Right, I don't do that.

964
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,976
I'd feel like an ordinary person.
I hate that.

965
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,144
But?

966
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,229
But…

967
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,189
strangely enough,

968
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,234
I'd like to be ordinary for once.

969
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:30,697
I want to wait in line and just hope
that they'll still have a kebab

970
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,908
left for me.

971
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,371
Why don't you get in line?

972
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:38,956
I'll be back.

973
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,042
She needs…

974
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:27,880
all the luck she can get.

975
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,138
Can you still not reach them?

976
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,183
No, their phones are turned off.

977
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,935
-Jeez.
-A divorce?

978
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,730
I looked into him,

979
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:47,191
and the friend he met
the most often these days

980
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:50,944
was Kim Yang-gi, a divorce attorney.

981
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:54,156
That might not be anything,
but there's a bigger problem.

982
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,325
It's where Mr. Kim works.

983
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,368
-It's Apollon.
-What?

984
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,997
Isn't that Chairman Yeom's law firm?

985
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,167
Yes, so I'm worried
that Mr. Baek may have handed over

986
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,960
the bugged files to him.

987
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:11,798
That must mean Hyun-woo
was the whistleblower, right?

988
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,593
You shouldn't jump to conclusions.

989
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:15,511
She's right.

990
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,889
Hyun-woo doesn't know anything
about the secret fund.

991
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:21,016
I don't want to hear it. Call them.

992
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,768
Tell them to come home right now!

993
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,028
I found it.

994
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,531
It was still here.

995
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,720
Are you serious?

996
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,690
MOM

997
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,074
DAD

998
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:49,289
Hyun-woo.

999
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:51,958
I got it.

1000
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,763
What's that? What is he holding?

1001
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:08,684
MOM
NEW MESSAGE

1002
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,887
Hae-in, I found it. On my way here--

1003
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,620
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

1004
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,375
Tell me this isn't true.

1005
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,253
Say it.

1006
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,089
Deny it.

1007
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,218
-Hae-in--
-Say it.

1008
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:26,511
Tell me it's not true.

1009
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,767
Tell me it wasn't you.

1010
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:43,320
No.

1011
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:49,493
It was me.

1012
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:01,421
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

1013
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,624
-I'm okay. Take it.
-Mr. Baek--

1014
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:20,584
I'm really okay.

1015
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,210
But I--

1016
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:34,097
I have a driver.

1017
01:21:50,113 --> 01:21:51,448
Wait. Slow down.

1018
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:52,365
Sorry?

1019
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,075
Slow down a bit.

1020
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:39,287
You're happy to watch them from afar.
You can't stop thinking about them.

1021
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,123
You take a detour
just to see them once more.

1022
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,168
If you did those for the first time,
then that's your first love.

1023
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:56,596
Sir, please follow that bus.

1024
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,056
Sorry?

1025
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,266
That bus will cross the bridge.

1026
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,935
It's okay. Please follow it.

1027
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:29,898
QUEEN OF TEARS

1028
01:24:58,009 --> 01:24:59,761
You've given up everything?

1029
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:03,431
What will you do? Do something if you can!

1030
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,267
Stop playing. You disgust me.

1031
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:09,729
He bugged your room.

1032
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,397
But I can look past them.

1033
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:12,732
Why would you?

1034
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,651
She knows about the divorce.

1035
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:16,361
The Audit Team will do that.

1036
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,530
You will be kicked out mercilessly.

1037
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,574
-He sent the flowers to a Kim Min-ji.
-Where is she right now?

1038
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,951
How feisty.

1039
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:25,870
What if I replaced him?

1040
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,790
But please keep your distance
from Yoon Eun-sung.

1041
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,090
