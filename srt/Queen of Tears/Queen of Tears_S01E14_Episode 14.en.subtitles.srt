1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,117
THREE YEARS AGO

3
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,745
I mean, this is our honeymoon.

4
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,873
Why did you want to visit
a cemetery of all places?

5
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,249
You're really something.

6
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,088
I like how there's a cemetery
in the middle of a park.

7
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,008
You're not buried
in a mountain or scattered at sea.

8
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,594
You're resting near your home.

9
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,638
It makes death seem like nothing.

10
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,892
Perhaps.

11
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,281
Is it his wife's grave?

12
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,617
What? What do you mean?

13
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,078
The old man over there.

14
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,329
I don't see anyone.

15
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,291
He was just there.

16
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,169
Don't scare me like that.

17
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,255
You know

18
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,298
those husbands in movies

19
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,760
who bring their late wives
flowers every day.

20
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,720
He looked like one.

21
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,059
Keep this in mind.

22
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,896
I won't do anything like that for you.

23
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:29,732
You won't?

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,568
If you die before I do,

25
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,612
I'm going to live one more day

26
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,614
and then follow you.

27
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,993
Whatever.

28
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,536
It's true.

29
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,621
How will I ever live without you?

30
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,707
Whatever.

31
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,084
I mean it.

32
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,544
That's enough.

33
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,007
We put emphasis on our happy moments.

34
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,593
But we don't know

35
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,219
what the future holds for us.

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,223
So we make promises we can't keep

37
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,602
and laugh as if
these happy moments will last forever.

38
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,772
However, there is a dark side
behind those radiant moments.

39
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,735
When the magical moments disappeared

40
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,363
and hardships made me want to give up,

41
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,741
a thought crossed my mind.

42
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:27,040
"Sure. I've experienced many misfortunes,
but I still have you."

43
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,043
And that helped me endure.

44
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,891
However,

45
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,103
I had to make a brutal decision.

46
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,527
So…

47
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,530
you're telling me

48
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,992
to make a decision?

49
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,162
I'll lose my memory if I get it

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,622
and die if I don't.

51
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,667
Are you telling me
to pick the lesser evil?

52
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,171
-No.
-Then what?

53
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,217
Forget it.

54
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,135
I'll pretend like…

55
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,305
this was all a good dream.

56
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,698
Let me go. I said, let go.

57
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,450
Don't make a choice.

58
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,577
Don't think.

59
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,122
Just listen to me.

60
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,001
Just… live.

61
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,921
Do that.

62
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,049
Please…

63
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,135
live.

64
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,637
Okay?

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,435
Hae-in.

66
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,229
Please live.

67
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,277
At that moment, we had no idea

68
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,241
what was waiting for us on the other side.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,121
EPISODE 14

70
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,893
-Where are you going?
-To see Hae-in.

71
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,228
-She's in Germany for the surgery.
-That's why.

72
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,231
Hyun-woo is there with her,
so why would you go?

73
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,526
I have my own duties to fulfill.

74
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,529
Your duties
and what you must protect lie here.

75
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,324
Why are you obsessing
over a girl who's dying?

76
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,659
She's not dying.

77
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,413
The surgery will save her,
and she'll forget all the bad memories.

78
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,706
She'll start anew.

79
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,792
Do you think she'll give you a chance?

80
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,709
Do you disagree?

81
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,510
Beom-seok is getting ready
to take your spot.

82
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,554
Beom-jun has met directors
who favor him since returning.

83
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,139
The stockholders' meeting is soon.

84
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,517
You're going to ruin this all
just for Hae-in?

85
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,727
What's wrong with you?

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,648
You shouldn't have left me.

87
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,859
It's all because you abandoned me.

88
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,656
I wouldn't have been curious
about how great this family was

89
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,783
for you to abandon your own son

90
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,119
or have been jealous of Hae-in
and eventually…

91
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,913
fall in love with her.

92
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,916
What will it take for you to stop?

93
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,007
I can't stop.

94
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,845
Not until I die.

95
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,312
Fine.

96
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,442
Then let me help you.

97
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,747
Are you going to Frankfurt?

98
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,916
Yes.

99
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,841
BODY FOUND NEAR SAMBANG RESERVOIR
IDENTIFIED AS PYEON

100
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,387
How did you find me?

101
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,431
You go out every morning,
so I followed you.

102
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,560
At least you're trying hard.

103
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,937
For what?

104
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,107
You need to pray a lot
if you want to go to Heaven.

105
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,777
That way, we'll even meet

106
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,946
in the afterlife.

107
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,490
Is it a given that you'll go to Heaven?

108
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,701
Isn't that obvious?

109
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,039
I wasn't praying so I'd go to Heaven.

110
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,459
Then?

111
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,170
I prayed that you'd get the surgery.

112
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,008
I told God I wouldn't ask
that you remember everything.

113
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,387
I just prayed that you'd live.

114
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,272
What a useless prayer.

115
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,190
Let's go.

116
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,533
Should we write one too?

117
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,330
You'll write something useless.

118
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,873
Let's just go.

119
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,139
I've given you enough time to think.

120
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,767
We can't push it back any longer.

121
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,102
I booked an appointment,
so let's go after breakfast.

122
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,187
We need to go somewhere.

123
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,649
Where?

124
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,959
Recognize this place?

125
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,754
We came on our honeymoon.

126
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,005
We did.

127
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,424
You said it was pretty
and took tons of photos.

128
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,134
There was a pub nearby too.

129
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,220
We had beer and argued.

130
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,599
We did. You said
I was too cute when I got drunk

131
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,142
and told me not to act cute.

132
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,103
No.

133
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,480
I remember vividly.

134
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,274
I told you only to be cute in front of me,

135
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,486
but all the girls were staring at you.

136
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,656
I didn't know that. Why?
Because my eyes were only on you.

137
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,368
Is that so?

138
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,704
You said that then,
and I wasn't mad anymore.

139
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,540
Not right away.

140
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,501
You sulked for about two hours.

141
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,669
Anyway…

142
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,798
We passed this place
on our way back to the hotel

143
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,927
and saw a beautiful full moon.

144
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,057
You're right. It was big and gorgeous.

145
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,601
I still have the photo.

146
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,478
I still remember the smell,

147
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,148
the moon, and the wind

148
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,900
of that day.

149
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,487
That's what memories are.

150
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,282
Being alive means

151
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,243
I cherish those memories
and draw strength from them.

152
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,370
So those memories define me

153
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,164
and my life.

154
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,417
And I'll be losing them.

155
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,672
This place will just become
an ordinary field for me.

156
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,549
And you…

157
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,680
will become a stranger.

158
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,058
I'll no longer be myself.

159
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,939
That's why I'm not getting the surgery.

160
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,358
I've lived as myself,

161
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,487
and I'll die as such.

162
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,737
Gosh, Beom-ja. Are you insane?

163
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,863
What are you doing?

164
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,826
Where are you going? Back to Yongdu-ri?

165
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,329
Snap out of it. Go back home.

166
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,965
Hey, this is so wrong.

167
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,384
Let's just go shopping.

168
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,345
Let's go to a department store. Hi, Bixby.

169
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,430
-I'm listening.
-Yongdu-ri.

170
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,015
I've gone insane.

171
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,308
I actually came back.

172
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,476
Is this your home?

173
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,646
I should've slashed my tires.

174
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
Gosh, you idiot!

175
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,238
-You startled me!
-What are you doing here?

176
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,282
I know

177
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,535
you like walnut cakes.

178
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,579
-Do I?
-Yes.

179
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,081
-I brought some for you.
-I see.

180
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,249
But why are you here?

181
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,417
This is Yeong-song's house.

182
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,710
Really?

183
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,004
I got the wrong address.

184
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,298
Beom-ja.

185
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,216
What…

186
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,726
-Why--
-She came to see me.

187
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,603
She dotes on me.

188
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,148
Would you like to have some tea?

189
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,108
We have tasty plum tea.

190
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,693
-Should I--
-It's okay.

191
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,739
She came to see me.
She got the wrong address.

192
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,617
I'll see you around. Let's go. It's cold.

193
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,745
-All right.
-Still.

194
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,165
Have some tea
even if you didn't come here for me.

195
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,761
Have some madeleines too.
I just baked them.

196
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,137
Goodness.

197
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,806
Yeong-song.

198
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,476
Your view of life is so modern.

199
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,395
You only work the bare minimum?

200
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,981
We don't need much to live
as we think we do.

201
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,609
-What else do you do then?
-I read and listen to music.

202
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,403
I think I found it.

203
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,572
I always felt stifled
and wanted to run away

204
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,157
when I lived in Seoul.

205
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,451
I'll stay here with Da-hye and Geon-u.

206
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,078
I'm going to work little

207
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,871
-and be very happy.
-You?

208
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,082
-As if.
-It'll be hard for you.

209
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,709
She's extremely materialistic unlike me.

210
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,462
Hey, I'm not.

211
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,380
You're wrong.

212
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,799
She only carries handbags
worth tens of millions.

213
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,926
One ring costs the same
as an entire apartment.

214
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,052
Do such rings exist?

215
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,304
And that's not all.

216
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,056
How much was that watch again?

217
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,307
-Two hundred million?
-Hey!

218
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,480
I'm enjoying this too.

219
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,691
I like having homemade plum tea,

220
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,611
madeleines, and reading and listening
to music without a worry in the world.

221
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,529
I see.

222
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,034
Yes, what is it?

223
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,371
All right. Bye.

224
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,332
Mom and Dad are here.

225
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,835
Why do they keep coming?
Da-hye will feel uncomfortable.

226
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,128
I'll call you later.

227
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,296
-Okay.
-Let's go, Aunt Beom-ja!

228
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,132
-I should get going then.
-Okay.

229
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,302
Come by again.

230
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,368
Come again. I'll bake more madeleines.

231
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,452
I wanted to go back to the hotel.

232
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,997
The professor is waiting.

233
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,542
You should at least talk to him.

234
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,338
Your parents are waiting too.

235
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,509
They want to do a video call.

236
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,813
-Where's Da-hye?
-She went out with Geon-u for a stroll.

237
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,939
It's cold out.

238
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,149
I think she was uncomfortable
to see my parents.

239
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,068
Hey, are you not going to greet us?

240
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,739
What's this about?

241
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,741
Hae-in is refusing to get the surgery.

242
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,826
What?

243
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,577
She's refusing?

244
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,415
How about we tug at her heartstrings?

245
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,917
-Her heartstrings?
-Let's beg.

246
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,253
"If you die, I'll die."

247
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,216
You don't know her well.
She'll say, "Do as you please."

248
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,717
No way.

249
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,221
She'll know that we're bluffing.
Threatening her won't work.

250
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,015
She's smart since she takes after me.

251
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,435
Then how about we take a logical approach?

252
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,353
How?

253
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:11,567
There are times when harvesting pears
becomes difficult due to severe blight

254
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,443
even if we use expensive pesticides.

255
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,405
But their roots will rot
if we don't spray them at all.

256
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,407
-You're at a crossroads.
-Exactly.

257
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,702
Even though we anticipate a huge loss,
we choose to spray them anyway

258
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,496
since we need to save the roots

259
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,831
for the upcoming year.

260
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:30,252
So you choose to save them
despite suffering a loss. I like that.

261
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,046
Then let's do this.

262
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,756
First, we'll try to be logical.

263
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,260
If we fail, you'll step up and scold her.

264
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,512
"Take care of the body
your parents gave you."

265
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,140
"I may not have given birth to you,
but I'm still your father."

266
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,351
Then you can support him and say,
"Let's just all die together."

267
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,937
And then… Okay.

268
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,069
-Hae-in.
-Yes, Mother.

269
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,489
Ma'am, the pear story.

270
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,158
The pears. Pesticides.

271
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,663
Goodness.

272
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,292
I have a runny nose. You can go first.

273
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,668
Then I'll take over.

274
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,629
Hae-in, you should

275
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,047
think this through.

276
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,715
This will benefit you.

277
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,928
You'll lose your good memories,
but the bad ones too.

278
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,095
Why do you think I drink?

279
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,849
I drown myself in alcohol
to forget the painful memories.

280
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,809
But they keep coming back.

281
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,480
So wouldn't it be a good thing
to forget them forever?

282
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,524
You're not persuading her.

283
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,780
Hae-in.

284
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,282
You must've been shocked.

285
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,702
Don't get mad at Hyun-woo.
I told him to keep it from you.

286
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,247
I'm sorry we didn't tell you.

287
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,166
We were afraid you'd refuse to go.

288
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,502
It's okay.

289
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,587
I would've done the same.

290
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,547
After learning about your illness,

291
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,968
I reached out
to hospitals around the world.

292
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:06,098
And they all said the same thing.
They were already in touch with Hyun-woo.

293
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,225
He had sent

294
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,436
hundreds of emails

295
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,941
and called the U.S. and European hospitals
in the middle of the night

296
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,194
to find labs or hospitals
that could save you.

297
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,372
That's how he found that hospital.

298
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,958
So, Hae-in,

299
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,919
please think this through and…

300
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,215
Think? She should focus on living first.

301
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,383
Don't you agree?

302
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,262
Your memories won't matter
if you die, right?

303
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,180
At least…

304
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,227
you'll remember me as a daughter
who had a good relationship

305
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,188
with you.

306
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,733
But after the surgery,

307
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,694
I might turn into a stranger.

308
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,033
The Hae-in who used to argue
so much with you

309
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,204
before tearfully reconciling
will be gone.

310
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,915
I won't recognize you anymore.

311
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,550
Please understand.

312
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm sorry.

313
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,931
Okay. Let's hang up.

314
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,561
Rest up, and we'll talk again soon. Okay?

315
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,773
-Wait--
-Why did you turn it off?

316
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,566
She didn't give us an answer yet.

317
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,652
Will you take responsibility
if she refuses the surgery?

318
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,446
Gosh, did you really turn it off?

319
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,031
I wanted to talk to her too.

320
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,949
Why would you?

321
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,660
She already has a lot on her mind.

322
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,707
Are you crying, Dad?

323
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,959
He's crying.

324
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,839
You're making me cry now.

325
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,217
Goodness.

326
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,886
Everyone is crying.

327
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,644
Call her back and persuade her.

328
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,021
What can I say?

329
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,397
We should do something.

330
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,507
Geon-u.

331
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,218
Let's go around one more time.

332
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,023
What brings you here?

333
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,984
Shouldn't you apologize first?

334
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,863
-I guess you're not sorry.
-Not to you.

335
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,073
But I'm sorry to my family.

336
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,158
Your family?

337
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,744
You're totally mistaken.

338
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,662
Da-hye.

339
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,372
Don't try to change.

340
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,166
But I want to.

341
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,877
No, do what you've always done

342
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,503
and scam those around you.

343
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,297
If not, that so-called family of yours

344
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,174
-will get hurt.
-What do you mean?

345
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,801
Stay here if you're curious.

346
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,429
I came to warn you
since I respect the history

347
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,555
we've shared together.

348
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,639
But…

349
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,975
I can't give you much time.

350
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,853
Give me the USB that you took from Jun-ho

351
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,689
and leave with your son.

352
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,485
You shouldn't have come here.

353
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,446
You should've just stayed in the U.S.

354
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,697
I get what you're saying,

355
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,700
so don't you dare harm Soo-cheol
or my family.

356
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,744
I won't sit still if you do.

357
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,953
What'll you do?

358
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,999
I'll give the USB
to the police or the prosecution.

359
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,292
Let's go down together.

360
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,252
You shouldn't say that as a mom.

361
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,795
Who'll look after Geon-u?

362
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,381
Will this family
take care of a kid who's not theirs?

363
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,675
Hey!

364
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,471
Why are you out in the cold?

365
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,723
Geon-u might catch a cold.

366
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,807
Seon-hwa.

367
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,978
Do you even know who Da-hye really is?

368
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,608
It doesn't matter.

369
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,152
My son is refusing to let her go.

370
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,332
Hae-in.

371
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm left with only two valuable things

372
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,574
in this life you've given me.

373
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,411
The memories of loving others

374
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,538
and being loved back.

375
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,332
I can't let go of them.

376
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,045
I won't ask you to save me.

377
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,130
But please,

378
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,715
let me cherish

379
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,135
these memories until my last breath.

380
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,041
Hae-in.

381
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,440
Hae-in, I'm sorry.

382
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,692
I'm sorry.

383
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,904
Don't do this to me.

384
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,325
Don't make me want to live.

385
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,212
I won't be able to recognize you.

386
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,675
I'll become a stranger.

387
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,979
Even if that's the case,

388
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,691
I'll be the first person you meet.

389
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,279
Then you'll fall in love with me again.

390
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,783
Your heart will race again
when I get drunk and act cute.

391
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,828
We can love once again.

392
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,342
I'll be by your side

393
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,594
even if…

394
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,639
you don't fall for me,

395
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,974
ignore me,

396
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,434
or…

397
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,979
dislike me.

398
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,858
I made a promise.

399
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,988
That I'd stay by your side…

400
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,449
even if you had debt…

401
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,703
or something more.

402
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,789
So…

403
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,709
don't worry

404
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,753
and just stay here, please.

405
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,089
Don't pray

406
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,924
about dying.

407
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,303
I'm terrified…

408
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,058
that it'll come true.

409
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,486
Hae-in.

410
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,463
I need to go to the toilet.

411
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,799
Go eat first.

412
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,303
What are you doing?

413
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,433
What do you mean?

414
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,022
You never drink coffee
on an empty stomach,

415
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,857
but you're having espresso?

416
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,527
Are you reading
that English newspaper to look smart

417
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,364
while intentionally flexing
your forearm muscles?

418
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,580
That's right.

419
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,050
Yes, I'm doing this intentionally.

420
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,138
Hold on.

421
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,975
Are you acting freely
since we haven't registered our marriage?

422
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,438
You're married,
so quit trying to impress others.

423
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,024
Roll down your sleeves,
fasten the buttons,

424
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,443
and have some scrambled eggs
with some ketchup.

425
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,076
I don't want to.

426
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,579
-Why not?
-I'm going to get under your skin.

427
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,873
What?

428
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,376
You said I'd be a waste.

429
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,382
You'd be the biggest waste.

430
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,848
Did you

431
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,142
hear that?

432
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,063
I'm going to make it unbearable for you

433
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,190
to leave me behind.

434
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,781
I should have some fruit.

435
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,173
He'd still be the biggest waste.

436
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,931
The DNA test result is out.

437
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:45,059
The victim's blood
was on the car seat and the murder weapon.

438
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,769
And the prints on the weapon?

439
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,604
Here it is. It's this guy.

440
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,656
Roll down your sleeves and button them.

441
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,868
You shouldn't show off
your arms like that.

442
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,661
-It's my choice.
-Hey.

443
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,745
Roll them down.

444
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,998
-No.
-Do it.

445
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:07,915
I don't want to.

446
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,057
How's Ms. Hong's treatment going?

447
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,601
-Will she be reinstated?
-Of course.

448
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,145
Will she take charge once again?

449
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,606
Well, I'm not sure about that.

450
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,609
We're all suffering here.

451
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,069
You can tell if a company is going down

452
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,905
based on the cafeteria and the pantry.

453
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,074
It did shock me when they got rid
of the coffee machine.

454
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,868
Did you go to the cafeteria today?

455
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,245
They even stopped giving
Yakult as dessert.

456
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,083
The company doesn't care
about our gut health anymore.

457
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,755
I know our fates depend on our bosses,
but shouldn't we do something?

458
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,257
I'm not sure

459
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,219
if Secretary Kim feels the same way.

460
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,971
-Why me?
-You played

461
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,307
a key role in the current management.

462
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,809
You're mistaken. I just ran a few errands.

463
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,062
And you were rewarded.

464
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,438
I was.

465
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,565
-But it didn't feel good.
-Why not?

466
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,027
Director Baek has been
awfully kind and forgiving.

467
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,447
He paid for my sibling's college tuition,
so I couldn't be too happy.

468
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,699
That's your guilt talking.

469
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,952
Not all rewards are great.

470
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,161
You're getting a call.

471
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,372
Hello?

472
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,207
Yes, it's me.

473
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,333
What? Where?

474
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,008
Pyeon Seong-uk was found dead.

475
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,802
He was murdered.

476
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,719
Are you serious?

477
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,888
The news broke out
when you left for Germany.

478
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,098
I just found out too.

479
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,935
All right.

480
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,733
Sir, I tracked down the suspect.

481
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,693
What?

482
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,945
He fled to Frankfurt after the incident.

483
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,071
I tracked down

484
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,781
-his current location too.
-Okay.

485
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,993
Let's request a warrant
and send it to the Foreign Affairs Bureau.

486
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,828
It'll be a headache if he vanishes abroad.

487
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,121
Yes, sir.

488
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,330
Hey.

489
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,124
This should be confidential.

490
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,501
Don't let the media find out
before we catch him.

491
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,877
Yes, sir. I'm aware.

492
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,134
-I met with Da-hye.
-Sorry?

493
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,677
You could've just sent me.

494
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,220
I didn't know she was so dumb.

495
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,763
I told you.

496
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,182
-She fell for Soo-cheol.
-So I called Jun-ho.

497
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,268
Why would you call that scumbag?

498
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,604
So he can take care of her?

499
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,065
I spared her out of pity,
and she's causing problems.

500
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,650
I'll get rid of them one by one.

501
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,408
Did you send those men to Germany recently

502
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,118
to take care of someone?

503
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,412
They won't be coming back.

504
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:56,083
Wire them money when they call
and find a place for them to stay.

505
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,043
Yes, ma'am.

506
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,020
Why won't they return?

507
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,398
How serious is their crime
that they're not coming back?

508
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,029
Hey, Ko Jeong-ja.

509
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,949
Don't be naive.
You know what's going to happen.

510
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,873
I think she's going to harm Hae-in.

511
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,100
60,000,000,000 WON

512
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,521
Get a grip.

513
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,857
No one is better than you
at tolerating injustice.

514
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,027
Yes.

515
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,196
Just forget about it.

516
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,006
Hello?

517
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,595
Hello?

518
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,681
It's me, Grace.

519
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,516
Hello. What's this about?

520
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,851
I'm just saying hello.

521
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,227
Is everyone doing well?

522
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,897
-Sorry?
-I guess they are.

523
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,274
I'm glad then.

524
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,360
Continue to stay safe until you return.

525
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,570
Goodbye, then.

526
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,622
Hae…

527
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,917
Hae-in…

528
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,668
Hae-in.

529
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,379
Hae-in.

530
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,930
Hae-in!

531
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,102
Hello? There's been a car accident.

532
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,313
I think it was a hit-and-run.

533
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,231
Hae-in…

534
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,733
Hae-in!

535
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,070
I reported it!

536
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,114
Oh, my God. Step back!

537
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,284
The car could explode! Get back!

538
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:20,788
Hyun-woo!

539
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,060
What's going on?

540
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,563
Calm down. Okay?

541
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,731
Did you get in a car crash? How?

542
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,527
Even still…

543
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,404
Are you crazy?

544
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,740
How could you break the window
with your bare hand? Look at this!

545
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,994
Look at your hand!

546
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,927
I thought you were dead.

547
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,568
I'm…

548
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,194
I'm…

549
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,904
I'm relieved.

550
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,414
It's okay.

551
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,083
It's okay.

552
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,378
Everything's okay.

553
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,019
EMERGENCY ROOM

554
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,564
Are you okay?

555
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,441
It hurts.

556
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,113
You shouldn't have acted like a lunatic.

557
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,948
I really was one

558
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,285
since I witnessed the crash.

559
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,204
I thought you were in the car.

560
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,374
When did you get out?

561
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,002
I guess lady luck does exist.

562
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,266
Look.

563
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,893
I bought it again.

564
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,479
It was still just as expensive.

565
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,563
But this

566
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,649
saved my life.

567
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,908
Will you sob like that if I die?

568
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:03,826
Of course.

569
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,497
Then that won't do.

570
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,000
What do you mean?

571
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,421
You tug too much at my heartstrings.

572
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,256
You make people want to hug you.

573
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,259
You look sexy with your sleeves up,
you're cute when you're drunk,

574
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,845
and you make others want to hug you
when you're crying.

575
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,139
Women will be lining up.

576
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,558
And I won't allow that.

577
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,227
I'd be turning in my grave.

578
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,187
What are you saying?

579
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,191
I'll get the surgery.

580
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,241
Do you mean that?

581
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,247
I'm terrified because I don't know

582
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,625
if I'll just lose my memory
or who I am entirely.

583
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,837
But I don't want to lose you.

584
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,555
I don't want to see you cry anymore.

585
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,016
I persuaded you
into marrying me by promising

586
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,018
that I'd never make you cry.

587
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,271
I should start keeping my promise.

588
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,280
Thank you.

589
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,782
I understand how you must feel.

590
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,578
You must be extremely anxious

591
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,538
and terrified.

592
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,416
But you will never

593
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,168
lose yourself.

594
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,462
I won't let that happen.

595
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,130
I'll help you stay

596
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,549
who you are.

597
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,593
Okay.

598
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,261
All right.

599
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,388
I trust you.

600
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,189
Gosh, Pinky. You eat so well.

601
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,232
Is it tasty?

602
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,816
-Let's talk.
-No thanks.

603
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,984
What's with you?

604
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,611
The building was always my turf.

605
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,655
This could cause a rift between us.

606
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,158
-I think I'm getting divorced.
-What?

607
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,245
Are you tired
of living far from your family?

608
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,580
Of course.

609
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,917
I don't know when my husband
will get his doctorate.

610
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,170
I sent my son abroad
to broaden his horizons.

611
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,925
And I think he's too busy to miss me.

612
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,218
Then go live with them.

613
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,594
Then who'll be the breadwinner?

614
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,221
I can't rely on Hyun-woo forever.

615
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,681
So you'll get a divorce?

616
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,891
-That's not why.
-Then?

617
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,894
-I think he's having an affair.
-What?

618
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,272
An American woman answered his phone.

619
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,856
And it was late at night.

620
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,705
Why would you give such a lousy reply?

621
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,874
Beats me.

622
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,129
I just blurted it out
the moment she talked.

623
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,173
Jeez, he's really smart.

624
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,635
He intentionally chose an American woman.

625
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,723
He knew you barely spoke the language
and couldn't confront them.

626
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,807
Gosh.

627
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:16,310
It's true that I can't confront them

628
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,146
or go there myself.

629
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,439
HAIRSTYLIST AWARDS

630
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,317
I have to remain here.

631
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,402
So please help me.

632
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,486
Goodness.

633
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,574
Fine.

634
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,035
You can have the building.

635
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,494
It's all yours.

636
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,122
Thanks.

637
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,544
Gosh, don't cry.

638
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,714
I'll give him an earful
when I see that scumbag.

639
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,716
How could he date an American woman?

640
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,885
Jeez.

641
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,180
Welcome.

642
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,306
Hello.

643
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,682
Where's Du-gwan?

644
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,601
He's at the market.

645
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,270
He seems busy these days,
so I said I'd take over his store.

646
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,481
-I see. So you're part-timing?
-"Part-timing"?

647
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,358
No.

648
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,859
I'm experienced.

649
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,153
I used to be the CEO
of a mart franchise in Seoul.

650
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,697
-I see.
-This is like Unexpected Business.

651
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,699
What is that?

652
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,368
It's that variety show

653
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,994
with Cha Tae-hyun and Zo In-sung.

654
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,704
They manage a store.

655
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,373
You're right.

656
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:22,834
That's it!

657
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,002
All right.

658
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,170
SNOW CRAB RAMYEON
3,500 WON

659
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,089
Goodness, look at this.

660
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,132
This is a feast.

661
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,051
Gosh.

662
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,805
It wasn't easy
to get these snow crabs from Uljin.

663
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,139
Express delivery was expensive.

664
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,683
Shouldn't you charge more

665
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,852
than the regular ramyeon price
of 3,500 won?

666
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,397
I'm not trying to make a profit.

667
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,356
Then what?

668
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,735
Chapter One of my book,
The Neighborhood Business King,

669
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,698
is "Ask Your Neighbors for Love,
Not Money."

670
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,199
You wrote a book?

671
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,284
I will, based on this experience.

672
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,747
This looks amazing.

673
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,332
-There's abalone inside too.
-Gosh!

674
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,667
-Goodness.
-Abalone?

675
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,669
-Hey.
-I heard the news.

676
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,421
They're filming Unexpected Business here?

677
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,672
Is In-sung here?

678
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,173
No, he's not.

679
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,508
But there's snow crab ramyeon.

680
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,052
There's abalone too,
and it's only 3,500 won.

681
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,595
-It's a bang for the buck.
-Right.

682
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,472
I'd like a double portion.

683
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,224
-Okay.
-Can I have a bite?

684
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,475
Thanks.

685
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,858
You know what? I'm going to invite
my mom and all the ladies.

686
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,443
Should we tell our kids to come too?

687
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,611
-Yes, we should.
-All right.

688
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,696
Look here, In-sung.

689
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,156
Come on. I'm working.

690
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,577
You're making me feel embarrassed.

691
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,756
-Enjoy.
-Why, thank you.

692
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,215
Goodness. I told you to rest.

693
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,385
I know, but I just can't.

694
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,304
What's going on?

695
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,722
It's a huge hit.

696
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,140
I didn't expect it either.

697
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,142
Check this out.

698
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,145
I've emptied out your ramyeon aisle.

699
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,022
-I can see that.
-They all love it.

700
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:09,441
Someone had three servings at once.

701
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,359
Chun-sik's entire family came by

702
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,196
and had their lunch and dinner's worth.

703
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,364
Chun-sik, that bastard.

704
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,657
-Sorry?
-Look.

705
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,742
Listen to me.

706
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,704
You won't be making a profit
considering the snow crabs, abalone,

707
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,790
shrimp, and the delivery fee, you know?

708
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,249
We're in debt.

709
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,252
No, this is just a marketing strategy.

710
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,256
I'm sorry for all the inconvenience,

711
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,009
but I feel the most guilty
about leaving him behind.

712
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,805
It feels like leaving
a bag of trash behind

713
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,139
after a trip.

714
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,141
He was warning me.

715
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,976
We're not making a profit from ramyeon.

716
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,230
Our goal is to make them
spend money on something more expensive.

717
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:53,360
Ramyeon is
the most expensive food we have.

718
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,156
I see.

719
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,582
I totally overlooked that.

720
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,252
So did you get fired?

721
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,797
I took responsibility and resigned.

722
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,342
Stop causing inconveniences
and go back to Seoul.

723
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,220
No.

724
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,599
I'm going to continue interacting
with the consumers here

725
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:29,104
and find a way for farmers
and big marts to coexist.

726
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,657
Did you think stealing my passport
would prevent me from coming to Korea?

727
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,700
Where are you?

728
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:45,036
Ms. Moh told me
that you're hiding in Hyun-woo's hometown.

729
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,372
Should I go there right now? Should I?

730
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,790
No, please don't do that.

731
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,417
I'm sorry.

732
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,710
If you want to save Soo-cheol,

733
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:54,880
meet me at the address I sent
with everything you stole.

734
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,214
I won't repeat myself.

735
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,887
There's an amusement park nearby.

736
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,930
Should we go there tomorrow?

737
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,641
I'm down. I'll make gimbap.

738
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,352
Geon-u, we're going to an amusement park!

739
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,395
An amusement park!

740
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,942
Aren't you fascinated?

741
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,860
What is this?

742
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,029
Where's Mommy?

743
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,196
There she is.

744
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,281
Hi, Mommy.

745
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:30,874
Geon-u, Mommy's here!

746
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,502
Let's eat.

747
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,005
-How tasty.
-How tasty.

748
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,175
-Is it good?
-It's good.

749
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,346
Geon-u, look at me.

750
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,057
Good boy. Well done.

751
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:47,974
Geon-u.

752
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,601
Good boy.

753
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,605
I'm tired.

754
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,608
-Can you buy me some coffee?
-Coffee?

755
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:58,610
Wait here. I'll get some.

756
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,530
It's chilly, right?

757
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,288
Okay. Your hand.

758
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,398
-I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

759
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,218
I'm sorry.

760
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,778
Did she go to the toilet?

761
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,389
Da-hye…

762
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,724
Da-hye!

763
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,394
Da-hye!

764
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,022
Da…

765
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,442
Da-hye!

766
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:04,986
Da-hye!

767
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,238
Da-hye…

768
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,533
Da-hye…

769
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,620
Da-hye…

770
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,292
Why did you leave me again?

771
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,175
This is a public announcement.

772
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:31,971
Mr. Hong Soo-cheol, 31,
is looking for his wife.

773
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,766
Please come to the Lost Children Center…

774
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,936
-What? But he's an adult.
-…as soon as you hear this.

775
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,395
Once again--

776
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,480
Da-hye.

777
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,899
Please, don't go.

778
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:44,818
I…

779
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,403
I'll do better.

780
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,367
I promise.

781
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,577
So please don't leave.

782
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,289
What? Did his wife
abandon him here and run away?

783
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,708
No way. He was abandoned.

784
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:04,295
He must be a loser
for her to leave him here.

785
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,421
He's not a loser.

786
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,549
Sorry?

787
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:09,092
He's not a loser.

788
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,469
My husband

789
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,471
is the most amazing man ever.

790
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,607
It's okay. Let's go.

791
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,422
Where did you go after leaving me?

792
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,841
What are you doing here?

793
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,354
You're making it hard for me to leave.

794
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,525
Why are you doing this?

795
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,621
It's my last night here.

796
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,831
Don't give it any meaning.

797
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,500
You'll always be yourself.

798
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,379
Nevertheless,

799
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,131
this is your chance.

800
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,258
-For what?
-To come clean.

801
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,303
I'll forget everything after the surgery.

802
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,138
So?

803
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,808
Complaints you had.

804
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,894
Times when you felt hurt.

805
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,604
Things you couldn't tell me.

806
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:50,688
Stuff like that.

807
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,359
You can be honest with me now.

808
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,073
Forget it.

809
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:04,327
I've fallen for that one too many times.

810
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,496
Come on.

811
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,539
I'll forget them anyway.

812
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,255
Forget it.

813
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,469
So…

814
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,514
you do have some things.

815
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,851
Don't try to sound me out.

816
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,941
What do you have to lose?

817
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,860
I'll be getting surgery soon,
so what's stopping you?

818
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:39,570
Tell me.

819
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,532
What?

820
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,702
-Nothing?
-I'm trying to pick.

821
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,790
There must be a lot.

822
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:51,958
Not really.

823
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,260
I'm only saying this

824
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,554
because you told me to.

825
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,558
You tend to change

826
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,143
your mind often.

827
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,602
What do you mean?

828
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,438
I'll give you an example.

829
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,482
You wanted me to remember our anniversary,

830
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,734
so I prepared a surprise.

831
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,361
Then you got mad about it,

832
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,572
but you also got mad
when I didn't prepare anything.

833
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,824
Everything in moderation.

834
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,743
But that's your standard.

835
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,163
I don't know what you're thinking,
so how would I know?

836
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,623
-That's--
-Also, I'd like you to hear me out

837
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,084
without getting mad when I talk to you.

838
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,836
I'm good at that.

839
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:37,962
You're mad even now.

840
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,340
No, I'm listening attentively.

841
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,050
I always frown when I listen.

842
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,135
Also…

843
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,720
You have a whole list.

844
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:46,971
I love you.

845
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,604
-What?
-I said I love you.

846
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,610
You told me to say things
that I couldn't say before.

847
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,156
I did say that.

848
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,785
Keep talking. Say what's on your mind.

849
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:10,244
Keep going.

850
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,251
Thank you for making

851
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,670
this hard decision.

852
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,299
Don't get sick

853
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,592
or hurt anymore.

854
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,303
Stay by my side forever.

855
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,976
Let's go on trips.

856
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,728
Let's take walks.

857
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,480
Let's work out.

858
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,190
Let's argue and make up.

859
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,235
Let's do ordinary things

860
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,362
and grow old together.

861
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,327
This is so unfair.

862
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,956
I'll forget all these sweet words too.

863
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:57,458
It's okay.

864
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,210
I'll say them again.

865
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,503
I'll say them every day.

866
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,132
Hold on.

867
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,061
Well…

868
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,190
I wrote down everything I could think of

869
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,234
about myself,

870
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,696
you, and the life I've lived.

871
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,115
I hope this will guide me

872
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,492
in my next life.

873
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:35,079
But I'll forget that I even have this.

874
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,456
So keep it

875
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,166
and give it to me.

876
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,213
By the way,

877
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,299
when did you write this?

878
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,218
-Don't read it now.
-Okay.

879
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,970
You can read it

880
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:54,390
while you wait for me to wake up

881
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,100
after the surgery.

882
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,353
Okay.

883
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:02,356
Don't change anything.
Don't make yourself sound better.

884
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,358
All right.

885
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,405
Come here.

886
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:53,699
Hold on.

887
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,953
Was the surgery at 10:00 a.m. in Germany?

888
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,206
It's in ten minutes. Goodness.

889
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,792
She'll be fine. Don't worry.

890
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,836
Okay. Stop shaking your leg.

891
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,754
Okay.

892
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,635
Honey.

893
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,262
Paengsun…

894
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,431
-is alive.
-What?

895
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,351
Really? The snail with no shell?

896
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,936
Wasn't she dying?

897
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,438
It's a miracle.

898
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:26,816
It is.

899
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,195
Gosh, Seon-hwa. This is a good sign.

900
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:33,906
Do you think so?

901
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,824
Yes.

902
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:36,325
Of course.

903
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,121
Hae-in's surgery will go well.

904
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:52,800
Wait.

905
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,849
You won't go anywhere, right?

906
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:01,976
Of course not.

907
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,687
You need to be by my side
when I open my eyes.

908
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,731
It's like imprinting.

909
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,234
I'm going to be
like a newly hatched duckling.

910
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:12,028
I'll trust whomever I see first.

911
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,781
Don't worry.

912
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,535
I'll stay by your side
from the moment you open your eyes

913
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,370
until you get sick of me.

914
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:25,916
What if I don't remember anything
or recognize you?

915
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,836
What if I mistreat you?

916
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,258
It won't be my first rodeo.

917
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,179
That won't matter at all.

918
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,306
Just get the surgery

919
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,391
and come back.

920
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,812
Make sure you come back.

921
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,189
I'll be back.

922
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,524
Please take care of me

923
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,651
when I return.

924
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,114
I'll be back.

925
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,537
HAE-IN HONG, IN SURGERY

926
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,788
IN RECOVERY

927
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:41,844
Mr. Baek Hyun-woo?

928
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:46,932
Who are you?

929
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,436
I'm Detective Kang Min-wook
from the German police force.

930
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,396
What is this about?

931
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,149
You're under arrest
for the murder of Mr. Pyeon Seong-uk.

932
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,986
What do you mean? I'm a murder suspect?

933
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,906
You have the right to remain silent
and hire an attorney.

934
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:05,117
You can also file a complaint
if you think this arrest is unjust.

935
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:07,995
Wait.

936
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,872
This is a misunderstanding.

937
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:10,915
Give me some time.

938
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,333
We can talk at the station.

939
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,250
Let's go.

940
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,754
Wait!

941
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,672
My wife is in surgery.

942
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,299
I need to be there when she wakes up.

943
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,176
Give me just 30 minutes.

944
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,345
I promised to be there!

945
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,055
I have to be there!

946
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,027
Don't worry.

947
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,529
I'll be her guardian.

948
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,156
Was this your scheme?

949
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,533
What scheme?

950
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:47,493
I'm just protecting

951
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,537
my woman from a criminal.

952
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:02,758
Hae…

953
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,094
Hae-in.

954
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,429
Hae-in!

955
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:08,973
Hae-in.

956
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:11,016
Hae-in!

957
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,646
Hae-in!

958
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,233
Hae…

959
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,319
Hae-in.

960
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:28,784
Hae-in.

961
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,542
Baek, the former director
of Queens' Legal Team,

962
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,876
-was arrested in Frankfurt
-Mom.

963
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,421
as the key suspect
in the reservoir murder that occurred

964
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:43,007
in Sambang, Yeongjin-gun,
Gyeonggi Province last month.

965
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:46,635
The police joined forces
with Interpol to arrest him

966
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,220
and plan to request an arrest warrant

967
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,347
for murder as soon
as he is brought to Korea.

968
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:55,102
Wait. If Hyun-woo was arrested,
who is with Hae-in right now?

969
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:56,562
What?

970
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,234
Where's the number he gave us?

971
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,153
Hold on.

972
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:06,572
Beom-jun, here.

973
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,573
GERMAN HOSPITAL

974
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:09,742
Here it is.

975
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,293
The hospital told me that you called.

976
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,670
Don't worry. I'm by her side.

977
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,756
The surgery went well,

978
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,549
and she'll recover soon.

979
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,301
We'll be there soon.

980
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:28,886
Right.

981
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,221
-I don't think so.
-What?

982
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:33,223
What do you mean?

983
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,142
I guess you haven't heard.

984
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,686
I wanted to wait out of respect

985
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,855
until Chairman Hong's funeral ended.

986
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:41,565
But I couldn't turn a blind eye

987
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:44,318
to your embezzlement and malpractice.

988
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,487
The prosecution will begin
their investigation soon,

989
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,280
so you won't be able to fly out.

990
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,198
You bastard!

991
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,575
I'll take care of Hae-in
and return to Korea.

992
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:52,493
So…

993
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,121
leave her to me.

994
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:09,301
It's actually more

995
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,386
of a request.

996
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,349
A divorce withdrawal.

997
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:23,982
That's a good date. October 31.

998
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,161
Since the universe

999
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,414
is on our side…

1000
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,331
Will you…

1001
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:42,835
marry me?

1002
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,890
You'll be by my side?

1003
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:57,850
Yes.

1004
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,060
I'll be there

1005
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:01,728
for you.

1006
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,653
Dear Hae-in from the future.

1007
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,655
I won't ask how you're doing since I know

1008
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:12,865
you'll be doing fine.

1009
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,492
You'll be just as pretty, healthy,

1010
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,578
and the most successful.

1011
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,204
With Hyun-woo

1012
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,457
by your side, of course.

1013
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:13,509
Are you finally awake?

1014
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:22,559
Don't. You'll exhaust yourself.
Let me talk.

1015
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,648
You're probably confused
and don't know who you are.

1016
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:28,565
It's normal.

1017
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:31,902
You just woke up from a major surgery.

1018
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:35,197
A tumor was removed from your brain.

1019
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:37,449
That's why you can't remember.

1020
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,369
You asked me for a favor
before the surgery.

1021
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:42,996
You asked me to be here when you woke up.

1022
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,707
That's why I stayed here the entire time.

1023
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,503
Baek Hyun-woo?

1024
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:33,463
What is it?

1025
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,133
Do you remember that name?

1026
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:38,010
That's the only name I remember.

1027
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:41,930
I'm not him.

1028
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,143
You're Hong Hae-in.

1029
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:47,644
I'm Yoon Eun-sung.

1030
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,525
We started dating in college.

1031
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,320
We had parted ways,
but we still love each other.

1032
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,489
Baek Hyun-woo

1033
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:00,866
is your ex-husband.

1034
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:02,576
I was

1035
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:04,911
married?

1036
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,708
I didn't want to alarm you
when you've just woken up,

1037
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,461
but he had completely deceived you.

1038
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:13,962
That's why you divorced him.

1039
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,214
I got a divorce?

1040
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,385
He had stalked you until recently,

1041
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,930
but he's been arrested
by Interpol as a murder suspect.

1042
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,601
You must be startled. I'm sorry.

1043
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,313
You probably remember his name

1044
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,690
because of how much you suffered.

1045
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,817
That's probably why.

1046
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,155
Don't think about anything
and just rest up.

1047
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:41,782
I'll bring the doctor.

1048
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,871
I didn't think I'd ever see winter again

1049
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,791
let alone the first snow.

1050
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,668
But it's possible now.

1051
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,086
Of course.

1052
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,716
And it'll come true
if the color still remains by then.

1053
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:43,677
What will come true?

1054
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:45,762
My first love.

1055
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,113
She must be awake by now.

1056
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,214
It's snowing.

1057
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:17,854
Is this the first snow?

1058
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:50,971
What's wrong with me?

1059
01:20:52,472 --> 01:20:53,473
What?

1060
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,736
It's so painful.

1061
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:55,493
You used to tell me about those days
you were in law school.

1062
01:21:57,871 --> 01:21:58,914
Yeah?

1063
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:01,333
You always bragged about your good memory.

1064
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,001
And?

1065
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,588
What was your secret to memorizing well?

1066
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,382
I'm not sure.

1067
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,843
I was able to easily remember

1068
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:15,180
anything I looked at.

1069
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,140
I'm serious.

1070
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:21,061
Did you gobble up
the pages after memorizing them?

1071
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:23,813
I'm not a goat.

1072
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:26,399
Well…

1073
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,902
I couldn't memorize everything.

1074
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,655
So I repeatedly mumbled

1075
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:34,950
the important parts.

1076
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,242
Then I could remember

1077
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,662
my voice during the test.

1078
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,205
My subconscious remembered it.

1079
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,292
Why do you ask?

1080
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:47,170
No reason.

1081
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,217
Go to bed.

1082
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:34,759
Baek Hyun-woo.

1083
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,722
Baek Hyun-woo.

1084
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:41,641
Baek Hyun-woo.

1085
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:46,438
Baek Hyun-woo.

1086
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,233
Baek Hyun-woo.

1087
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:52,360
Don't forget that name.

1088
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,032
Baek Hyun-woo.

1089
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:02,537
Baek Hyun-woo.

1090
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,540
Baek Hyun-woo.

1091
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:17,135
QUEEN OF TEARS

1092
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:49,209
I was very worried.

1093
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,420
I'm going to keep you safe.

1094
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:55,715
I must've lived a lonely life.

1095
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,259
They followed Hae-in to Germany
and kept me updated.

1096
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,720
Please check the bus dashcams
around the time of the murder.

1097
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,597
-Exactly!
-I'll get out no matter what.

1098
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,848
Let Da-hye go!

1099
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:07,811
This will prove that Eun-sung and his men
conducted a two-trillion investment fraud.

1100
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:10,355
My heart is racing.

1101
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,981
He is the person

1102
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,025
-I want to remember forever.
-Hae-in!

1103
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,151
We will meet again.

1104
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:17,779
Because I won't give up.
I'll stay by your side.

1105
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,494
