1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,111
FOUR YEARS AGO

3
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,039
That's strange.

4
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,499
What is?

5
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,125
They said this was

6
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,753
the best dating spot,

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,047
but why is it so empty?

8
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,926
You're right. It is.

9
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,559
RENTED FOR THE DAY

10
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,332
The music…

11
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,709
What about it?

12
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,254
Don't they normally play

13
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,631
happy songs like the ones

14
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,967
in The Little Mermaid?

15
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,219
It sounds a bit too romantic.

16
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,147
Change the song!

17
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,189
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,775
This playlist was called "Call For Love."

19
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,738
The music changed.

20
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,199
You're right.

21
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,285
How fascinating.

22
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,664
Ms. Hong, these days

23
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,167
it feels like the entire universe

24
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,170
is on our side.

25
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,966
We went to a famous restaurant,
and we were the only ones there.

26
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,969
When we went to the amusement park,

27
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,804
no one else was in that huge place

28
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,681
except for us.

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,101
You're right.

30
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,402
Speaking of which…

31
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,489
Since the universe is on our side…

32
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,577
Will you…

33
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,872
marry me?

34
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,239
Are you crying?

35
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,244
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,082
About what?

37
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,175
Are you that worried?

38
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,182
Don't you worry.

39
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,481
Baek Hyun-woo.

40
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,235
I love you.

41
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,558
I wish…

42
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,729
this moment wouldn't end.

43
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,649
I wish you'd continue

44
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,527
to smile at me

45
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,406
without knowing the truth.

46
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,116
What do you mean?

47
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,868
What don't I know?

48
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,251
Don't be shocked.

49
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,469
We already went to Germany.

50
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,313
We did?

51
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,485
I already received treatment?

52
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:44,946
No.

53
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,074
You weren't ready.

54
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,581
I'm dumbfounded.

55
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,168
How could I forget that?

56
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,757
What if I lose all my memory?

57
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,927
I'm already sick as is.
That'd be so unfair.

58
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,473
There are times

59
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,061
when people completely forget things

60
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,564
even if they're not sick.

61
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,611
I was the same.

62
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,866
I had forgotten it all.

63
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,493
What is it?

64
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,579
What's going on?

65
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,165
Is there something else I forgot?

66
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,547
I was going to divorce you

67
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,842
without telling you first.

68
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:51,971
What?

69
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,224
And you found out in Germany.

70
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,936
So it's been rocky for us lately.

71
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,023
So…

72
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,567
you were going

73
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,236
to divorce me?

74
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,030
Yes.

75
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,161
And I knew?

76
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,246
Yes.

77
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,957
Don't lie.

78
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,084
If that were true,

79
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,171
then you wouldn't be here right now.

80
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,174
I would've broken your bones
or popped your eardrums.

81
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,927
-Hae-in--
-Should I do that right now?

82
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,262
I have no idea what's going on.

83
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,014
Then try to remember

84
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,518
what I did to you…

85
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,106
and how much you resented me.

86
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,069
No, I really don't remember…

87
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,863
So you won't bother trying anymore?

88
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,199
I'd be grateful if you divorced me
without filing a suit.

89
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,117
It was unbearable to live with you anyway.

90
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,202
Hae-in.

91
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,331
You know what kind of person you are.

92
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,958
No wonder I chose to do so.

93
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,709
I could've lived

94
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,044
a comfortable and wealthy life.

95
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,754
Because I hated living with you

96
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,089
more than anything!

97
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,466
When I heard that you'd be dying soon,

98
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,634
I was relieved deep down.

99
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,637
We'd have a clean divorce if I put up
with you for the next three months.

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,514
So if you choose

101
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,183
not to take any action at all
and just divorce me,

102
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,476
then honestly,

103
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,686
I'd be grateful.

104
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,854
Will you do that?

105
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,160
-Hae-in-.
-Stop. I remember now.

106
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,457
I remember how much you despise me

107
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,128
and how miserable your life has become.

108
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,130
What is it?

109
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,341
Did you think you'd live comfortably

110
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,011
if you married me,
but found out that wasn't the case?

111
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,639
It must've been entertaining

112
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,184
to watch me not remember anything
and talk nonsense.

113
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,145
No.

114
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,856
-I wasn't--
-I was miserable too!

115
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,859
It wasn't just you.

116
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,944
I was miserable too.

117
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,199
I can't spend my remaining life

118
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,993
next to you.

119
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,163
-Hae-in, wait.
-Let's part ways.

120
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,002
I want a divorce.

121
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,565
EPISODE 8

122
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,653
ALARM

123
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,258
It's a consensual divorce.

124
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,969
So why are we here when you agreed
to divorce without any alimony?

125
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,555
Who's their attorney?

126
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,473
I'm not sure.

127
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,227
This doesn't sit right with me.

128
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,848
It must be him.
He must be her divorce attorney.

129
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,978
-So?
-You don't know anything, do you?

130
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,187
He's…

131
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,814
a terrifying man.

132
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,150
He's just an attorney.

133
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,195
There are many rumors about who he is.

134
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,489
The youngest heir
of a conglomerate family.

135
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,533
A former soldier stationed abroad.

136
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,702
Someone who came here on a spaceship.

137
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,663
Others say he's a werewolf.

138
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,665
His name is Vincenzo.

139
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,500
And he is…

140
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,836
Please show mercy.

141
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,296
Please spare us.

142
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,297
-Please.
-Please.

143
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,257
-Just this once.
-Please spare us.

144
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,594
He's from the mafia.

145
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,636
The mafia?

146
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,723
You mean the mafia from that Mafia game?

147
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,934
No, the real mafia.
And he's a consigliere.

148
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,436
He's the boss.

149
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,022
I thought he was in Italy.

150
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,274
I heard

151
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,860
he doesn't negotiate in words.

152
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,071
You don't deserve to be reasoned with.

153
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,764
I think Ms. Hong has decided
not to forgive you.

154
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,476
In all honesty,
what you did to her is infuriating.

155
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,811
You tricked her into thinking
that you were in love.

156
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,314
You told me…

157
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,899
So?

158
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,944
She probably wants you dead.

159
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,572
Hae-in, please spare me this once!

160
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,243
Mr. Baek, you deceived my client.

161
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,787
A couple of divorce papers
won't make up for that.

162
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,834
I'm sorry to say this,
but evil should be countered with evil.

163
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,421
No!

164
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,841
Hae-in, it was Yang-gi.

165
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,969
He told me to do this.

166
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,470
That bastard--

167
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,265
That's her plan.

168
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,100
Be quiet.

169
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,894
Can I just leave?

170
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,688
I have a family.

171
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,857
You have no kids
and won't have a wife soon either.

172
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,860
Do as you wish.

173
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,613
Jeez.

174
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,583
First of all, please know

175
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,377
that I'm not here to negotiate.

176
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,310
That's the official paper
regarding the divorce

177
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,312
that Mr. Baek prepared. Correct?

178
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,396
Yes.

179
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,565
-What's wrong with it?
-Look at it.

180
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,191
He wrote the main reason for divorce

181
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,570
as irreconcilable differences.

182
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,073
These darn…

183
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,576
nutjobs.

184
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,582
Isn't that the simplest
and most optimal reason?

185
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,004
Look at her.

186
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,257
She's a wealthy woman
who's known for her good looks.

187
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,801
This department store CEO
was born into a rich family.

188
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,429
The tabloids and rumors make her out
to be someone haughty.

189
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,890
And she's a member
of the One Trillion Club.

190
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,685
Not yet.

191
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,650
Well, not yet.

192
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,443
Anyway, given these facts,

193
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,613
not many would think
that her personality is her forte.

194
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,031
And now,

195
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,786
she's going to divorce a mere director

196
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,621
due to irreconcilable differences?

197
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,461
People will immediately think
that she has a terrible personality, no?

198
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,505
Right.

199
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,759
Then what should we say instead?
Do you have any suggestions?

200
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,928
I do.

201
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,101
"They have become distant
due to their hectic schedules."

202
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,811
But they live under the same roof.

203
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,608
"They have agreed
to remain as good friends."

204
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,985
I don't think they can.

205
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,737
-"They wish the best for each other."
-Wait.

206
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,990
I don't wish that.

207
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,997
From what I know,
none of my clients ever do.

208
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,331
They just say this.

209
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,755
You can write whatever you want.

210
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,050
Are you sure?

211
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,928
Will you not regret it?

212
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,097
No.

213
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,474
Whatever it may be,

214
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,185
it won't be the real reason anyway.

215
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,931
Why did you choose
the subway instead of a taxi or a car?

216
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,768
You know.

217
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,105
When I've had a rough day,
but have no one to rant to,

218
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,148
I take Line Two.

219
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,775
Why?

220
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,651
This line is a loop,

221
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,904
so it goes around Seoul.

222
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,240
Time passes by quickly
when I watch people.

223
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,368
I remain in the subway until sundown.

224
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,705
Then in between
Dangsan and Hapjeong Stations,

225
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,377
I get to see the best sunset in Seoul.

226
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,232
Isn't it pretty?

227
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,318
The sunset helps me forget

228
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,113
how awful of a day I had.

229
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,074
It just makes me want to go home.

230
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,611
Sir.

231
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,197
Let's make a stop somewhere.

232
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,131
He had rice soup, played baseball,
washed his car,

233
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,425
ran laps,

234
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,094
and had rice soup again.

235
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,096
Is it that good?

236
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,808
He had stir-fried pork too.
He eats so well.

237
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,685
Look at you. You're running again.

238
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,523
He runs so well.

239
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,525
What's his deal? Gosh.

240
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,203
-Go slowly. You'll hurt yourself.
-Be careful.

241
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,747
Me too.

242
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,375
They're all working out in pairs,

243
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,003
so why does he run alone?

244
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,386
Is this fun?

245
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,181
Is it really?

246
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,466
GRANDMA'S HOME COOKING

247
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,469
Two bowls of rice soup
and one soju, please.

248
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,387
Coming up.

249
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,266
It won't take long.

250
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,600
Thank you.

251
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,228
What do you want?

252
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,439
One bowl of rice soup and one soju.

253
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,149
What?

254
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,695
One bowl of rice soup
and one soju, please.

255
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,739
"One bowl of rice soup
and one soju." Okay.

256
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,461
You couldn't have sundae and rice soup

257
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,464
because your wife hated the smell,
but you can knock yourself out now.

258
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,341
This is a perk of the divorce.

259
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,052
Just think of the good things.

260
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,763
Look. You no longer
have to worry about men tailing you

261
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,348
or having to rush home.

262
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,683
You had to leave us

263
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,853
while drinking if your mother-in-law
or the chairman called you.

264
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,732
Jeez. That's why you didn't meet us often,
and always had dinner alone.

265
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,154
I know,

266
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,947
but I wanted that life.

267
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,993
What do you mean? You wanted that?
Do you have Stockholm syndrome?

268
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,619
I don't know.

269
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,871
I just wanted

270
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,166
to be by Hae-in's side.

271
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,770
About those pills, sir,

272
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,313
I'll send you an email too,

273
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,524
but they're used
to treat malignant tumors.

274
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,693
It's an anticancer drug.

275
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,737
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

276
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,878
Mom!

277
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,802
EVERGREEN HOPE ORPHANAGE

278
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:07,719
Mom!

279
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,737
Hey! You!

280
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,823
You! It's okay.

281
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,366
It's okay. Hey.

282
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,701
You scumbag!

283
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,578
What if my dog got hurt?

284
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,330
Have you gone insane?

285
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,874
Do you know how expensive this dog is?

286
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,418
-What are you looking at?
-Stop it.

287
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,213
I almost got bitten by your dog.

288
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,589
And who are you?

289
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,634
Do they not teach you manners?

290
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,094
Ms. Hong!

291
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,934
Hae-in.

292
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,186
Grandpa.

293
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,188
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

294
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,231
Are you?

295
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,484
She's the granddaughter
of Queens Group's chairman.

296
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,652
Goodness, I didn't know.

297
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,821
Are you okay?

298
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,322
Let's go to the hospital.

299
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,532
Okay?

300
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,867
Goodness.

301
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,773
Thanks.

302
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,368
Mr. Oh, where's Hae-in?
She hasn't come home yet.

303
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,578
She told me to go home first.

304
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,664
She got off at a nearby elementary school.

305
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,332
You should've kept an eye on her.

306
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,001
I haven't been able to track her
since she's been alone lately.

307
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,587
This isn't what we agreed on.

308
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,922
I'm sorry, sir.

309
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,352
Where have you been?
Why did you take a taxi?

310
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,604
I had to stop by somewhere.

311
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:05,939
Wait.

312
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,402
Will Mr. Baek keep working for you?
Aren't you uncomfortable?

313
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,948
I don't plan on firing him
if he wants to stay.

314
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,492
After all, we need him in the company.

315
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,328
The one person Queens really needs

316
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,748
is me.

317
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,710
And I'm also

318
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,670
the one you need.

319
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,923
Must I still prove that?

320
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,805
I was going to tell you later,

321
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,141
but I'll just say it now.

322
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,892
I thought long and hard.

323
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,978
I'm going to pass up

324
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
on Hercyna.

325
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,732
What?

326
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,777
I appreciate all the help you've given me.

327
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,071
But Mr. Hermann chose our store

328
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,366
because of you, not me.

329
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,619
I wanted to use you out of greed,

330
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,496
-but that's--
-Then do so.

331
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,540
That's why I'm here.

332
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,752
Do you know what I've done in life
to become someone useful to you?

333
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,921
Do I have to know?

334
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,761
Hae-in.

335
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,222
I'm not going to ask you
for anything even if you choose Hercyna.

336
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,517
All I wanted to do was show you

337
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,438
that I could provide you with everything

338
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:30,690
others couldn't.

339
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,781
You're being blunt since I'm divorced now.

340
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,824
But listen up.

341
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,495
I didn't divorce him
so you could have a chance.

342
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,998
I married Hyun-woo
because he said he'd be by my side.

343
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,419
And I divorced him
because I felt bad about everything

344
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,755
he had to go through.

345
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,426
Can you say the same thing

346
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,471
even if you lost everything?

347
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,223
-What?
-Even then?

348
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,892
You won't need me?

349
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,854
Did you just get home?

350
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,764
You went through so much, ma'am.

351
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,309
-He's always been a nuisance.
-And he still is.

352
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,438
Why isn't Hyun-woo quitting his job?

353
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,897
You should fire him.

354
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,068
Mom, if there's one thing I can't do,
it's outsmarting him.

355
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,487
What do you mean?

356
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,782
He divorced her without taking any money.

357
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,451
What if we provoke him,

358
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,579
and he uses that smart brain
of his to get alimony?

359
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,791
But still,
a legal director has a lot of power.

360
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,461
Don't you feel uneasy
that he still has that power?

361
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,463
I do.

362
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,965
That's why you should get rid of him.

363
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,470
Goodness, why is she calling me?

364
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,307
You have no customers. Good.

365
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,059
Mom, why are you here?

366
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,480
I want to look like a female politician.

367
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,482
-Turn me into one.
-What?

368
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,234
You know that hairstyle they have

369
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,904
when giving a public apology to show that

370
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,739
they're terribly sorry?

371
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:47,160
But I don't want to look servile.

372
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,496
-There's no such hairstyle.
-Come on!

373
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,041
Give my hair some poof like this.

374
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,168
I see. Poof.

375
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,379
Yes, I need some poof to look confident.

376
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,595
I felt awful

377
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,139
after our previous call.

378
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,059
Marriage is the most important promise
in one's life.

379
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,103
Hae-in must be so distraught.

380
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:18,608
I'm sure you and your husband
were utterly speechless as well.

381
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,986
I should've taught my son better.

382
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,780
I'm truly sorry.

383
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,660
-Is this a scheme?
-Sorry?

384
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,038
Did your attorney son tell you to do this
so that he could get alimony

385
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,832
and some of Hae-in's fortune?

386
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,958
Sorry?

387
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,585
Don't tell me you're recording this.

388
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,005
You can't use this recording in court
since I didn't consent to it.

389
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,883
Recording? Why would I do such a thing?

390
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,469
Why wouldn't you? Even your son did it.

391
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,555
-Hyun-woo?
-Yes.

392
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,975
He bugged our chairman's room.

393
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,853
I don't know if he wanted
to sell the recording

394
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,981
or use it against Hae-in
for their divorce.

395
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,693
What did he say? Did he admit to it?

396
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,529
-He denied it.
-Then that's the truth.

397
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,282
Does it even matter anymore?

398
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,533
They're divorced now.

399
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,121
I guess you didn't know.

400
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,626
This is exactly why some people
shouldn't marry each other.

401
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,628
They'll only bring each other down.

402
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,506
That's why I was vehemently against them.

403
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,888
You may have been against them,

404
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:34,267
but they shared
enough happy memories to get married.

405
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,185
What?

406
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,897
I realized that life may seem long,

407
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,691
but happy memories are limited.

408
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,027
So?

409
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,029
They may have parted ways,

410
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,031
but I hope

411
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,366
they'll still cherish

412
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,120
those happy memories.

413
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,039
That's a good idea.

414
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,625
The divorce has already been settled,

415
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:04,255
so I hope your family
won't try to get anything out of it.

416
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,217
Also, please persuade him to quit his job.

417
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,262
Why won't he? He's so pathetic.

418
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,266
I hope we never see each other again.

419
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,489
Goodness.

420
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,241
Did she not say who she was meeting?

421
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,494
Judging by how she dressed
before going to Seoul,

422
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,162
maybe it was Ms. Kim.

423
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,247
Then why isn't she picking up?

424
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,709
There she is! Mom!

425
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,466
I gave her hair so much poof,
but it's all gone.

426
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,093
Go greet her.

427
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,010
Grandma!

428
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,514
Hello, my dear puppy.

429
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,224
-Were you waiting for me?
-Yes.

430
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,103
-My feet hurt, so I bought some slippers.
-Well done.

431
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,315
I was worried
since you weren't picking up.

432
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,819
Did you have dinner?

433
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,782
Not yet.

434
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,996
Hey, order some Chinese.

435
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,040
Forget it. We should have rice.

436
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,419
Where should I order from? Ting Hua?

437
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,837
No, they're not good.

438
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,423
The Great Wall of China
has better service.

439
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,383
Do you have coupons?

440
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,847
That's the list of customers who purchased

441
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,266
Ronde de Frédic's 101st anniversary watch.

442
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,727
There's one Korean.

443
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,937
Isn't she the chairman's mistress?

444
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,856
Where was it purchased?

445
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,025
Six years ago on Fifth Avenue, Manhattan.

446
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,944
It's a men's watch.

447
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,280
I wonder whom she gifted it to.

448
00:33:56,242 --> 00:34:00,371
She goes somewhere without me
about two to three times a week.

449
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,661
Our cars

450
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,456
are fine. We didn't crash.

451
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,416
-Is this a coincidence?
-No.

452
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,336
I saw you following Hae-in
from the office,

453
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,754
so I followed you.

454
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,548
They're used to treat malignant tumors.

455
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,175
It's an anticancer drug.

456
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:55,927
Yes, I'm sure.

457
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,553
Is someone you know sick?

458
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,347
Hello?

459
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,307
Mr. Yoon?

460
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,365
CALLS

461
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,908
YOON EUN-SUNG

462
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,121
I reported back to him every now and then

463
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,706
about whom you were meeting.

464
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,501
He told me to look into these pills,
so I asked a friend

465
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,837
who worked at a pharmaceutical company.

466
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,754
I'm truly sorry.

467
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,340
Why are you following her?

468
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,883
She's not your wife anymore.

469
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,428
So what's it to you?

470
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:46,602
Look. If you continue to follow her,
I won't stop following you either.

471
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:51,149
And if you try to harm her,
I'll do the same to you.

472
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,276
That's my plan.

473
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,444
So you want to protect her.

474
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,280
Do as you please.

475
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,699
She'll choose me anyway.

476
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,952
You'll get what I mean soon.

477
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,685
Did your family immigrate there
or were you studying abroad?

478
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,187
I was adopted overseas.

479
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:33,065
My adoptive parents passed away
right before I graduated university.

480
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,068
So I have no family now.

481
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,699
Come in.

482
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,913
Eun-sung.

483
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,749
I could've just gone to you.

484
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,834
It was urgent.

485
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,213
Mr. Na of Bolt One called.

486
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,130
What? What for?

487
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,715
Regarding the land.

488
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,760
There's a military base near the area
where the resort will be built.

489
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,803
Gosh, is that what this is about?

490
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,847
They agreed to move.

491
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,184
If not, their laser station would've made
the construction impossible.

492
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,019
I heard they're not moving.

493
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,104
What?

494
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,613
Why did they change their mind?

495
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,991
MOLIT wants to move, but the MND refused
and said it'd cost too much.

496
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,160
So they canceled everything.

497
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,372
Is the MND more powerful than the MOLIT?

498
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,917
I'm not too sure, sir.

499
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,795
The MOLIT must win at all costs.

500
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,130
Can you still not reach
the senior manager of MOLIT?

501
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,174
No, he keeps texting
that he's in a meeting.

502
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,802
He can't do this to me.

503
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,821
GRANDFATHER

504
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,634
Hello?

505
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,969
Yes, sir.

506
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,680
-Sir.
-What is it?

507
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,099
-The chairman wants to see you.
-No…

508
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,893
Why can't you be quick-witted?

509
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,647
Didn't you see how I rejected
his call for the first time in my life?

510
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,606
Yes, I did.

511
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,817
You should have made up an excuse.

512
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,695
How could you just say yes?

513
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,240
Hyun-woo. Where is he?

514
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,533
Hyun-woo.

515
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,621
Hyun-woo,
it must've been so tough for you.

516
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,832
-What's wrong?
-You know what they say.

517
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,501
Workers have resignation letters
ready at all times.

518
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,379
So why can't you have
divorce papers in your safe?

519
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,922
It's not your fault.

520
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,716
It's our family's for discovering it.

521
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,260
What's this about?

522
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,346
-An issue with the site.
-What?

523
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,682
The military base needs to move
so that people can visit our resort,

524
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,060
take the elevator to the sky lounge,

525
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,603
have some steak and wine,

526
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,607
stargaze, and swim in the infinity pool.

527
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,152
-But they won't move.
-I told you to run the validity test.

528
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,236
I know.

529
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,406
You did say that,
but Mr. Yoon swooped in at that moment

530
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,450
and made such a tempting offer.

531
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,035
So I was too hasty.

532
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,579
I see. Then you should go to him.

533
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,955
-Ask him for help.
-Come on!

534
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,584
He's from the U.S.
He never served in the military.

535
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,711
So what would he know about moving bases?

536
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,172
On the other hand, you were a marine.

537
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,471
Not just the marines,
but the Special Guard Team.

538
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,472
See?

539
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,433
I'm only asking you for help
since you're special.

540
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,935
Please save me.

541
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:58,687
Honey.

542
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,732
Yes?

543
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,193
What were you doing?

544
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,362
I'm in huge trouble.

545
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,615
I'm missing the last piece
of this 2000-piece puzzle.

546
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,242
Are you serious?

547
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,828
Queens Group,
who ambitiously announced the building

548
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,373
of the largest resort complex
in Northeast Asia, is facing bad luck.

549
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,375
A military base nearby canceled

550
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,919
their plans to move
and therefore, has limited

551
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,130
the resort's height to 180 meters.

552
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:28,801
This means that the hotel can only build
39 floors instead of the original 90.

553
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,096
The hotel's estimated earnings
will likely drop drastically,

554
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,807
and its investors may demand a prepayment…

555
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,643
Is Soo-cheol still not answering?

556
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,605
No, Father. I think he's trying
to resolve this issue--

557
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,443
He shouldn't have let this happen
in the first place. It's too late!

558
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,946
How is he just as foolish as you?

559
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,656
Goodness.

560
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,785
Hey, you were all here.

561
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,579
Why haven't you been picking up?

562
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,290
I'm here now with a solution.

563
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,253
What is this?

564
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,427
I looked into the long-range radar
near our land.

565
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,806
Having been built in 1994,
it's worn out and needs to be repaired.

566
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,725
Its efficiency rate is a bit over 60%,

567
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,436
and it received Grade C
in last year's safety test.

568
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,898
The government gave us money,
so it'll be fixed this summer.

569
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,692
Raising the height of the radar.

570
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,235
-What about that instead?
-Sorry?

571
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:38,287
The radar station is 180 m,
and the hotel is 350 m.

572
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,455
So if you set up

573
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:43,918
a concrete structure
above the station that's 170 m or more,

574
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,337
then the problem is solved.

575
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,839
It seems like the optimal solution.

576
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,799
Right.

577
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,261
Hyun-woo sure is smart.

578
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,848
I came up with the idea.
He just wrote it down as my attorney.

579
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,226
Hyun-woo is quite intelligent.

580
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,066
Why does it feel like
no one is listening to me?

581
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,444
Anyway, make sure
you explain it well to the investors.

582
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,114
You got it. I'm sure they'll be relieved.

583
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,992
Did you not hear what I just said?

584
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,663
The problem has been solved,
so why are you pulling out?

585
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,414
I just don't get it.

586
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:26,627
I heard Chairman Hong's financial manager
was taken in for interrogation.

587
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,836
About that…

588
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,506
How could you keep
such important news from us?

589
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,051
I wouldn't have known
had it not been for our legal advisor.

590
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,637
Your legal advisor?

591
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,974
As in Apollon? Am I right?

592
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,476
Mr. Baek planned it out well.

593
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,062
No one would invest

594
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,231
when the financial manager
has been arrested.

595
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,358
I can't believe Hyun-woo.

596
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,903
He should take revenge on Hae-in, not me.

597
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,658
Is this the end
since they're all pulling out? Oh, God.

598
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,410
Of course not.

599
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,120
What?

600
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,162
It's the beginning.

601
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,332
Hey, does that mean…

602
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,962
Sir.

603
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,380
Take a look at this.

604
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,761
P INVESTMENT PLANS TO INVEST
900 BILLION WON IN Q RESORT

605
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,145
We, Pione Investment,
will be your sole investor.

606
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,772
It'll be easier to sort things out
if we're the sole investor.

607
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,774
Yes, a sole investor is the way to go.

608
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,028
People say we shouldn't put
all our eggs in one basket,

609
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,239
but it's completely fine
since we trust Eun-sung.

610
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,035
Yes, it's all about who you work with.

611
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,037
And I also value trust the most.

612
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,081
Are you my soulmate or what?

613
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:50,085
I always say that business
is about those involved.

614
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,380
My entire life is in your hands.

615
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,551
I'm sure this wasn't easy for you,
so thank you for doing this.

616
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,721
I should seal the deal
before you change your mind.

617
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:13,067
You shouldn't be here, sir.

618
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,945
Hyun-woo, what is this about?

619
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,113
Secretary Jang.

620
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,622
Sir, the Legal Team gave their opinion
regarding this investment deal.

621
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:30,042
But I don't think you received it.
Please reconsider the convertible rights.

622
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,795
If the owner's risk causes a problem,

623
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:36,632
then 6.7% of your shares
will be handed over to Mr. Yoon.

624
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,717
You shouldn't be rash about this.

625
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,760
Hyun-woo.

626
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,969
Look, Mr. Baek!

627
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,554
What he just said

628
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,973
makes sense too.

629
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,559
Father!

630
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,853
You can do as you please.

631
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,357
However, I will also pull out
if this falls through.

632
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,901
The trust

633
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,070
needs to be mutual.

634
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,085
She said you'll have to make
a big decision soon.

635
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,964
If someone offers you
a large sum of money and some papers,

636
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,549
she advises that you accept it.

637
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:22,136
Doing so will save you and your company.

638
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,098
Whoever hurls a monkey wrench into it

639
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:30,102
will betray you down the road,

640
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,770
so you should ignore them.

641
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,189
Come on.

642
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,611
You must listen to me.

643
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,450
Just like at that hunting ground,
this great shaman has saved your life

644
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,201
countless times.

645
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,455
She sure is good.

646
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,831
Sorry?

647
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,583
It's nothing.

648
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,002
-Hyun-woo?
-Yes, sir.

649
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,254
I don't toss people out right away.

650
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,882
I give them three chances.

651
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,343
But you betrayed my granddaughter,

652
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:08,724
bugged my room,
and tried to ruin this deal.

653
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,643
That's three strikes already.

654
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,562
-Sir…
-Get out.

655
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,507
Is this broken?

656
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,050
Please.

657
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,259
Thank you.

658
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,144
INVALID ID

659
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,694
Sir, you need to come out.

660
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,075
Mr. Baek Hyun-woo.

661
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,952
Please leave your ID card,
corporate phone,

662
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,288
laptop, and other equipment behind
and leave the building.

663
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,124
It's past working hours.
You can't do this out of the blue.

664
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,043
It's the chairman's orders.

665
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:18,961
Please leave.

666
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,255
Does the Security Team have no rules?

667
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,303
Are you the chairman's men or something?

668
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,598
It's past working hours. Go home.

669
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,685
But the chairman ordered us--

670
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,478
Just go home.

671
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,527
At least make a deal.

672
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,405
Demand something in return for quitting.

673
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,574
Will you really let them kick you out?

674
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,575
They can't.

675
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:55,747
The chairman can fire me as a director,
but I'm also a team manager.

676
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,375
He needs a legitimate reason to fire one.

677
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:02,212
I know the Audit Team
couldn't find any reason to fire me.

678
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,672
That's…

679
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,217
Fine, but why are you still here?

680
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,513
You were so eager for a divorce
that you secretly prepared for it.

681
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,100
So why are you still here
and letting them humiliate you?

682
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,226
When you were with me…

683
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,897
You had to put up with it.

684
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,524
But not anymore.

685
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,526
I know.

686
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,363
I'm only doing this
because I still want to be here.

687
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:36,997
How are you feeling?

688
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,042
I'm okay.

689
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:14,159
-Ms. Hong.
-You better get in, or I'll run you over.

690
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,767
Which one was it?

691
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,602
The company? A reunion? A bar?

692
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,648
Don't bother denying it.

693
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,608
I know everything about divorce.

694
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,486
There's only one answer.

695
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:50,987
A mistress.

696
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,741
Ma'am…

697
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,577
Hae-in was the only woman in my life.

698
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,788
Then don't go!

699
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,874
You're all she has,
so why are you leaving?

700
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,126
I'm not going anywhere.

701
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,754
How could I possibly leave her?

702
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,091
That's why I'm still at the company.

703
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,384
I'll stay by her side

704
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,636
at all costs.

705
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,179
Also…

706
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:22,144
I'll get to the bottom
of who bugged the chairman's room,

707
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,813
handed the recording to Apollon,

708
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,440
and wanted me out of the family.

709
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,364
About that…

710
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,285
I do have my suspicions.

711
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,327
Ms. Moh?

712
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,121
How did you know?

713
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,290
Everyone knows how much you despise her.

714
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,125
That's not why.

715
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,044
She's scarier than you think.

716
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,465
She's been living under a false identity
and deceiving us for decades.

717
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,967
What do you mean?

718
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,304
Her real name is Oh Sun-yeong.

719
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,473
She had a son,

720
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,224
and he's 34 years old now.

721
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,852
And Oh Sun-yeong is deceased on paper.

722
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,189
So? Insane, isn't it?

723
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,065
Don't you want to team up with me?

724
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,318
I even have a partner named Conan.

725
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,491
Iced Americano all the way, right?

726
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,994
-How did you know?
-I can see that you're the stubborn type.

727
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,412
I see.

728
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,415
He could pass as a shaman.

729
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,792
I practically raised him myself.

730
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,251
What have you found out?

731
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,213
I met with the guard
from Oh Sun-yeong's penitentiary.

732
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,547
She gave birth behind bars

733
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,966
and sent him
to an orphanage in Gangwon Province.

734
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,301
-Where exactly?
-It's…

735
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,890
-Wonsan.
-Isn't that near the hunting ground?

736
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,475
Yes, our villa is there.

737
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,393
Yes, it's very close.

738
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,187
It's Evergreen Hope Orphanage.

739
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,647
"Evergreen"?

740
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,398
That's--

741
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,151
My father and that wench sponsored

742
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,737
and gave out scholarships there
up until a decade ago!

743
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:03,411
That orphanage
went up in flames ten years ago.

744
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,539
I believe the director passed away too.

745
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,124
Do you know anyone we could reach out to?

746
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,669
-I'm not sure.
-What about him?

747
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,711
Who?

748
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,005
The man who came
to the hunting ground with you.

749
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,466
The one who wanted to buy our dog.

750
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,927
-Mr. Yoon Eun-sung?
-Don't be absurd.

751
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,137
What? You said he looked familiar too.

752
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,225
Whom did he remind you of?

753
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,937
There was this boy at the orphanage.

754
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,857
He was so smart that he received
scholarships from Queens Group.

755
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,442
But he was taken
to the police station once

756
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,319
after poisoning and killing
a neighbor's dog.

757
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,280
And Mr. Yoon looked like him.

758
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,159
He did say he was adopted to the U.S.

759
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,162
That's right. That boy
was adopted to the U.S. as well.

760
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,419
Isn't she the chairman's mistress?

761
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,963
It's a men's watch.
I wonder whom she gifted it to.

762
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,673
She's scarier than you think.

763
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:00,051
She's been living under a false identity
and deceiving us for decades.

764
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,388
She gave birth behind bars and sent him
to an orphanage in Gangwon Province.

765
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,764
I was adopted overseas.

766
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,600
He was adopted by a Korean family at 12.

767
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,311
She had a son, and he's 34 years old now.

768
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,354
So I have no family now.

769
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,823
POWER OF ATTORNEY
HONG MAN-DAE

770
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,411
RIGHT TO MAKE ANY MEDICAL DECISIONS

771
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,831
Why are you signing this?

772
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,251
Why would you give me
the right to make decisions for you?

773
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,837
When the prosecution investigates
the secret fund,

774
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,006
they might not be convinced
that you embezzled it

775
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,842
just because you have some
of the money under your name.

776
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,054
Anyone could be the financial manager.

777
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,263
Is that so?

778
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,016
See?

779
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,060
This is for my sake.

780
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,770
Will you still not do it?

781
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,439
No, I should.

782
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:58,526
Today is your birthday,
so this could be my gift to you.

783
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,653
Right.

784
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,364
Yes, I'll consider it my birthday gift.

785
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,673
AUTHORIZER
HONG MAN-DAE

786
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,314
Wait, why is Mr. Yoon sitting here?

787
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,191
He should sit with us.

788
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,943
Well…

789
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,152
It was my order.

790
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,654
What?

791
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,115
It's only right. He's not family anyway.

792
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,744
Why? You sit with us
when you're not family either.

793
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,622
So?

794
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,292
So you can be family
even if it's not on paper.

795
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,169
-If you live together--
-So?

796
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,256
You're saying Mr. Yoon
could become family?

797
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,340
Is that what you think?

798
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,719
No, I never said that.

799
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,763
Hae-in got divorced not too long ago.

800
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,058
What would people think
if he sat next to her?

801
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,352
They'd think she has shallow intentions.

802
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,105
"Shallow"?

803
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,190
Did you seriously just say that?

804
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,358
Really?

805
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,276
Then,

806
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,029
you shouldn't give them wrong ideas.

807
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,406
Who are you to order people around?

808
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,660
Seon-hwa

809
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,412
is the lady of the house.

810
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,250
You're really something, you know?

811
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,504
All right.

812
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,091
Let's not get upset over nothing
on this good day.

813
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,186
Why does she have this?

814
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,230
This was Mom's!

815
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,191
She wore it all her life,

816
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,068
and I was supposed to inherit it.

817
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,904
So how could you give it to her?

818
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,865
Okay. Let me go, and I'll take it off.

819
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:14,204
Father, why have you gone crazy?

820
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,665
You may have always been a workaholic,
but you weren't like this.

821
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,626
Why can't you make good judgment?

822
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,545
Look who's talking! How dare you?

823
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,174
You've kicked Beom-seok out
and treat Beom-jun like an idiot.

824
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,551
Look who's left now.

825
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:32,388
You only have this bitch
who's waiting to milk you dry!

826
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,598
Watch what you say!

827
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,018
When my children backed out in fear
that I'd send them to jail,

828
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,937
she was the only one who stepped up!

829
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,690
Maybe she's not afraid to go
since she's been there before!

830
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,234
What nonsense are you spewing?

831
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,528
You know nothing.

832
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,905
I was going to tell you later.

833
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,407
She's been to prison

834
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,159
and even had a child!

835
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,037
She's been living
under a false name all along!

836
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,833
Beom-ja, why are you so mean to me?

837
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,502
I may have been poor,

838
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,797
but I've always strived
to live an honest life.

839
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,553
I'm sorry, sir.

840
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,764
I can't do this anymore.

841
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:17,433
I'll leave this house.

842
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,436
Come on.

843
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,149
You know Beom-ja always talks nonsense.

844
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,775
You little brat!

845
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:29,070
You better stop, or I'll send you
to a mental asylum. Got it?

846
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,321
A mental asylum?

847
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,784
Then I ought to do this much.

848
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,289
You!

849
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,082
Let her go!

850
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,460
I said, let her go!

851
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,470
Father…

852
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,637
I'm so sick of you.

853
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,765
Your mom got her revenge on me

854
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,601
by giving birth to you.

855
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,813
How could you torment me to this day?

856
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,732
Just leave, will you?

857
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,983
Leave, I beg you.

858
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,401
Just go!

859
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:18,703
I'll do that.

860
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,081
You won't be able to save face

861
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,375
after kicking out two of your three kids.

862
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,960
I'm leaving of my own will.

863
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,380
Have a great birthday party today.

864
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,052
I'll at least attend your funeral.

865
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,178
Even still,

866
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,889
I hope you live a long life.

867
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,982
That little…

868
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,408
It's okay.

869
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,286
All right, now.

870
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,290
Are the hair follicles intact?

871
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,834
Probably. I pulled them out
with all my might.

872
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:08,920
And Mr. Yoon's?

873
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,217
Thank you.

874
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,267
Ma'am.

875
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,318
Are you okay?

876
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,822
No…

877
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,450
I'm not okay, Hyun-woo…

878
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,289
My father hit me
for the first time in his life.

879
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,127
He hit me…

880
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,390
What if Grandfather faints

881
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:05,059
due to happiness
after receiving my surprise?

882
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,978
Don't push yourself too much. Be calm.

883
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,022
I've been way too calm all along.

884
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,857
I need to change.

885
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,775
Can't you see? I'm Queens' solution now.

886
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:15,320
I'm their lifesaver.

887
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:21,826
Still, your grandfather wants
a quiet birthday this year.

888
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,245
You're so innocent.

889
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,997
Don't let him fool you. It's just a test.

890
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,416
It's like midterms or exams.

891
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,294
In that aspect, this is like the CSAT.

892
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:34,964
Will I be chosen as the heir or not?

893
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:36,674
It's the play-off.

894
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,967
But I have a hunch.

895
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,678
What? What kind?

896
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,891
That today will be

897
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,144
the best day of my life.

898
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:49,937
I see.

899
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,898
Wear a pretty dress

900
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,608
and take Geon-u to the hair salon.

901
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,736
I'll be waiting.

902
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,038
Honey.

903
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,251
Thank you.

904
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:31,896
You fool.

905
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:34,399
CONGRATULATIONS
ON CHAIRMAN HONG'S FOURTH 20TH BIRTHDAY!

906
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:02,969
CHAIRMAN HONG'S 80TH BIRTHDAY

907
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:22,822
We've gathered together
to celebrate the chairman's birthday.

908
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,782
Our family went through

909
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,368
a rough patch recently.

910
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:31,372
People slandered him and spread rumors.

911
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,666
However,

912
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,960
our hero neither gave in

913
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,170
nor gave up.

914
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,214
He overcame all the hardships.

915
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,842
Everyone, please clap
for Chairman Hong Man-dae.

916
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,620
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

917
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,568
POWER OFF

918
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,540
Dreams come true.

919
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:59,418
There's Mickey Mouse in the U.S.
and Totoro in Japan.

920
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,129
Queens Amusement Park,
which will be the biggest one

921
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,048
in Northeast Asia,

922
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,884
also has a beloved character.

923
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,762
I created it myself.

924
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,349
It's Chairman Hong, my grandfather.

925
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,226
Me?

926
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,523
Soo-cheol prepared
a great birthday gift for Father.

927
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,607
You're right.

928
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,735
I'm ecstatic to finally be able

929
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:27,488
to reveal it to you all.

930
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,868
Come on out, Man-sung!

931
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,516
We're planning to sell
this Man-sung merchandise

932
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,727
as toys, golf wear, mugs,

933
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:01,689
keychains, mats, and more.

934
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:02,732
And, of course,

935
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,985
we'll issue NFTs as well.

936
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,704
Tell Soo-cheol to stop.

937
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,752
Please stop.

938
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,137
CHEON DA-HYE

939
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,939
I got the DNA results.

940
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,204
Da-hye.

941
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:10,841
Honey.

942
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,222
Da…

943
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,306
Da-hye.

944
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,528
Da-hye.

945
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:15,990
Da-hye!

946
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,303
Da-hye.

947
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,364
Da-hye!

948
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,116
Geon-u!

949
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,918
My son can't go to bed
if I don't tuck him in.

950
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,713
Please, Da-hye!

951
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,889
Geon-u.

952
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:22,890
Let's try some.

953
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,391
Just one bite, Geon-u.

954
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:29,188
What's wrong?

955
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,111
Geon-u.

956
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,406
Geon-u.

957
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:41,909
Geon-u.

958
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,120
Mommy's here.

959
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:03,764
BEOM-JA

960
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:19,947
HYUN-WOO

961
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:29,331
Why are you calling me at this hour?

962
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,167
I'm sorry. It's urgent.

963
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,793
Are you alone, sir?

964
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,503
I'm playing Janggi. Why?

965
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,797
Please just listen if Ms. Moh is with you.

966
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,048
What?

967
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:43,220
I did a DNA test on Ms. Moh and Mr. Yoon.

968
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,015
There's a 99% chance or higher
that they're related.

969
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,476
Mr. Yoon has been gathering your shares.

970
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,980
He has already taken 9.6%
of the directors' shares

971
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:55,357
through a foreclosure agreement.

972
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,736
Sir, you must withdraw
the convertible rights now.

973
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:01,989
All right.

974
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,035
I'll call you back later.

975
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:14,668
Checkmate.

976
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,298
I got the king.

977
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,477
What's the matter?
Do you have something to say?

978
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,775
You…

979
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:41,528
Goodness.

980
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,031
Are you okay?

981
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,834
No, you're probably not okay.

982
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,253
That's what the drug does.

983
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:02,341
Ten minutes in the respiratory system,
and you'll slowly become paralyzed.

984
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,884
So it was true.

985
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:05,678
How incredible.

986
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,937
Don't worry.

987
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,022
You won't die right away.

988
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,238
If you do, this will be useless.

989
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:27,533
I can only become your legal guardian

990
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:31,954
and have a say if you're in a coma.

991
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:32,997
So…

992
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:34,790
be in a coma

993
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,251
for two to three months before you die.

994
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,671
Can you do that for me?

995
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,325
See?

996
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,536
Hyun-woo and Beom-ja were right.

997
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:16,665
So why did you trust me instead of them?

998
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:35,392
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

999
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,855
-Happy birthday, dear Beom-ja
-Happy birthday, dear Beom-ja

1000
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,649
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

1001
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,567
Come here.

1002
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,408
I'll take it now. Please smile.

1003
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,537
Say cheese on the count of three.

1004
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,291
Okay. One, two, three.

1005
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,292
Cheese.

1006
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,266
What's with you guys?
Don't you know who I am?

1007
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,352
Why can't I see him?

1008
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:21,688
Only those allowed
by his legal guardian can enter.

1009
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,148
-Move.
-No, sir.

1010
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,942
-No, sir!
-Goodness.

1011
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:25,859
Hey.

1012
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,696
We're the chairman's children.
So who's this guardian?

1013
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,115
-Move.
-No, ma'am.

1014
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,408
Goodness.

1015
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,001
You bitch.

1016
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,170
What have you done?

1017
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,172
Give me a minute.

1018
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,341
What happened, Attorney Han?

1019
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,761
The chairman had a sudden heart attack
and received treatment.

1020
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,722
But he's currently unconscious.

1021
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,057
No, Father!

1022
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:03,397
And his current legal guardian
is Ms. Moh Seul-hee.

1023
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:08,902
What do you mean?

1024
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,195
Right.

1025
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:17,619
The chairman recently gave
the power of attorney to her.

1026
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,665
According to this document,
Ms. Moh is his legal guardian

1027
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:25,502
and has the right
to make decisions in his stead

1028
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,629
since he's unconscious right now.

1029
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:32,009
If this is proven to be fabricated,
you'll be charged with the forgery, use,

1030
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:34,678
and making of untrue entries
in this official document.

1031
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:38,223
I have a video of him signing this paper.

1032
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,308
I'll send it to you.

1033
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:40,976
-I'm dizzy.
-Honey.

1034
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:42,269
Honey.

1035
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,401
He must've had zero trust in his children
to give me the right to act in his stead

1036
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:52,112
in case something like this occurred.

1037
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:55,324
You were only interested
in taking as much money from him

1038
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:56,867
as possible.

1039
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,495
The chairman chose the company

1040
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,664
he raised his entire life
over his own family.

1041
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,833
I know what he wants more than any of you.

1042
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:06,960
I'll follow his wishes.

1043
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,463
"His wishes"?

1044
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,132
"His wishes"?

1045
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,636
Hey, I don't know about that.

1046
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,263
But I do know what you want.

1047
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,474
You and your son,
Yoon Eun-sung, are going to use

1048
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,601
the power of attorney to your favor!

1049
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,810
What do you mean?

1050
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:28,148
Yoon Eun-sung? The Yoon Eun-sung?

1051
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,233
Correct, sir.

1052
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:30,859
We checked the DNA results.

1053
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,906
Yes, Mr. Yoon is my son.

1054
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,242
Why? Is that wrong?

1055
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:40,160
Does that change anything?

1056
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,621
Hey!

1057
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:43,539
Damn it!

1058
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,832
Beom-ja, keep acting cute,

1059
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,168
and I might secretly move
your father to another room

1060
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:50,587
and not give you the chance
to say goodbye to him.

1061
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,172
Do you not believe me?

1062
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,980
This is an unprecedented incident
in the business industry.

1063
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,690
The stockholders' meeting

1064
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:12,818
agreed to take the Queens' family's rights
over their own company.

1065
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:16,446
Pione Investment, an investor
in Queens' new resort complex,

1066
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,823
purchased 14.7%

1067
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,909
of Queens' shares
at the beginning of this month…

1068
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,453
…and announced its participation
in the management.

1069
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,790
Pione then amassed
a total of 24.3% of the shares.

1070
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:31,128
Once Chairman Hong lost consciousness
due to a sudden heart attack,

1071
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:33,755
Pione exercised the convertible rights

1072
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,632
and took 6.7% of his shares.

1073
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:37,092
Now, with a total of 31%,

1074
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:41,013
they've become
the second largest shareholder.

1075
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:44,141
Pione then organized
a temporary stockholders' meeting.

1076
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:46,727
With the power of attorney,
Ms. Moh Seul-hee

1077
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,354
sided with Pione Investment.

1078
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:52,649
A shocking 68.8% supported
the removal of the Queens' family,

1079
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:57,404
while only 31.2% were against it.

1080
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,741
The business industry is stunned
by this unprecedented event

1081
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:03,243
where a conglomerate family
lost their power

1082
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:06,038
due to opposition from the stockholders.

1083
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:09,249
HONG HAE-IN

1084
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,842
What'll happen to the family now?

1085
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:19,801
Who knows?

1086
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,012
Even the reporters
don't know where they are.

1087
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:24,097
They're neither home nor at a hotel.

1088
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,767
They can't even leave the country
due to the investigation.

1089
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,436
You're right. Where could they be?

1090
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,494
YONGDU-RI SUPERMARKET

1091
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,965
Hey.

1092
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:02,594
-What are you guys doing here?
-Du-gwan, I'm glad you're here.

1093
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,388
I was going to text you.

1094
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,514
Du-gwan.

1095
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:07,182
How much are the sausages?

1096
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:08,684
How did you open the store?

1097
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,686
The passcode is 0070.

1098
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,771
Everyone knows that.

1099
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,356
Jeez.

1100
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:15,482
I should change it.

1101
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:18,527
The villagers wanted to pay
their unpaid grocery bills,

1102
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,445
so we're running the place for you.

1103
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,863
Look at this.

1104
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,741
-Here.
-We wrote them all down.

1105
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:27,828
They never stopped by
when I urged them to,

1106
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:28,745
so why now?

1107
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,957
I guess they wanted to help
after watching the news.

1108
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:40,799
You know what?

1109
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:44,720
It's gloomy today,
so how about some ramyeon and soju?

1110
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,887
Sounds good.

1111
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:46,972
All right.

1112
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,559
Cheers…

1113
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,441
Here.

1114
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,151
Be careful.

1115
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,154
Gosh, that looks delicious.

1116
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:03,739
Eat up.

1117
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,407
Du-gwan.

1118
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:09,077
Why would you close the store
over something trivial?

1119
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,412
I'm disappointed in you.

1120
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,459
Why would you be in hiding?

1121
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,003
Let's be honest. It's not your fault.

1122
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,297
Hyun-woo is to blame.

1123
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:22,716
Hyun-woo didn't do anything wrong.

1124
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:23,842
I agree.

1125
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,802
He's just a victim of this great typhoon.

1126
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,563
Du-gwan.

1127
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,276
You should know as a farmer yourself.

1128
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,530
Crops don't grow deep roots
if you plant them in the breeze

1129
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,948
since they don't need them.

1130
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:52,078
But those planted amid strong winds
are deeply rooted and invincible.

1131
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:58,543
In that sense,
typhoons can be helpful in life.

1132
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:03,465
You're like one of those people.

1133
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:04,716
A philosopher.

1134
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:06,259
Hey.

1135
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:11,681
If you like typhoons so much,
you can experience them yourselves.

1136
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:15,560
It breaks my heart to think that my son

1137
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,648
is all alone in that disaster!

1138
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:23,318
-Du-gwan--
-Let me be.

1139
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:26,488
Have some ramyeon too.

1140
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:28,949
What's that?

1141
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,409
What's with the light?

1142
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:34,496
Who's here at this hour?

1143
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,667
-What?
-Is that Hyun-woo?

1144
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:40,627
Who?

1145
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,586
Hyun-woo.

1146
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,421
Hey, Hyun-woo!

1147
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:46,508
I didn't know you were coming.

1148
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,344
Dad, it was urgent.

1149
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,346
Hey, Hyun-woo.

1150
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:53,056
Why weren't you picking up?

1151
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:56,101
Do you not eat well?

1152
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:57,894
You look terrible.

1153
01:20:57,978 --> 01:20:59,271
Goodness.

1154
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,814
Don't be so distraught.

1155
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:02,566
I'm glad you left that crazy family.

1156
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,026
Look at what happened to them
after they kicked you out.

1157
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,112
-Karma will always find its way.
-Mi-seon.

1158
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,697
-Hold on--
-You bet.

1159
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:12,742
I was so relieved to hear
that the damn family was ruined.

1160
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:14,369
Serves them right!

1161
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:18,248
Anyway, forget about
that sly fox and live a happy life.

1162
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:39,895
The sly fox

1163
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:41,563
is here too.

1164
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,816
I see.

1165
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,485
You're here too.

1166
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,072
It's not just her.

1167
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:56,262
I know,

1168
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:58,056
but I wanted that life.

1169
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,642
What do you mean? You wanted that?

1170
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:02,102
Do you have Stockholm syndrome?

1171
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,728
I don't know.

1172
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,021
I just wanted

1173
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,149
to be by Hae-in's side.

1174
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,455
Thank you.

1175
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,082
Goodness, come again.

1176
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,333
Thank you.

1177
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:48,440
Goodness.

1178
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,191
Are you okay?

1179
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,028
Why are you crying?

1180
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,371
My husband.

1181
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:05,123
Yes?

1182
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,044
He wants to be by my side.

1183
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:13,423
And is that so sad?

1184
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,135
Of course.

1185
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,015
Because hearing that makes me want…

1186
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,936
to live.

1187
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,149
Then live. What's stopping you?

1188
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,652
I'm desperate to live too.

1189
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:38,615
I want to stay

1190
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:41,493
by his side.

1191
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:48,208
Gosh. You're drunk.

1192
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,264
I want to live.

1193
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,350
Desperately.

1194
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:19,405
QUEEN OF TEARS

1195
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,479
They might get back together?

1196
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,439
Do you have feelings for each other?

1197
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,192
Just drink from the kettle!

1198
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,778
This is the best twist ever
since The Sixth Sense.

1199
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,656
-He looked like Leslie Cheung.
-I heard she's a psychopath.

1200
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,284
What?

1201
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,661
Was he born to love me or something?

1202
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:08,872
Where is she? Hae-in.

1203
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:12,292
-Whatever happens to me or my family…
-Hae-in is…

1204
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,835
has nothing to do with you.

1205
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:15,587
If I can prove it,

1206
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,464
I'm going to use
the same tactic Yoon Eun-sung did.

1207
