1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,237
WHERE IS THE MONEY?
WE DEMAND OUR LAND COMPENSATION!

3
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,511
What's going on?

4
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,096
Why are they acting up
when we're the victims here?

5
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,807
Land compensation?

6
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,975
All hell will break loose if we go home.

7
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,310
Let's go back.

8
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,104
Where can we go if not home?

9
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,940
We can't go to a hotel.

10
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,445
Hey, Grace.

11
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:56,407
Ma'am, the back gate is empty.
You can come this way.

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,661
You're the best. Okay.

13
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,580
Turn back. Take the back gate.

14
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,088
So? Are they coming?

15
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,257
Let's see what you can do.

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,426
"A conglomerate family
becomes dirt-poor and gets kicked out."

17
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,055
Here they come!

18
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,147
What are you doing? Open the gate.

19
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,525
Ma'am, you need to step out for a bit.

20
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,783
What is it? I'm tired.

21
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,162
Are you aware that Chairman Hong
gave Ms. Moh the power of attorney

22
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,124
to manage everything in Queens Town

23
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,626
during his absence?

24
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,545
So?

25
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,214
Is she kicking us out?

26
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,508
Not really.

27
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,927
Given how this place is swarming

28
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,721
with reporters and protesters,

29
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:04,058
she wants you to lie low
until the dust settles.

30
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,604
Does she have the right to do that?
We're all residents here.

31
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
Shut up, will you?

32
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,733
Don't butt in when the adults are talking.

33
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,611
What did you just say?

34
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,362
Damn it.

35
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,407
You don't get it, do you?

36
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,373
Wait. Hey.

37
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,043
Company vehicles, drivers,

38
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,795
phones, and credit cards
are no longer yours.

39
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,507
Your company security cards
and key cards won't work either.

40
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,885
What do you mean? It's my house!

41
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,845
Call the police, honey!

42
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,388
Sure, call them.

43
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,098
The reporters would love it.

44
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,975
Given our history together,

45
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,895
I've packed up some essentials for you.

46
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,980
So get going.

47
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,741
-What's that?
-Damn it.

48
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,994
Get in! There are cameras
on the other side!

49
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,296
Isn't this absurd, Hyun-woo?

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,256
How can Seul-hee

51
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,341
lock the doors and kick us out

52
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,634
of our father's house?

53
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,303
You can assert your rights
as residents of the house.

54
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,931
But you must file a lawsuit,

55
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,557
and it'll take some time.

56
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,601
But the biggest issue is

57
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,396
the chairman included a convertible
rights clause in the contract

58
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,065
and put his family as joint surety.

59
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,943
So your real estate, stocks,
and personal bank accounts

60
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:37,902
are all frozen.

61
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,155
Gosh, Father.

62
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,867
Hold on. Is this true, honey?

63
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,079
I didn't know either. I'm flustered too.

64
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,164
Lip balm, anyone?

65
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,167
Lip balm, my foot.

66
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,505
It's best that the media
doesn't post photos of you.

67
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,092
I'll take you somewhere safe,
and we can think of our next plan there.

68
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,886
Why has Soo-cheol been so quiet?

69
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,681
Hey, Soo-cheol! Say something!

70
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,268
So your wife, Da-hye,
was in on this too. Am I right?

71
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,397
What did I say?
Geon-u doesn't take after him at all!

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,481
Come on.

73
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,908
By the way, where are we going?

74
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,786
Well…

75
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,889
-What is that?
-What's that?

76
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,931
What?

77
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,933
-Who's blinding us?
-Who's that?

78
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,481
-Wait.
-Who's that?

79
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,232
This is private property.

80
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,942
-What?
-Is that Hyun-woo?

81
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,695
Who?

82
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,654
Hyun-woo.

83
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,364
Hey, Hyun-woo!

84
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,533
I didn't know you were coming.

85
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,744
Dad, it was urgent.

86
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,456
Hey, Hyun-woo. Why weren't you picking up?

87
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,375
Do you not eat well?

88
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,086
You look terrible.

89
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,171
-No, it's--
-Don't be so distraught.

90
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,923
I'm glad you left that crazy family.

91
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,093
Look at what happened to them
after they kicked you out.

92
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,677
Karma will always find its way.

93
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,137
-Hold on--
-You bet.

94
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,723
I was so relieved to hear

95
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,142
that the damn family was ruined.
Serves them right!

96
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,188
Anyway, forget about that sly fox
and live a happy life.

97
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,117
The sly fox is here too.

98
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,370
I see.

99
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,039
You're here too.

100
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,626
It's not just her.

101
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,076
Goodness.

102
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,787
It's your father-in-law. No.

103
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,081
Is it "former father-in-law"?

104
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,793
Anyway… What brings you here?

105
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,711
Hello.

106
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,380
How have you been?

107
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,465
Good.

108
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,758
Say hello.

109
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,845
-Hello.
-Hello.

110
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,681
I apologize for coming unannounced.

111
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,016
Don't worry about it.

112
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,018
I'm glad you're here.

113
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,730
Please follow me. This way.

114
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,856
I'm going back to Seoul.

115
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,232
-Hail a cab.
-Mom.

116
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,611
There are no cabs around here
at this hour.

117
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,615
Then I'll find another way,
so do as you please.

118
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,658
Honey.

119
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,952
Honey.

120
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,622
We're already here, though.

121
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,291
I already told you
that I didn't want to come.

122
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,293
Jeez!

123
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,177
What's wrong?

124
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,305
I think she stepped on cow dung.

125
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,565
Mom, don't come. Don't come to me!

126
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,192
Don't come to me either!

127
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,116
Ms. Kim?

128
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,773
That's good.

129
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,407
Hey, Hyeon-tae.

130
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,285
I picked plenty.

131
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,579
How am I to make sense of this?

132
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:40,997
What do you mean?

133
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,959
Why did Hyun-woo bring his ex-wife
and her family all the way here?

134
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,128
It's similar to Korea.

135
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,463
There may be North and South,

136
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,925
but we're still on the same team
at the Olympics.

137
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,051
What are you saying?

138
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,596
We join hands when there's a common enemy.

139
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,726
Does this mean
they might get back together?

140
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,438
We may be on the same team,
but that doesn't guarantee a unification.

141
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,276
-Let's get ready.
-Okay.

142
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,372
What's wrong?

143
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,877
Thank you for today.

144
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,379
I'll look for a new place
to go to tomorrow.

145
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,881
Nothing will change

146
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,382
overnight.

147
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,303
I know. All the more reason
why we shouldn't stay here.

148
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,639
It'll take some time
until the dust settles.

149
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,767
This is the safest
and the most comfortable place you can be.

150
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,604
Not for me.

151
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,607
I'm at my former in-laws' house.

152
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,403
Not you. Me.

153
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,864
This is comfortable for me.

154
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,576
Let me…

155
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,954
be selfish for now.

156
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,416
I have too much on my plate right now

157
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,335
to worry about you as well.

158
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,379
Don't worry about me.

159
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,798
We're divorced.

160
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,300
Whatever happens to me

161
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,760
or my family

162
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,388
has nothing to do with you.

163
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,526
I'll stop worrying

164
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,779
once you're better.

165
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,952
But for now,

166
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,913
that's impossible.

167
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,623
So please…

168
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,252
understand.

169
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,339
Just…

170
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,633
stay with me.

171
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,558
Do you think being together

172
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,601
in this situation will make us happier?

173
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,853
We'll be less miserable.

174
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't think too much for today.

175
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,986
Let's just focus on being less miserable.

176
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,253
I got rid of the chunks. As for the smell…

177
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,048
It'll take some time to dry.

178
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,844
-Just throw them away.
-Goodness.

179
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,139
What for? They look expensive.

180
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,063
Wear these for now.

181
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,760
What about these heels?
Should I throw them away?

182
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,096
So what is it?

183
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,182
Will she get rid of them or not?

184
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,351
They look expensive.

185
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,769
Over 500,000 won.

186
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,823
Five million?

187
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,507
I didn't come here by choice.

188
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,135
Your son was very quick.

189
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,346
He practically kidnapped us.

190
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,014
My late mother

191
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,475
was right.

192
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,353
She said, "You never know
what the future holds."

193
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:20,234
Who knew we'd meet again
a few days after we bid our last farewell?

194
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:25,781
My sister is urging us
to stay at her villa in Namhae instead.

195
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,616
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

196
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,286
Sure.

197
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,290
But don't be so confident.

198
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,770
Sir.

199
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,314
Please eat.

200
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,566
Okay.

201
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,307
It's tasty.

202
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,477
Does it suit your taste?

203
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,272
Yes, it's very delicious.

204
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,901
Eat up.

205
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,820
You need to cut down on sodium.

206
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,157
Doctor Yoon will scold you
if he finds out. Don't eat that.

207
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,327
Don't worry.
He hasn't been answering my calls.

208
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,120
I think he blocked me.

209
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,880
Why aren't you eating, Soo-cheol?

210
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,139
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm not hungry.

212
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,060
Do you have water?

213
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,853
Yes, here.

214
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,063
Here you go.

215
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,441
You see…

216
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,360
I only drink sealed water.

217
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,820
Do you have bottled water?

218
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,656
Hey, just drink it.

219
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,328
Yes, we have some at the store.
I'll bring some.

220
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,832
Thank you. I'd prefer mineral water
from the Alps, please.

221
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,546
Sorry? The Alps?

222
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,090
I can't believe you.

223
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,635
I apologize.

224
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,303
He's still immature.

225
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,264
Gosh, that's okay.

226
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,598
We understand.

227
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,977
It doesn't have to be from the Alps.

228
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,023
Germany or Australia is fine.

229
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,524
Fiji is okay too.

230
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,111
We're not that picky.

231
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,240
Yes, I'm fine with them too.

232
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,787
Just drink from the kettle!

233
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,338
I'll take that.

234
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,591
-Gosh.
-No, please.

235
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,802
She doesn't hit me.

236
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,018
Did you see her hit her brother?

237
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,394
I was terrified.

238
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,438
What do you mean? You hit me too.

239
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,524
Hey, my slaps aren't that painful.

240
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,110
But Hae-in was totally--

241
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,445
Should I help?

242
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,447
Gosh.

243
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,116
That's okay.

244
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,660
No, you don't need to help.
You can just rest.

245
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,873
Thank you.

246
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,085
By the way, Hae-in…

247
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,378
Right.

248
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,130
Can I say something?

249
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,757
Even though you two are divorced…

250
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,967
Sure, you can.

251
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,012
Don't take to heart what I said earlier.

252
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,806
Which was?

253
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,016
About you being a sly fox and all.

254
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,645
-Right.
-I never disliked sly foxes.

255
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,022
After all, that was my nickname
in high school.

256
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,816
I look like a fox, you know?

257
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,528
I'd like to apologize
for saying that your family was ruined.

258
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,488
It's true though.

259
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,948
We're done for.

260
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,991
This is a touchy subject.

261
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,827
I know you're divorced,

262
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,411
but did you agree to come here

263
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,413
because you had feelings for each other?

264
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,665
No.

265
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,959
It was an emergency. Nothing more.

266
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,710
Right. You're strangers now.

267
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,087
We're more than that.

268
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,172
But could there be something between you--

269
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,173
No, not at all.

270
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,092
I see.

271
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,971
We wouldn't have divorced
if that was the case.

272
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,514
That's true.

273
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,099
She's right.

274
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,268
So please don't misunderstand, anticipate,

275
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,436
or give meaning to any of this.

276
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,608
I won't. Remember So-yeong?

277
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,693
The principal's daughter?

278
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,487
She recently got a job
at a middle school nearby

279
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,198
and has been asking for Hyun-woo's number.

280
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,367
-But I couldn't tell her.
-You can.

281
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,994
Can I?

282
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,458
But then again,
I didn't need to ask for permission.

283
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,544
Good night then.

284
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,299
I knew it.

285
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,967
They won't get back together.

286
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,136
Hey, I don't want that either.

287
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,470
She's so rude.

288
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:44,683
She didn't bother to hear me out
and kept cutting me off.

289
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,644
Jeez, that sly fox.
She shouldn't have come.

290
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,150
This is our annex.

291
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,403
We used to live here
before Hyeon-tae and Mi-seon

292
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,946
got married.

293
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,907
We heated up the floor.

294
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,411
I'm sorry about everything.

295
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,329
Goodness.

296
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,914
Please don't apologize.

297
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,999
Even neighbors help out

298
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,584
when times are rough.

299
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,836
But we

300
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,048
used to be family.

301
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,968
Hyun-woo told me
that it's a secret that you're here.

302
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,887
I already warned the villagers

303
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,390
not to use the internet.

304
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,768
There are no CCTV cameras around,

305
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:32,439
and barely anyone uses a smartphone here.

306
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:36,318
So don't you worry
and have a good night's sleep.

307
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,446
Thank you so much.

308
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,615
Gosh, it's nothing.

309
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,495
You can wash up in here.

310
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,413
Where's the tub?

311
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,456
There is none.

312
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,709
But here's the shower.

313
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,510
Where can I take a bath?

314
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,511
You can't.

315
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,721
-What about my bath bomb?
-Don't use it.

316
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,518
You can use this towel.

317
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,645
BAEK HO-YEOL'S FIRST BIRTHDAY

318
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,774
Didn't you say
your nephew's name was Ho-yeol?

319
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,942
Yes, Baek Ho-yeol.

320
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,947
This "baby Ho-yeol" can't possibly be

321
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,741
the boy I saw earlier, right?

322
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,578
I see.

323
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,000
Right. He used to be so tiny.

324
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,420
He was so adorable. Yes, this is him.

325
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,256
So it's the same person.

326
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,801
Then how old is this towel?

327
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,012
Gosh.

328
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,848
What's wrong? Do you want a new one?

329
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,018
Hyun-woo.

330
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,812
Do you know

331
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,483
what's even more unbelievable
than this eight-year-old towel?

332
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,403
It's that

333
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,741
Da-hye and Geon-u have left me.

334
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:11,663
And that Yoon Eun-sung,
that bastard deceived me!

335
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,962
What's going on?

336
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,589
Where is everyone?

337
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,258
Hello.

338
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,886
Where's Hae-in's family?

339
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:27,971
I wouldn't know.

340
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,015
I'm sure they're somewhere.

341
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,308
Why did you do it?

342
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,730
Did you want them to stay then?

343
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,273
How can we possibly live

344
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,776
under the same roof
as those we stole from?

345
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,194
It's not over yet.

346
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,738
They'll try to find your weakness

347
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,531
and retaliate.

348
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,116
You should've just kept them close--

349
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,076
Don't you…

350
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,661
just want to keep Hae-in close?

351
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,371
Forget her.

352
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,956
You will do so eventually.

353
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,750
Don't bother regretting it.

354
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,799
I've lived here for 25 years,

355
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,760
but this is the first time I get to pick

356
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,345
my own wine.

357
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,599
Let's enjoy what we have from now on.

358
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,517
Okay?

359
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,604
Remember what you said
when you sent me away?

360
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,023
Don't forget.

361
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,110
I love you the most.

362
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,279
So I'll stay strong and endure it

363
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,823
even when I miss you

364
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,075
and want to see you.

365
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,828
Just because I love you.

366
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,582
And you kept your word.
You were pretty good at it.

367
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,546
You were never curious about
how your young son was doing abroad.

368
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,215
You never bothered to call.
You really endured it all.

369
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,466
But, you see,

370
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,718
I realized that it was a lie…

371
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,099
to endure something out of love.

372
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,268
You can't endure it

373
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,687
if you truly love someone.

374
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,280
What are you getting at?

375
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,240
Are you saying

376
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,992
that you resent me now?

377
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:12,909
No.

378
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,954
I'm telling you that I'll bring Hae-in
back here at all costs.

379
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,539
I'm not like you.

380
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,293
It drives me crazy to wonder
where she is and what she's doing.

381
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,172
I can't

382
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,674
endure it.

383
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,679
Do you even know
how difficult it was to come this far?

384
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,806
Why do you think I'm doing this?

385
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,146
We don't share the same goal.

386
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,565
So just like
how you chose this family over me,

387
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,151
I can also choose

388
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,070
something else over you.

389
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,506
Check all the hotels and villas.

390
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,347
This is a living hell.

391
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,643
What kind of hell offers us a silk blanket

392
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,646
and a warm floor?

393
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,869
Let him be.

394
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,122
He must be utterly distraught.

395
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,629
He's never slept on hard floors before.

396
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,508
He can only sleep on Spanish royal beds.

397
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:58,306
Ours looks thicker than his.

398
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,350
Let's switch blankets.

399
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:01,893
Honey.

400
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,020
What?

401
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,146
Me too.

402
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,025
It's my first time sleeping
on the floor too.

403
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,906
I'm from a rich family too.

404
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,584
Hello?

405
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,878
-Beom-seok.
-I saw the news.

406
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,797
How's everyone?

407
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,048
A total mess.

408
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,219
I feel terrible for Father.

409
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,347
I'm hanging up if this is about him.

410
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,225
Don't be like this.

411
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,601
Remember what he said?

412
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,895
He told me
not to even come to his funeral.

413
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,481
So don't call me even if he passes away.

414
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,984
Come on. Don't be like this.

415
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,031
I resented him when he was healthy.

416
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,993
But now that he's ill,

417
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,163
I feel so guilty.

418
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,080
For what?

419
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,294
Maybe everything would've been okay

420
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,132
had I treated Seul-hee better.

421
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,761
Maybe she was livid
because I mistreated her.

422
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,637
About ten years ago,

423
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,765
I threw a huge fit when Father told me

424
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,350
he wanted her to be his legal wife.

425
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,018
So he gave up on that idea.

426
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,438
Maybe she held a grudge
and schemed everything.

427
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,320
This stupid ring. It's nothing.

428
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,280
I should've just let her have it.

429
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,993
Should I give it back to her?

430
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,747
Should I give it to her right now?

431
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,335
Beom-ja.

432
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,673
It feels like I'm to blame
for what happened to Father.

433
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,272
Why are you crying?
Did your husband leave you?

434
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,068
-No.
-Then, are your parents ill?

435
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,447
Yes…

436
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,077
My father is sick.

437
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,370
Oh, dear.

438
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,498
It's normal to feel guilty

439
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,626
when your parent falls ill.

440
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:33,336
Cry.

441
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,588
Let it all out
and treat him better from now on.

442
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,465
Everything will be fine.

443
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,052
Thank you.

444
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,265
Mom!

445
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,726
Mom!

446
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,270
Goodness, what do I do?

447
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,897
What's the matter?

448
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:58,445
There's this lunatic
who calls me Mom and follows me around.

449
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,404
What?

450
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,532
Can you tell him that you're my daughter?

451
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,952
Okay.

452
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,663
Mom.

453
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,708
It's too late to be out.

454
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,922
Excuse me. This is my mom.

455
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,924
-So go on your way.
-What?

456
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,218
I'm her daughter,

457
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,928
so leave.

458
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,432
Aren't you from Seoul?

459
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,184
She's my mom.

460
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,602
No, she's mine!

461
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,150
Mom, aren't you going to watch
the soap opera?

462
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,359
The soap opera?

463
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,907
Well, I can't skip out on that.

464
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,700
Let's go, my son.

465
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,997
The soap opera.

466
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,044
What was that?

467
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,047
Jeez.

468
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,723
MUST HAVE BEEN LOVE

469
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,768
Hyun-woo and I have similar tastes.

470
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,572
Are you sleeping?

471
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,344
I'm about to.

472
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,262
Why?

473
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,391
I need to go to work early tomorrow,

474
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,059
so I won't be able to see you…

475
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,357
Going to work early tomorrow.

476
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,193
When will you be coming home…

477
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,158
Okay.

478
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,207
Should I take tomorrow off?

479
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,585
Can you just take tomorrow off?

480
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,937
Good night.

481
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,488
I'm going to listen to the songs
on your MP3 before I sleep.

482
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,116
Oh, that? How are the songs?

483
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,743
They're all oldies.

484
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,660
I like them.

485
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,371
They're all my favorite songs.

486
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,373
That MP3 isn't mine.

487
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,918
-Then?
-I picked it up in the past.

488
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,129
I couldn't find the owner,
so I kept it with me all along.

489
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,881
Where did you find it?

490
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,965
At my high school.

491
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,634
On the field.

492
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,220
Didn't you go
to Hanil Foreign Language High School?

493
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,890
Yes, I picked it up on my first day there.

494
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,242
What?

495
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,788
So this was mine?

496
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:40,833
Wait.

497
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,484
That was

498
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,611
Hyun-woo?

499
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,782
Unbelievable.

500
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,326
I mean…

501
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,912
Was he born

502
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,415
to love me or something?

503
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,043
He fell for me in that brief moment,

504
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,713
so he kept this all this time.

505
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,008
He'll be so shocked
if he finds out that the girl he fell for

506
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,926
was me.

507
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,476
But why do you still have it?

508
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,104
She must've been so pretty.

509
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,148
What…

510
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,654
What is it?

511
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,034
I don't…

512
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,996
remember.

513
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,749
You don't?

514
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,833
Of course not.

515
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,251
That was years ago.

516
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,962
Exactly.

517
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,883
The fact that you still kept this
all these years must mean

518
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,094
you couldn't get her out of your head.

519
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,638
She must've been gorgeous.

520
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,894
Come on. It's not like that.

521
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,062
I can't even remember

522
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,857
if the person was male,
female, a teacher, a student,

523
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,567
or a security guard.

524
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,402
I can't remember a thing.

525
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,367
Then why still keep it?

526
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,247
I'm not keeping it.

527
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,209
I just stashed it away.

528
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,547
Okay. You can go.

529
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,426
Go. Go sleep.

530
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,641
What is it this time?

531
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,393
The curtain.

532
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,521
Make sure you draw it.

533
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,649
This room is facing east,

534
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,692
so it gets pretty bright in the morning.

535
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,402
Okay, so leave.

536
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,084
Should I help?

537
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,752
Will you?

538
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,671
I'm going to make some japchae.

539
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,925
Can you chop these carrots for me?

540
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,720
Okay.

541
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,562
Sweetie, be careful
not to chop your fingers.

542
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,606
You need to julienne it.

543
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,028
Exactly how thin
do you want me to chop them?

544
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,406
Well… It's…

545
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,241
Let me show you.

546
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,802
-Mother.
-Yes?

547
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,637
You're incredible.

548
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,307
What's so incredible about this?

549
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,646
How could you say that? This is like

550
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,149
modern art.

551
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,359
Is that so?

552
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,569
Goodness.

553
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,363
That's a new one.

554
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,323
You're making japchae, right?

555
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,992
What else do you need to do?

556
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,661
Next…

557
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,830
I need to cook some eggs.

558
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,750
-How exactly do you do that?
-The eggs?

559
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,668
It's a cakewalk. Should I show you?

560
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,171
I'm excited.

561
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,097
You're so incredible.

562
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,306
I can use both hands.

563
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,769
Goodness, Mother.

564
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,938
You're truly amazing.

565
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,357
Am I? Should I give it a spin too?

566
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,608
A spin?

567
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,362
I was just joking.

568
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,990
Why the change of heart?

569
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,742
You said your villa was vacant.

570
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,286
What's wrong? Is your husband against it?

571
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,206
In case the reporters find out?

572
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,751
He's unbelievable.

573
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,546
Who helped him
whenever his business was failing?

574
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,549
How could he do this
to my husband of all people?

575
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,759
Forget it.

576
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,761
Unbelievable.

577
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,390
Here you are.

578
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,309
I was looking everywhere for you.

579
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,019
Why me?

580
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,314
They're clean now.

581
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,649
They don't smell at all.

582
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,401
Is that so?

583
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,278
-Have them if you want.
-Really?

584
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,197
But they're extremely expensive.

585
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,366
It's okay. They're yours.

586
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,413
Then why don't you let me do your hair?

587
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,581
I'm very skilled.

588
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,551
What kind of hairstyle do you want?

589
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,720
What can you do?

590
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,972
Everything.

591
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:19,059
I used to work
in Cheongdam-dong, you know?

592
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,522
Mi-seon, what is going on?

593
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,650
This is the best twist ever
since The Sixth Sense.

594
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,736
Even my palms are sweaty.

595
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,404
-Hey--
-You bad-mouthed that sly fox.

596
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,865
Then I heard she suddenly appeared.

597
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,700
That only happens in movies or dramas.

598
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,785
This is more thrilling
than any drama ending.

599
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,579
-Yes.
-So what happened?

600
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,206
Guys, let's talk later.

601
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,919
I heard Hae-in's mother is a psychopath.

602
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,380
What do you mean? That's just nonsense.

603
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,007
-Go!
-Wait!

604
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,178
I'm not leaving.
My husband told me everything.

605
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,931
I heard she stepped on dung
the moment she arrived

606
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,432
and cried a river.

607
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,148
It's crazy. How could she step
on dung as soon as she arrived?

608
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,275
Let's be frank.

609
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,403
-Your mom is the one who stepped in dung.
-That's right.

610
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,198
They're former in-laws
who ended things on a bad note.

611
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,951
That dirt-poor family
fled in the middle of the night,

612
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,452
and Ms. Jeon had to take them in.

613
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,997
Yes, I saw the news.
They have nothing to their names now.

614
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:26,835
Your mom may look tough,
but she's such a softie at heart.

615
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,462
-Yes.
-Thanks.

616
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,760
By the way, isn't that woman so shameless?

617
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,429
How dare she come here
after what she's done?

618
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,265
-Right.
-You know what?

619
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,850
I'd love to see her face just once.

620
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,935
Me too.

621
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,813
What? Is there something on my lips?

622
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,986
Then look.

623
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,698
You wanted to see me, so take a good look.

624
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,537
Our assets are just frozen for now.

625
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,913
We're not dirt-poor.

626
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:06,250
Though it was late when we arrived,
we didn't flee in the middle of the night.

627
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,626
And we'll be leaving soon.

628
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,963
We're not mooching off of them.

629
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,214
Do you understand?

630
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,675
-Yes.
-Yes.

631
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,137
Jeez.

632
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,847
What do you take me for?

633
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,850
Wait.

634
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,437
Hey.

635
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,023
You didn't have breakfast.

636
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,151
I'm taking these to the orchard.

637
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,570
The cold bean-soup noodles
are tasty and refreshing.

638
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,696
Would you like some?

639
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,748
I don't have carbs during the day.

640
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,759
Jeez. Then when will you have them?

641
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,271
How do you feel about becoming
the youngest chairman?

642
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,065
What's your plan?

643
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,108
Is it any different
from the previous management?

644
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,153
There is rumor of a large-scale
restructuring. Is it true?

645
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,655
How is Chairman Hong doing?

646
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,539
I plan to establish
a corporation in Singapore by 2025

647
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,251
so we can branch out to foreign markets.

648
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,629
It'll cost us
about 140 billion won to establish

649
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,964
and run this corporation
that'll serve as the foundation

650
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,217
for department stores
and supermarkets abroad.

651
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,387
I visited Mr. Song
at the penitentiary and spoke with him.

652
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,182
I don't think he knows
where the chairman's secret fund is.

653
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,393
He created the fund and wired it abroad,

654
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,978
but he doesn't know where it is.

655
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,647
How's that possible?

656
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,942
The chairman's office
manually managed the ledger

657
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,985
and handed it
to the chairman to be reviewed.

658
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,657
The laundering process was complicated
as they went through ten countries.

659
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,661
The last destination
was a bank in Labuan, Malaysia,

660
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,204
but the money wasn't there.

661
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,674
You wanted to see me, Chairman Yoon?

662
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,302
You didn't hesitate

663
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,013
to call me that.

664
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,348
Why should I?

665
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,558
Things have changed.

666
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,853
I'm no longer a part of Queens
or Hae-in's husband.

667
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,396
I see.

668
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,523
But it's a pity.

669
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:38,652
I feel uncomfortable
that you're still leading our Legal Team.

670
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,737
Of course. I understand.

671
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:43,782
Mr. Baek.

672
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,537
Drop the act already.

673
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,546
I'll be honest
since you seem to know everything.

674
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,715
I'm still waiting.

675
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,802
I submitted my resume
to Baekhwa, Taepung, Hwang & Kim.

676
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,847
We're still negotiating my salary,
but it's not easy in this field.

677
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,683
It's hard to raise your salary
if you've been on a break.

678
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:14,062
As you already know,
I didn't receive any alimony.

679
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,148
So I need to make this work.

680
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,567
I only need one month.

681
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,653
Could you please help me out?

682
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,657
So you're looking for a new job?

683
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,034
Correct. And as you know,

684
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,454
I have no access
to the Legal Team's classified documents.

685
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,164
There's nothing to worry about.

686
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,128
You may go.

687
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,841
Where is she?

688
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,220
Hae-in.

689
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,138
Wasn't it you who picked her up yesterday?

690
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,686
So where is she?

691
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:57,689
I'm afraid

692
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,108
I don't know either.

693
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,530
You picked her up,
but you don't know where she went?

694
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,532
Exactly.

695
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,200
I guess she couldn't trust me.

696
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,036
She took the car
and hasn't been picking up.

697
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,704
Please let me know

698
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,289
if you find her.

699
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:16,959
Sure.

700
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,787
You're the true owner of this teacup.

701
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,164
It suits you much better.

702
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,667
I love your outfit too.

703
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,670
You look glamorous and elegant.
That's rare.

704
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:05,424
This is why I haven't been dressing up.
It's easy for me to look glamorous.

705
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,428
Please come by the spa
before I close it down.

706
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,555
Let me take care of you one last time.

707
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,181
Are you closing it down?

708
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,476
Sorry?

709
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,186
Why? Hasn't business been good?

710
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,195
Of course, you should shut it down.

711
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,031
Right?

712
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,490
You've had it for a long time.

713
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,742
Exactly.

714
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,203
I thought I'd grow old
while making others look more youthful.

715
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,623
-That can't happen.
-Right?

716
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,003
Once I take office,
I want to launch a cosmetic line

717
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,963
with products from the department store.

718
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,048
What do you say?

719
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,217
Just like Lafayette or Harrods,

720
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,720
we should give our store
a luxurious reputation--

721
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:52,846
Wait.

722
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:53,972
"Take office"?

723
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,975
-What?
-Where?

724
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,520
Aren't I taking over Hae-in's spot?

725
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,566
Would it look too weird
if I took over right away?

726
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,652
Then how about a director first?

727
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,243
What is it?

728
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,830
Close down your spa,

729
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,709
pack up your stuff,
and join Director Jo in the US.

730
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,004
We have too much to lose
if they catch you here.

731
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,634
You can start
a small cosmetic line there if you want.

732
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,886
I'll look for some investors.

733
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,063
You can shut down your business,
move, and go into hiding.

734
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,399
But one thing you can't change
is your child's academy

735
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,525
if you're a parent.

736
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,943
His daughter is a senior.

737
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,987
She's preparing to go
to college by majoring in cello.

738
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,660
I sued you for fraud and violating
the Communications Privacy Act,

739
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,037
but they couldn't send you
the papers since you were gone.

740
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,539
I looked everywhere for you.

741
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,470
So he had this all along.

742
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,805
He must've made a copy.

743
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,307
Who is she?

744
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,523
Soo-cheol, let me reveal the truth

745
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,900
about your former wife, Cheon Da-hye.

746
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,902
It might scare you a bit.

747
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,532
You said you'd get rashes
just eating next to an older woman.

748
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,577
But you see, I'm five years your senior.

749
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,998
Everything about my parents,
their wealth, and my education is fake.

750
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,085
One more. Geon-u isn't your son.

751
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,297
How was it not obvious?

752
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,300
You have sharp features,
while Geon-u's are soft.

753
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,051
How could you not suspect it?

754
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,930
I'm sad to leave you as well.

755
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,143
I'll never meet another man like you.

756
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,270
Are you going to marry me or not?

757
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,313
I said no.

758
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,275
Fine, but give me your gloves then.

759
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,986
You're skittish yet clumsy.

760
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,321
What's my name again?

761
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,697
Cheon Da-hye.

762
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,657
You're rich, but you're not too bright.

763
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,203
Can you promise
that I don't have to marry you?

764
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,287
Yes.

765
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,539
By the way, is that muffler warm?

766
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:46,144
You should've recognized me
after giving me everything I wanted.

767
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,064
Please give them a round of applause

768
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:51,733
as they begin their new journey.

769
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,489
They're both good-looking.

770
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,324
Hey.

771
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,326
Don't make me frustrated.

772
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,204
I was so annoyed
when Hae-in refused to listen to me

773
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,914
and chose that guy instead.

774
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,917
You better seduce Soo-cheol
and marry him right away.

775
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,418
All right.

776
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,546
Don't tell him your real name.

777
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,839
Use a fake one.

778
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,258
No, I'm going to use my real name.

779
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,260
By the way, where is he?

780
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,845
Over there.

781
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,763
Don't ever get married.

782
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,973
It's so hectic.

783
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,015
-No way.
-I know.

784
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,393
That's the crybaby that I knew?

785
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,353
He's so tall. Just my type.

786
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,106
No, behind him.

787
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,618
That fool. He hasn't changed.

788
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,080
-Gosh.
-Anyway, eat up since you're here anyway.

789
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,333
Goodbye.

790
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,933
-Sir.
-It's nice to see you.

791
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,019
Where have you been?
I was looking for you.

792
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,353
I'm glad you're here.

793
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,646
Eat up.

794
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,733
But you failed to recognize me.

795
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,415
Hello.

796
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,083
My name is Cheon Da-hye.

797
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,710
"Cheon Da-hye"?

798
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,009
That's a pretty name.

799
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,802
And so is your face.

800
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,888
I see.

801
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,601
You haven't eaten yet.

802
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,061
Let's see…

803
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,896
Forget me

804
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,774
like you have in the past.

805
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,150
Geon-u too.

806
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,028
It won't be hard.
You're not that bright anyway.

807
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,665
Hey.

808
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,085
Why are you crying?

809
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,881
Where will I find Da-hye?

810
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,888
You can't.

811
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,224
She took everything
and probably went into hiding.

812
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,270
No, you're wrong. She forgot something.

813
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,438
What?

814
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,607
Me.

815
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,403
I'm still here.

816
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,114
She used to say

817
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,450
that I was the most precious person.

818
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,330
So where did she go
after leaving me behind?

819
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,952
Gosh, are you up?

820
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,245
Hi, you're up.

821
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:34,330
Hold on.

822
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,553
Look at this, Geon-u.

823
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,514
It used to be my favorite doll.

824
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,273
But what's the point of doing this now?

825
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,983
The tables have been turned.

826
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,902
-I'll turn them back again.
-But how?

827
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:07,113
Eun-sung didn't achieve
what he did legally, and I'll prove that.

828
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,281
Fine.

829
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,701
Let's say it was illegal
and we had all the proof.

830
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,496
Filing a suit, attending trials,
suing him again for the stocks…

831
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,414
It'll take at least five years.

832
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,957
-Are you sure?
-I'll take a shortcut.

833
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,542
-Which is?
-Investment fraud.

834
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,754
He schemed a two-trillion investment fraud

835
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,631
from the get-go and lured the family

836
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,175
with a new business idea
to steal their stocks.

837
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,304
They'll get their provisional seizures
back if I can prove it.

838
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,681
But most importantly,
he'll lose his power.

839
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,724
What about the stocks?

840
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,684
The stocks would still be his.

841
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,229
I'm going to use the same tactic he did.

842
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,781
-What are you doing?
-I just have a lot of time.

843
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,617
They should give us new positions.
I feel uneasy here.

844
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,618
I felt bad.

845
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,329
I've never rejected
Mr. Hong's call before.

846
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,372
Don't feel bad.

847
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,125
It's best to cut ties immediately.

848
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,669
Weren't you pretty close
with Ms. Hong though?

849
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,628
Who's that?

850
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,255
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

851
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:09,592
Do you know why "friendship" and "loyalty"
are abstract nouns?

852
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,010
Because they don't exist.

853
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,225
Secretary Na and Ms. Hong
don't seem to be in touch at all.

854
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,726
She's taking some time off.

855
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,854
She's going to stay
at a farm with her kid.

856
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,064
-And Mr. Baek?
-He has no work these days.

857
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,358
So he's been writing resumes

858
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,318
and attending job interviews too.

859
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,826
I don't want to hear it!
Bring out the executives!

860
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,953
-Arrest them!
-Arrest them!

861
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,747
We demand that Queens
resolve this investment fraud!

862
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,624
Hey, what's your plan?

863
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,625
They look livid.

864
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,420
The legal director is also on their side!

865
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,880
You married into that family!

866
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:47,922
No, you're wrong.

867
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,008
He's been fired from work and home.

868
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,093
He has no influence whatsoever.

869
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,723
Anyway…

870
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,684
I came here to hear you out.

871
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,436
We've already told our story.

872
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:04,522
Queens lured us in by offering
to pay five times the market price.

873
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,733
Then they said
the resort complex project fell through

874
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,401
and offered only double?

875
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,572
I think there was a double contract.

876
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,866
-Let me see the contract and--
-Don't be absurd.

877
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,386
ATTORNEY HWANG

878
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,393
BANK PRESIDENT GU BON-JUN

879
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,278
ASSEMBLYMAN HAN

880
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,279
DIRECTOR RYU

881
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,199
I'M IN A MEETING.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

882
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,709
Goodness!

883
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,254
What are you doing out here?

884
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,340
You work on the weekends too.

885
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,424
Yes.

886
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,094
The weeds never stop growing.

887
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,388
There's nothing more we can ask for

888
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,683
than some cold makgeolli
and green onion pancakes

889
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,978
after our morning work.

890
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,521
I see.

891
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:30,483
You're living a great life
surrounded by nature.

892
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,568
I'm envious.

893
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,612
Goodness.

894
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,699
People will laugh if they hear
that a rich family

895
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,951
is envious of some farmers.

896
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,997
By the way, I'm not sure
if you've had makgeolli before.

897
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,206
I did once,

898
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,418
out of curiosity,
back in university 30 years ago.

899
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,548
Then you should have some today.

900
00:59:58,636 --> 00:59:59,470
Goodness.

901
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,098
-Here.
-Goodness.

902
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,225
Thank you.

903
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,520
Okay.

904
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,896
Then…

905
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,901
We need to make a toast,
but what should we say?

906
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:17,155
How about "Health matters the most"?

907
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,075
We can't say that

908
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,954
since his father is bedridden.

909
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,998
Then how about

910
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,916
"It's wonderful to see you"?

911
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,711
That won't work either

912
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,504
since their current situation

913
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,924
isn't that wonderful.

914
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,134
Let's just

915
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:39,886
clink our glasses.

916
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:40,928
But…

917
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,451
Goodness.

918
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,911
Goodness.

919
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,204
Are you okay?

920
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,290
Let's…

921
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,375
Let's drink a bit more.

922
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,044
Don't be silly. We should go home.

923
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,421
No, I won't go back there.

924
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,467
Gosh. Is our house uncomfortable?

925
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,469
I do admit that it's shabbier than--

926
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,430
No, that's not why!

927
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,267
As the head of my family,

928
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:33,231
I should comfort them and say

929
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,192
that everything is fine.

930
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,860
That things will pan out

931
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,530
and that we should go back home tomorrow.

932
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,534
But I can't say that right now.

933
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,203
I'm too ashamed to face them.

934
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:49,580
I don't want to go home either.

935
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,791
Oh, dear.

936
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,335
Earlier today,

937
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:58,047
I called my closest friend.

938
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,509
I had never asked for such a favor before,

939
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:06,097
but I asked him for just 20 million
since we had no money.

940
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,432
And?

941
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,684
He said no.

942
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,894
He was hesitant to give me money

943
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,231
since we'd be interrogated
by the prosecution soon,

944
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,108
and reporters are looking for us.

945
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,401
I see.

946
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,111
I was dumbfounded.

947
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:23,114
I can understand why you were dumbfounded

948
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,158
since he was your closest friend.

949
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,034
No, not because of him.

950
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,830
By the fact
that I didn't even have 20 million won.

951
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:35,960
I had recently signed
a tax invoice worth 45.6 billion won.

952
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:39,589
But now, I don't even have
20 million in my pocket.

953
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,425
I feel utterly pathetic.

954
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,097
Look.

955
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,810
I don't know if this will comfort you.

956
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,395
Okay.

957
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,730
But no one does.

958
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,150
No one has that much in their pockets.

959
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:03,404
Mr. Baek! I know you're lying
just to make me feel better!

960
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,531
I mean it!

961
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,366
I've never had that much before!

962
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,582
All right.

963
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,833
We'll talk again later.

964
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,294
Aunt Hae-in.

965
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:23,716
Hey.

966
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,261
I heard that you're in a pickle right now.

967
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,262
A bit.

968
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,889
It's a long story.

969
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,225
I heard it's a secret that you're here.

970
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,478
Don't worry.
No one will hear a peep from our end.

971
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,521
"Our end"?

972
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,855
The Yongdu-ri Internet cafe.

973
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,399
I pretty much run the place.

974
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,442
I see.

975
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:42,860
Okay.

976
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,032
Thanks.

977
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,274
Goodness, she's up.

978
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,984
-Hae-in.
-Are you okay, Hae-in?

979
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,613
Have some water, sweetie.

980
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,120
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

981
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,121
Shouldn't you?

982
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,456
I'm okay.

983
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,334
I couldn't sleep well last night,
so I felt dizzy.

984
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,794
Are you taking your medication?

985
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:44,630
What medication? Is she sick?

986
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,300
It's for my anemia.

987
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,259
You have anemia?

988
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,469
Your checkup results never showed that.

989
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,470
How bad is it?

990
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,598
Jeez, don't be so dramatic.

991
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,558
I'm anemic too.

992
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,311
I'm also dizzy
since I couldn't sleep much either.

993
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,646
It's not like Soo-cheol
is doing fine either.

994
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,024
We're all suffering here.

995
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:08,988
Even still, it's not normal to faint.

996
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,284
Tag along with Hyun-woo
to Seoul tomorrow and visit a hospital.

997
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,201
Okay, I'll do that.

998
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,292
What? I'm tired.

999
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,711
Why are you so harsh to Hae-in?

1000
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:26,547
-When was I?
-She's sick.

1001
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,049
She fainted.

1002
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,384
Even a stranger would be concerned.

1003
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,054
It's okay. Her mother-in-law--

1004
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,640
No, her former mother-in-law
takes good care of her anyway.

1005
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,933
Didn't you see?

1006
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,393
Hae-in didn't hesitate to obey her.

1007
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,688
Has she ever done the same to me?

1008
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,484
Seon-hwa, do you think
you know everything about Hae-in?

1009
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:50,988
No, of course not.
And there's no need for that.

1010
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:55,785
Seon-hwa.

1011
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:56,953
What?

1012
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,164
Gosh.

1013
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:01,958
Seon-hwa!

1014
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,834
What's wrong with you?

1015
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,461
Stop calling my name.

1016
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,545
Hae-in is…

1017
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,755
What about her?

1018
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,971
Just do me this favor.

1019
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,473
Treat her well
so you won't regret it later on.

1020
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,016
Please.

1021
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,644
Why would I regret it?

1022
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,980
I never do things that I regret.

1023
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,861
God, this is so upsetting.

1024
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,407
She's going to be so heartbroken.

1025
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:36,867
Gosh.

1026
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,603
Why aren't any of my exes like him?

1027
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,617
I called your doctor.

1028
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,703
-You can see him tomorrow.
-Sit down.

1029
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,419
What have you been up to?

1030
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:29,920
What?

1031
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:34,050
Some days, he was covered in eggs.

1032
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,449
LAND PURCHASE AGREEMENT

1033
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,742
Secretary Na?

1034
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,995
Let's have a meeting in the office pantry.

1035
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,080
Okay.

1036
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:09,543
I think he's been meeting

1037
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,170
with those land protestors.

1038
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,421
All right.

1039
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,506
We'll talk again later.

1040
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,549
Were you in touch with her?

1041
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,222
Tell me how much you found out

1042
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:22,765
behind my back.

1043
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,812
It's your typical
real estate investment fraud.

1044
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,439
A broker bought the land in question
from the owners

1045
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,650
and offered five times the market price.

1046
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,528
Then they signed a contract
with Queens for one-third of that price.

1047
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,904
A double contract?

1048
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,115
That's deliberate fraud.

1049
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,324
We need to prove that.

1050
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,159
And the broker? You mentioned one.

1051
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,702
Is he in Korea? Did he flee already?

1052
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,538
PARADISE LAND, LTD

1053
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,344
He did disappear,

1054
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,973
but he's getting married this weekend.

1055
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,476
I think he plans to fly out
immediately afterward.

1056
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,728
But he won't be able to.

1057
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,438
I persuaded the landowners to sue

1058
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,232
and put him on the No Fly List today.

1059
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,320
Things will pan out once we catch him.

1060
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:19,864
Yes.

1061
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,700
But you shouldn't concern yourself

1062
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:24,243
with this matter.

1063
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,619
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

1064
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:29,707
Look at me.

1065
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,875
I'm dying.

1066
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,253
Our family's ruined.
We're dirt-poor and homeless.

1067
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,880
My grandfather is in a coma.

1068
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:36,922
Da-hye ran off.

1069
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,340
Soo-cheol is out of it.

1070
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,383
But the worst part

1071
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,178
is that I'm in my ex-husband's hometown.

1072
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:45,639
Is that

1073
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:47,474
so terrible?

1074
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,227
I need to do something

1075
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,478
in this situation.

1076
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,106
Today, I even gave myself
the injection that'd raise my WBC.

1077
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,649
I don't want to sit still.

1078
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,068
I see. You did well.

1079
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,739
Yes, I'll be able to get back on my feet

1080
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,908
if I keep this up.

1081
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,328
And you'll be able to leave me
without feeling worried.

1082
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,664
Then we'll finally part ways

1083
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:13,500
like a true divorced couple.

1084
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,211
That's my goal.

1085
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,880
To part ways with you for good.

1086
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:27,514
I'll share everything

1087
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,184
with you from now on.

1088
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,061
Let's do everything we can

1089
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,605
as long as your body can take it.

1090
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:36,982
You should reach your goal

1091
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,068
as soon as possible.

1092
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:41,737
Right.

1096
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:17,124
I'll park and come up.

1097
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,751
Okay.

1098
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,628
ARE YOU THE PATIENT?
YES

1099
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,341

Wait! What's your name?

1106
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,161
Even the hospital director
refused to tell me your name,

1107
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,704
but I finally get to meet you.

1108
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,206
You wrote this diagnosis.

1109
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,667
So tell me.

1110
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,253
How can I save Hong Hae-in?

1111
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,422
That's all I need to know.

1112
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,984
Why are you here?
I'm going to the doctor's office.

1113
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:08,485
The doctor called.

1114
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,028
Eun-sung came by.

1115
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:25,502
I'm sorry.

1116
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:29,465
You're neither her family nor guardian,
so I'm not obligated to tell you.

1117
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,508
I have nothing to say.

1118
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:32,426
Is that so?

1119
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:35,846
Will you tell me if I become her guardian?

1120
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,933
YONGDU-RI SUPERMARKET

1121
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,020
Hello.

1122
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,230
Aren't you hungry?

1123
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,690
Please sit here.

1124
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,487
So…

1125
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,405
You see…

1126
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,323
Yes?

1127
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:58,160
An old lady lent me her handkerchief.

1128
01:14:58,243 --> 01:14:59,703
What old lady?

1129
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,373
So… She…

1130
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:07,169
She had a son.

1131
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,921
I see. And his name was?

1132
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,339
I'm not sure.

1133
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,591
He looked ordinary.

1134
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,302
He looked like Leslie Cheung.

1135
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,930
In our neighborhood?

1136
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,014
No, I doubt it.

1137
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:21,600
He had a great voice too.

1138
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,977
Like that of a singer.

1139
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,940
A man who looks like Leslie Cheung
and has the voice of a singer.

1140
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,399
In our neighborhood?

1141
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:34,238
Unless it was a ghost,
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

1142
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:36,573
No, I'm not.

1143
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,659
They look similar.

1144
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:46,792
Goodness.

1145
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:47,876
They're here.

1146
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,590
Are you hungry?

1147
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,509
-Yes.
-Okay, let's eat.

1148
01:15:57,177 --> 01:15:59,346
Great timing.

1149
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:00,973
Dinner is ready. Let's eat.

1150
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:01,974
What's for dinner?

1151
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,350
I made braised short ribs.

1152
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:04,893
-Braised short ribs?
-It's sweet.

1153
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,937
-I hope that's okay.
-Did you add chestnuts too?

1154
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:07,854
Did you…

1155
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,590
Did Grace visit you?

1156
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,633
Did you tell her no?

1157
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:39,219
Yes, I did.

1158
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:42,139
Well done. She needs to know her place.

1159
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,892
Send out a press release and say
that I'll take over the department store.

1160
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:47,686
No, that's Hae-in's spot.

1161
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,983
What are you saying?

1162
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:54,735
She's coming back.

1163
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,570
I'll manage it until then.

1164
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,618
He won't die that easily.

1165
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:04,453
I'm going to take great care of him

1166
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:07,372
so that he lives but remains unconscious.

1167
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:16,131
As long as he's in a coma,
I am in charge of 21% of the stocks.

1168
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,050
Do you understand?

1169
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,479
TAKE ME OFF THE NO FLY LIST
THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING

1170
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,349
MR. YOON EUN-SUNG

1171
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,645
What have you done?

1172
01:18:11,728 --> 01:18:12,771
I told you.

1173
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,398
We don't share the same goal.

1174
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:15,565
Where is the chairman?

1175
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,234
You shouldn't do this.

1176
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:19,152
What if he dies?

1177
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,529
Then it can't be helped.

1178
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,777
HONG HAE-IN

1179
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:01,695
I'm leaving now.

1180
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:58,502
Where are you going this late?
Let's have dinner.

1181
01:19:58,585 --> 01:19:59,503
I'm just going

1182
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,213
for a walk.

1183
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:05,717
I think Hyun-woo is coming soon.

1184
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,676
Is he?

1185
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,345
Yes.

1186
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:10,972
We should wait and eat with him.

1187
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,307
All right then.

1188
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,647
Don't go too far, okay?

1189
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,190
Okay.

1190
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:14,244
BAEK HYUN-WOO

1191
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,111
Hyun-woo?

1192
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,280
BAEK HYUN-WOO

1193
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:34,866
Mr. Pyeon Seong-uk?

1194
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:38,036
I've been looking for you.

1195
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,955
I see. I should be

1196
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,374
in Boracay right now after my wedding.

1197
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,918
But things have become complicated,
thanks to you.

1198
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:46,711
Did you get my text?

1199
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:47,712
I replied and said

1200
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,423
we should deal with it legally

1201
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:55,720
since I won't drop the suit.

1202
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,826
Exactly.

1203
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:03,496
The fact that you still kept this
all these years must mean

1204
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,291
you couldn't get her out of your head.

1205
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:08,752
She must've been gorgeous.

1206
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:11,963
Come on.

1207
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,758
It's not like that.

1208
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:15,967
I can't even remember

1209
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,761
if the person was male, female,

1210
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:20,096
a teacher, a student,

1211
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,767
or a security guard.
I can't remember a thing.

1212
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,810
That was close.

1213
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:29,230
She sure is sharp
just like a CEO should be.

1214
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,648
How could she get it right away?

1215
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,360
As soon as she saw it, her gut told her
that it belonged to a woman.

1216
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:35,862
It was close.

1217
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:37,072
I almost got caught.

1218
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,449
Didn't you say

1219
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:41,034
you searched the entire school

1220
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:43,953
for that girl just like the prince
from Cinderella?

1221
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:48,333
I did.

1222
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:50,752
She was really pretty.

1223
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,762
-Do you still remember that?
-Vividly.

1224
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,263
She was my ideal type.

1225
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,015
Do you think you'd recognize her?

1226
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:05,558
Right away.

1227
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,143
I know it's too late,

1228
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:10,605
but maybe she was your destiny.

1229
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,820
I wonder where she is
and what she's doing.

1230
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:26,955
QUEEN OF TEARS

1231
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,737
-What humiliation did he get?
-I'm going to kill you!

1232
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,782
Even still,
I would've made the same choice.

1233
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:06,077
You should know by now
that I do anything I set my mind to.

1234
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:08,329
No amount of money
can buy this experience.

1235
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,206
-You told me to hold it!
-Nepotism?

1236
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:12,792
Will he move out?
Does he want to live with you?

1237
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,419
No way. Is he jealous?

1238
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:18,381
From what I heard,
he's feigning ignorance.

1239
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:21,551
I have a knack for revealing truths.

1240
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,053
There's something I must do.

1241
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:25,930
You're really testing my patience,

1242
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,515
so just get lost.

1243
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,441
