EPISODE 4

3
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,574
Mr. Oh, have you left? Where are you?

4
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,161
What? Here it is.

5
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,210
It was in my pocket.

6
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,631
What?

7
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,178
Hae-in, wait.

8
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,055
Wait.

9
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,556
Wait.

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,641
Wait!

11
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,859
What are you doing?

12
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,445
I'm not sure.

13
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,031
What am I…

14
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,451
doing right now?

15
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,287
I'm glad

16
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,666
that you found your phone.

17
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,003
It could've been a hassle to get it.

18
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,595
Why wasn't I…

19
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,935
confident?

20
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,062
What?

21
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,898
What did you say?

22
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,361
Right.

23
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,076
I told you, right?

24
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,746
I'm going to try

25
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,749
new things from now on.

26
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,319
Good night.

27
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,073
Right. Good night.

28
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,708
Are you going to bed?

29
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,433
Well,

30
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,102
I'm not sure.

31
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,536
It'll recharge in no time.

32
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,288
What was that?

33
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,540
He could've just said

34
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,292
he wanted to come in.

35
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,547
What's with him?

36
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,438
Hae-in's birthday?

37
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,149
The day the department store went public.

38
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,778
My birthday?

39
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,616
It can't be our wedding anniversary.

40
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,827
One Trillion Club?

41
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,869
TRY AGAIN IN 30 SECONDS

42
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,204
Damn it.

43
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,986
Don't tell me…

44
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,787
It's 1031?

Okay, done.

00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,218
My God.

50
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,722
You startled me.

51
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,812
What are you…

52
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,816
doing here?

53
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,235
Well…

54
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,740
I couldn't sleep, so…

55
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,620
You couldn't

56
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,872
sleep,

57
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,920
so you came to my room?

58
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,261
So…

59
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,056
because of me?

60
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,560
You can't sleep because of me?

61
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,153
It's not that.

62
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,031
It's not like that at all. I just…

63
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,075
I just couldn't sleep.

64
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,993
For no particular reason.

65
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:01,415
So I came to see
if you were feeling the same.

66
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,669
And

67
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,420
if you wanted to talk.

68
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,132
But you're too tired, right?

69
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,802
I'm a bit tired,

70
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,305
but let's do it. Let's talk.

71
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,850
So where?

72
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,852
Should we sit here?

73
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,062
You're tired.

74
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,439
I guess I thought…

75
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,109
only of myself.

76
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,945
You had a few drinks,
and it's pretty late.

77
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,196
That's true, but…

78
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,240
So you're tired.

79
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,784
Well, I think
I've sobered up a little. Let's sit.

80
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,536
No. Don't sit.

81
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,374
I was being thoughtless.

82
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,419
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:50,256
You have a lot to do tomorrow.
You should rest.

84
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,218
Have a good night's sleep.

85
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,595
Lie down.

86
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,646
He cares…

87
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,610
so much for me.

88
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,536
That was so close.

89
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
No way…

90
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,694
It's 1031?

91
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,116
Congratulations.
You're four weeks pregnant.

92
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,038
Well…

93
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,707
Four weeks…

94
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,752
Then when will the baby be born?

95
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,172
It's due on October 31.

96
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,301
I see. October 31.

97
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,970
That's a good date.

98
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,972
October 31.

99
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,076
Please use top-quality
eco-friendly interior materials.

100
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,121
Right. I hear that thing
is a must for a baby's room.

101
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,328
I ought to…

102
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,873
How could you go there?

103
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,876
I mean, we've never met her properly
since they got married,

104
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,504
-but they suddenly mentioned divorce, so…
-Mom, I tried to stop her.

105
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,298
And you went with her?

106
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,551
Anyway, what did she say?

107
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,803
She had no idea.

108
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,055
-Yeah.
-Only Hyun-woo was thinking of divorce.

109
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,474
Really?

110
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,018
And she said she'd come visit us soon.

111
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,603
-And, Dad.
-Yes?

112
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,608
I finally added her on my messenger app!

113
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,945
But what about Hyun-woo?

114
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,198
He says he won't divorce her.

115
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,741
They're doing well. Don't worry.

116
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,993
-That's a relief.
-No, they are not!

117
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:10,122
He was considering divorce
while his wife had no idea.

118
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,790
You think they're doing well?

119
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,293
Neither of them know how the other feels.

120
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,008
Invite me in the chat.

121
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,929
I won't say much or send photos.

122
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,490
We will now take a photo
of the family members and relatives.

123
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,495
Ms. Kim.

124
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,789
Yes?

125
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,875
I know

126
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,712
that you don't like Hyun-woo
as your son-in-law.

127
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,049
I'm not sure if I should say this,

128
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,678
but when Hyun-woo told us
he was seeing someone,

129
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,306
he said that the girl might get fired
and become unemployed soon,

130
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,643
so he'd have to provide for her
if he married her.

131
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:17,022
Then our family said
he could find a better girl

132
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,567
and that she was too poor.

133
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,320
Even a family like us
was being so calculating.

134
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,281
I can't imagine how you felt.

135
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,994
There's a great difference.
I'm sure you were upset and disappointed.

136
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,621
We're all human after all.

137
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,498
So,

138
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,749
I understand.

139
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,920
Right. I'm glad that you understand.

140
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,131
I know

141
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,757
my son lacks a lot.

142
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,468
But I hope you take good care of him.

143
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,847
He lacks a lot?
You clearly don't know your son.

144
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,099
He managed to marry my daughter.

145
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,226
He's really something.

146
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,686
Pardon?

147
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,397
It's a compliment.
As a lawyer, he should be

148
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,359
good at calculating, being practical,
and taking what he wants.

149
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,237
-What do you--
-I'm saying he's smart

150
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,739
he didn't miss this opportunity.

151
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,285
What do you mean by "this opportunity"?

152
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,536
I'm sure you know.

153
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,580
Right.

154
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,082
Whatever you mean by it,

155
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,627
it's a marriage between our kids.

156
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,420
I know that.

157
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,174
Exactly. I just wanted
to say that it'd be nice,

158
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,010
as their parents, if we could help them

159
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,555
lead a happy marriage. That's all.

160
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,515
If it's their marriage,

161
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,477
it's their business to lead a happy life.

162
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,437
Why should we help?

163
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,485
Who's she to tell me what to do?

164
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,368
Divorce or not,

165
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,869
I'm so worried.

166
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,874
Please live a good life, will you?

167
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,876
Shoo!

168
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,353
Don't forget to drink orange juice
in the morning.

169
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,771
That's your hangover cure.

170
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,110
Isn't that too cold?

171
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,195
Want me to make you some tea?

172
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,614
Something warm would be better.

173
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,740
I'm good.

174
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,660
Hold on.

175
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,723
Keep yourself presentable.
You're not a kid.

176
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,827
My goodness.

177
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,247
I wondered why my heart was pounding.

178
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,668
It was because I was scared. That's it.

179
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,671
That's why my heart was racing so much.

180
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,240
What do you think?
I'm wearing this to the meeting tonight.

181
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,707
I see.

182
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,336
It's a Hercyna vintage jacket from 1982.

183
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,715
-Is that so?
-There are only two pieces in the world.

184
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,550
CEO Hermann's wife has one,

185
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,968
and the other is this one.

186
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,308
You don't like it?

187
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,603
That's not it.

188
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,480
Well…

189
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,695
It looks fine.

190
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,168
Why does she look pretty?

191
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,879
Why?

192
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,466
Why on earth?

193
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,345
What are you doing?

194
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,482
Let's go.

195
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,112
I like your suit.

196
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,533
My suit?

197
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,076
Yes. You look good.

198
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,222
You must be in a good mood.

199
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,641
No, not really.

200
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,059
But you were humming.

201
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,896
-Was I?
-Yes.

202
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,861
-When?
-Just now.

203
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,744
Are you excited?

204
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,830
Because she complimented you?
Is that why you were humming?

205
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,957
God, have I gone crazy?

206
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,420
Maybe I have since she hasn't
complimented me in so long, or…

207
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,015
Look at her frown.
She's unhappy with something.

208
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,018
She'll throw a fit soon.

209
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:33,273
Five, four, three, two, one.

210
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,318
What happened to decorating
the personal shopper room like a gallery?

211
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,820
-Oh, no.
-The artist's reputation and colors

212
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,073
don't suit the interior design!

213
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,952
Yelling and glaring like that,
she looks so mean.

214
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,413
That's why I get scared
and my heart races.

215
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,545
Yes, this is what I was talking about!

216
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,298
What happened? She's excited.

217
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,008
Not bad.

218
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,398
What the… What's wrong with me?

219
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,150
Why did I smile?

220
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,861
Get a grip.

221
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,363
Hey, that's dangerous.

222
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,284
You know how actors fall in love for real
while filming romantic scenes together.

223
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,202
Like Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin.

224
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,704
That's not the case.

225
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,331
And yet you bought her shoes?

226
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,462
Goodness.

227
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,590
The whole point of an escalator
is to avoid having to walk up.

228
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,509
She's so impatient.

229
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,262
I can't believe her.

230
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,265
Watch out!

231
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,692
Did someone just yell?

232
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,818
I heard it too.

233
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,154
What kind of lunatic yells like that here?

234
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
Sir?

235
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,166
Can I help you?

236
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,877
Well…

237
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,423
Do you have a pair of these in size 240?

238
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,551
That's why you bought the shoes for her?

239
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,763
She hasn't changed her will.
I can't let her

240
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,473
-fall and die.
-Right.

241
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,516
-So that's why?
-Of course.

242
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,768
Even I was surprised

243
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,479
that I was so calculating
and cold-hearted.

244
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,189
So? What did she say?

245
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,830
So, you bought them
because they were 50% off?

246
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,707
And today is the last day.

247
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,210
Plus, 240 is a popular size,

248
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,712
and the white ones
are sold out all over the country.

249
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,380
Except for this pair.

250
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,716
I had to buy them.

251
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,676
I'm sure you did.

252
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,055
But my shoe closet

253
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,642
is full of expensive shoes
that I had to pay extra to buy.

254
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,521
Would I ever wear ones
bought at half price?

255
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:21,274
Of course, I know that you have
a lot of expensive, luxurious shoes.

256
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,277
But none of them are comfy.

257
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,949
-They're pretty.
-You're pretty even without them.

258
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:35,122
Besides, the heels are so thin and high.

259
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,333
I'm worried you might fall.

260
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,586
So why don't you

261
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,131
wear comfy shoes once in a while?

262
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,636
Leave them here, then.

263
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,514
She didn't like them then.

264
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,808
I couldn't believe her reaction.

265
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,184
But even more unbelievable?

266
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,102
What is it?

267
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,398
She wore them.

268
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,742
-Wow, Ms. Hong looks so…
-Right?

269
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,369
Pretty, right?

270
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,289
No, she looks so feisty today.

271
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,294
As if she's ready to crush anyone.

272
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,006
Exactly.

273
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,510
Anyway, those two meet
so often these days.

274
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,138
-This is Secretary Na.
-Oh, hi.

275
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,056
Right.

276
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,393
It's because of the Hercyna store.

277
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,981
Recently, Mr. Yoon
has been visiting every day,

278
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,482
having meals and coffee,

279
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,526
and even taking walks with her.

280
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,281
It seems you don't know this,

281
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,283
but workaholics even use

282
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,453
mealtimes and coffee breaks
to talk about work.

283
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,121
That's why.

284
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,966
Mr. Yoon may be her friend,

285
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,802
but he clearly doesn't know Hae-in well.

286
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,763
Hae-in hates it

287
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,016
when someone touches her hair like that.

288
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,643
She's smiling.

289
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,147
It seems she doesn't really hate it.

290
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,110
So is it bothering you?
Does it make you jealous?

291
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,406
Were you even listening?
Don't you get my point?

292
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,617
That's your point. You're jealous.

293
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,370
Don't you know what "jealousy" means?

294
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,790
That's what you feel when you like someone

295
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,584
and a rival happens to show up.

296
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,961
That's the wrong premise.

297
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,463
I don't even like Hae-in.
Why would I be jealous?

298
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,258
-So it doesn't bother you?
-No, not at all.

299
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,635
I don't care if they're close

300
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,762
or if they go anywhere together.

301
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,848
I got it, but what are you grilling
instead of meat?

302
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,572
Are you wearing those?

303
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,077
My husband bought them for me
and asked that I wear them. What can I do?

304
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,874
Still, we're meeting the CEO of Hercyna.
Wouldn't it be better to wear their shoes?

305
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,209
Want me to find you some?

306
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,004
I'm wearing their clothes.

307
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,797
Their shoes are uncomfortable.

308
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,967
And he's worried that I might fall.

309
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,884
Who is?

310
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:36,970
Hyun-woo is.

311
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,806
What a worrywart.

312
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,160
Right.

313
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,247
What?

314
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,251
Whatever Hermann says, just listen.

315
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,794
When he's done,

316
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,838
just say one thing.

317
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,656
Sara Lopez?

318
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,077
She's a popular designer in Europe.
We're planning to open up a store.

319
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,036
What about her?

320
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,081
She's Hermann's new mistress.

321
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,000
I see.

322
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,336
And his wife doesn't know?

323
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,673
She's a hot-tempered, competent lawyer.

324
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,258
If she finds out,

325
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,387
he'll never see his baby girl.

326
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,141
Hermann was glaring at you.

327
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,895
Because besides the two,
I was the only one who knew.

328
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,606
Aren't you in a fix, then?

329
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,192
It's all right.

330
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,738
I have a few more cards
to play against him.

331
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,075
Ye-na was right.

332
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,202
You're not the Eun-sung I knew.

333
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,246
What's happened?

334
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,041
I've worked very hard

335
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,461
to hear this from you.

336
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,507
A debt or kindness, I always repay it.
I owe you one.

337
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,053
All right. I'll hold you to it.

338
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,855
WALNUT AND PEANUT SNACKS

339
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,985
One bag of peanut cakes, please.

340
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,111
Sure.

341
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,197
Please pack it in two layers.

342
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,281
Okay.

343
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,326
-You're bringing it home?
-Yes.

344
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,625
This is why I'm suspicious.

345
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,712
In my eyes, if you think of her
when you see these snacks

346
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,297
when you're drunk,

347
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,842
it means you love her!

348
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,927
Love, my foot.

349
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,346
-They're just peanut cakes.
-Here.

350
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,514
You want one too?

351
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,891
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

352
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,559
They're just…

353
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,021
peanut cakes.

354
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,737
Where are you? Hurry home.
I have something to tell you.

355
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,032
Don't worry.
It's good news that you'll love.

356
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,283
Something to tell me?

357
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,577
Good news that you'll love?

358
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,540
Wait! No way.

359
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,917
-What?
-"I leave all my assets

360
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,794
to Baek Hyun-woo."

361
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,962
Changing her will.

362
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,426
-Come on. No way.
-Yes way!

363
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,679
It must be it! Yay!

364
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,597
Congrats, you punk!

365
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,433
-Don't forget about me.
-It can't be that.

366
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,601
Let go.

367
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,686
You punk!

368
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,398
Hey.

369
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,608
Hey.

370
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,322
These are peanut cakes. Want some?

371
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,252
I wanted to give you this
before it got cold.

372
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,254
So I rushed home.

373
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,051
How is it?

374
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,928
It's good.

375
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,013
It's still warm.

376
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,140
Right?

377
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,604
By the way,

378
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:42,108
what is this good news I'll love?

379
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,192
Right.

380
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,778
Why don't you open it?

381
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,032
This?

382
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,705
Open it?

383
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,501
Don't be surprised.

384
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,547
Okay.

385
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,382
I won't.

386
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,054
I got it just earlier.

387
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,973
It's from one of the best cancer centers
in Europe.

388
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,435
On the next pages
are their research papers.

389
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,194
Yes.

390
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,320
That's right.

391
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,948
They think they can cure me.

392
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,075
-What?
-And the chance…

393
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,956
is over 50%.

394
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,041
Over?

395
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,294
I knew you'd be so happy.

396
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,132
Here.

397
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,469
The chance is about 51%.

398
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,931
And they'd like
to do clinical treatments on me.

399
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,183
-It's true.
-What did I say?

400
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,268
I said I'd never lose to that illness.

401
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,187
That God's on my side.

402
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,815
You're on my side,

403
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,858
and so is God.

404
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,820
My goodness.

405
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,447
I feel so reassured.

406
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,609
If

407
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,862
she is cured,

408
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,281
then…

409
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,158
The team dinner finished

410
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,995
-at 9:30 p.m. last night, so why…
-Why did you have to bring it up at…

411
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,329
Didn't I tell you?

412
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,749
I'm just worried.

413
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,251
-Say something!
-It's not Hyun-woo.

414
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,004
-You're a part of our Hong family!
-Hyun-woo!

415
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,677
Hurry up. We're going to be late.
This is why you're always late.

416
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,056
-I'm sorry.
-You're so frustrating.

417
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,267
A life like that

418
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,895
for 50 more years?

419
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,524
No.

420
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,652
I should get a divorce

421
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,196
as I originally planned.

422
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,324
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

423
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,369
Right.

424
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,455
Now that I've been cured,

425
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,999
you're going to betray me?

426
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,128
You got your life back,

427
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,421
so I want mine back too.

428
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,094
Right.

429
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,305
People can feel that way.

430
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,099
It's understandable.

431
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,562
However…

432
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,200
Not my people.

433
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,587
It might be worse than my imagination.

434
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,971
God, I'm exhausted.

435
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,139
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

436
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,473
Yes, I'm all right.

437
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,934
Goodness, it's exhausting.

438
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,939
Goodness.

439
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,816
I've gotten a lot better.

440
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,402
Dad, aren't you thirsty? Have this.

441
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,447
Right. Thanks.

442
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,410
Can I really drink this?
You didn't poison it, did you?

443
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,871
Come on, Dad. Just drink it.

444
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,415
What's gotten into you?

445
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,083
I was always like this.

446
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,711
Look at this.

447
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,047
We used to be so happy together.

448
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,967
I mean, we used to be,
before some bitch entered the picture.

449
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,886
We weren't this messed up.

450
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,971
Mr. Hong, I'll go inside first.

451
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,361
Dad, do you remember

452
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,530
how much you adored me?

453
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,615
You doted on me.

454
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:26,577
You always bought a gift for me
on your way back from your business trips.

455
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,537
That was ages ago.

456
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,875
You always told me to live
with you forever without getting married.

457
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,336
And see? I'm still by your side.

458
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,714
I didn't tell you
to get married and come back.

459
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,674
Come on.

460
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,926
Love is about coming back, Dad.

461
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,096
Why did I come back within three years
whenever I got married?

462
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,139
That's because

463
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,643
your lovely daughter loves you.

464
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,895
Hey, stop. I'm eating soon.

465
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,772
-I'll lose my appetite.
-Oh, no.

466
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,024
You shouldn't lose your appetite.

467
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,278
At your age, it's more dangerous
than running out of money.

468
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,572
What is it? Just say it.
Why are you being like this?

469
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,868
You know, it's my birthday
the day after tomorrow.

470
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,787
I don't want anything else.

471
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,500
I just want to go on a date
with my beloved dad, just the two of us.

472
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,876
-Please?
-My God.

473
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,754
Please, Dad?

474
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,966
I want to have
something delicious with you.

475
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,593
-Stop it.
-Will you treat me to something nice?

476
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,138
Hey, stop. That's gross!

477
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,472
Stop! Go away!

478
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,292
Hey.

479
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,337
-Hello.
-Hello.

480
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,340
What are you doing here
in the morning on a weekend?

481
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,133
For the negotiation with Hercyna.

482
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,010
Oh, then I should join you.

483
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,014
The Legal Team should be in the loop
to work on the details.

484
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,599
That'll come later.

485
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,102
We're discussing the negotiation
between the CEOs

486
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,688
to get rid of any deal-breaking factors.

487
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,193
Are we bothering you?
We can go somewhere else.

488
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,444
What about my hotel?

489
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,571
You can just do it here.

490
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,448
Here, comfortably.

491
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,659
Thank you.

492
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,828
I should thank you.

493
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,497
You're helping my wife.

494
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,082
Want some coffee?

495
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,500
-Yes, thanks.
-Sure.

496
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,712
You too? You don't drink coffee
on an empty stomach.

497
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,762
That's true.

498
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,266
-An espresso for you, right?
-Yes.

499
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,572
She cares for me so much.

500
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,117
What?

501
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,913
She says coffee's like poison
on an empty stomach and it's unhealthy.

502
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,458
She doesn't let me drink it.

503
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,794
I mean, I'm not her kid, you know?

504
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,423
I guess she can't stop

505
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,175
worrying about me.

506
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,553
Hae-in must care so much for you.

507
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,721
I envy you.

508
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,266
Well, yes. I think so too.

509
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,226
She's not like that to me.

510
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:41,814
She always asks me for help,
saying I'm the only one who can help her.

511
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,899
She was always like that.

512
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,280
She'd call me anytime asking for help,
saying I was the only one she had.

513
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,948
How could I not help then?

514
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:55,077
Even this time around. This kind
of negotiation could even take a year.

515
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,496
But she asked me
to finish it in two weeks.

516
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,792
I won't have time to do anything else
while I'm in Korea.

517
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,669
It seems

518
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,130
I have to be stuck with her all the time.

519
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:10,885
That's

520
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,721
reassuring.

521
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,857
Are you bringing this to him?

522
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,323
I'm suddenly curious.

523
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,950
About what?

524
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,120
Don't you hate it
when someone touches your hair?

525
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,997
-What?
-I mean,

526
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,582
when I touched it last time,

527
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,502
you yelled at me,
saying I was ruining your hairstyle.

528
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,795
What are you saying?

529
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,464
Put it simply.

530
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,134
You got mad when I did it,

531
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,137
so why didn't you when Mr. Yoon did it?

532
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,097
What?

533
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,353
Oh, that's because--

534
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,646
I want you to be fair.

535
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,315
Not just Mr. Yoon.

536
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,526
If any guy touches your hair,

537
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,444
you should get mad.

538
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,323
Except for your hairdresser.

539
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,674
She just left…

540
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,261
without saying anything.

541
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,275
How could she do that?

542
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,317
Darn it.

543
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,031
Goodness.

544
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,329
God…

545
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,583
This is unbelievable.

546
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:10,671
I've never been this annoyed
at someone's smile.

547
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,298
He really is something.

548
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,269
He's still smiling. What?

549
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,732
That jerk. Why is he pulling it down?
Hey, you bastard. Wait.

550
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,611
Wait. Hey.

551
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,572
What's wrong with him?

552
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,074
You think I can't watch you
if you do this?

553
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,368
I'll find a way, no matter what.

554
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,430
I'm…

555
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,266
just walking by.

556
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,602
Walking around.

557
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:11,899
It's not because I'm curious.

558
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,279
Goodness.

559
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,698
What?

560
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,201
What is it?

561
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,414
Didn't you say "Honey"?

562
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,749
No, I didn't.

563
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,459
I see.

564
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,544
I must've heard wrong.

565
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,671
All right.

566
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,465
Well, carry on.

567
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,510
Call me if you need me.

568
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,761
No, I won't need you today.

569
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,554
Just go and rest.

570
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,140
I am resting.

571
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,727
-Hey.
-Yes?

572
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,895
No, not you.

573
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,105
Eun-sung!

574
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,525
I heard my sister
was bothering you on Sunday, so I came.

575
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,026
Hey, get lost.

576
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,736
We're working.

577
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,697
You know,
I tried to contact you many times,

578
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,949
but your secretary

579
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,785
doesn't suit your international,
clean-cut image.

580
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:09,706
She hung up on me without knowing
how close we are. I was so hurt.

581
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,875
Really? I'll talk to them, Mr. Hong.

582
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,171
Don't be so formal with me.
Just treat me like your little brother.

583
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,550
Seriously, I feel closer to you
than Hyun-woo,

584
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,094
who's been my brother-in-law
for three years.

585
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,430
You're still here?

586
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,474
I'm leaving.

587
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,518
-No, don't come out.
-Right.

588
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,103
I won't.

589
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,522
Have you eaten yet?

590
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,275
Why are you so down?

591
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:41,905
The way I see it,
Eun-sung's like your new hope.

592
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,323
What do you mean?

593
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,577
Hae-in has a 51% chance of living now.

594
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,079
Of course, you should be happy for her.

595
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,665
But your hope is gone.

596
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:55,335
Your hope for a rich and safe parting.

597
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,420
So?

598
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,925
What if Eun-sung and Hae-in fall in love?

599
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,010
You'll get alimony.

600
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,344
No, not Yoon Eun-sung.

601
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,637
Why not?

602
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,682
That guy's creepy.

603
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,229
Who cares?

604
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,024
Hey, I think he's your savior.

605
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,319
You should be grateful
that he's come to save you.

606
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,614
There is something off with him.

607
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,618
-I can feel it.
-Come on.

608
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,872
Who cares what your savior is like?

609
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,292
If you're drowning, and you don't like
the rescuer, will you not

610
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,378
grab the rope?

611
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,800
In any case,
I can't let it be that bastard.

612
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,677
I said no.

613
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,183
Are you okay?

614
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,476
Eun-sung.

615
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,604
See this land? It's a million pyeong.

616
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,732
Neverland is 430,000 pyeong,
and Souland is 280,000 pyeong.

617
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,526
It's bigger than the two combined.

618
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,902
Impressive.

619
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,948
You know the two most important things
in the resort business,

620
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,866
securing the land and licensing.

621
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,328
As you can see, we have the land,
and as for licensing…

622
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,041
We have our person
in the Ministry of Land.

623
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,585
Is that so?

624
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,421
He studied with Queens scholarships.

625
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,673
And he was my tutor.

626
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,758
-I see.
-Right.

627
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,887
K-pop, K-drama.
Korean content is so popular these days.

628
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,431
Let's outdo Disney together, Eun-sung!

629
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,936
I'll think about it.

630
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:01,712
Oh, my.

631
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,172
He meets all these people?

632
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,010
Do you know Robert Bailey,
the legendary hedge fund manager?

633
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,762
Among his 12 apprentices,
this guy's the best one.

634
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,601
Robert even entrusted his asset management
with him. What more is there to say?

635
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:17,978
Really?

636
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,814
He's perfect
as Mr. Hong Soo-cheol's partner.

637
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,193
But he's quite picky, so…

638
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,156
But he's willingly
helping Hae-in regarding Hercyna.

639
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,450
Yes, since the two are so close.

640
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:37,748
And that might be why
Mr. Yoon isn't getting close to Mr. Hong.

641
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,250
What do you mean?

642
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,293
Think about it.

643
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,544
For Ms. Hong,

644
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:46,715
if Hercyna opens in her mall, she'll reach
one trillion won in sales for sure.

645
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:51,678
Then the chairman will lean towards
giving the group to her, as he promised.

646
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,971
Are you saying

647
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:57,351
Hae-in doesn't want Soo-cheol to succeed
in attracting investment for the resort?

648
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,688
Yes! Soo-cheol could turn the tables.

649
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:07,653
I mean, I don't know
what Ms. Hong told Mr. Yoon,

650
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:11,239
but it seems he doesn't consider
Mr. Hong as a potential partner.

651
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,910
He's having dinner
with Chairman Yeom's grandchild tonight.

652
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,207
Fortune telling doesn't lie.

653
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,958
I told you, didn't I?

654
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:27,005
Ms. Hong's fated
to prey on her siblings all her life.

655
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,968
Anyway, you don't need anything else
to deal with her.

656
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,180
Fortune telling is like the Bible to her.

657
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,183
If you look up anything online
and tell her,

658
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,601
she just believes it.

659
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,062
But that worked to your advantage.

660
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:48,235
That's true. I've benefitted
a lot from it for about 15 years.

661
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,940
What brings you here?

662
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,653
I knew it.

663
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,616
If I hadn't withdrawn the suit, your mall
in Gwanggyo wouldn't even be happening.

664
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,160
Do you want that?

665
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,790
Stop beating around the bush.

666
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,876
Just tell me.

667
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,630
What did you tell
Eun-sung about Soo-cheol?

668
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,760
What did you say that made him
not consider investing in Soo-cheol?

669
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,969
What do you mean?

670
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,387
It's obvious.

671
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:02,350
"If Soo-cheol gets investment, it's bad
for me. So invest in Sang-jin instead."

672
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,811
Because that would make
the chairman furious.

673
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,939
Do you think that even makes sense?

674
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,359
Yes! I think
you're more than capable of doing that.

675
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,279
Because you're a bitch
who's selfish to the bone.

676
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:19,075
You don't care if anyone around you dies.
You just find a way to save yourself.

677
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,036
And that's why your older brother…

678
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,006
She's been feeling unwell
since this morning.

679
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,091
I think she needs to rest.

680
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,218
I'm sorry, Mother.

681
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,430
So are you telling me to leave?

682
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,766
When I'm still talking to her?

683
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,645
I'm sorry.

684
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,392
Let's tell your family.

685
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,270
I said no.

686
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:31,189
Situations like earlier
can happen anytime.

687
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,149
They might find out.

688
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,484
I'll get treated.

689
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,697
You're acting
like I'll drop dead tomorrow.

690
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,823
You're being

691
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,200
selfish and irresponsible.

692
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,327
Yes.

693
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,665
You're thinking about your money, stocks,
and the One Trillion Club. I get it.

694
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:54,045
I get that you're worried your family
could take what's yours if they find out.

695
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:55,839
But,

696
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,384
keeping this important matter from them

697
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,387
because you don't want anything
to be taken.

698
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,472
Is that right?

699
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,686
I don't want to shock them.

700
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,065
My parents…

701
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,741
They already lost a child.

702
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,333
So why scare them?

703
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,339
I can never be a good daughter anyway.

704
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,341
I just

705
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,053
don't want to be
a more terrible existence to my family.

706
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,889
And more importantly,

707
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,602
I'm confident I'll be cured.
So stop treating me like a patient.

708
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,569
Can you leave?

709
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,029
I want to rest.

710
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,419
And the stock purchase?

711
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,715
We bought 14.7% in total, 4.9% per person.

712
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,760
And the directors supporting the chairman?

713
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,479
The rate of return of the last blind trust
was close to 90%,

714
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,774
so they're eager to join the next fund.

715
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:41,277
We need to lead them to put
Queens stocks up as collateral next.

716
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,154
The minimum amount is so high,

717
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,199
I doubt they can come up
with that much cash in days.

718
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,952
If we rush them,
they'll put their stocks up as collateral.

719
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,871
Next is Chairman Hong.

720
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,000
The prosecution investigation.

721
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,210
I feel bad for him.

722
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,337
He hates jail.

723
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,301
By the way, how will you do it?

724
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,472
The chairman's real safekeeper

725
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,434
is Song Jeong-beom in Finance.

726
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:17,105
He's siphoning off his own share
as well as the chairman's slush funds.

727
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,026
We'll hand all the evidence
over to the prosecution.

728
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,319
And as they look into the higher-ups,

729
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,322
they will end up investigating
the chairman too.

730
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,463
You can see the Queens Tower from here.

731
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,675
And I like that.

732
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:50,138
It feels like
I'm looking at a delicious meal.

733
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,034
Damn it.

734
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,579
I told you to make the font bigger.

735
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,750
Darn it. Prepare the documents again
and set another meeting.

736
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,543
I can't believe them.

737
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,545
Get out!

738
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,048
Out!

739
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,102
I think I can let you join
the private equity fund.

740
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,646
The minimum amount is 20 billion won.

741
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,399
And you can put your Queens stocks up
as collateral if you're short of cash.

742
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,569
The earnings rate's expected to be higher.
First come, first served.

743
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,656
So make a quick decision.
Confidentiality is a must.

744
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,282
-Thank you.
-I understand.

745
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,450
That's possible.

746
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,956
She's already here.

747
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,333
What's gotten into Beom-ja?

748
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,379
Why does she suddenly
want to treat me to a meal?

749
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,011
The chairman has arrived.

750
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,240
No, Dad. You can't leave.

751
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,992
-Over my dead body.
-Move.

752
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,996
Dad, just hear me out.

753
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,497
I don't want anything else.

754
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,625
Just give me a chance.

755
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,877
You bastard.

756
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,503
Did I not give you a chance?

757
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:50,091
I gave you one, but you sold me out
to the prosecution to save yourself!

758
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,471
While I was locked up,
you schemed to take my place

759
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,098
with the directors who supported you.

760
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,601
-Have you forgotten?
-I wasn't in my right mind.

761
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:04,147
I heard you were trying
to pin the embezzlement charge on me,

762
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,273
so I lost it.

763
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,066
I'm so sorry.

764
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,403
It's been 20 years.

765
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,906
You would've even forgiven a stranger
after this long.

766
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,741
Why are you so harsh on your son?

767
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,993
I would rather forgive a stranger!

768
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,704
How could I forgive my own child
who betrayed me?

769
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,499
I just can't.

770
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,502
So never do something like this again.

771
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,503
Dad!

772
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,880
I missed you.

773
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,090
That's really why I came.

774
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,387
Well, you've seen me now.

775
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,557
I don't want to

776
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,768
see you again.

777
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,853
You ingrate.

778
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,105
Don't even come to my funeral.

779
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,944
Darn it.

780
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,674
Why do you look so down?

781
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,468
It seems you haven't eaten.

782
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,848
When you're not feeling well,

783
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,226
there's nothing better than

784
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,520
a bowl of this.

785
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,858
My mother always made me this
when I was sick.

786
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:35,863
Back when I used to sell newspapers
and shine people's shoes in Myeong-dong.

787
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,949
When I was hungry or sick,

788
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,954
I always thought of this.

789
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:44,956
Have some.

790
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:50,169
From sleeping on the streets
using newspapers as blankets

791
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:56,718
to owning one of Korea's
top department stores and mart franchises,

792
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,636
it took 60 years.

793
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,724
But why does it feel like

794
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,685
I'm standing alone in the wilderness?

795
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,813
Something must've
hurt your feelings badly.

796
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,566
Only I know how tenderhearted

797
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,651
you are.

798
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,375
It tastes just like

799
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,045
my mother's.

800
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,054
Why can't you give us a refund?

801
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,681
My baby's skin got ruined
after she used this,

802
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:47,101
but you can't give us a refund,
let alone compensate us?

803
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,396
Sir, it's been over eight months
since you purchased the product,

804
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,607
and you've almost used it all.

805
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,525
Hey. I'm glad you brought it up.

806
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,403
My face looks like this
because I used this much.

807
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,490
If I hadn't, my skin
wouldn't have become like this!

808
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,326
Babe, don't get worked up.
It'll get worse.

809
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,995
Just give us a refund right now.

810
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,872
Sir, we can't do that.

811
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,957
Didn't I make myself clear enough?

812
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,255
Sir, please calm down.

813
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,174
How can I calm down?

814
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,304
Right. You think I'm one
of those obnoxious customers, don't you?

815
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,390
Want me to show you the real thing?

816
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,647
Sir, you can't do this here.

817
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:38,069
I wanted to use our security deposit
for her surgery, but my mom won't listen.

818
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:45,034
This is an unreasonable demand.
We cannot help you.

819
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,494
"Unreasonable"?

820
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,747
You're hopeless. Come here.
How dare you talk to me--

821
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,170
Who the hell are you?

822
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,005
Let go.

823
01:01:58,589 --> 01:01:59,882
Let go of me.

824
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,054
This is not the place for such behavior.

825
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,683
Look, I have no business
with you small fry.

826
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:09,892
Bring your CEO.

827
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,894
Bring your CEO right now!

828
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,188
-She's here.
-What?

829
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,606
I'm the CEO.

830
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,359
Are you the CEO?

831
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,820
Why didn't you
train your employee properly?

832
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,197
You're right.
I don't think I did it properly.

833
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,118
Ms. Kim Min-ji?

834
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,079
Deal with our customers only.

835
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,999
As for criminals, report them
to the police without warning.

836
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,334
What? A criminal?

837
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,754
You call your customers criminals?

838
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,589
Babe, are you filming this?

839
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:40,840
Yeah.

840
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,634
The CEO of this mall
looks down on her customers.

841
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,928
Let's sue her and teach her a lesson.

842
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,263
Let's do that.

843
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,141
Make sure to do it.

844
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,225
I will too.

845
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,772
I know well
since my husband is a good lawyer.

846
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,023
You can be charged

847
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,984
with obstruction of business,
special assault,

848
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,861
and property damage.

849
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:06,699
And I'll file another suit
for the sales loss you caused.

850
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,702
-Did you all film it?
-Yes, we did!

851
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,288
-I did. Here!
-Please make way.

852
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,500
Take them to the police.

853
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,959
Let's go, babe.

854
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,844
Thank you.

855
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,767
By the way, Mr. Baek, about Park Seok-hun.

856
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,311
What about him?

857
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:38,022
He's going around saying

858
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:43,027
that the Yongdu Pear you're promoting
as our village specialty has no future.

859
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,488
He claims the Yongdu Apple will be

860
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,907
the new K-food craze around the world.

861
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,742
Apple? Goodness.

862
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,285
That's just ridiculous.

863
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,746
Traditionally, apples
are no match for pears.

864
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,456
Of course… Really?

865
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,001
Just think about memorial services.

866
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,546
We put pears on the tables, not apples!

867
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:05,675
Besides, persimmons and pears go together.
Persimmons and apples don't.

868
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:09,929
How dare he downplay the importance
of pears, our traditional fruit?

869
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,306
Anyway, this guy's running

870
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,060
an election campaign in such smart ways.

871
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,521
You know his mom's restaurant?

872
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:23,401
He's offering half-price lunches,
so everyone's eating there now.

873
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,443
You idiot!

874
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,778
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

875
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,822
That little…

876
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,908
He's not playing fair, is he?

877
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,618
Are you going there?

878
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,371
HALF-PRICE LUNCH

879
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:43,671
Hello.

880
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,131
Hey, Mr. Park.

881
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,091
The soup is especially good today.

882
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,926
Come on. It's always been good.

883
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,637
What is this?

884
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,806
It's like a feast.

885
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,809
We should compete with pledges and plans.

886
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,521
But he's trying to win people over
with a popular song.

887
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:04,567
I mean, if he wins the election like this,
it's not his victory. It's the singer's!

888
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,196
It should be considered
an election law violation. Yes.

889
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,157
Chun-sik, gather the evidence.

890
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,244
Those who entertain and those
who play along. I'll report the whole lot!

891
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,288
Come on!

892
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,418
You're all doomed.

893
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,547
Wait. What…

894
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:28,883
-Mr. Baek.
-What?

895
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,688
Seok-hun! I'll have one more pork platter.

896
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,814
One more soju, too!

897
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,400
It's so delicious!

898
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,235
That piece of…

899
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:50,112
You son of…

900
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,238
I ought to…

901
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,490
How bad is it?

902
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:55,242
He walked right into their trap.

903
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:59,997
Family corruption. It's an issue even
the country's presidents couldn't avoid.

904
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,751
The current village head's son let
the opposite side treat him to a meal.

905
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:07,213
People say the head's family is ruined

906
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,508
because his children
weren't properly disciplined.

907
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:11,801
You idiot!

908
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:12,969
I can't believe you!

909
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,598
Dad, I'll change their opinion
from now on.

910
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:18,849
What can you do?

911
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,935
My salon produces roughly 90%

912
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,646
of the rumors going around Yongdu-ri.

913
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,147
You know, gossipers!

914
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,859
-We can use them.
-Like a smear campaign?

915
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:32,029
Exactly! Seok-hun stole snacks
from our store

916
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,322
when he was a kid.

917
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,573
We'll expose that.

918
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,743
"He who will steal an egg
will steal an ox!"

919
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:39,912
What do you think?

920
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:42,957
Got a cigarette?

921
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,250
I quit smoking.

922
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:02,935
Mi-seon, are you coming?

923
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,938
Your father and Seok-hun
will have a big face-off.

924
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,314
Go ahead.

925
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:13,070
I don't think so. Your family needs
as many people as possible on their side.

926
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,739
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

927
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,200
Because the head is at a disadvantage now.

928
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,785
Just go!

929
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:20,870
Just come!

930
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,621
For God's sake! Just go!

931
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,206
No, Pinky!

932
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:26,500
You go back in.

933
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,045
I am standing here

934
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,922
because our village needs young people.

935
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,257
As I said earlier,

936
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,386
I will make the Yongdu Apple
a K-food loved by people around the world!

937
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:41,766
I, Park Seok-hun, will recover
the two years Yongdu-ri lost!

938
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,103
He's well received.

939
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,188
It's okay.

940
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,607
It's all right.

941
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,694
Everyone, our Yongdu-ri

942
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,781
is like the heart of Korean pears.

943
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:00,785
Well, isn't the heart of pears
Naju or Seongju?

944
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:05,456
That's right! Yongdu-ri
isn't the heart. It's more like…

945
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:06,540
How do I put it?

946
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,335
It's more like the intestine.

947
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,336
Am I right?

948
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,840
Right. If it were the heart, our pears

949
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:19,011
would be sold
at his daughter-in-law's department store.

950
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,429
You're right!

951
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:26,268
What? Why bring that up here?

952
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,561
My daughter-in-law

953
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,272
keeps her work and private life apart!

954
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,817
I get that she's a good CEO.

955
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,859
But her private life?

956
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,196
To be blunt, we only heard
she and your son got married.

957
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,825
-We've never seen her.
-Didn't she come on a chopper?

958
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,702
Right. I thought war had broken out then.

959
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,705
It's true that she's never visited
since they got married.

960
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,499
It was before they got married?

961
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,503
-What?
-What's going on?

962
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:55,214
-Is it an earthquake?
-What's happening?

963
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,758
YONGDU-RI COMMUNITY HALL

964
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:06,934
-What's that?
-Film it.

965
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:09,603
They brought a lot.

966
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,260
Father?

967
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,763
Oh, my God.

968
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,056
Oh, my.

969
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,484
No way…

970
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,655
She came.

971
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:02,948
Finally.

972
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:13,959
What are you doing here?

973
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,544
I'm glad you're all here.

974
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:18,214
I missed your last birthday,

975
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:21,967
so I came to treat
the villagers to a meal.

976
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:29,683
Hello, I'm Hong Hae-in,
the village head's daughter-in-law.

977
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,356
What's going on?

978
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:36,941
I texted her.

979
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:40,236
You said you'd visit us one of these days.

980
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,323
Can that day be today and right now?

981
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:48,702
My father's running for reelection,
and it's not looking good.

982
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:52,873
I think he needs to show people
someone influential is supporting him.

983
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,508
Oh, she read it!

984
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,592
It says "read."

985
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,556
She came because of that text?

986
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,475
I can't believe it either.

987
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,687
Good job!

988
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,356
Hong Hae-in!

989
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,732
It's not much.

990
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:21,944
Expensive nutritional supplements,
ginseng,

991
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,155
cosmetics, silk scarves,
cashmere mufflers,

992
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,949
Italian leather gloves, so on.

993
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:30,202
I was going to buy
just a little for Father,

994
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,412
but I went overboard.

995
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:32,788
You can share.

996
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:36,000
Oh, my. I can't believe you.

997
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,585
You bought too much.

998
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,049
-Baek Du-gwan!
-Baek Du-gwan!

999
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:48,971
-Hae-in!
-Baek Du-gwan!

1000
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,224
Everyone! What's Yongdu-ri's specialty?
Apples or pears?

1001
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,892
-Pears!
-Pears!

1002
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,605
-Baek Du-gwan!
-Baek Du-gwan!

1003
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,025
-Hae-in!
-Baek Du-gwan!

1004
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,360
BAEK DU-GWAN
A HARD WORKER WHO PROTECTS YONGDU-RI

1005
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:35,476
Hyun-woo. Hae-in's here.

1006
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,523
-Hey.
-Mom, I missed your call.

1007
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,734
It's all right. How are you?

1008
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:47,529
I heard Mi-seon and Hyeon-tae went there.
You must've been surprised.

1009
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:51,116
No, it's okay.
Nothing bad happened, so don't worry.

1010
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,409
And Hae-in is…

1011
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,911
Yes, she's doing well too.

1012
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:55,454
What do you mean?

1013
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,872
Did you two fight?

1014
01:12:58,957 --> 01:12:59,875
Of course not.

1015
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,628
Then why don't you know where she is?

1016
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,588
She's here.

1017
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:06,673
What? Why would she be there?

1018
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,425
You should come ask her yourself.

1019
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,220
The whole village
is having a feast thanks to her.

1020
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:14,640
What's she talking about?

1021
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,936
Where's Hae-in right now?

1022
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,507
BAEK HYUN-WOO

1023
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:11,840
Who are you?

1024
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,259
Me?

1025
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,428
I'm the daughter-in-law.

1026
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,348
-Who are you?
-I know everyone in this family,

1027
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:20,641
but I've never seen you.

1028
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:23,810
I don't come here often.

1029
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,486
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm part of the family.

1030
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:33,862
Then what's the dog's name?

1031
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,534
Musty.

1032
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,535
Spotty?

1033
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,577
They have no dog.

1034
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,412
You look suspicious.

1035
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,540
Why are you so suspicious?

1036
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:48,126
I'm the wife of Baek Hyun-woo,
the son of this family. Happy? Now go.

1037
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,213
You're the building owner.
You should've told me sooner.

1038
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,257
-What?
-My dad told me

1039
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,842
Uncle Hyun-woo's wife
is the owner of our building.

1040
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,390
Let me properly greet you, Aunt.

1041
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,642
-I'm Baek Ho-yeol.
-I see.

1042
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,979
You're my nephew that I only heard about.

1043
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,438
Yes, I am.

1044
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:10,899
I saw an unfamiliar car
in front of the house.

1045
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,360
Is it yours, Aunt?

1046
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:14,486
Yes, it is.

1047
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:17,114
That's sick.

1048
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:21,243
A V8 engine,
the horsepower and speed tuning.

1049
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,704
That rare car is really yours?

1050
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,540
Could I have a ride, please?

1051
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,794
If I let you, will you stop talking to me?

1052
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,213
I promise you.

1053
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,885
Can you drive him around the village?

1054
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:42,180
Maybe three or four laps.

1055
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,265
Yes, ma'am.

1056
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,797
My youngest is here!

1057
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,799
Gosh, Hyun-woo.

1058
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:44,219
The massage chair you gave us last time.

1059
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:46,555
It's so good. Thank you so much.

1060
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:51,435
My friends told me to take a picture
with you when I met you.

1061
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:52,894
Is that okay?

1062
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:55,939
Two, three.

1063
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:58,024
I'm sorry, but can you step aside?

1064
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,484
Come on.

1065
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,777
Your arm, too.

1066
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,696
-Even my arm?
-Just the two of us.

1067
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:07,451
Now, now. He installed air conditioners
and boilers in our senior center.

1068
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:11,455
Hyun-woo's the pride of Yongdu-ri.
Give him a round of applause!

1069
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:13,874
He's my brother.

1070
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:14,958
My brother.

1071
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,042
Eat your fill.

1072
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,382
Well…

1073
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,051
I heard it from your brother and sister.

1074
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,345
But don't worry about me.

1075
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,682
I never mentioned
the divorce to your wife.

1076
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,434
You're mentioning it now, Dad.

1077
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:33,477
Don't worry.

1078
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:36,688
She's not here. She's at home.

1079
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:38,648
-No, she's not.
-What?

1080
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,776
I just picked up Ho-yeol.
She wasn't there.

1081
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:42,944
What are you talking about?

1082
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,112
She's not there.

1083
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:58,335
Hello, Mr. Baek.

1084
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,045
Where's Hae-in?

1085
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:03,673
Is she not at the community hall?
When I came back, she wasn't here.

1086
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:23,360
Hong Hae-in!

1087
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:28,365
Hong Hae-in!

1088
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,950
Hae-in!

1089
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:34,704
Hae-in!

1090
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,057
Hong Hae-in!

1091
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:57,310
Hae-in!

1092
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:15,328
Hong Hae-in!

1093
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,292
What happened?

1094
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,717
-Why are you here?
-Why are you yelling?

1095
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:16,222
I heard you came here out of the blue,

1096
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,559
so I came, but you weren't home

1097
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,728
or at the hall.
No one knew where you were.

1098
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,188
You didn't answer your phone!

1099
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:24,981
So,

1100
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:27,984
-why are you here--
-Hold on.

1101
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:31,571
I came out for a walk.

1102
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,701
A walk in this neighborhood?

1103
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,578
Yes.

1104
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:42,707
-I was worried!
-Why would you be?

1105
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,835
I'm not a patient.

1106
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:50,924
Right.

1107
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:53,969
Yes, you told me that.

1108
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:58,765
I'm sorry I yelled.

1109
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:33,717
The truth is…

1110
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:37,012
I don't remember.

1111
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:41,391
I don't remember at all why I was there.

1112
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,530
I was in front of your house,

1113
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:57,782
then suddenly I was somewhere else.

1114
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,663
I don't know when I went there

1115
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,500
or how.

1116
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:12,338
I have no idea.

1117
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:15,967
I was…

1118
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:22,265
so scared.

1119
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,851
NAMED OUTSTANDING SCHOOL OF 2006

1120
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,894
-We're here.
-Okay.

1121
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,814
-See you later.
-See you.

1122
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,110
Wait, Hyun-woo.

1123
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:01,447
Seoul people aren't that different.
Don't feel discouraged.

1124
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:03,491
Stand firm.

1125
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,076
-Firm.
-Stand upright.

1126
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,121
And try to glare like this.

1127
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:09,998
-Okay.
-Good. Go in.

1128
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:11,416
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

1129
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,335
-Listen to your teacher.
-Drive safe!

1130
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:24,262
Hae-in's going to the States to study.

1131
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,306
Say goodbye to her, okay?

1132
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:27,932
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1133
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,937
Look at her face.

1134
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:35,732
She's still so full of herself.

1135
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:39,485
There's a rumor that she's
being admitted to a mental hospital.

1136
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,906
I heard it's because she went mad
after her brother died.

1137
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,033
Wait.

1138
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,005
Take it.

1139
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:46,302
I don't need it.

1140
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,363
Clean it and put some ointment on it.

1141
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:18,293
Are you crying?

1142
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:23,131
I'm not.

1143
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,019
You are.

1144
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:51,200
QUEEN OF TEARS

1145
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,271
Don't you dare mention the divorce.

1146
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,981
You got it.

1147
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,275
Divorce is nothing.

1148
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,069
I wanted to get a divorce too.

1149
01:29:28,404 --> 01:29:29,822
-What's wrong?
-Don't mind me.

1150
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,949
How could their love die?

1151
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,535
They used to be madly in love.

1152
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:37,538
The woman I love right now is you.

1153
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:39,499
Your white blood cell count is too low.

1154
01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:41,501
I will find a way.

1155
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:43,294
Even if I have to search the world,

1156
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:44,796
I'll find a way to live.

1157
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,422
So I should be…

1158
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:48,925
by your side at times like this.

1159
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:49,967
I wanted you

1160
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,719
to be by my side.

1161
01:29:57,308 --> 01:29:59,310
