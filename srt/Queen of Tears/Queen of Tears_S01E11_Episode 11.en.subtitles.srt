1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,903
Du-gwan!

3
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,738
Look!

4
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,031
Oh, dear!

5
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,866
FORMER CEO HONG HAE-IN TERMINALLY ILL

6
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,287
-Gosh!
-Gosh, Du-gwan!

7
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,455
Du-gwan!

8
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,040
Don't forget your shoes!

9
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,208
Mi-seon!

10
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,470
Because I was told

11
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,515
that I have little time left…

12
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,350
to live.

13
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,566
When were you diagnosed?

14
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,735
Is Chairman Yoon aware of this too?

15
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,824
Hae-in.

16
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:22,994
I can't die yet.

17
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,581
I haven't

18
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,292
told you yet.

19
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,794
Moving through!

20
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,340
That it's okay.

21
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,680
That I never resented you.

22
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,599
What's the use of it?

23
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,934
It only gets on my nerves.

24
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,687
Let's part ways. I want a divorce.

25
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,483
I haven't thanked you
for being by my side all these years…

26
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,619
despite all the harsh words

27
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,287
I didn't mean.

28
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,289
I love her.

29
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,836
I love you, Hae-in.

30
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,465
I love you.

31
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,762
You were the reason
I wanted to live even more.

32
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,763
You can't come in.

33
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,723
You're not allowed to come inside.

34
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,817
I thought I had more time.

35
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,925
We're looking for Hong Hae-in.

36
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,804
Ma'am, where's Hong Hae-in?

37
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,224
I haven't apologized to everyone yet.

38
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,900
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

39
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,554
I'm sorry.

40
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,272
I'm sorry for everything.

41
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,906
EPISODE 11

42
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,006
I thought you hadn't found him.

43
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,676
-You see--
-Get out.

44
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,097
What gives you the right?
This isn't your hospital.

45
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,101
You're going to see the chairman.
Get out since I won't let you.

46
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,646
Your son betrayed you and moved him here.

47
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,774
So do you still think
that you're his legal guardian?

48
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,651
Do you think I'd let that slide?

49
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,739
I'll get out myself.

50
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,248
Damn it.

51
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,419
Hey! Damn it!

52
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,549
Hey!

53
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,731
EMERGENCY STAIRCASE

54
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,164
-Open the door.
-I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

55
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,832
I wasn't talking to you. Open it.

56
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,423
Me too!

57
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,717
Let me in too!

58
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,970
Look. I'm begging you.

59
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,682
Please. I'm sorry for being
so rude to you all this time.

60
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,184
Please forgive me.

61
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,813
Please let me see my father
just this once.

62
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,814
Please.

63
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,691
Should I kneel?

64
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,151
Should I?

65
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,653
Fine.

66
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,780
Fine? Really?

67
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,533
Do you mean that?

68
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,205
But I want you to leave right afterward.
If not, you'll be dragged out.

69
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,001
Thank you.

70
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,312
Father?

71
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,026
Father!

72
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,903
Father!

73
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,155
Father!

74
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,117
You woke up!

75
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,703
I'm so proud of you!

76
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,663
You did well!

77
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,172
Come on, now.

78
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,675
Don't you know who I am?

79
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,762
Jeez.

80
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,347
Father!

81
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,891
What? Did he pass away?

82
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,728
Father!

83
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,941
Father!

84
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,203
You bitch.

85
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,914
You're done for.

86
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,500
So he made you his legal guardian?

87
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,169
He's awake now.

88
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,797
So you've lost the power
of attorney now. Am I right?

89
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,258
Yes, that's true.

90
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,054
-Wait. Let's call his doctor--
-Shut up!

91
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,806
Call the police.

92
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,850
Father.

93
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,561
It was her, wasn't it?

94
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,272
That bitch harmed you, didn't she?

95
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,995
Who are you?

96
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,635
Father…

97
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,748
Damn it!

98
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,875
Why are you kicking me out too?

99
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,586
Damn it.

100
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,849
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

101
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,115
What's… wrong with her?

102
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,367
Mother…

103
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,829
What's her problem?

104
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,499
The CT scan shows acute brain swelling.

105
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,877
The brain tumor cells pressured
the surrounding tissues

106
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,254
and temporarily increased
her intracranial pressure.

107
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,505
We should lower it first--

108
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,466
Brain tumor?

109
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,967
What do you mean?

110
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:46,098
Were you aware of everything
Hae-in announced? Is that so?

111
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,268
-Honey.
-Then why didn't you tell us? Why?

112
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,853
What have you been doing?

113
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,272
You should've told us that she was sick.

114
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,231
Why didn't you?

115
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,774
-Stop.
-He deceived us again!

116
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,864
He kept it a secret from us.

117
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,325
He deceived us
when Hae-in was this severely ill.

118
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,077
-What are you scheming this time?
-I told you to stop.

119
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,918
We have no right to get upset.

120
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,011
I'm sorry.

121
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,056
We had no idea

122
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,850
despite being her parents.

123
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,186
Please explain.

124
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,980
Please elaborate

125
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,318
on her current condition.

126
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,948
Ms. Hong is suffering from Cloud Cytoma.

127
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,116
It's a type of malignant brain tumor.

128
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,579
Unlike your typical tumor,
where the tumor is

129
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,039
a big lump,

130
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,793
these tumor cells have spread
throughout her cranial nerves like clouds.

131
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:59,463
Her case is a very rare one worldwide,

132
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,216
so it's been difficult to treat her.

133
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,438
I'm sorry, Mother.

134
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm truly sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

135
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,853
She probably told you not to.

136
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,731
It must've been a great burden.

137
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,488
Hae-in didn't want her parents

138
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,365
to be heartbroken.

139
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,827
So she wanted to tell you
once things were looking up.

140
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,539
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

141
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,396
Dad.

142
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,949
By the vast and endless ocean

143
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,744
Stood a single humble cottage

144
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,039
Dwelt a fisherman father

145
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,542
And his young daughter

146
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,796
Oh my love, oh my love

147
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,924
Oh my love, Clementine

148
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,427
Why have you abandoned me forever

149
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,347
Leaving your old father behind

150
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,320
Judging by the MRI results,

151
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,490
I believe he has vascular dementia
due to a head injury and brain hemorrhage.

152
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,909
The significant damage
to his frontal and temporal lobes

153
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,037
is making it difficult for him
to think rationally or remember things.

154
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:42,501
For now, we have no choice
but to wait until his brain recovers.

155
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,294
Let's give him two weeks.

156
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,088
Does that mean he could recover?

157
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,049
It varies per case,
so I can't guarantee anything.

158
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,120
Seon-hwa.

159
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:21,999
You must be stunned.

160
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,044
I just heard and--

161
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,920
You knew she was sick.

162
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,341
That's why you told me
not to do things I'd regret.

163
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,931
I'm sorry.

164
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,771
Everyone knew.

165
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,482
Everyone knew but me.

166
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,404
But, Mom,

167
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,742
I just told you
that I had a serious matter too.

168
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,286
Aren't you curious?

169
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,123
You always know what to do
whether it's big or small.

170
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,792
Right.

171
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,252
I'll take care

172
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,463
of my business.

173
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,676
Jeez, don't be so dramatic.

174
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,095
I'm anemic too.

175
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,056
I'm also dizzy
since I couldn't sleep much either.

176
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,600
It's not like Soo-cheol
is doing fine either.

177
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,602
We're all suffering here.

178
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,412
-What?
-What is this about Hae-in?

179
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,706
Is it true? Is she sick?

180
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,166
I doubt her family knew.

181
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,709
Not even Soo-cheol.

182
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,294
He must be shocked.

183
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,800
That's why you called?

184
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,093
It's a small favor.

185
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,097
He has anxiety disorder.
It happens when he's stressed.

186
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,308
It's serious. He needs medication.

187
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,518
I don't think he took any with him.

188
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,064
We have some at home.
Can you tell someone to get it?

189
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,190
-It's--
-Hey.

190
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,026
-Cheon Da-hye.
-He might faint and die!

191
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,779
-Then let him die.
-Hey, how could you…

192
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,740
What do you want me to do?

193
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,867
Should I kill him?

194
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,662
Don't ever call me again
over something like this!

195
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,331
Or I'll kill him myself.

196
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,177
Hyun-woo.

197
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,142
I think this was why.

198
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,019
What do you mean?

199
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,275
What is that?

200
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,694
I was told to carry this around…

201
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,156
so it'd subdue her energy.

202
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,367
I didn't believe it.

203
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,954
I just wanted
to be better than her for once.

204
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,873
But…

205
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,501
what if this damn talisman

206
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:39,381
is the reason why she's sick?

207
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,758
It's all my fault.

208
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,219
I shouldn't have carried
this stupid talisman.

209
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,074
Hae-in.

210
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,118
Hae-in!

211
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,167
What about a talisman? You lunatic.

212
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,257
Did you see that?
This talisman must be powerful.

213
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,426
She woke up once I ripped it up.

214
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,386
Soo-cheol.

215
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,306
I'm sorry…

216
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,350
for everything.

217
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,231
Hyun-woo, I don't think
she's in her right mind.

218
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,277
Go get the doctor and the family.

219
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,445
Our family…

220
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,212
-Are you okay?
-I love you.

221
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,842
I've loved you

222
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,844
from the moment we met

223
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,138
until now.

224
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,103
I'm sorry that I didn't treat you better.

225
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,981
I'm also sorry that I left you all alone

226
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,609
with my family.

227
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,656
I think a part of me already knew

228
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,283
that you wanted a divorce.

229
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,913
You put up with us for so long.

230
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,206
So…

231
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,876
it's okay. Don't feel bad.

232
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,427
What are you doing?

233
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,305
If I don't say these things before I die,

234
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,810
you'll never know how I really feel.

235
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,148
I'm telling you this now

236
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,401
since I don't know when I'll die.

237
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,252
Last night,

238
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,840
I prayed
more than I had done in my entire life.

239
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,053
I said I'd do nothing,

240
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,015
but cry every day,

241
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,684
drink a ton of alcohol,

242
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
sleep on the street,

243
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,856
and live recklessly

244
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,901
if you died.

245
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,656
That's a threat, not a prayer.

246
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,664
I don't care.

247
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,417
If you die,

248
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,837
I'll give up on myself.

249
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,922
You just watch.

250
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,840
How can I watch when I'm dead?

251
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,301
So cut the nonsense.

252
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,762
I'm opening my heart to you.

253
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,183
I was even scared

254
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,977
in my sleep in case I wouldn't be able

255
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,355
to tell you.

256
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,608
Don't be scared.

257
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,320
You're not going to die.

258
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,914
You won't die.

259
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,251
I won't let you.

260
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,105
ENDOSCOPY

261
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,481
Mom!

262
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,942
Hae-in woke up! Hurry up!

263
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,461
Where did she go?

264
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,341
Why didn't you tell us about this?

265
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,386
But it's okay. I know about it now.

266
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,974
Don't worry. Many of my close friends
are renown doctors.

267
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,600
They're all around the world.

268
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,645
Is that so? I should've told you sooner.

269
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,569
I'm sorry.

270
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,451
Why are you sorry?
You're the one who's sick.

271
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,829
You should've told me sooner.

272
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,457
It must've been so painful
to keep it a secret.

273
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,293
You're okay now.

274
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,421
Everything will be fine. Okay?

275
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,339
Okay.

276
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,639
Where's Mom?

277
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,242
Mother.

278
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,287
Let me be alone.

279
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,415
I'm truly sorry that I didn't tell you

280
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,417
sooner.

281
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,462
Forget it.

282
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,798
What kind of mother

283
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,510
doesn't know that her child is dying?

284
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,679
I know nothing about my own daughter.

285
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,437
How pathetic.

286
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,399
I can't believe I took my pain out

287
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,901
on my own daughter.

288
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,614
Whenever that young child
reached out to me…

289
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,161
I didn't hold her

290
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,331
even once.

291
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,306
Even I can't live with myself.

292
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,892
I'd hate to have a mom like me.

293
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,024
Hyun-woo.

294
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,986
It's all my fault.

295
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,739
I caused my daughter

296
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,159
pain and stress.

297
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,370
That's why she's sick.

298
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,810
Are you a doctor?

299
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,695
How could you know things
that a doctor doesn't even know?

300
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,033
They don't know the cause
or how to prevent my illness.

301
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,869
It's not caused by stress either.

302
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,412
How are you…

303
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,420
so naive?

304
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,006
You're so annoying.

305
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,678
And…

306
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,641
I would've struggled

307
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,811
to have a daughter like me too.

308
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,979
So it's not all your fault.

309
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,315
Hae-in.

310
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,128
Did it hurt

311
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,923
a lot?

312
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,389
Well…

313
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,309
There were times when it hurt
and times when it didn't.

314
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,734
I had no idea you were sick.

315
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,862
I'm sorry.

316
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,364
It's all my fault.

317
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,492
I'm sorry.

318
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,995
I was wrong.

319
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,456
I told you.

320
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,335
This has nothing to do
with how you treated me.

321
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,588
I didn't want to tell you because I knew

322
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,967
you wouldn't understand.

323
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,597
I'm sorry.

324
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,390
I'm…

325
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,018
I'm really sorry.

326
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,146
I can't live

327
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,648
without you.

328
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,234
No.

329
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,028
Don't die.

330
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,618
Please don't die, Hae-in. I'm sorry…

331
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,300
My dear Hae-in…

332
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,604
I'm sorry…

333
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,666
Lady Luck is only on her side
since that evil bitch is so hardworking.

334
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,793
She sure is something.

335
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,389
Chairman Hong.

336
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,391
Do you recognize where we are?

337
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,066
Come on, don't be scared. We're home.

338
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,194
Let's go inside.

339
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,831
Ma'am, there are many
nice electric wheelchairs these days.

340
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:51,362
The chairman may be out of it,
but he refuses to be fed

341
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,572
by anyone but me.

342
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:56,034
So I can't leave his side.
That's why I asked you to come here.

343
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,746
We understand. It's only thanks to you
that he woke up.

344
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,123
Enough with the flattery.
Explain yourselves.

345
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,709
How could he hold
such a press conference right now?

346
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,503
We had no idea either.
Chairman Yoon suddenly--

347
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,005
You should've known better.

348
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,132
You're only getting paid so much

349
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,801
so you'd prevent
such disasters from occurring.

350
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,345
Goodness, should I not have said that?

351
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,681
"You have no right
to say such things to us."

352
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,476
"What do you know when you only cook
and nurse the chairman?"

353
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,437
-Is that it?
-Of course not, ma'am.

354
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,565
In that case, submit all the drafts to me
before you give them

355
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,110
to Chairman Yoon and tell the PR Team
to come by tomorrow morning.

356
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,737
What for?

357
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,073
Do you not read the news?
The public is enraged.

358
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,785
They're sympathizing with
the former management and criticizing us.

359
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,496
Am I the only one who's worried
about the falling stock prices?

360
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,456
The anchor LPs are furious.

361
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,707
They're worried that

362
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,418
the exit point will be delayed
due to the plummeting stocks.

363
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,254
Rumor has it they want
to set up a co-GP investor.

364
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,509
We must find the secret fund
if we want them to shut up.

365
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,718
Did you dig into it?

366
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,221
Yes, it was confirmed that Jamal Ibrahim,

367
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,933
the bank president of LCC Investment Bank
in Labuan, Malaysia,

368
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,643
managed the account.

369
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,312
I think he withdrew the money
and wired it.

370
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,855
-How much?
-Almost 900 billion won.

371
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,192
Send someone to Labuan right now.

372
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,945
Find out the next route.

373
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,824
This restaurant is known
for their kal-guksu.

374
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,868
-Try to eat.
-I'm sorry.

375
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,162
I don't think I can.

376
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,667
You need to eat well at times like this.

377
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,002
Your family relies on you.

378
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,090
You need to stay strong
if you want your kids to do the same.

379
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,384
They don't look up to me for strength.

380
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,303
I'm not the pillar of our family.

381
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,932
In fact, it was my father all along.

382
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,185
That hurt me at times,
but I was honestly relieved too.

383
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,438
Pathetic, right?

384
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,650
I was relieved
that my kids didn't rely on me.

385
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,194
My daughter is dying,

386
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,241
and I told her to trust me.

387
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,495
But I doubt that meant anything to her.

388
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,205
You're wrong.

389
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,291
Our kids don't look at us that way.

390
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,626
My father passed away before his time.

391
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,961
But even to this day,

392
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,297
I think of him
when I need to make a tough decision.

393
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,174
"What would he have done?"

394
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,092
You are

395
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,095
a lighthouse to your kids

396
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,056
no matter who you are.

397
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,350
So eat well, stay strong,

398
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,520
hold your head up, and shine your light.

399
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,481
Here.

400
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,192
Here.

401
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,652
Let's eat.

402
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,071
Even the tastiest kal-guksu is bad

403
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,573
if it gets soggy.

404
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,590
"What did I just watch? Is this a drama?"

405
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,259
"She's still foolishly in love
with her ex-husband."

406
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,053
"I've never seen someone terminally ill

407
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,346
-so in love."
-Enough.

408
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,184
You've become the talk of the town
while you've been asleep.

409
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,769
Don't be silly. It's mortifying.

410
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,980
What do you mean?
You're going through dramatic changes.

411
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,358
You were ambitious
about joining the One Trillion Club.

412
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,735
Then your family went broke
and fled in a single day.

413
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,779
And now, you're Juliet.

414
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,449
Simply put,
people think I'm hopelessly in love

415
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,619
with my ex-husband and that I revealed
my illness just to save him.

416
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,288
-That's true.
-That's why I'm mortified.

417
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,000
There are other things to worry about.

418
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,627
Such as?

419
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,383
What's this?

420
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,511
I bought a formal dress.

421
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,638
I bought it at full price
at a department store.

422
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,516
-What does this signify?
-You tell me.

423
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,393
That I'm very excited

424
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,478
about your return.

425
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,356
But I should get a refund.

426
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,274
Don't bother.

427
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,401
They'll assign you to someone else.

428
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,069
You can wear it then.

429
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,405
-No thanks.
-Why not?

430
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,115
You know I'm shy around strangers.

431
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,118
Given my occupation,
I won't have many opportunities.

432
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,705
So come back. I'll be waiting.

433
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,748
I can't guarantee that.

434
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,584
But I'll do my best.

435
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,671
I thought that didn't matter.
You always said to just make it work.

436
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,007
So I'll say the same.

437
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,968
Come back before I pay
all the installments.

438
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,139
And when is that?

439
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,098
In six months.

440
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,435
-That's a bit--
-Just come back.

441
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,730
Fine, I will.

442
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,356
Why are you mad?

443
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,320
I'll…

444
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,739
give you a hug today

445
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,824
because you finally woke up.

446
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,342
Look at this.

447
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,971
I became a divorcée who's still in love
with her ex in a single day.

448
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:14,935
Is this funny to you?

449
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,563
Why would you let that bother you?

450
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,566
Look behind you.

451
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,700
They were pitying me, weren't they?

452
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,371
No one has ever looked at me
that way before.

453
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,039
It's a first.

454
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,042
This won't do.

455
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,795
Dote on me in front of them.

456
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,422
"In front of them"?

457
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,634
-How?
-First…

458
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,428
-Gaze at me lovingly.
-"Lovingly"?

459
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,230
Like this?

460
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,158
Well…

461
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,875
Not bad.

462
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,181
How long will you keep looking?

463
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,933
What?

464
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,560
What's your left arm doing?

465
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,354
Right.

466
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,148
Like this?

467
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,287
SUNGMIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

468
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,307
I was surprised you called.

469
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,600
I had something to say.

470
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,018
How are you feeling?

471
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,728
I'm doing better.

472
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,313
I'm leaving tomorrow.

473
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,690
Why so soon?

474
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:28,068
-There's not much they can do for me.
-Then come back home.

475
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,361
It'd be more convenient.

476
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,447
I didn't call to discuss that.

477
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,241
-I'm listening.
-I know you're in a pickle.

478
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,204
You're struggling to deal with the media.
The anchor LPs must be burdening you.

479
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,456
You wouldn't have
enough stocks to stop them

480
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,375
even if they wanted a new GP.

481
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,045
So you know.

482
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,838
It's all thanks to you.

483
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,048
So…

484
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,343
are you worried about me?

485
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,721
No. I don't feel bad about your situation.

486
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,017
Provoke me again,
and you'll lose something even bigger.

487
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,520
That's all.

488
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,025
Fine.

489
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,735
That may be why you called.

490
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,821
But my heart skipped a beat

491
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,618
when I got your call
even though I knew why you called.

492
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,496
You don't know

493
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,124
how long I've had these feelings

494
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,834
or when they first developed.

495
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,336
No, I don't.

496
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,175
And I don't need to.

497
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,886
Do you remember why

498
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,889
I cut ties with you in university?

499
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,433
I was grateful for your help
when I was struggling.

500
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,978
But you were the reason
why I was struggling

501
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,063
in the first place.

502
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:49,984
Maybe you should've liked me back
before I did those things.

503
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,486
I only did such things

504
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,614
because I couldn't get close to you
no matter how hard I tried.

505
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,324
That's how you treat others.

506
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,410
Look at you even now.

507
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,122
You pushed me into a ditch
so you could get me out of it.

508
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,417
So who could possibly like you?

509
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,961
Then what about Hyun-woo?

510
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,922
Does he deserve your love?

511
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,175
He was going to leave you.

512
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,137
Did your tumor mess with your memory?
Did you forget?

513
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,388
He's with me now.

514
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,351
He's with me

515
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,103
right now.

516
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,566
Must I explain more?

517
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,002
-Are you done talking?
-Mr. Baek.

518
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,671
Why are you still by her side?

519
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,840
Why must I tell you?

520
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,968
Did you develop feelings
after finding out she was dying?

521
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,387
Or are you hoping
she'll leave you something?

522
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,475
Just come to me.

523
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,061
I'll give you anything you want
if you leave her side.

524
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,074
You're really testing my patience,
so just go.

525
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,498
Hey.

526
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,256
I didn't want to tell you something
I haven't even told her yet.

527
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,926
But try all you want.
I'm not going anywhere.

528
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,512
I'm going to stay by her side forever.

529
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:42,971
I'll be with her.

530
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,225
So don't hold your breath
and just get lost.

531
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,034
You're home.

532
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,829
The chairman is here.

533
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,830
Did you hear?

534
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,876
You look happy.

535
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,711
Of course not.

536
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,549
How can I when
the love of your life broke your heart?

537
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,093
What happened to your face?

538
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,928
-Are you hurt?
-It's none…

539
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,973
of your business.

540
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,643
I've always lived a hopeless life.

541
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,229
No pain is greater than another,

542
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,606
and I don't care if I get hurt.

543
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,025
So quit trying to act

544
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,610
like a typical mom.

545
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,656
You have a guest.

546
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,086
Why haven't you been picking up?

547
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,048
Do you feel no guilt
about what happened to me?

548
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,012
I told you not to call me,
so why are you here?

549
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:10,559
I dodged getting arrested,
but they haven't let me off the hook.

550
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,146
-Baek Hyun-woo won't sit still!
-So?

551
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:17,065
Will I be the only one going down
if the world finds out

552
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,401
about the double contract
and the land investment fraud?

553
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,779
Do you think you'll keep your position,
Chairman Yoon?

554
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,034
This is the amount of stocks
Eun-sung's LPs have.

555
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,494
I sounded him out today.

556
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,287
"Aren't your LPs furious?"

557
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,955
"Don't they want a new GP?"

558
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,540
And he agreed.

559
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,167
That means--

560
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,086
He still hasn't located
Chairman Hong's secret fund.

561
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,505
Were you aware

562
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,840
of the secret fund in Switzerland?

563
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,259
Three corporations
are founded in the Virgin Islands,

564
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,844
Moldova, and Singapore.

565
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,097
The secret fund in Switzerland
is moved to Singapore.

566
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,807
Then the Virgin Islands

567
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:54,019
make it look like
they lent money to Moldova,

568
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,064
and Singapore underwrites Moldova's debt.

569
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,609
Then Moldova announces
that they can't pay it back?

570
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,527
Correct.

571
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,947
Then the Virgin Islands
files a default suit,

572
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,907
and the court demands Singapore
to pay it back.

573
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,453
The court makes it possible
to move the secret fund legally.

574
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,872
Once everything is done,
these three corporations

575
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,583
shut down
and make it difficult to track the fund.

576
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,544
They continue to launder this way.

577
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:22,464
And finally, they send the money
to a bank in Labuan, Malaysia.

578
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,050
Incredible.

579
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,845
Does that mean the secret fund
is in Malaysia right now?

580
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,307
I don't think so because Eun-sung
sent someone to Labuan today.

581
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,269
So he doesn't know
the final destination either.

582
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,399
By the way,

583
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,818
how did you know this?

584
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,489
Many people are unhappy
about the current situation

585
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,283
but they can't express it.

586
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,161
Some of them have been working
for Queens for over 30 years.

587
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,748
Secretary Jang had been
Chairman Hong's secretary for years.

588
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,543
But he turned down a hefty salary
and resigned.

589
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,171
Secretary Jang.

590
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,716
How have you been?

591
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,844
They told you these things for us?

592
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,556
No, for the company they dedicated
their entire lives to.

593
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,851
They don't want to see
the company crumble anymore.

594
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,146
What about you?

595
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,899
Why are you doing this? For the company?

596
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,735
Yes, it's for the company.

597
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,991
Because I know how much you love

598
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,409
your company.

599
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,090
We have taken into consideration
each of our members' opinions.

600
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,509
You have violated
your duty of confidentiality

601
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,219
and leaked information--

602
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,352
-Who are you?
-Right.

603
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,396
We're here to defend our client,
Mr. Baek Hyun-woo.

604
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,691
Look. You have no right
to interfere in this internal audit.

605
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,278
According to Article 12, Paragraph 1,
Item 3 and Article 11, Paragraph 4

606
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,490
of the Administrative Procedure Act,
our client has the right to hire

607
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,991
an attorney to represent him.

608
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:17,954
Let's continue.

609
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,624
Due to these reasons,
we've decided to fire you--

610
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:21,750
Your reason for firing him

611
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,711
is that you received a tip-off
from a rival company's executive

612
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,255
who claimed that Mr. Baek leaked
VIP information to them.

613
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,550
And you confirmed that he got his hands
on it by using his company ID.

614
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,761
-Yes, and?
-When did you receive that tip-off?

615
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,137
On August 6th.

616
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,972
When did Mr. Baek extract the VIP list?

617
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,140
August 1st and 2nd.

618
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,684
-Two different occasions.
-How odd.

619
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:42,187
His intranet ID was deleted on July 28th.

620
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,271
Correct.

621
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,066
I returned my ID card,
company card, laptop,

622
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,776
and everything else that day.

623
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,821
Maybe it wasn't your ID.
You could've used someone else's.

624
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,947
Like whose?

625
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,074
Maybe one of his team members'.

626
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:59,329
That means a regular employee has access
to Queens Department Store's VIP list.

627
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,831
-Isn't that a problem?
-Correct.

628
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,000
There needs to be proof that
the certain information was restricted

629
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,627
for it to be considered classified.

630
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,755
If anyone could gain access
and download the material,

631
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,007
that just shows that the store

632
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,593
didn't keep the VIP list a secret.

633
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:18,140
The real problem is the embezzlement,
and he signed all the related documents.

634
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,226
We requested an authentication
to a document examiner who used to be

635
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:25,063
the former Chief of Document at the NFS
regarding those 27 signatures.

636
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,357
The sizes and the details
of the signatures

637
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,943
were proven to be exactly the same.

638
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,946
This is only possible
if his signature was duplicated.

639
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:38,034
We can't trust this result
since you requested it.

640
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,370
Then let's ask the prosecution
to appraise it.

641
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,956
For your information,
there's no fine for document forgery.

642
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:45,584
Only imprisonment
for a maximum of three years.

643
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,213
We hope

644
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,716
you'll make

645
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,885
a wise decision.

646
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,862
-It's me.
-Hello, sir.

647
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,033
Get rid

648
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,952
of Baek Hyun-woo.

649
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,288
He's a nuisance to both of us.

650
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,623
Boracay, was it?

651
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,416
I'll send you there

652
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,210
and pay you handsomely.

653
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,169
Chairman Yoon.

654
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,464
There was a hiccup last time
because I was a bit careless.

655
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,925
I'll take care of it properly this time.

656
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,441
The more attorneys, the better.
It's great that you have us.

657
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:38,488
Despite having different specialties,
we got together to help a friend.

658
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,574
We're like the Avengers.

659
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,160
I'm sorry, but I'm also here
because people kept asking

660
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,788
if you were
getting back together with your ex.

661
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,831
Are you?

662
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,256
That's none of your business.

663
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,300
You majored in commercial law.

664
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:02,554
He's right. You excelled at
the Bills of Exchange Act and Check Act.

665
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,973
That's the past.
I take all sorts of cases now.

666
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,392
Take a look at this

667
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,977
and track the money.

668
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,604
WSB SWITZERLAND BANK

669
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,773
Where did you get these?

670
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,279
Hello.

671
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,489
Take this.

672
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,825
-I'll throw this away on my way out.
-Thank you.

673
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,076
-Second basement level?
-Yes.

674
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,912
Secretary Na, hello.

675
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:27,829
Hello.

676
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,916
Have one.

677
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,250
Thank you.

678
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,025
Eun-sung is looking
for the chairman's secret fund

679
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,985
so he can buy more stocks.

680
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,695
A secret fund? How much?

681
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,905
Nine hundred billion.

682
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,411
I'm going

683
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,247
to find it first.

684
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,584
Ma'am, be careful of the UV rays.

685
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,419
Why do you keep coming?

686
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,421
Didn't you side with Beom-ja?

687
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,422
Sorry?

688
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,591
Gosh, you got the wrong idea.

689
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,134
That time,

690
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,261
I felt terrible because she begged me

691
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,348
to help her see her father just once.

692
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,975
I'm unusually soft at times.

693
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,768
Fine. Side with whomever you pity.

694
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,354
Gosh, Ms. Moh!

695
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,897
You know me.

696
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,942
I only side with money and power.

697
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:42,404
After all, you're the queen right now.

698
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,950
I don't need to be the CEO
or anything like that.

699
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,952
I'm just going to stick with you

700
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,912
like your maid.

701
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,664
Maid, my foot.

702
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:54,833
Let's see then.

703
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,167
Sure thing.

704
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:00,588
I, the amazing Grace,
will serve you amazingly.

705
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,681
Sir, do you remember this room?

706
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:11,850
They said being in a familiar environment

707
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,852
would help you recover,
so I brought you here.

708
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,937
It's not easy to be a caregiver.

709
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,231
Let me give you a massage later.

710
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:20,150
How about some frankincense oil?

711
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,067
Sure.

712
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,134
Thank you.

713
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,095
You can go and let him rest.

714
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,487
So?

715
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,655
Does that bring back memories?

716
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,449
Tell me. Where's my money?

717
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,660
Where's the secret fund that
you stashed away under my name?

718
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,273
Keep watching her no matter what.

719
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,193
Who knows what else she'll do to him?

720
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:50,824
I'm hanging up.

721
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,263
Goodness.

722
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,849
Gosh, he's showing so much skin
in broad daylight.

723
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,824
What is it?

724
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,451
"Check me out."

725
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,578
"I'm good-looking."

726
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,830
"I have a great body too."

727
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:39,747
Is that it?

728
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,041
Goodness.

729
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,402
What are you doing?

730
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,113
I…

731
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,531
Well…

732
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,911
I believe you were peeping.

733
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,705
No, I wasn't. I was just passing by

734
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,582
when I saw you there.

735
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,004
Do you want some?

736
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,758
-What is that?
-Mulberries.

737
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,134
As in…

738
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,263
-berries?
-Yes, you're right.

739
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,098
They're good for women.

740
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,562
-How much?
-They're not for sale.

741
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,647
They're free.

742
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,689
Why would you…

743
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,653
How original. I'll give you that.

744
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,488
What?

745
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,575
You're the first guy
to make a move using mulberries.

746
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,245
But let me be clear.

747
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,412
Accepting these

748
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,456
doesn't mean I'm accepting your love.

749
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,254
-What's your MBTI?
-What?

750
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,382
I think you're an ISTJ.

751
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,842
-I… What?
-You don't express emotions well.

752
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:19,264
You're a perfectionist with a good memory.
You look cold, but you're actually soft.

753
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,559
Both Robert De Niro
and Natalie Portman are this type.

754
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,063
What is he saying?

755
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,567
But why are you home?

756
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,610
Shouldn't you be working like the others?

757
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:33,695
I don't work

758
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:35,863
that much.

759
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,448
Why not?

760
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,409
Because life is too short.

761
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,370
I just work enough to be self-sufficient.

762
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,755
So what? He's a self-sufficient farmer?

763
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,560
Did he save these for me?

764
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,644
Jeez.

765
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,565
Natalie Portman?

766
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,045
Goodness!

767
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,672
That's a lot!

768
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:37,133
They're from Yeong-song.

769
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:38,926
He picked some mulberries.

770
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,386
He says he has more.

771
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,055
He picked way too many,

772
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,931
so he's been sharing them.

773
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,934
He's ridiculous.

774
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,645
He could just sell the extra.

775
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,314
He always puts aside
just enough for his family

776
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,274
and gives away the rest.

777
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,652
What'll we do with all this?

778
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,769
Someone once told me that
the wise eat meat when times are rough.

779
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,814
Yes, you're right.

780
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:36,901
Determination alone
can't strengthen your willpower.

781
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,945
Your health matters too.

782
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,613
-Wipe your hands.
-Okay.

783
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:45,410
Also, think about what you ate
on all your special occasions.

784
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,869
It was meat.

785
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,664
Right? Birthdays, graduations,
the day you got a new job…

786
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:50,581
And look.

787
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:54,001
We're celebrating her discharge
over some meat too.

788
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,754
We always had Chinese food on my birthday.

789
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,257
What's sweet and sour pork?
What about chili chicken?

790
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,719
-Let me grill it.
-You?

791
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,722
You only eat meat

792
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,306
that's served on your plate.

793
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,017
I'll be grilling
my family's meat from now on.

794
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,394
Put down your tongs.

795
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,146
-Let me.
-Yes, sir.

796
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,612
Hae-in, I remember

797
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,657
the doctor saying
that your WBC mattered the most.

798
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,701
He said you needed to reach

799
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,412
a certain level
to receive treatment in Germany.

800
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,414
That's correct.

801
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,915
My WBC needs to be

802
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,836
between 4,000
and 10,000 cells per microliter.

803
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,963
How high was it in Germany?

804
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,256
It was 1,500 cells/µL.

805
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:42,967
That's so low.

806
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,595
But it went up a lot recently.

807
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,346
It's about 3,000 now.

808
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,057
That's double the amount.

809
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,768
I'm proud of you.

810
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,020
Well… It's not that big of a deal.

811
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,565
-I still have over 1,000 to go.
-You're almost there.

812
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,358
Try harder.

813
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,904
Hey, this isn't like studying.
I can't just "try harder."

814
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,990
In that case,
what should you do? Get injections and?

815
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,533
I looked into it.

816
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:11,412
It's all about her stamina and immunity.

817
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,707
She needs to eat well
and take a lot of vitamins and proteins.

818
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,083
She needs good rest too.

819
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:19,378
Then she needs to eat a lot of meat

820
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,296
and beans.

821
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,340
I'm going to plan her diet.

822
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,723
-Beom-jun.
-Yes?

823
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,808
Flip them over.

824
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,143
Right.

825
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:36,979
No.

826
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,731
They're burned. What should I do?

827
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,107
We can just cut them off.

828
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,152
-Can you give me the scissors?
-No.

829
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,111
I'll do it.

830
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,698
So she needs meat and beans.

831
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,825
What else?

832
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,327
Bananas and nuts…

833
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,455
-This is good.
-Gosh.

834
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,123
This is tasty.

835
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,042
It's really good.

836
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,419
-Look.
-He's excited.

837
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,090
Goodness.

838
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,093
You need to flip this.

839
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,846
Look at this.

840
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,307
She needs a lot of protein.

841
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,725
She does.

842
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,648
Eat while you do it.

843
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,442
Wipe it off for her.

844
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:34,829
Come in.

845
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,086
This isn't working again.

846
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,715
Is it not?

847
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,221
You just need to press this part.

848
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,057
I'm not as good as you.

849
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,185
Should I buy a new one?

850
01:04:58,853 --> 01:04:59,854
Why?

851
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,188
Because you struggle to use it.

852
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,816
Then you can do it for me.
Look how good you are.

853
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,321
I think

854
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,822
I'm getting better…

855
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,409
the more I dry your hair.

856
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:17,663
You're right.

857
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,373
You did a good job on the curls.

858
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,504
Now that you're better,
keep drying my hair for me.

859
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,756
Sure. That's not a problem.

860
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,174
What else?

861
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,011
Tell me what else
you want me to do, and I'll do it.

862
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,139
I'm happy

863
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,893
as long as you dry my hair
with the broken hair dryer.

864
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,730
So just this?

865
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:43,814
It's a big favor.

866
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,692
You'd have to be by my side every day.

867
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,611
I don't think

868
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:51,030
I should be greedy for now.

869
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,409
No, be greedy.

870
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:56,911
You can.

871
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:59,288
Don't try too hard to treat me well.

872
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,084
I didn't confess my love to you
so that you'd treat me better.

873
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,001
I was simply

874
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,712
expressing my feelings.

875
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,797
Same goes for me.

876
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,217
My heart wants it.

877
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,387
I want to do better

878
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,764
if I can.

879
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,266
That's how I feel.

880
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,400
Yesterday…

881
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,277
I couldn't recognize Soo-cheol's face

882
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,948
for a few seconds.

883
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,827
I couldn't remember
my doctor's name either.

884
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,788
I also lost my way to my hospital room

885
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,582
for a minute and just stood still.

886
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,212
When my doctor
first told me about my illness,

887
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,548
he mentioned memory loss,

888
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:53,551
sensory loss, and speech impediment.

889
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,177
But I didn't believe him.

890
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,264
I thought that only happened to others.

891
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,683
I thought I was different.

892
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:05,896
But it's happening in that exact order.

893
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:10,317
I can expect the next symptom,
and it's terrifying.

894
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,903
I don't want you

895
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,072
to be next to me when it happens.

896
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,162
What are you saying?

897
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,122
Let's be happy with where we are now.

898
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,667
And when my illness worsens,

899
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,169
I want you

900
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,921
to leave me.

901
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:35,551
That's my wish.

902
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,239
What? When did he leave the game?

903
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,407
Did something happen?

904
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,408
DEACTIVATED MEMBER

905
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,035
Damn it.

906
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,002
Room service.

907
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,141
Drink up.

908
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,818
Is it that bitter?

909
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,574
-Not as much as my life.
-Dear.

910
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:47,373
Master, please talk casually to me.

911
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,457
"Master"?

912
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,630
Please teach me how to box.

913
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:57,091
I couldn't land a single punch

914
01:08:57,174 --> 01:09:00,886
on Eun-sung last time
and fell down humiliatingly.

915
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,849
I understand.

916
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,268
But if you suddenly start working out
out of rage,

917
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:09,520
-you'll injure your joints--
-Joints?

918
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:10,646
That's fine by me!

919
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,815
I'm going to go insane at this rate!

920
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,987
What if I need to protect
my family in the future, but I can't?

921
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,198
I'm dreading it.

922
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,616
Oh, dear.

923
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,414
Fine.

924
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,582
I'll teach you.

925
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,126
Thank you.

926
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,377
Sit down.

927
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,461
Sit down.

928
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:35,629
Sit down.

929
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,176
But since we're doing this in a haste,

930
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,094
I can only teach you one thing.

931
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,012
And what's that?

932
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,513
Landing a single punch

933
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,600
on someone powerful.

934
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,232
There are two core skills.

935
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,151
Soo-cheol.

936
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,737
Hit me.

937
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:01,739
Are you serious?

938
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,787
Am I that strong?

939
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,791
No, this is the first skill.

940
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,501
Exaggerate.

941
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,837
So that they'll feel arrogant and think,

942
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,839
"He's no match for me."

943
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,507
"I pretty much won."

944
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,468
"I'm surprisingly strong."

945
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,929
-I see.
-Okay, bring it on.

946
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,977
-Well done.
-That really hurt!

947
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,729
-I'm sorry.
-My nose!

948
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:35,648
Why must I learn this?

949
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,942
So they'll let down their guard.

950
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:41,111
You must wait
until they let down their guard

951
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,155
then land your critical punch.

952
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,907
But get beaten up until then?

953
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,742
That's the second skill.

954
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,244
Endurance.

955
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,537
You need stamina to take blows well.

956
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,623
Do you think I can do that?

957
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,174
Muhammad Ali, my mentor, said this.

958
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,300
"Impossible

959
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:05,844
is not a fact, it's an opinion."

960
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,390
I see.

961
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:13,727
You can do it, Soo-cheol.

962
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,981
Take some blows for now
and become a champion in life.

963
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,857
Did your mentor say that too?

964
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,526
No, this is me talking.

965
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,527
All right.

966
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,653
Let's give it a try.

967
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:24,029
Okay.

968
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,750
Goodness.

969
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,295
I didn't know you were relaxing
in such a beautiful

970
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,213
and clean environment.

971
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:42,923
Relaxing, my foot.

972
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,425
How dare you come here?

973
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:45,884
Mother, I invited her.

974
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:47,970
Really? Why?

975
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:50,180
There's something I haven't told you.

976
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,099
It's about Grandfather's secret fund.

977
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,020
Nine hundred billion?

978
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,188
And that money is in Malaysia?

979
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,815
No, I think it's here.

980
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:00,899
-In Korea?
-Yes, sir.

981
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,652
It was laundered in Hong Kong
before coming here.

982
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,279
That paper company

983
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:08,574
lent the money
to five investment companies in Korea

984
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,534
before shutting down.

985
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:14,079
That means the five companies
don't need to pay it back.

986
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,290
Does Father own those companies?

987
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,834
The ownership was transferred
before he collapsed

988
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,252
to Ms. Moh.

989
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:21,712
What did you say?

990
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,922
Are you saying that bitch took it all?

991
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,591
I don't think so.

992
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,718
She's still looking for it.

993
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,603
Tell me.

994
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,687
Where's my money?

995
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,690
Where's the secret fund that
you stashed away under my name?

996
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,650
Are you sure Grace is allowed

997
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,319
-to hear this?
-You can trust me.

998
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:47,363
I've defected.

999
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,655
Remember Lee Woong-pyung?

1000
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,407
I've also flown my jet

1001
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:53,035
to this land of freedom.

1002
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,829
We'll see about that.
Let's take a look at your jet.

1003
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:56,955
Tell us.

1004
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,876
Someone I know in the real estate business
said something strange.

1005
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:03,629
That Director Jin of Queens Gallery rented

1006
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,340
a 5,000-pyeong warehouse
on the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.

1007
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:09,843
It's not like they're building a film set,

1008
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,387
so why do they need such a huge one?

1009
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,514
So you think the money is there.

1010
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:22,147
You told me to bring you
all the mails sent

1011
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,690
to the former chairman.

1012
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:24,608
Good.

1013
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,241
I could've come by myself.

1014
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:34,618
You didn't have to swarm over here.

1015
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:38,330
We can't trust you. It's like leaving
a kid to her own devices.

1016
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,749
You were all exposed on the media.

1017
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,877
-What if they recognize you?
-We disguised ourselves.

1018
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,088
We'll take over from here, so you may go.

1019
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,341
You're hurting my feelings.

1020
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,094
This is an undercover mission.

1021
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,471
Have you ever faked anything before? No.

1022
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,849
My entire life has been fake,

1023
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,976
so how could you leave me out of this?

1024
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:00,978
Okay. Attention, please.

1025
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,397
I'm a real estate agent,

1026
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,775
and you're wholesale dealers
who need a huge warehouse.

1027
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,487
I'll do the talking,
so don't say anything.

1028
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:14,199
Let's go.

1029
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,831
There's no place to stash all that money.

1030
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:22,583
By the way,

1031
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,750
what will they store?

1032
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,298
-Golf clubs--
-Clothes--

1033
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,593
He imports

1034
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:34,887
golf equipment,

1035
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,556
and she sells clothes in Dongdaemun.

1036
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,850
He's from China.

1037
01:14:39,933 --> 01:14:42,352
He understands Korean

1038
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,937
but can't speak it.

1039
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,150
Sir. No coriander.

1040
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,652
I don't speak Chinese.

1041
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,577
Is the temperature and humidity in here

1042
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,661
being regulated?

1043
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:00,746
You noticed.

1044
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:04,416
Our former customers
used to import artwork.

1045
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,293
I know a bit about art.

1046
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:07,461
Which artists?

1047
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,505
They weren't famous.

1048
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,632
They were rookies.
But they're very famous now.

1049
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,926
Their works have jumped
20 to 30 times in price.

1050
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,594
This place brings good energy.

1051
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:19,264
-No cilantro in my dish, please.
-Yes.

1052
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,059
He'd like to see the artwork.

1053
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:22,976
Sure thing.

1054
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,729
Your Majesty, what has become of my child?

1055
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,567
The main door is open.

1056
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,569
We're headed inside, so check the office.

1057
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,571
Okay. I'll do that.

1058
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,045
This is considered a business trip.

1059
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,838
I'll pay you extra.

1060
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:57,678
They really shouldn't catch me
doing this here.

1061
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:12,651
This is the wrong way to store artwork.

1062
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:16,321
Did you say these pieces
of artwork jumped in price?

1063
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,323
Yes, that's what I heard.

1064
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:22,411
I have a good eye for art,
but they don't look that great to me.

1065
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:31,003
I think the money is in the artwork.
This is where he laundered it.

1066
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,423
So he purchased the rookie artists' work
at a high price with the money?

1067
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,383
Yes, by ten to twentyfold.

1068
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:38,927
After wiring the money,
I think 90% or more of it

1069
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,221
was given back to him via cash.

1070
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,515
That's a substantial amount.

1071
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,267
I wonder where all that money is.

1072
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:50,022
DECRYPTING…

1073
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,361
We need to leave.

1074
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,904
We have no time.

1075
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,489
Darn it.

1076
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,116
There's too much data.

1077
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,831
I'll ask my clients
and give you a call right away.

1078
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,375
Goodbye.

1079
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,720
OFFICE
PLEASE KNOCK

1080
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,268
Is it broken?

1081
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,414
You shouldn't get wet.
Wait here while I bring the car over.

1082
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:27,369
Hae-in.

1083
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,297
Hyun-woo, that was quick.

1084
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,175
Why are you out here?

1085
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,468
Get up.

1086
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,143
I was a bit dizzy.

1087
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:53,937
I'm hungry too.

1088
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,901
Let's have something tasty
before we go home.

1089
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,614
Sure.

1090
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:23,467
Was I out for long?

1091
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,345
No, not that long.

1092
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:37,939
Hae-in.

1093
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,066
Hang tight.

1094
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:41,902
Why?

1095
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:44,070
Are we being tailed again?

1096
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,614
Don't worry. I can lose him.

1097
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,283
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1098
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,201
Should we call the police?

1099
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,412
-Wait.
-We should.

1100
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:17,622
You were attacked
by three men last time too.

1101
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,555
Hae-in!

1102
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:15,532
Jeez.

1103
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,283
Look at these comments.

1104
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:18,660
This is because Eun-sung

1105
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:21,204
spread false rumors about
how you were being investigated

1106
01:23:21,287 --> 01:23:23,331
for embezzling money prior to the divorce.

1107
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:24,374
It's okay. Ignore them.

1108
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:26,584
How can I possibly do that?

1109
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,254
"Hong Hae-in's ex
must've married her for money."

1110
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:30,213
"He's a scammer."

1111
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:32,465
"This is why you should be wary
of handsome men."

1112
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,718
How dare they curse at you?

1113
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,052
Let's sue them all.

1114
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,804
Forget it. Let's go.

1115
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:41,016
Wait. Someone bad-mouthed Hae-in too.

1116
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:44,227
"She already got a rebound
after the divorce. She must be easy."

1117
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:46,021
They know nothing about her.

1118
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,481
"Maybe she lied about dying."

1119
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,317
This one crossed the line--

1120
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:54,112
What's the ID?

1121
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,071
Screenshot this.

1122
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,948
Make a PDF file and sue them.

1123
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,366
I won't settle or negotiate.

1124
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,285
What's with your eyes? You're scaring me.

1125
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,287
They will all pay for this.

1126
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:11,337
QUEEN OF TEARS

1127
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:43,912
I'm close to locating the secret fund.

1128
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:45,830
That's it!

1129
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,290
Snap out of it.

1130
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:49,834
We have our own movie-like story.

1131
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,087
How lovey-dovey.

1132
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,589
Where is the statue?

1133
01:24:54,672 --> 01:24:55,507
Da-hye!

1134
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:57,300
Scumbags!

1135
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,135
I'd have to check.

1136
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,221
I can't be sure of anything anymore.

1137
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:04,140
It was me
who developed feelings for you first.

1138
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:06,643
So he knows where the money is?

1139
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:08,686
Is this real? Am I not dreaming?

1140
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,820
