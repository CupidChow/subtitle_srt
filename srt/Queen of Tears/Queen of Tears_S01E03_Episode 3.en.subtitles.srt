1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,446
FOUR YEARS AGO

3
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:15,909
EPISODE 3

4
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:20,747
We own this entire orchard.

5
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,041
I see.

6
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,214
I thought my mom would be here.

7
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,549
Maybe she's at the store.

8
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,426
She runs a store as well.

9
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,474
I told you that our family
was influential in this town.

10
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,809
Right.

11
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,625
Mom!

12
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
Mom?

13
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,547
YONGDU-RI SUPERMARKET

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,673
Gosh.

15
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,049
She's not here either.

16
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,600
Pick whatever you want.

17
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,740
Have this.

18
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,117
It's a new flavor.

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,535
ICE POP

20
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,871
It's strawberry flavored.

21
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:47,458
All the kids buy one after school
since it's so popular.

22
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,227
It's good and refreshing.

23
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,937
It's my first time.

24
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,569
It's your first time having an ice pop?

25
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,531
Wait. Maybe not as an adult, but as a kid?

26
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,369
Did your mom never buy you one?

27
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,538
No, she didn't.

28
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,632
To be honest, I kind of knew.

29
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,091
Knew what?

30
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,220
You always wear t-shirts
with holes in them.

31
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,512
What?

32
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,514
That's vintage.

33
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,643
-I got them made in Europe--
-What you're wearing today looks like

34
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,645
something my grandma would wear.

35
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,272
No, hear me out first.

36
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,316
You'd be shocked to find out…

37
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,072
the price of this cardigan.

38
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,699
-You don't have to pretend with me.
-Trust me.

39
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,826
I'm not that poor.

40
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,621
Really.

41
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,041
You should trust me instead.

42
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,001
I give you my word.

43
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,504
From this moment on,

44
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,925
I'll let you enjoy
all the things you couldn't enjoy in life.

45
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,929
That won't be easy.

46
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,891
Didn't I tell you
that my apartment was leased?

47
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,976
You did.

48
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,146
But there's more.

49
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,857
To be honest…

50
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,239
I save two million every month.

51
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,125
Don't look at me
like you don't understand.

52
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,418
I'm not bragging.

53
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,086
I'm saying it's okay.

54
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,923
I don't care if your family has debt.

55
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,094
If we have debt?

56
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,432
Even if there's more than that,

57
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,851
I really don't care.

58
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,605
Because…

59
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,191
I'll be by your side.

60
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,115
You'll be by my side?

61
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,199
Yes.

62
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,535
I'll be there

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,330
for you.

64
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,129
Why did this memory pop up?

65
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,969
Would you be the last person on my mind

66
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,264
if I died right now?

67
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,512
Are you okay?

68
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,437
Hae-in.

69
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,901
Are you hurt?

70
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,613
Are you okay?

71
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,698
Can you wrap up here?

72
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,367
She looks startled.

73
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,993
She needs some rest.

74
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,249
Let's go.

75
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,376
Okay.

76
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,351
It felt surreal at the hospital,

77
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,272
but I really thought I'd die back there.

78
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,195
So I told myself again

79
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,907
that I would never die.

80
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,701
Because I felt

81
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,620
offended.

82
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,586
Are you okay?

83
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,051
I think you sprained it.

84
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,025
Am I being dramatic again?

85
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,113
Yes, if this was any other day.

86
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,781
But since I'm injured,

87
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
I think it's reasonable.

88
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,954
Right?

89
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,887
Isn't it easy to set wood on fire?

90
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,014
But this is oak.

91
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,517
-So is it impossible?
-No, it's not.

92
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,770
But campers like me
prefer plum tree to oak.

93
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,065
The burning smell of plum seeps
into the meat and makes it tasty.

94
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,734
Okay. Go on then.

95
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,113
Gosh, this makes me nostalgic.

96
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,699
I'm reminded of when I went to Africa.

97
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:58,788
My twenties were filled
with wildness and barbarism.

98
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,624
You mean how you stayed

99
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,752
in the hotel the whole week
due to the mosquitoes?

100
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,839
I had enough of the wilderness
just looking out the window.

101
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,100
What?

102
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,852
-There's only smoke.
-Right.

103
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,230
I think this wood is damp.

104
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,275
Even the most skilled campers
can't do anything about this.

105
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,569
Hyun-woo was never picky about wood.

106
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,488
He's from the countryside.

107
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,824
You can't compare me to him who probably

108
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,410
played soccer
on unpaved roads with pig bladder.

109
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,661
He has experience.

110
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,497
Jeez, you and your excuses.

111
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,874
Where is he, by the way?

112
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,377
You can stop. Just ask him to do it.

113
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,587
No, I can do it.

114
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,131
Soo-cheol, that's enough. You can stop.

115
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,411
Chamomile?

116
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,954
Yes.

117
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,082
Can you make two more
for the chairman and me?

118
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,668
Sure.

119
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,047
Why did Father return early
instead of hunting?

120
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,089
Well…

121
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,009
The great shaman contacted me.

122
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,135
About what?

123
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,388
The shaman suddenly asked
if the chairman had gone hunting.

124
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,682
-How did she know?
-No wonder she's great.

125
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,645
She said the chairman would be
in danger if he went hunting today.

126
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,565
Is that why he came back right away?

127
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,901
Yes, but at least
it's good news for Hae-in.

128
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,361
She got to take his course.

129
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,571
Mom!

130
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,989
Mom!

131
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,282
Mom!

132
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,451
Hae-in got injured.

133
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,535
What? How?

134
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,038
I heard she met a boar while hunting.

135
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,416
But her injuries
aren't that bad. They're not bad.

136
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,543
Goodness. Is she okay?

137
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,342
How did you know?

138
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,260
You truly are the best.

139
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,182
What did she say?

140
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,852
Anyway, thank you so much.
I'll visit you sometime soon.

141
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,106
What did she say?

142
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,655
Your ex-wife appeared in her dream.

143
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,907
She was holding a knife
at a hunting ground.

144
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,326
She wanted to take you with her.

145
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,788
You could've been in grave danger
had you hunted today.

146
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,332
See?

147
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,167
You were wise to listen to me and return.

148
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,717
Don't ignore superstitions.

149
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,929
Check in with the shaman
before making big decisions.

150
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,514
Okay.

151
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,652
Shouldn't we call Doctor Kim?

152
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,613
I'm okay. I just sprained it.

153
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,532
Hyun-woo saved your life.

154
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,493
I thought he couldn't even shoot a bird,
but a boar?

155
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,203
He was pretending all along.

156
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,164
He probably has experience.

157
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,710
Did you just compliment him?

158
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,087
You need a lot of experience to catch one.

159
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,132
Boars are thick-skinned,
so you need to hit the right spot.

160
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,925
If not, it could be even more dangerous.

161
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,181
Exactly. Thank God he was lucky.
What if he missed?

162
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,226
Think about it.

163
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,646
He shouldn't have been
so reckless as a rookie.

164
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,566
He was a marine in the Special Guard Team.

165
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,401
-He was known for his shooting.
-Really?

166
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,778
Yes, really.

167
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,156
Do you finally understand
how much of a fool you were

168
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,074
to offer to teach him how to shoot?

169
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,661
One thing is for certain.

170
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,248
I wouldn't be here right now
had he hesitated even a bit.

171
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,670
You lucky brat.

172
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,423
-What?
-I could tell by his muscular arms

173
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,928
that he didn't spend all his years
only studying.

174
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,012
How could you tell?

175
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,598
When I was in jail,

176
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,392
he handed me the agreement
with those muscular arms

177
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,353
and said, "Please sign this."

178
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,605
And my heart

179
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,482
fluttered.

180
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,150
-Aunt.
-Aunt, come on.

181
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,449
You amaze me at times, Hyun-woo.

182
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,868
How did you make that decision
in that brief moment?

183
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,912
I wasn't thinking.

184
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,081
It was instinctive.

185
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,543
Your instincts knew
that you shouldn't let her die.

186
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,672
You had to save her
so she'd revise her will. Right?

187
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,883
Hello?

188
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,530
Where's Hae-in?

189
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,032
She took some meds and went to bed.

190
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,993
She must've been so startled.

191
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,995
I can't believe this.

192
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,290
Actually, I scanned the course earlier.

193
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,667
I noticed that the fence was pried open.

194
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,129
I believe the injured boar
had entered through that hole.

195
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,048
That was supposed to be
Chairman Hong's course.

196
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,634
What are you getting at?

197
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:50,598
Are you saying someone purposely lured
the injured boar to harm him?

198
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,850
We wouldn't know
even if that was the case.

199
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,189
I'll check the nearby CCTV cameras
and dashcams.

200
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,275
I'll check them myself.

201
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,402
Would you like to do that?

202
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,738
Okay, I'll get them ready.

203
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,281
I'm sorry

204
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,993
this had to happen
during your visit, Mr. Yoon.

205
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,661
Don't worry about it, sir.

206
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,955
Mr. Yoon, try the soup.

207
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,790
I caught that pheasant.

208
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,378
Come on. Don't lie, Dad.

209
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,214
We bought them at a nearby farm.

210
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,678
All right. Let's eat.

211
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,804
Eat up.

212
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,315
Thank you.

213
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,334
Why did you season the bellflower roots?

214
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,796
Hyun-woo prefers them charbroiled.

215
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,547
No, I like this too.

216
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,424
Really?

217
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,884
Yes.

218
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,178
Eat up.

219
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,721
Yes, sir.

220
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,059
Mr. Yoon.

221
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,519
These are lacquer leaves.

222
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,562
They're pretty rare.

223
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,565
The mountain-bred ones
are very tasty and hard to find.

224
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,067
I had them when I was younger.

225
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,193
"Younger"?

226
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,571
Didn't you grow up in the US?

227
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,575
No, I went there when I was 13 years old.
I was in Korea up until then.

228
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,329
Did your family immigrate there
or were you studying abroad?

229
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,956
I was adopted overseas.

230
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,334
My adoptive parents passed away
right before I graduated university.

231
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,421
So I have no family now.

232
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,633
I lost my parents at 15.

233
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,011
And I came this far by myself.

234
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,179
I wasn't aware of your family history.

235
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,766
You're unlike today's young generation.

236
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,892
I agree.

237
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,520
I'm proud of you as if I'm your mother.

238
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,233
Feel free to consider us
your Korean family.

239
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,985
I appreciate that.

240
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,236
Eat up.

241
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,243
Come here. Yes, over here.

242
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,748
Thank you.

243
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,668
Is he a Pungsan dog?

244
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,961
Yes, sir.

245
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,213
He's a handsome one.

246
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,840
Not only is he handsome,

247
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,469
but he saved my son years back
when our house was on fire.

248
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,678
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

249
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,180
My son was home alone.

250
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,974
He would've lost his life
had our dog not woken him up

251
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,517
and dragged him outside.

252
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,606
He's intelligent and loyal.

253
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,902
Would you be willing to sell him?

254
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,821
Well…

255
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,906
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,450
He's family.

257
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,090
-I'll give you 100 million.
-Sorry?

258
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,557
But he doesn't even have a pedigree.

259
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,725
That doesn't matter.

260
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,435
I'll offer less with time.

261
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,981
Ninety million.

262
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,996
-Eighty million.
-Wait.

263
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,289
Honey.

264
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,999
I'll sell him.

265
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,543
But…

266
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,253
could you give us 100 million?

267
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,090
Sure.

268
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,941
Honey.

269
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,402
There's only one thing I don't have.

270
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,862
It's prejudice, right?

271
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,863
But what about it?

272
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,198
It's about Mr. Yoon.

273
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,619
Doesn't he seem too laidback for someone
who has gone through so much in life?

274
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,955
He must've worked hard to make up for it.

275
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
Don't judge a book by its cover.

276
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,293
You can never know
what someone's thinking deep down.

277
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,752
Are you sure you're from the US?

278
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,464
You know our language and Korean proverbs
better than me.

279
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,799
I already told you.

280
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:40,095
My father made us only speak Korean
and read Korean books at home.

281
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,805
What a wise man.

282
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,641
Not everyone can become
an Ivy League professor.

283
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,352
Would you like some?

284
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,525
Right. Even beer is too bitter for you.

285
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,242
You know I feel terrible that
I can't be your drinking buddy, right?

286
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,703
What do you mean? Don't feel bad.

287
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,829
I need the toilet.

288
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,638
He's so chatty.

289
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,568
Your room is the very last one
on the second floor.

290
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,947
Yes, I know.

291
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,323
Have a lovely night.

292
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,659
You should go upstairs.

293
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,036
I will.

294
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,162
Good night then.

295
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,915
Right, Soo-cheol.

296
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,503
You asked me for advice last time

297
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,714
on how to get
on the KFTC members' good side

298
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,132
when they summoned you.

299
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,342
Right.

300
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,636
What do you say?

301
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,472
Do you want some detailed tips right now?

302
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,556
Right now?

303
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:11,728
Based on the legal expertise I obtained
during my law school days at SNU

304
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,524
and years of working at the Legal Team,

305
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,820
I could offer an extensive
yet simple explanation.

306
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,324
I'm free from now
until late into the night.

307
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,119
I'm not. My wife is waiting for me.

308
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,663
Really? What a shame.

309
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,084
I mean, it's a shame for you.

310
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,545
This is a great opportunity.

311
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,217
Are you afraid?

312
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,886
Of what?

313
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,723
Sleeping in the same room as Hae-in.

314
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,528
Soo-cheol.

315
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,156
That's absurd.

316
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,741
We're married.

317
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,785
Why would I be afraid
of sleeping next to my wife?

318
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,037
All right.

319
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,419
Where are you going?
Your room is up there.

320
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,341
I know.

321
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,763
Go straight.

322
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,351
I truly

323
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,021
pity him.

324
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,577
-Where's the alcohol?
-What do you mean?

325
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,162
You drank it all.

326
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,039
I did?

327
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,499
Are you drunk already?

328
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,375
How cute.

329
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,337
-Let's go to bed.
-Okay.

330
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,050
I drank it all.

331
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,675
What took you so long?

332
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,427
Were you not sleeping?

333
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,513
I woke up.

334
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,142
I asked you a question.

335
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,686
Right.

336
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,398
Soo-cheol asked me something,
so we were talking.

337
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,566
What?

338
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,860
That lunatic.

339
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,487
Was he pestering you at this hour?

340
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,490
Honey. Hae-in.

341
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,703
Please don't be so hot-tempered.

342
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,372
Should I go back out there

343
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,625
and give him a stern warning?

344
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,835
That's okay.

345
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,464
Right? That's what I thought.

346
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,924
-Help me take off my top.
-What?

347
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,303
I think I sprained my fingers.
It hurts to unbutton it.

348
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,929
Can you do it?

349
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,145
-Me?
-Yes.

350
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,232
-Unbutton you?
-Yes, back here.

351
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,317
Here.

352
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,085
That's enough.

353
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,922
I can do the rest.

354
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,798
Okay.

355
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,676
Right.

356
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,021
Why aren't you undressing?

357
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:23,939
Do I have to?

358
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,567
You're not showering?

359
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,319
Do I have to?

360
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,168
Should I not go out?

361
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,812
What's wrong with you?

362
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,107
Don't glamorize him.
He wasn't that handsome.

363
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,749
Are you okay?

364
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,669
No. Stop it.

365
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,255
Don't replay it in slow motion.

366
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,012
Don't do it.

367
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,139
Don't.

368
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,864
I couldn't find

369
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,574
a bathrobe.

370
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,538
Right.

371
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,373
I see.

372
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,426
I'm so dumbfounded.

373
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,388
Does he think

374
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,807
he's sexy?

375
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,686
What in the world
happened to his body?

376
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,484
Seriously.

377
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,043
What? What do you want?

378
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,128
I…

379
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,090
There's a lot of water on the floor.

380
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,928
You don't like that,
so I was going to wipe it.

381
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,389
It's okay.

382
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,224
Just go dry your hair.

383
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,228
Don't tell me…

384
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,357
you didn't dry your hair

385
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,526
because you looked in the mirror

386
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,237
and thought you looked like

387
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,532
a drenched Timothée Chalamet
or a young Leonardo DiCaprio.

388
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,660
What do you mean?

389
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,495
If that's not why,

390
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,165
then go dry your hair.

391
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,792
Okay.

392
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,502
I will.

393
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,511
Unbelievable.

394
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,054
Was he trying to seduce me?

395
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,561
I'm too stimulated

396
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,980
for this hour.

397
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,627
Are you sleeping?

398
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,258
Not yet.

399
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,386
The bed is small.

400
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,848
Is this queen-sized?

401
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,974
It's king.

402
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:10,892
I see.

403
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,063
It feels too small

404
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,607
to be king-sized.

405
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,942
There was a time

406
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,111
when we slept together

407
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,572
on a single bed.

408
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,367
When?

409
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,577
Don't you remember?

410
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,247
My first visit to Yongdu-ri.

411
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,588
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD
DILIGENCE AWARD

412
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,817
Spend the night here.

413
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,249
It's too late.

414
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,337
It's 9:00 p.m.

415
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,340
That's pretty late.

416
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,594
-It's dangerous to drive at night.
-That's true.

417
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,678
Right.

418
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,056
Sleep here.

419
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,601
I'll be in that room.

420
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,770
I'll be there

421
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,273
if you need me.

422
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,276
Good night then.

423
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,372
The moon looked pretty.

424
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,209
Maybe we could look at it together.

425
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,172
Come in…

426
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,259
if you want.

427
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,544
-By the way…
-Yes?

428
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,463
How did we even sleep

429
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,466
on that bed?

430
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,510
We cuddled.

431
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,429
Right.

432
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,055
Did we cuddle?

433
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,684
Do you want to cuddle
if the bed is too small?

434
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,565
I'm okay.

435
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,525
It's not too small.

436
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,944
I have some room.

437
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,699
-Really?
-Yes.

438
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,200
Then…

439
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,164
do you want to cuddle

440
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,416
nonetheless?

441
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,391
I'm just kidding.

442
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,895
Don't be so scared.

443
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,942
What are you doing here?

444
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,319
Goodness.

445
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,029
I'm sorry.

446
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,907
I wasn't in my right mind yesterday.

447
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,410
I'd like to give this back.

448
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,038
Please help us.
We couldn't sleep last night.

449
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,836
I already gifted the dog to him,
so I can't do that.

450
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,587
I'm sorry.

451
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,423
He's family to us since he saved our son.

452
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,552
I must've been insane
to have sold him.

453
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,846
All right. I'll take this.

454
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,806
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

455
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,808
Thank you so much, sir.

456
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,976
Goodness.

457
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:45,977
What are you doing?

458
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,437
You felt guilty for selling him.

459
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,567
So let's just kill him off.

460
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,569
Would that be better?

461
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,697
What are you doing?

462
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,708
Jeez, I almost shot you again.

463
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,629
I asked you a question.

464
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,133
I was just joking.

465
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,636
Was that a joke to you?

466
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,346
What do you think it was?

467
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,019
Did you return the money?

468
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,063
Did you get it?

469
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,524
I'm your witness.

470
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,402
The deal has ended.

471
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,701
You may go.

472
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,162
Thank you.

473
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,788
Thank you. Let's go.

474
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,957
-Hurry.
-By the way,

475
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,668
why can't I kill it?

476
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,837
You heard him.

477
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,005
He doted on the dog.

478
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,299
The dog is like family.

479
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,467
I see.

480
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,055
In that case, is it okay
to kill abandoned or stray dogs?

481
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,746
That's the entrance to the forest.

482
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,458
No one else entered except for our family.

483
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:36,003
Does that mean this was an inside job?

484
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,215
Hold on.

485
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,140
Stop there.

486
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,815
Who is that?

487
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,358
I can only see his back.

488
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,484
That's your brother.

489
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:02,989
That can't be.

490
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,323
Honey.

491
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,533
We don't know for sure.

492
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,827
Beom-seok wouldn't do that.

493
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,537
Find out if he's still in Korea.

494
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,330
Yes, sir.

495
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,415
Pack up.

496
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,209
-Already?
-The day is ruined.

497
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,377
Let's go home.

498
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,006
-Honey, do you remember that boy?
-What?

499
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,593
It happened over two decades ago.

500
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,138
That incident where
the German Shepherd of a brewery died,

501
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,056
and the killer
turned out to be a little boy.

502
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,934
Right, the one
from the Evergreen Hope Orphanage.

503
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,813
He received a scholarship
from Queens Group because he was so smart.

504
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,357
I fed him several times when he visited.

505
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,442
Yes, him.

506
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,361
Remember what he said to the police?

507
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,988
This is you, isn't it?

508
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,784
Why would you kill someone's precious dog?

509
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,494
I won't let this pass.

510
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,413
Do you know how much he cost?

511
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,248
I'm sorry.

512
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,584
Apologize to him this instant.

513
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,172
What makes a precious dog any different?

514
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,885
Then would it be okay to kill

515
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,138
a normal dog?

516
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,016
What's wrong with that kid?

517
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,142
Gosh, what is he saying?

518
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,686
Gosh, you're right.

519
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,104
He did ask that question.

520
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,191
It was creepy to hear a boy say that.

521
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,026
-Didn't he look like him?
-Who?

522
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,281
Hey, it's me. Did you get home safe?

523
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,826
I booked you a meeting with Mr. Hermann.

524
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,994
Are you serious?

525
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,497
Thanks.

526
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,873
Okay, see you then.

527
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,834
You won't be disappointed.

528
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,346
ALL MAIL

529
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,531
WE APOLOGIZE…

530
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,412
I'm going

531
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,123
to die?

532
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,125
When Hercyna is just around the corner?

533
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,627
When I'm this close
to the One Trillion Club?

534
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,466
Impossible.

535
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,760
I have so many limited editions
that I haven't worn yet.

536
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,638
I bought so many islands
but haven't visited them yet.

537
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,975
And yet, I'm going to die?

538
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,977
No, that'd be such a waste.

539
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,860
I bought all these from artists

540
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,362
in their nineties
because posthumous works skyrocket.

541
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:34,158
So how could I die before them?

542
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,872
That'd be such a waste.

543
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,433
You'd be the biggest waste.

544
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,234
Then let's wrap up this store's contract.

545
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,818
Good work, everyone.

546
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,805
-Secretary Na.
-Yes, ma'am?

547
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,517
Are there women whose hearts still race
when they see their husbands

548
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,728
despite being married
for over three years?

549
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,354
Why would their hearts race?

550
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,274
-Do they have arrhythmia?
-No, not that.

551
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,358
Maybe…

552
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,027
because…

553
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,653
they're handsome?

554
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,239
-Their husbands?
-Yes.

555
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,491
Maybe she's ill.

556
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,995
Do you know someone like that?

557
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,289
Yes, I do.

558
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,919
On some days,
she looks him in the eye

559
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,089
and wants to embrace him.

560
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,758
Why?

561
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,886
Because she pities him.

562
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,764
She feels bad

563
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:05,768
that such a soft soul
has to endure this harsh world.

564
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,687
-No way.
-On other days,

565
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,814
his shoulders look

566
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:11,940
so broad.

567
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,361
She wants him to hold her.

568
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,405
He looks like a walking, sexy dynamite.

569
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,283
She wonders
if she should let the homme fatal

570
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,286
roam freely in this world.

571
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:29,917
Please tell her
to see a doctor. She's ill.

572
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,419
-Do you think so?
-I'm telling you.

573
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,381
Make sure she gets a brain CT scan.

574
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,216
Something's seriously wrong up there.

575
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,343
Secretary Na.

576
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,762
You're pretty good.

577
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,683
-I've been very strange these days.
-How so?

578
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,309
I feel sympathy

579
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,311
for others.

580
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,356
-Is that strange?
-I was never like this.

581
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,900
I've always been cold-hearted.

582
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,111
So it's odd.

583
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,908
You're so noisy.

584
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,911
Stop crying
when I'm sacrificing my arm for you.

585
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,747
And I keep empathizing

586
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,499
with others.

587
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,639
What was that?

588
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,474
Solicitors aren't allowed here.

589
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,893
I'm sorry. He's my acquaintance's husband.

590
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,479
So you're doing him a favor?

591
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,189
Their baby is in an incubator.

592
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,482
I felt bad so…

593
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,276
He won't come back.

594
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,486
-I'm sorry.
-How long does the baby…

595
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,821
Sorry?

596
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,030
…have to be in there?

597
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,284
-About three-
-Forget it. One week? Two?

598
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,954
I'll only let him come by until then.

599
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,122
You'll let him do that?

600
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:53,917
I better not see him
once his baby is discharged.

601
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,129
No insurance will cover it.

602
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,506
I wanted to use
our security deposit for her surgery,

603
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,883
but my mom won't listen.

604
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,427
She says it's my wedding money.

605
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,221
Money is always the problem.

606
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,557
I'm sorry.

607
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,068
Unbelievable.

608
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,364
Her mom isn't the only one who's sick.

609
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,035
Her mom can get treated,
so why would she cry…

610
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,419
Why are there so many sick people?

611
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,756
How annoying.

612
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,466
I was never like this.

613
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,968
I never cared

614
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,387
about people's pain,
so why am I like this?

615
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,974
My husband makes my heart race.

616
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:56,563
I believe my brain
isn't functioning properly.

617
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,524
Are these symptoms of my illness?

618
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,150
Not really.

619
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:04,988
Many terminally ill patients
experience such changes of heart.

620
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,200
They realize things
that they wouldn't have realized

621
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,493
if they weren't dying.

622
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,245
"You're changing because of death."

623
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,914
"You're going to die soon."

624
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,333
I think that's what you're insinuating.

625
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,834
But you're wrong.

626
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,921
You see, I've been
on the brink of death many times.

627
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,297
And my miraculous luck

628
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,925
saved me every time.

629
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,935
If you're not skilled enough to save me,

630
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,520
then just watch.

631
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,939
Another miracle

632
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,191
will save me.

633
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,574
Hey, Hyun-woo.

634
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,745
Long time no see.

635
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,083
Yes, I went to the hunting ground!
So what?

636
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,042
Why did you?

637
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,087
To see Father.
He's there around this time of the year.

638
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,172
But you left without seeing him.

639
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,465
Are you

640
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,508
suspecting me?

641
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:10,053
The fence was pried open
and there was bait nearby.

642
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,432
Then the boar that had been shot
attacked Hae-in.

643
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,101
-Someone purposely--
-So?

644
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,231
My daughter almost died.

645
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,734
Tell me the truth.

646
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,527
This is your last warning.

647
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,906
You're upset because Hae-in was involved.

648
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,410
Why weren't you upset
when I was falsely accused and kicked out?

649
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,332
Fine, sit down.

650
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,963
I went there because I knew
it was the family's hunting day.

651
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,342
But when I went there,
the great Moh Seul-hee said

652
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,552
he was asleep and didn't let me see him.

653
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,429
I begged her but to no avail.

654
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,723
So I came back. That's all.

655
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,351
Fine.

656
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,102
Beom-jun.

657
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,772
Help me meet him just once.

658
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,318
That's all I need.
I want to reconcile before it's too late.

659
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,236
Sometimes,

660
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,157
it's better to let go.

661
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,926
Hyun-woo.

662
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,011
Isn't my family so odd?

663
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,639
Sorry? Not at all, sir.

664
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,392
We have seven lawsuits against each other.

665
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,479
You must've walked
on eggshells as you took care

666
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,398
of our trivial matters.

667
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,152
You've done so much.

668
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,873
Hello.

669
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,420
The chairman is already asleep.

670
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,213
Already?

671
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,340
Should I wake him up?

672
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,466
That's okay.

673
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,510
I just came by to greet him.

674
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,428
Goodbye then.

675
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,642
Ms. Moh.

676
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,563
Did Beom-seok come to our hunting ground

677
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,065
and ask to see Father?

678
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,694
No, he didn't.

679
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,155
Is that what he said?

680
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,617
Look.

681
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,078
I don't like saying this,

682
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,497
but be wary of him.

683
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:46,209
He's been holding a grudge for a while
after getting kicked out.

684
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,962
Those who have nothing to lose
are the most fearful.

685
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,225
What kind of person
is Mr. Yoon Eun-sung? Do you know?

686
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,435
Mr. Yoon?

687
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:07,397
I know his business side,
but not him as a person.

688
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:12,569
You know that people like us
shouldn't trust others easily.

689
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,530
If this deal
goes down the drain as well,

690
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,324
Father will abandon Soo-cheol.

691
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,408
Don't worry.

692
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,702
I'll look into him discreetly.

693
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,157
Looking for me?

694
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,077
Gosh, you startled me.

695
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,835
A background check?

696
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,212
She's quite cautious.

697
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,589
She's just afraid,

698
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,008
but it's only in the beginning.

699
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,262
People like her trust easily
once they let down their guard.

700
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,806
She did let down her guard somewhat.

701
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,352
By the way, do you see
any hope with Hae-in?

702
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,023
Money is important to me for sure,

703
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,651
but I'd also love to see
that couple break up.

704
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,319
Why?

705
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:41,783
It's safe to say that I pioneered
the matchmaking scene in this country.

706
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,619
Yet I failed
to properly marry off Queens' daughter.

707
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,413
How humiliating is that?

708
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,707
I will tear them apart at all costs

709
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,042
and retrieve my lost honor
and performance.

710
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,505
In that case,
don't repeat what you did.

711
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,174
-You'll get in the way.
-That was…

712
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,136
I was told to do that.

713
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:06,099
But Hyun-woo stepped in, killed the boar,

714
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,183
and saved Hae-in.

715
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,895
I never saw that coming.

716
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,107
Hyun-woo, you've leveled up.

717
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,069
From Mr. Cinderella
who married into a wealthy family

718
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,614
to a lifesaver
who saved their daughter's life!

719
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,909
They are treating me differently now.

720
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,411
It was my first time eating
a pheasant leg.

721
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,164
I was normally given
the neck or the lean cuts.

722
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,249
But my father-in-law gave me the leg.

723
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,961
It's too early to be complacent.

724
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,671
Keep up the good work.

725
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,382
How?

726
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,345
"I was only doing my job."

727
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:47,349
Don't ruin this opportunity
by saying such nonsense.

728
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:52,062
"Yes, I was scared too. I could've died,
but I did it for Hae-in."

729
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,814
You need to take credit.

730
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,109
-Do I have to?
-Yes, you do.

731
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,987
Taking credit
is like collecting coffee coupons.

732
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,365
You need to collect ten coupons

733
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:06,743
for them to realize
you're a regular and give you freebies.

734
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,453
I don't need

735
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,330
any freebies.

736
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,208
All I want is to be free and unscathed.

737
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,085
What an idiot.

738
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,670
Say goodbye if you're going

739
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,921
-to be fake.
-Goodbye to what?

740
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,881
"Goodbye, my Italian suits."

741
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,758
"Goodbye, my handmade designer shoes."

742
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,010
"Goodbye, my foreign car."

743
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,430
"Goodbye, the luxury watch on my wrist."

744
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,767
"Goodbye, Hae-in's fortune."

745
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,939
Mr. Cinderella will now return
to his orchard down south.

746
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:40,485
But the problem is, his family
won't welcome him with open arms.

747
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,906
I'm sorry, Coach.

748
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,493
My son isn't interested in boxing
and wants to do Taekwondo instead.

749
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,662
That's okay. Kids are like that.

750
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,664
Goodbye then.

751
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,832
Let's go.

752
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,167
By the way, Jae-hyeon,
why do you like Taekwondo?

753
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,545
They have belts.

754
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,088
Belts? For your waist?

755
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,548
Is that why?

756
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,884
That's why he wants to go.

757
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,096
Jae-hyeon, we have belts too.

758
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,222
Look at that.

759
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,515
It's the champion belt.

760
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,851
Coach, that's okay.

761
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,354
-Ta-da.
-Gosh.

762
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,439
Check this out.

763
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,734
What do you say?
Isn't it fancier than those belts?

764
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,277
They smash things too.

765
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,112
Smash?

766
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,823
We smash things too.

767
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,576
We just didn't have time.
Should I show you?

768
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,202
No, you don't need to show him.

769
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,203
Hold on.

770
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,580
Give me one second.

771
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,873
Where's the board?

772
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:35,957
There it is.

773
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,876
Okay. Look.

774
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,502
Check this out.

775
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,512
This is how you do it.

776
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,222
I'll smash it this time around.

777
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,307
Watch me.

778
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,277
Gosh!

779
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,362
See? I smashed it, right?

780
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,907
-Isn't boxing cool too?
-But…

781
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,409
What? What is it this time?

782
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,079
I want to do Taekwondo
because Ji-seong does it.

783
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,540
Ji-seong is his best friend.

784
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,666
I see.

785
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,794
Ma'am.

786
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,714
I'm only saying this
because I care a lot about Jae-hyeon.

787
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,009
Don't you think
he should have various friends?

788
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:28,968
Sorry?

789
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,970
-Do you know Baek Ho-yeol?
-I do.

790
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,308
He's my son, and he's just like you.

791
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,435
He loves games just like you.

792
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,271
How great would it be to come here to box

793
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,690
and play games with him after school?

794
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,737
Ho-yeol has the lowest grade.

795
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:48,822
Hey.

796
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,660
Coach.

797
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,786
You're bleeding.

798
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,164
Gosh.

799
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,707
Why am I…

800
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,335
Gosh, don't worry about me.

801
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,170
The wood must've scraped me.

802
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,713
Goodbye then.

803
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:06,798
Are you leaving?

804
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,883
-Let's go.
-Get home safe, ma'am.

805
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,301
Goodbye.

806
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,511
Okay.

807
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,721
Jae-hyeon, see you again!

808
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,265
Bye.

809
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,516
Goodbye, ma'am.

810
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,743
-Hey, you're bleeding.
-It's just a scrape.

811
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,120
The wood scraped me.

812
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,997
Why are you so irritated?

813
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,792
I haven't been getting much sleep lately,
so I closed down my salon today.

814
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,627
I should close down this gym soon

815
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,172
and consider working under someone
once Hyun-woo divorces.

816
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,882
Stop talking about his divorce.

817
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,926
I should accept reality
and prepare myself.

818
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,931
-Should we go to Seoul?
-And do what?

819
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,225
I called Hae-in, but she didn't pick up.

820
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,687
Let's meet her in person and dissuade her
from getting a divorce.

821
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,564
-Get ready.
-What?

822
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,899
Let's go.

823
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:12,322
You were so against this whole plan,
but I guess you eventually got into it.

824
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,073
Well…

825
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,494
I always do my best
when I set my mind to something.

826
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,578
You're right.

827
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,497
You always do things wholeheartedly.

828
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,040
But here's the problem.

829
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,834
Fool her halfheartedly,
and all will be fine.

830
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,544
But do an outstanding job,

831
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,924
and she'll be livid
if she finds out.

832
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,677
-Probably, right?
-Right.

833
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:38,765
So you should never get caught. Got that?

834
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,434
I won't get caught

835
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,520
as long as you and I

836
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,438
keep this a secret.

837
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,481
Right.

838
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,821
By the way, shouldn't we tell Hyun-woo
that we're going to see Hae-in?

839
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,657
You idiot.

840
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,409
Do you think he'll allow that?
We've got nothing to lose now.

841
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,954
We should try to stop them
at all costs, right?

842
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,581
Step on it.

843
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,174
ONGOING RECRUITMENT

844
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,940
What should we tell them?

845
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,193
We don't need to introduce ourselves.

846
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,653
Do you not watch dramas?

847
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,115
The secretary's office manages
the VIP families.

848
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,702
They'll be startled the moment
they see our faces and say,

849
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,954
"Ms. Hong, your sister-in-law is here."

850
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,873
Then they'll let us in right away.

851
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,750
You need to book an appointment.

852
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,004
You must be new here.

853
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,142
Look at this.

854
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,518
That's me.

855
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,562
This wavy-haired guy is him.

856
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,190
Okay? That's us. See?

857
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,528
Leave your name and number,
and I'll hand it to her.

858
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:17,739
Look.

859
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,659
We're her family.
We're part of the royal family.

860
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,037
Why must we book
an appointment to see our family?

861
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,913
Jeez.

862
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,584
Please book an appointment and come back--

863
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:34,964
Hae-in!

864
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,883
Long time no see.

865
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,468
I'm Hyeon-tae, Hyun-woo's brother.

866
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:40,928
I know.

867
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:44,015
I wondered if it was you, and I was right.

868
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,810
We need to talk. Even Hyun-woo
doesn't know that we're here.

869
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,854
Well…

870
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,776
Should we go upstairs?

871
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,735
All right.

872
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,571
-This way.
-Okay.

873
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,163
Are you surprised?

874
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:11,250
But you see, we won't punish you
for not recognizing us.

875
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:12,794
Don't worry.

876
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:17,215
We don't abuse our power in that manner.

877
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:28,851
You must be busy.

878
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,312
Sorry we came by unannounced.

879
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:35,066
I had actually called several times,
but I couldn't reach you.

880
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,776
I don't pick up unsaved numbers.

881
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,113
You must not have my number.

882
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,740
What brings you here?

883
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,991
You see…

884
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,496
Where should I begin?

885
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,251
It was our dad's 60th birthday recently.

886
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:57,422
You must be here because you were upset
that I didn't show up.

887
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,381
Gosh, not at all.

888
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,298
No?

889
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,510
Of course not,
because we weren't upset at all.

890
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:08,182
I don't know how you'll feel about this,

891
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,351
but Hyun-woo…

892
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,145
-Yes?
-He's difficult, isn't he?

893
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,981
-Sorry?
-Gosh, I understand.

894
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,065
Understand what?

895
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,944
The person who's the polar opposite of you
isn't on the other side of the globe.

896
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:25,116
It's the person you're married to,
the one you sleep and eat next to.

897
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:28,119
They fail to understand you the most.

898
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,078
Right.

899
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,873
My husband and I
argued all the time because of the AC.

900
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:34,667
He'd turn on the AC in the summer,
and I'd be freezing.

901
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,211
We even cursed each other out
because of it.

902
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,676
He used to be head over heels
for me when we got married,

903
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,887
yet he couldn't even
turn off the AC for me.

904
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,890
We don't argue over such things.

905
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,725
Is that so?

906
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,101
Then that's great.

907
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,644
You have a good relationship.

908
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,105
We sleep in separate rooms,
so we each have an AC.

909
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:01,778
That's understandable
if you have many spare rooms.

910
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:05,072
Anyway, this is what
I say to him all the time.

911
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,325
"Now that you're married,
you're no longer one of us.

912
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,953
Consider yourself a part of Queens
and stay there even after you die."

913
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,123
"Don't you dare come back
or set foot into our house."

914
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,376
So speaking of which…

915
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,887
Div--

916
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,266
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but you're going to be late

917
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,393
for your meeting with Mr. Hermann.

918
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,187
I'm sorry, but I need to go.

919
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,939
I have an important dinner today.

920
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,649
Okay, you should go.

921
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,360
I'll text you
the rest of the conversation,

922
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,111
so please save my number.

923
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:55,623
-I'll visit you sometime soon.
-Really? Would you do that?

924
01:03:55,706 --> 01:04:00,044
I admit that we've been distant
after Hyun-woo got married.

925
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,463
After all, you got us a building.

926
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,464
A building?

927
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,550
Yes, the one in our town.

928
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,177
Did I purchase a building there?

929
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,138
Yes, you did. You told me
to get one when you got married.

930
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,182
I see.

931
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,101
Are you using that?

932
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,394
Yes.

933
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,563
But don't you worry.

934
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,648
I do the cleaning and repairing.

935
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,858
I do everything.

936
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,986
Don't you worry about the building
since I have it under control.

937
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,368
By the way, why did your in-laws visit?

938
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,536
I'm not sure.

939
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,372
She mentioned
how I didn't attend her father's 60th.

940
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,499
So she came to nitpick?

941
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,625
She said no.

942
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,543
Then?

943
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:46,674
She said marriage
was like turning the AC on in the summer.

944
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,510
What? What does that mean?

945
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,637
You never agree on the temperature.

946
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,598
I see.

947
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,308
That makes sense.

948
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,112
Hey.

949
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,698
-Where's Mr. Hermann?
-Right.

950
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,576
He went to see his baby daughter
because she flipped over.

951
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,705
He ditched this meeting
just because his baby flipped over?

952
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:18,998
He's a family guy.

953
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:22,293
That must be why he divorced four times
and had a baby at 60.

954
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,544
How irritating.

955
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:27,131
I even brought the floor plan
since he wanted to see it first.

956
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,966
This is actually better.

957
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,928
You see, he already has a picture in mind.

958
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,014
Knowing that beforehand
would give you an advantage.

959
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,807
What does he want?

960
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,103
What? You're back?

961
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,980
I thought you went home.

962
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,607
I have more documents to look over.

963
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,359
-You can go home first.
-Yes, sir.

964
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:51,155
By the way, Secretary Na told me earlier

965
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,240
that Ms. Hong had a dinner appointment.

966
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,283
I see.

967
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,703
She said Ms. Hong was meeting
with Mr. Yoon Eun-sung

968
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,413
and might come home late. So sir,

969
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:03,626
I think it's safe for you
to go home instead of staying here.

970
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,461
Who is she meeting again?

971
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:09,632
Hercyna wants two floors.

972
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,883
-Two floors?
-Yes.

973
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,428
You'll need a fancy staircase around here.

974
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,055
How can we do that?

975
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,015
This won't be a simple renovation.

976
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,726
I'll have to change
the structure and get it approved.

977
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,438
Exactly. He'll make that suggestion
and choose whomever gets it done first.

978
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,315
That's insane.

979
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,360
It's ridiculous…

980
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,654
but only I know this?

981
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,322
Correct.

982
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:47,086
Sir, did you hear about your siblings
visiting Ms. Hong earlier today?

983
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,715
-Who?
-Your sister and brother.

984
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,967
Secretary Na just told me about it.

985
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,260
Did you not know?

986
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,898
Eat first before they get soggy.

987
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,777
Hold on. "I know it's tough.
Dot, dot, dot."

988
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,196
"But you still can't get a divorce."

989
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,991
"Can you reconsider it for my sake?"

990
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:19,827
Why would she do that?
She barely knows you.

991
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,579
Just eat your udon.

992
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:23,789
Why did you mention
cleaning the building to her?

993
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,458
I was so shocked.

994
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,752
How did she not know
about her own building?

995
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,628
Is this similar to how I forgot

996
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,005
about the 10,000 won I left

997
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,423
in my winter coat?

998
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:33,674
Is that what owning

999
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,843
-a building is to them--
-Stop talking!

1000
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,933
"Whatever the reason
for your divorce may be,

1001
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,644
I believe Hyun-woo is to blame."

1002
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:49,648
"So could you please
be understanding this once

1003
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,984
and not get a divorce? Crying emote."

1004
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,447
I'm sending it.

1005
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,242
It's Hyun-woo!

1006
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,327
BAEK HYUN-WOO

1007
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,788
-What do I do?
-Pick it up.

1008
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,666
What? Yes, I met her.

1009
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,087
Why do you think I did?
To tell her not to divorce you.

1010
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,005
But she was too busy,

1011
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,215
so I texted her instead.

1012
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,884
-What?
-What?

1013
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,385
They're not separating.

1014
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,304
-Did they reconcile?
-Did you reconcile?

1015
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,225
No, she just doesn't know that he wants

1016
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,309
-a divorce.
-What?

1017
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,560
He never brought it up.

1018
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,896
What do I do?

1019
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,064
HONG HAE-IN

1020
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,536
BAEK HYUN-WOO

1021
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,290
POWER OFF

1022
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,506
Are you okay?

1023
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,007
Yes.

1024
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,677
Let's go.

1025
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,850
What kind of person

1026
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:07,685
is your husband?

1027
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:08,936
That was random.

1028
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,355
You were always cold
and suspicious of others.

1029
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,732
So I was curious about the person

1030
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,901
you chose to marry.

1031
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:18,279
Let me think.

1032
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,867
It feels like
you're hoping I'd bad-mouth him.

1033
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,035
But you're wrong. He's a good man.

1034
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:29,039
You saw how he jumped in
to save me in that dangerous moment.

1035
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,668
You're wrong.

1036
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,504
I saw him hesitating.

1037
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,840
He hesitated

1038
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,508
to save you.

1039
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,722
Hae-in.

1040
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,519
HONG HAE-IN

1041
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:54,273
The number you have dialed
is not available…

1042
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,118
That's the difference between you two.

1043
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:10,039
You were watching him at that moment,

1044
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:11,957
but he was watching me.

1045
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,881
You actually believe that he loves you.

1046
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,174
Yes, I do.

1047
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:22,968
I don't know what love means to you.

1048
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:27,640
But to me, it's not about being happy
and whispering sweet nothings.

1049
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,516
Love is when

1050
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,268
you endure the pain together.

1051
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,771
When you choose to stay
instead of running away.

1052
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,649
Even if they have a debt

1053
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:39,360
or something more than that,

1054
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,153
you still stick together.

1055
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:44,406
That's love.

1056
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,951
And he's doing just that.

1057
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,037
That was lengthy.

1058
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,455
What?

1059
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:53,499
People tend to ramble when they're unsure.

1060
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:56,919
You don't look confident.

1061
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:35,708
I didn't know you were here.

1062
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,834
Where's Hae-in?

1063
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:39,211
Well, you see…

1064
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,138
What brings you here?

1065
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,265
Hae-in had a lot to drink.

1066
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:54,184
She drank?

1067
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,525
Hae-in.

1068
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:03,902
-Hae-in.
-Let her be. She's sleeping.

1069
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,282
She sleeps when she's drunk.

1070
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,204
Hong Hae-in.

1071
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:20,002
She's been sleeping the whole time,
so give her ten more minutes.

1072
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:22,379
Or I'll bring her in later,

1073
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,547
so you can wait inside.

1074
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,466
How much alcohol did you feed her?

1075
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:28,802
Sorry?

1076
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:30,971
Look.

1077
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,476
She doesn't usually drink,
but she can hold her liquor.

1078
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:39,063
So how much did you feed her for her to be

1079
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:42,983
this drunk?

1080
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,777
I mixed alcohol.

1081
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,750
I can't sleep because you're too noisy.

1082
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,046
Thanks. Go home safely.

1083
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,131
Okay. Sleep well.

1084
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:09,426
-See you tomorrow evening.
-Why would she--

1085
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:12,846
I mean…

1086
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,933
I heard you guys met
with Mr. Hermann today.

1087
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:18,227
So what's tomorrow for?

1088
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,187
Mr. Hermann didn't show up today.

1089
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,481
It was just us two.

1090
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,108
And we drank

1091
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:26,860
by ourselves.

1092
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,494
Right. Don't forget to drink
orange juice in the morning.

1093
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,162
That's your hangover cure.

1094
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,206
Whatever. Okay.

1095
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:40,666
Okay.

1096
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,544
-Bye.
-Goodbye then.

1097
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,463
Please take good care of her.

1098
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,510
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes, sir?

1099
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,471
Please take him home safely.
He seems to be very drunk.

1100
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,641
He seems very out of it,
so walk him to his door.

1101
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:58,725
Yes, sir.

1102
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:01,854
What are you doing? Get in.

1103
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,206
Why did you suddenly drink so much?

1104
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,875
Because it was unlike me.

1105
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,587
I'm going to try new things from now on.

1106
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:30,924
It's so unfair.

1107
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:35,971
I lived differently from others
so I could live a long, healthy life.

1108
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,766
But look at me now. It was all useless.

1109
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,687
I'm going to speak my mind,

1110
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,107
do everything I want,

1111
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,113
and kill those who deserve it.

1112
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:01,163
What's with the last one?

1113
01:15:03,707 --> 01:15:05,250
I'm going to kill

1114
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,419
every single scumbag who betrays

1115
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,087
and stabs me in the back.

1116
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:12,633
Think about this.

1117
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:16,094
Even if I do commit murder,

1118
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:20,682
I'll just need to attend trial
a few times before I die

1119
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,059
in three months.

1120
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:27,856
Right. You could be my attorney.

1121
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,321
Okay, give me that. Let's go inside.

1122
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:38,909
You have a knack
for saying such terrifying things.

1123
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,422
Don't be afraid.

1124
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:57,511
I know you would never betray me.

1125
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:00,264
Of course not.

1126
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,433
I'm not afraid.

1127
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:10,691
By the way,

1128
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,945
your phone was turned off.

1129
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,322
Where is it?

1130
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,407
Is it not in there?

1131
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:20,909
Right.

1132
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:22,828
I must've left it in the car.

1133
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,912
In the car?

1134
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:27,374
Go in first. I'll get your phone.

1135
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,339
Mr. Oh, have you left? Where are you?

1136
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,883
What? Here it is.

1137
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,851
It was in my pocket.

1138
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,609
What? It's turned off.

1139
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,117
Hae-in, wait.

1140
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:35,108
-What are you doing?
-I'm not sure.

1141
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,029
What…

1142
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:40,822
am I

1143
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:43,784
doing right now?

1144
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,827
I'm glad

1145
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:48,455
that you found

1146
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:50,165
your phone.

1147
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,459
It could've been

1148
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:54,670
a hassle to get it.

1149
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:02,386
Why wasn't I…

1150
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,100
confident?

1151
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,227
What?

1152
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,063
What did you say?

1153
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,074
Right.

1154
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,332
I told you, right?

1155
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,376
I'm going to try

1156
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,504
new things from now on.

1157
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:13,498
SANSSOUCI PALACE, POTSDAM, GERMANY
THREE YEARS AGO

1158
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,801
Did you say this place had no worries?

1159
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:29,931
"Sans souci" in French
means "carefree."

1160
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:33,393
That's just ridiculous.

1161
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,061
How could such a place exist?

1162
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:37,481
Do you know The Happy Prince?

1163
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:41,109
The prince who made
a swallow poke out his eyes?

1164
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,113
Yes.

1165
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:49,826
The prince used to live in this palace.

1166
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:54,498
I only realized one thing
after reading that book

1167
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:55,916
as a child.

1168
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,001
"You'll always suffer away from home."

1169
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:01,129
Even the prince probably missed his home.

1170
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,924
He left home only to suffer.

1171
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:05,926
He gave away his gems and eyes.

1172
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:10,555
Hae-in.

1173
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,143
That's why he's the "happy prince."

1174
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,438
Please. He wasn't happy.
He just changed before his death.

1175
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,191
We should stay true to ourselves

1176
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,693
and not act out of character
just because we're dying.

1177
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,672
I'd like to build something.

1178
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,466
A cancer support center
that aids employees' families.

1179
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,717
Sorry?

1180
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:50,887
You want to offer financial help
to their families?

1181
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,013
Why?

1182
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,057
For efficiency, of course.

1183
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,434
What do you mean?

1184
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,728
Imagine if your family member has cancer.

1185
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,230
Could you focus on work?

1186
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:02,566
-Probably not.
-Right?

1187
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,318
Then you wouldn't be able
to sell your products.

1188
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,736
That would be my loss.

1189
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,574
And you'd cry in the toilet
about how you're in need of money.

1190
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,701
Your makeup would run,
your eyes would be swollen.

1191
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:15,662
It would only bring down
our department store's reputation.

1192
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:17,873
I see.

1193
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:18,915
I'm not trying

1194
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,668
to help others out of goodwill.

1195
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:25,714
It's all about the efficiency
and the financial aspect.

1196
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,887
QUEEN OF TEARS

1197
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:01,708
-Are you going to bed?
-Let's do it.

1198
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:04,961
It was because I was scared.
That's why my heart was racing so much.

1199
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:07,422
Now that I've been cured,

1200
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,466
you're going to betray me?

1201
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,842
Watch out!

1202
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,928
What kind of lunatic yells like that here?

1203
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:16,306
You're not the Eun-sung I knew.

1204
01:22:16,389 --> 01:22:18,767
I've worked very hard
to hear this from you.

1205
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:21,937
I don't even like Hae-in.
Why would I be jealous?

1206
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,148
I have something to tell you.

1207
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:27,567
Don't worry.
It's good news that you'll love.

1208
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:33,740
