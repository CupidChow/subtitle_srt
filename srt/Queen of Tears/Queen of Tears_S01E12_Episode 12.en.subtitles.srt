1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,790
Stop.

3
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,348
I recognize that truck.

4
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,730
I did find it odd

5
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,483
when my grandfather suddenly wanted

6
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,402
to change the ventilators
and told us to leave.

7
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,655
That's the day I saw that truck.

8
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,116
So you think that truck
carried his secret fund?

9
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,452
If I'm right,
wouldn't the money be at home?

10
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,547
EPISODE 12

11
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,851
You shouldn't get wet.

12
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,311
Wait here while I bring the car over.

13
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,800
You have arrived at your destination.

14
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,283
Hae-in.

15
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,247
Hyun-woo.

16
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,674
That was quick.

17
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,223
Why are you out here?

18
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,224
Get up.

19
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,108
I was a bit dizzy.

20
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,529
I'm hungry too.

21
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,535
Let's have something tasty
before we go home.

22
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,253
Sure.

23
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,595
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

24
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,346
Should we call the police?

25
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,681
-Wait.
-We should.

26
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,975
You were attacked
by three men last time too.

27
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,119
You're…

28
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,913
Eun-sung.

29
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,083
What? Do you recognize me now?

30
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,585
What a shame.

31
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,133
How could I…

32
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,677
Exactly. How could you mistake me

33
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,095
for Hyun-woo?

34
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,599
Hae-in!

35
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,732
Open the door.

36
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,777
And if I do?

37
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,238
What will you tell him?

38
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,824
-What?
-Are you going to tell him?

39
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,702
That you got in my car
after mistaking me for him?

40
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,510
He'll be shocked.

41
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,846
Wouldn't it be better if you said

42
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,015
we were going somewhere?

43
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,435
Hae-in.

44
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,151
Open the door.

45
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,989
Open it.

46
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,172
Are you okay?

47
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,841
Yes, I'm fine.

48
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,802
Then I'm relieved.

49
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,685
I thought something happened to you.

50
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,437
Let's go.

51
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,792
I ran into Eun-sung earlier.

52
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,169
And he invited me back home.

53
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,549
You know I've wanted to see Grandfather.

54
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,640
I'll be back.

55
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,434
I understand.

56
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,687
Let me go with you.

57
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,313
I'm sorry,

58
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,148
but I only invited her.

59
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,196
Don't worry.

60
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,491
Just pick me up later.

61
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,077
Are you sure you're okay?

62
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,456
Yes, I'm fine.

63
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,357
Surprise.

64
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,566
How did you find me?

65
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,905
What's wrong?

66
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,242
-Aren't you glad to see me?
-I mean, I was going to call.

67
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,787
I see.

68
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,706
Jeez, I had no idea.

69
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,170
So I thought of killing you
once I tracked you down.

70
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,096
Geon-u.

71
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,767
Is this him?
Jeez, he looks better in photos.

72
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,311
Hey, Dong-u.

73
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,271
Say, "Daddy."

74
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,898
-His name is Geon-u.
-Hey.

75
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,692
I named my son Dong-u, so that's his name.

76
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,654
Anyway, it must've been tough

77
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,240
to live with a dense idiot.

78
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,202
Soo-cheol will be arrested soon.

79
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,579
-Why?
-I did some illegal deeds

80
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,747
as a finance director.

81
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,000
I planned it out
so that he'd take the blame.

82
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,254
I tipped off a prosecutor
before leaving Korea.

83
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,131
-You didn't have to do that--
-Hey.

84
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,383
I did it all for you.

85
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,511
What if he wants revenge
and comes looking for you?

86
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,690
God, he's noisy. Hey!

87
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,025
Do that in the bathroom.

88
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,739
The person you dialed is unavailable.

89
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,074
MY SON, HYUN-WOO

90
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,452
Hyun-woo and Hae-in aren't picking up.

91
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,495
Are they spending the night in Seoul?

92
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,789
That's better than driving back
at this hour.

93
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,459
Honey, don't you think

94
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,586
-we're being too liberal?
-What do you mean?

95
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,421
Forget about Hae-in.

96
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,257
Hyun-woo didn't even go abroad to study.

97
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,217
Don't you think he's too open-minded?

98
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,218
What's the issue?

99
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,220
They're not strangers.

100
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,476
Divorced couples
are more distant than strangers.

101
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,397
-Is this right?
-This isn't your first rodeo.

102
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,401
What did you say when you heard
Hyun-woo was marrying into that family?

103
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,944
"Is this right?"

104
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,696
And when he decided to divorce?

105
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,031
"Is this right?"

106
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:05,326
And when he first brought
his in-laws to stay here,

107
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,369
didn't you say the same thing?

108
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,287
I did.

109
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,206
"Is this right? Is this wrong?"

110
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,167
There's no point in worrying.
Life will take its course.

111
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,294
-Let them be.
-You're right.

112
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,297
Honey, have you seen his eyes lately?

113
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,342
There's no turning back for him now.

114
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,595
No one can stop him.

115
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,097
Then stop it already.

116
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,184
-What?
-Stop calling him.

117
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,101
Okay.

118
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,621
MISSED CALLS
FATHER

119
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,002
What? What's going on?

120
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,797
Hey.

121
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,132
-You're up.
-What have you done to me?

122
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,676
What is this?

123
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,178
God, you're noisy. Go back to sleep, okay?

124
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,558
I'll light up a briquette
to keep you warm while you sleep.

125
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,117
Why are we here?

126
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,746
-I want to see my Grandfather.
-You're wet and cold. Get changed first.

127
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,623
And let's eat.

128
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,294
That's not why I'm here.

129
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,045
That's why I brought you here.

130
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,717
Get changed and eat with me.

131
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
Then you can see him.

132
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,658
-Is the steak almost ready?
-Yes, sir. I made yuzu salad.

133
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,535
It's her favorite.

134
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,413
Good. I'll pick the wine.

135
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,873
As for the plate…

136
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,543
This one.

137
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,878
-Okay.
-And for the wine…

138
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:24,965
Use this.

139
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,364
MR. PYEON

140
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,242
-What is it?
-I got rid of Mr. Baek.

141
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,914
-Are you sure?
-Yes. What should I do now?

142
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,334
Don't call me and lie low for now.

143
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,336
-The money and the plane ticket?
-You'll get it.

144
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,464
But they'll suspect us
if we meet or I pay you now.

145
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,757
Wait until I call you.

146
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,595
POWER OFF

147
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,195
Put some more flowers.

148
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,738
Yes, sir.

149
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,123
How does it feel to be back home?

150
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,334
It doesn't feel like home.

151
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,212
This is your favorite wine.

152
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,964
-Right?
-No thanks.

153
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,465
Are you sure?

154
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,843
The steak is good. Try it.

155
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,345
I don't have an appetite.

156
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,472
You said you were hungry.

157
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,849
I was,

158
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,268
but not anymore.

159
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,519
Let's go now.

160
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,147
Go where?

161
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,944
Give me some time.

162
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,239
-For what?
-So I can clear up the misunderstanding.

163
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,490
What misunderstanding?

164
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,077
You said

165
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,372
that I pushed you
into a ditch only to save you.

166
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,375
But that's not true.

167
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,671
Do you recognize this?

168
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,339
What's that?

169
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
It belonged to you a long time ago.

170
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,642
Why do you have it?

171
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,737
Don't tell me…

172
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,947
-That was you?
-It was.

173
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,660
Was that when we first met?

174
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,163
No, it was before that.

175
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,207
Before?

176
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,792
When?

177
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,013
You were the one who saved me?

178
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,100
Yes, I was the one who saved you

179
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,309
from drowning that day.

180
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,561
What are you doing?

181
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,150
I couldn't sleep,
so I was looking at some old albums.

182
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,235
Can I join you?

183
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,612
Of course. Please sit.

184
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,036
Goodness, is this Hyun-woo?

185
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,955
Yes.

186
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,793
Gosh, he was always handsome.

187
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,380
He was. Not everyone knew his name,

188
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,382
but they all knew the cute son

189
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,591
of the pear tree house.

190
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,178
You're blessed
with a handsome and smart son.

191
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,015
Yes. He's good at boxing and swimming too.

192
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,184
Right. Look here.

193
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,478
He even went to
a children's Marine Corps Camp.

194
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,398
He once even saved a kid from drowning.

195
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,574
What is it?

196
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,367
I think

197
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,413
I recognize this beach.

198
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,998
Why were you there?

199
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,126
To see my mother.
That's when I saw you drowning.

200
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,545
-Really?
-Yes.

201
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:36,258
It was me who met you
and developed feelings for you first.

202
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,723
I didn't know.

203
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,601
You should've told me.

204
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,772
My mother abandoned me
at an orphanage to keep her secret.

205
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,150
So I couldn't say anything.

206
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,195
-It must've been hard.
-It was. So…

207
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,239
eat with me.

208
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,118
I've always wanted to eat with you

209
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,411
at this table.

210
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,873
Hyun-woo reluctantly
ate with you every day.

211
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,542
But this has always been my wish.

212
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,547
So don't look at me that way.

213
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:19,843
Let's eat.

214
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,492
-Is that really her?
-Gosh.

215
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,916
Let me have some time with him.

216
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,363
Grandfather.

217
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,156
Do you…

218
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,325
recognize me?

219
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,874
Have you gone insane?

220
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,210
How dare you let her in?
Is she in there alone?

221
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,463
-Let her be.
-Are you a saint?

222
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,549
She humiliated you in front of everyone.

223
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,384
Move!

224
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,720
She's with a geezer
who's not in his right mind.

225
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,471
-What could happen?
-Let go.

226
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,857
-Long time no see.
-I guess.

227
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,608
-Has it been a month?
-I heard.

228
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,028
I'm sorry you're sick at such a young age.

229
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,238
That's why I'm visiting my grandfather.

230
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,449
-Because I might die at any time.
-Hae-in.

231
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,368
What are you trying to find out
when you're dying anyway?

232
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,203
What are you afraid I'd find out?

233
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,374
This is exactly why
he entrusted me with everything.

234
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,210
He was afraid his family
would scheme something at times like this

235
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,129
-and only trusted me!
-Talk all you want.

236
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,256
We both know

237
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,883
-that you're lying.
-What?

238
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:27,095
You only have the power of attorney
as long as he's alive.

239
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,764
So I trust

240
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,725
that you'll take good care of him.

241
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,021
Since when did you even care?

242
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,356
All your family did was fight over money.

243
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,111
I know. But our family suffered
thanks to you,

244
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,989
and now we've become quite close.

245
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,575
But I'm not grateful.

246
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,453
I'll be back soon.

247
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,334
-Don't go.
-Let me go.

248
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,877
What'll you do?

249
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,007
Where's the main gate?

250
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,552
The main gate…

251
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,537
Hae-in.

252
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,298
Are you okay?

253
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,928
What's wrong?

254
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,853
Hyun-woo?

255
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,522
Is that you?

256
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,524
Yes, it's me.

257
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,818
What's the matter?

258
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,699
What happened?

259
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,576
Did you get beaten up again?

260
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,125
How many times must I tell you?

261
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,169
I don't get beaten up.

262
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,756
I can even handle three guys at once.

263
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,982
Seeing how arrogant you are,

264
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,526
you must be Hyun-woo.

265
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,841
Can you excuse me?

266
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,643
What happened?
I thought you got rid of him.

267
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,146
Exactly. You shouldn't have done that.

268
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,188
Done what?

269
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,232
-Come on.
-Check first.

270
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,026
-What?
-You can kill me

271
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,737
after five minutes,
and it won't make a difference.

272
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,115
So call the person
who hired you to kill me

273
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,118
and see if they keep their promise.

274
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,966
I got rid of Mr. Baek.

275
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,135
-Are you sure?
-Yes. What should I do now?

276
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,595
Don't call me and lie low for now.

277
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,597
-The money and the plane ticket?
-You'll get it.

278
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,141
But they'll suspect us
if we meet or I pay you now.

279
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,559
Wait until I call you.

280
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,269
Hello? Wait, listen--

281
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,104
Damn it.

282
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:29,939
MR. YOON EUN-SUNG 2

283
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,693
The number you have dialed is unavailable…

284
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,363
This asshole.

285
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,371
You're just a real estate scammer for now.

286
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,206
But you'll become a killer
once you kill me.

287
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,749
Don't pull one on me.

288
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,794
The police are still investigating
your assault case on me.

289
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,089
But if I die, that case
will turn into attempted murder.

290
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,091
You'll become a suspect

291
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,301
and get additional punishment
for planning it.

292
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,512
Then Interpol will put you
on their Red Notice,

293
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,055
their highest wanted list.

294
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,724
I told you to shut up.

295
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:10,230
You'll get at least 20 years for planning
a revenge killing and fleeing.

296
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,941
But if you don't kill me,

297
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,319
you'll only get three years for the fraud.

298
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:20,407
You could even get probation if I convince
the landowners to settle the case.

299
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,119
So? I'll put everything aside
if you stop here.

300
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,204
So you just let him go?

301
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,331
-Are you stupid?
-Yes, I was.

302
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,624
Pay me right now.

303
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:33,253
Or I'll tell the police
that it was you who hired me.

304
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,514
This is where I've been staying.

305
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,868
Gosh, you startled me!

306
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,750
It's okay. Don't clean up.

307
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,877
I've just been too busy.

308
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,049
I wondered where you were staying
after the divorce.

309
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,801
You were here.

310
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:23,845
Well…

311
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,639
Has it been uncomfortable?

312
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,184
Well…

313
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,312
No, it's a good place.

314
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,398
It was newly built and fully furnished.

315
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,245
Why did you sleep on the sofa?

316
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,497
Well…

317
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,917
You know I sleep well.

318
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,003
I can sleep

319
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,255
wherever I put my head down.

320
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,218
I guess you could sleep well

321
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,512
after our divorce, unlike me.

322
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,223
-What?
-It was your dream to get a divorce.

323
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,643
Now that it's come true,
you must've found peace

324
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,728
in this newly built
and fully furnished place.

325
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,730
That's not what I meant.

326
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,817
It's okay. At least one of us
was happy after the divorce.

327
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,776
I'm glad.

328
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,824
I wasn't comfortable at all.

329
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,953
This place gave me sick building syndrome,
so I suffered from headaches.

330
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:34,123
And look. The living room
is right next to the kitchen,

331
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,126
so it's not easy to air this place out.

332
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,044
And most of all,

333
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:40,839
you're not here.

334
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,305
Isn't that better for you?

335
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,431
Not at all.

336
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,059
At times, I wondered how it would feel

337
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,895
if we had lived here as newlyweds.

338
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,941
It would've been nice to live
in a small place like this

339
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,778
even after arguing with each other.

340
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,994
My mind would wander like that,

341
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,580
and I'd miss you.

342
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,541
I did.

343
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,092
I'm hungry.

344
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,888
Really? I'll cook you something.
Get some rest.

345
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,720
This looks good.

346
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,138
Let's eat.

347
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,571
You're really good.

348
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,949
Why didn't you ever cook?

349
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,951
I never had the chance.

350
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,794
By the way…

351
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,713
Will you see other women after I die?

352
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,634
What?

353
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,346
Will you live with someone
in this small place even after arguing?

354
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,474
Will you make her stew and live happily…

355
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,435
ever after?

356
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,187
What are you saying?

357
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,356
Just eat.

358
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,359
Answer me.

359
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,570
Don't change the subject again.

360
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,405
Do you want to die before me?

361
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,032
You worry too much.

362
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,491
Who would want to date me?

363
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,370
Everyone thinks you saved me,
because you're helplessly in love.

364
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,581
They're also criticizing me
for not knowing that

365
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,332
and leaving you.

366
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,792
So what kind of woman--

367
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,336
What kind of woman
wouldn't want to date you?

368
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,299
You're handsome, kind,

369
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,885
smart, but not arrogant.

370
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,596
Plus, you're a good cook.

371
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,182
There's no man like you.

372
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,561
Even if I was reborn a hundred times,
I'd still marry you

373
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,854
every single time.

374
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,202
How could you say such a thing

375
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,703
without even blinking…

376
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,498
your eyes?

377
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,999
It's true.

378
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,668
So why would I hesitate?

379
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,509
You know how to make my heart race.

380
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,826
Do you finally get it?

381
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,995
Hae-in doesn't care about you.

382
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,789
She's always using you.

383
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,499
I've always known that.

384
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,293
-Yet you still let her?
-Yes.

385
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,170
It's a habit.

386
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,799
I was always used

387
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,676
by you too.

388
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,856
You resent me
for abandoning you abroad, don't you?

389
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,694
Do you think I didn't know
that your adoptive parents abused you

390
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,155
despite getting paid handsomely?

391
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,157
Was it a coincidence

392
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,617
that those nondrinkers died
while driving drunk?

393
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,036
What are you saying?

394
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,624
What about the orphanage director
who mistreated you?

395
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:13,004
They closed down due to
a sudden fire, and the director died.

396
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,965
Was that a coincidence?

397
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,763
I never neglected you.

398
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,726
I didn't just sit on my hands
when those people caused you pain

399
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,227
or got in your way.

400
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,104
And that hasn't changed.

401
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,981
Being the chairman isn't enough.

402
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,443
It's my goal to make everything yours.

403
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,612
And I won't sit still

404
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,448
if anyone gets in my way

405
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,992
whether it's Hae-in or someone else.

406
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,871
Do you understand?
This is my way of loving you.

407
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,210
If you truly love her

408
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,463
and don't want her to get hurt,

409
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:01,093
then don't let her use you.
I won't stand for it.

410
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,349
Come on.

411
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,267
How could you get hurt again?

412
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,354
What happened?

413
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,564
I already told you.

414
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,317
It was a minor car accident.

415
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,987
My mind wasn't all there
when I was driving.

416
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,865
Right, did you get to see
your grandfather?

417
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,577
Grandfather, do you recognize me?

418
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,542
Lady, I'm hungry.

419
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,632
Grandfather…

420
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,598
Have you gone insane?

421
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,267
-How dare you let her in?
-Grandfather.

422
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,143
-I have no time.
-Is she in there alone?

423
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,853
Let her be.

424
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,438
Are you a saint?

425
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,731
She humiliated you…

426
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,317
Do you remember this pen?

427
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,610
You gifted it to me.

428
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,947
You even engraved my initials on it.

429
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,573
It can record sounds.

430
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,167
I'll place it over there,

431
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,712
so if you have anything to say, record it.

432
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,839
I'll be back soon.

433
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,466
He'll recognize the pen once he comes

434
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,592
to his senses.

435
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,886
He got it custom-made and gifted it to me

436
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,305
when I became the CEO.

437
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,848
It's something only we know.

438
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,522
What did Hae-in say?

439
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,858
I bet she asked about the secret fund.

440
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,695
Why did you have to hide it
and make us all suffer?

441
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,115
You should've wired it to me
if that was your plan all along.

442
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,160
What'll you do?
Take it with you when you die?

443
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,494
You fool.

444
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,582
You can't die. You're only barely alive
because of that damn money!

445
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,307
Are you sure you're out of it?

446
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,808
Did Hae-in tell you?

447
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,269
She's dying soon.

448
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,647
She has a rare case of a brain tumor
and won't live long.

449
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,860
Look at what happened
to the great Hong Man-dae.

450
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,989
You can't even process the fact
that your favorite granddaughter is dying.

451
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,199
Serves you right.

452
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,604
I'm strong.

453
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,189
I'm the best.

454
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,691
I'm a lunatic.

455
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,903
I'm a total lunatic. I'm--

456
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,621
I'm a strong male--

457
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,216
When did you get here?

458
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,760
I came after my morning jog.

459
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,514
You remind me of myself
when I first started boxing.

460
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,849
I like this attitude of yours.

461
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,562
Where are you coming from?

462
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,397
I dropped Ho-yeol off at school.

463
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,481
I see.

464
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,151
By the way,

465
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,529
does your wife work somewhere far away?

466
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,948
-Do you only meet on the weekends?
-No, we live together.

467
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,908
I see. I just never met her.

468
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,201
You see…

469
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,370
When we first got married,

470
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,206
my mom told her this.
"You're my daughter-in-law."

471
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,916
You're not my daughter.

472
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,085
A daughter-in-law can't be a daughter.

473
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,045
I hit Mi-seon.

474
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,505
Come on.

475
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,634
But you have your own parents,
and I can't do that to you.

476
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,013
We should watch what we say
and never get physical

477
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,222
if we're in-laws.

478
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,724
Yes, you're right.

479
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,559
So now that you're married,

480
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,227
-let's avoid seeing each other.
-What?

481
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,270
Seriously?

482
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:26,066
You can visit your parents or go on a trip
during national holidays if you want.

483
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,485
Thank you.

484
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,404
And don't bother
getting me birthday gifts.

485
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,282
It's uncomfortable.
If you want, just text me an emoji.

486
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,829
Don't you think that's too little?

487
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,749
Shut up. However, I have one condition.

488
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,210
My son has many flaws,

489
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,961
and there's nothing I can do.

490
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,756
You can try to fix him,
but don't return him to me.

491
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,924
Come on, Mom.

492
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,181
I'll do my best.

493
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,976
Your mother is so laid-back.

494
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,521
Thanks to her,
my wife's colleagues all say

495
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,314
that she has the best mother-in-law.

496
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,066
I can see that.

497
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,651
Since my mom treats her well,

498
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,946
my wife tends
to turn a blind eye to most things

499
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,239
that I do.

500
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,157
That's how we live.

501
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,331
Hey…

502
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,084
-I didn't mean to brag.
-But you did.

503
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,669
I didn't mean to.

504
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,297
Are you sulking? Soo-cheol.

505
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,507
Damn it.

506
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,761
This is it?

507
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:39,515
I know you stole all their pricey artwork

508
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,350
-before leaving.
-No, I didn't.

509
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,018
I just grabbed a few.

510
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,228
Then I bought an apartment.

511
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,565
I know you stole
a golden Buddha statue this big.

512
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,275
No, I didn't.

513
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,485
You're not fooling me.

514
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,126
Geon-u, are you okay?

515
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,879
Hey, what are you doing?

516
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,800
I see. So he's your weakness.

517
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:17,845
Are you crazy?

518
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,930
Touch him, and you're dead.

519
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,557
Where is the statue?

520
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,768
I know you haven't sold it.

521
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,688
I already looked into it,
so don't lie to me.

522
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,653
It's in a private safe.

523
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,573
We'll go there tomorrow morning.

524
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,536
Okay. Good.

525
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,662
Good girl.

526
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,044
Hey, pour me some wine. Okay?

527
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,377
Did you sleep well?

528
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,004
Yes.

529
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,174
I like this place.

530
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,052
I fell asleep right away just like you.

531
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,349
I told you.

532
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,727
Do you want to sleep more?

533
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,686
No.

534
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,735
Give me ten minutes.

535
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,448
No, just five.

536
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,147
We haven't had
a nice breakfast in a while.

537
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,691
I should have some salad and coffee.

538
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,487
Hyun-woo sneaked in here last night.

539
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,404
What?

540
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,949
Goodness. How?

541
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,993
He knew the back gate's camera was broken
and came in through there.

542
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:10,911
I see.

543
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,540
-He's so smart and thorough.
-Not at all.

544
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,918
He didn't erase the dashcam footage
in the other car.

545
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,297
So I found out how he got in.

546
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,563
Why are you putting me in a pickle?

547
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,065
Have you forgotten who I am?

548
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,318
You're the defected heroine
who joined our side.

549
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,363
No. Keep this up, and I'm going back.

550
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,575
Ms. Moh will kill me if she finds out.

551
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,869
I'm close to locating the secret fund.

552
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,998
That's why Hae-in came here.

553
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,251
God, this is driving me insane.

554
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,504
Give me 3% of the money then.

555
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,714
Make that 5%.

556
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,674
Do you mean that?

557
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:09,970
I betrayed them,
and they're still livid about it.

558
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,431
Of course. You can trust me.

559
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,851
Don't smile at me.

560
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,770
Handsome men are dangerous.

561
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,158
Seul-hee is going to kill me.

562
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,618
Thank you.

563
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,828
I forgave you once,

564
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,539
so how dare you
side with them again like a rat?

565
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,792
Dogs can be pets, but not rats.

566
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,253
They need to be killed at all costs.

567
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,341
Return your car pass, ID card,
and company card before you leave.

568
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,762
Your greed could cost you
all the money you have, Grace.

569
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,806
It would be best
to lie low for your safety.

570
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,932
-Ms. Moh.
-Get lost.

571
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,476
No, I can't do that.

572
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,604
How can I
when there's a huge misunderstanding?

573
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:04,232
I make a living out of information,
and people often mistake me for a rat.

574
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,400
But what can I do?

575
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,194
That's just who I am.

576
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,365
A misunderstanding?

577
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,368
Then explain why
you brought Hyun-woo of all people

578
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:15,869
to my house.

579
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,540
Hyun-woo offered me a deal.

580
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,709
He offered to give me
10% of the secret fund.

581
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:26,088
So he knows where the money is?

582
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,839
That's what I was curious about.

583
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,341
So I agreed to help.

584
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,467
And where is it?

585
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:35,681
Hyun-woo offered 10%,
but I'm fine with 7% from you.

586
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,225
Don't mess with me.

587
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,229
Then a small building and just 5%.

588
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,690
I deserve that much.

589
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,612
Tell me.

590
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,534
He thinks

591
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,077
it's in this house.

592
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,341
-Could I be wrong?
-What?

593
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,386
I see some men
taking photos of me behind that wall.

594
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,971
Jeez.

595
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,348
I can't believe this.

596
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,808
I still got it, don't I?

597
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,393
-Let them be.
-Why?

598
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,729
They'll leave in a bit.

599
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,400
Did they leave?

600
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,319
Bang-sil.

601
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,364
They left.
You don't have to suck it in anymore.

602
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,407
There you go.

603
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,784
I think I saw them

604
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,036
-yesterday as well.
-What?

605
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,372
They kept coming by in a black van.

606
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,250
They keep taking photos of things.

607
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,004
Where did I put my pricey heels?

608
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,094
Hey.

609
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,471
We need to talk.

610
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,308
What do you want?

611
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,393
You took a photo of our house?
Give me your camera.

612
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,146
-We didn't take anything. Let's go.
-I saw you.

613
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,564
So give it to me!

614
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,024
Goodness.

615
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,984
Hey, are you crazy?

616
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,152
Hey.

617
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,364
-You hit me first.
-Yes. So what?

618
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,617
Do you know what kind of heels I have on?

619
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:24,206
They had poop on them,
and I'll trample you with them!

620
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,255
You scumbags!

621
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:43,558
Gosh, that hurts.

622
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,269
Hey, what are you guys doing there?

623
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,063
-Dad…
-What are you doing?

624
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,689
Help us…

625
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,025
Ready, set, go.

626
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,236
Cross. That's it. Cross.

627
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,112
Cross.

628
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,158
One leg.

629
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,535
Cross. That's it. Cross.

630
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,536
Yes. Cross.

631
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,538
One leg.

632
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,664
-Jump.
-Did you hear?

633
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,581
Jump! What?

634
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,834
-They're forming a Yongdu-ri Quintet.
-Right.

635
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,753
You mean the village patrol team?
I heard about the mysterious van.

636
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:12,671
Exactly.

637
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,006
Keep going. Repeat.

638
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,717
I'm going to sign up.

639
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,470
I've quickly grown some muscles too.
I bulked up. Touch it.

640
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,930
No thanks.

641
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,392
Quintet means they'll pick five people.

642
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,104
Being a part of it means I'll be
one of the five strongest men here.

643
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:32,524
Do you think I can make it?
I want to punch something and break it.

644
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,360
Do you suggest a wooden bar or roof tiles?

645
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,278
Soo-cheol--

646
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,988
I know it won't be easy.

647
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,532
But I had a good dream last night.

648
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,242
I'm feeling hopeful.

649
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,994
There'll be less than five participants.

650
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,378
All right.

651
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,880
We're done then.

652
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,298
It'll be us five.

653
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,342
Leave me out of this.

654
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,303
I just stepped down from office.

655
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,264
People might interpret it politically

656
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,142
if they find out I formed a private group.

657
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:11,396
It'll only spark a conflict
between the two parties.

658
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,232
I can't leave my mom's side either.

659
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,236
You always leave her unattended
when you drink.

660
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,490
-Why are you pretending to be a good son?
-Come on, guys.

661
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,618
We need at least five members

662
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,871
if we want this group to be funded.

663
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,788
Does this mean

664
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,458
I'm in?

665
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,543
Yes, it does.

666
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:35,879
I can punch this.

667
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:36,922
That's okay.

668
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,382
Becoming one of us means
it'll be permanent.

669
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,967
You can't back out later.

670
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,219
See?

671
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,680
I told you you didn't have to try much.

672
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,955
Are we almost there?

673
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,081
Yes.

674
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,165
Almost.

675
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,626
Shall we get out?

676
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,352
This is nice.

677
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,147
Everyone confesses their feelings here,

678
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,525
and no one has failed so far.

679
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,988
Your love comes true
if you confess it here.

680
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,324
And it's worked every time.

681
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,118
That's absurd.

682
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,038
Not only do you get

683
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,082
a beautiful sunset,

684
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:59,337
but the light also gives your face
a warm tone,

685
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,172
which makes you look more gorgeous.

686
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,299
You look beautiful

687
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,926
right now.

688
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,136
Is that so?

689
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,055
So will you confess your love?

690
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,227
It's actually more

691
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,271
of a request.

692
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,815
What kind?

693
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,287
A divorce withdrawal.

694
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,460
Asking you to marry me again
would be too much.

695
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,838
So could you at least
take back the divorce?

696
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,730
You remembered my size.

697
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:01,816
Of course.

698
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,612
But I should put that on you.

699
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,960
Get a refund.

700
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,716
Why?

701
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,720
You said you wanted to
marry me every single time.

702
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,015
That's if I was reborn, but not now.

703
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,978
Why not exactly?

704
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,897
Why?

705
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,572
Yesterday, I thought…

706
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,954
it was you.

707
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,207
-What?
-I…

708
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,292
followed Eun-sung

709
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,295
because I thought it was you.

710
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,466
It has come this far.

711
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,052
My memory is unstable.

712
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,054
I forgot where I was.

713
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,350
And in the end,
I couldn't even recognize you.

714
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,368
Hyun-woo?

715
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,020
I told you

716
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,772
that we shouldn't be together

717
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,566
if my illness worsens.

718
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,360
But…

719
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,197
that time came sooner than expected.

720
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,245
The sunset is beautiful.

721
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,122
You're right.

722
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,125
The sunlight

723
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,212
makes you look more handsome.

724
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,508
But…

725
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,347
are you even really Baek Hyun-woo?

726
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,729
Is this real? Am I not dreaming?

727
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,360
I can't be sure of anything anymore.

728
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,533
That's why I can't make any promises.

729
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:57,992
I'm sorry.

730
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,966
What's that in his hand?

731
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,593
The curtain is in the way.

732
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,178
It has low resolution.
Should I get a higher one?

733
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,436
Have you seen my mother?

734
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,895
No, I haven't.

735
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,358
You're not lying, are you? I'm serious.

736
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,444
What is he saying?

737
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,528
I'm serious too.

738
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,614
Hey! Yeong-song!

739
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,199
-Have you found her?
-No.

740
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,576
She wasn't in town either.

741
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,828
We should call the police.

742
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:24,912
I already did.

743
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:25,997
Good job.

744
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,500
You don't think
she's in the mountains again, do you?

745
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,211
-Goodness.
-The sun will set soon.

746
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,338
I'll check.

747
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,297
Wait.

748
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,801
I think I can help.

749
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,562
There it goes.

750
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,315
A bit more to the right.

751
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,359
A bit more,
and you'll see the mineral springs.

752
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,235
A bit more. Yes, there.

753
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,863
Go up from there.

754
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,615
More.

755
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,158
Keep going.

756
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,914
There's a peak called the Fairy Peak.

757
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,627
That's it!

758
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,222
There she is!

759
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,025
Mom!

760
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:38,778
Mom!

761
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,119
-Is she asleep?
-Yes.

762
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,996
Thank you so much.

763
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,416
I'm jealous.

764
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,458
Of what?

765
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,128
My father is sick too,

766
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,089
but I can't even take care of him.

767
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,090
Right.

768
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,134
I heard.

769
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,054
He was one strong man.

770
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:09,308
He wouldn't budge
no matter how much I challenged him.

771
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,896
So I kept at it.

772
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,108
But I wouldn't have done it

773
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,861
had I known this would happen.

774
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,906
Do you know
what the last thing I said to him was?

775
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,285
"I'll see you at your funeral."

776
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,959
This darn mouth of mine.

777
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,961
I should've been more careful.

778
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,010
I've never challenged my mother before.

779
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,930
Are you bragging right now?

780
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,140
My mother left home

781
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,768
when I was very little.

782
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,688
My father was abusive and cheated on her.

783
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,942
So I grew up without her.

784
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,112
Then she got dementia,

785
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,158
so I took her out of the nursing home
and have been living with her.

786
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,662
It's my wish
to argue with her when she's sane.

787
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,580
I…

788
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:15,291
I had no idea.

789
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,375
All of us

790
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,837
have burdens that we must carry in life.

791
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:23,007
Even those who look the most carefree

792
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,968
carry heavy stones in their pockets.

793
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,596
So…

794
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,848
don't be jealous

795
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,850
or blame yourself.

796
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,812
I'm sure your father knows
how much you care.

797
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,572
I tracked the truck.

798
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:13,326
It left for your house in Hanil-dong
from the warehouse in Gyeonggi Province.

799
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,285
What is this?

800
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,037
So all that money is at home?

801
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,955
That's impossible.

802
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,541
Even if an apple crate
holds 600 million won,

803
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,210
he'd need a total of 1,500 crates.

804
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:27,214
He'd need more than just a storage room.
It'd require about 100 pyeongs of space.

805
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,343
Could there be
a secret space in our house?

806
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,677
Or a warehouse perhaps?

807
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,555
We stopped by the district office
to check the floor plans,

808
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,891
but we found nothing.

809
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:37,850
Then what is this?

810
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,310
Last night,

811
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:42,063
Grandfather told me something when we met.

812
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,483
What is it?

813
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,068
Do you have something to say?

814
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,864
Lady, come to my house
if a war breaks out.

815
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,242
We have an air-raid shelter.

816
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,036
You can hide there.

817
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,955
He mentioned an air-raid shelter.

818
01:05:59,038 --> 01:05:59,914
An air-raid shelter?

819
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,207
In our house?

820
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,583
That can't be.

821
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,960
He was probably rambling.

822
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,670
We have something similar.

823
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:10,299
He told me about how he had built

824
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,259
a panic room.

825
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,928
You're right. I heard too.

826
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,221
But where is it?

827
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,847
We only heard about it.

828
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,225
None of us knows where it is.

829
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,061
Even the floor plan didn't show anything.

830
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,354
That's true,

831
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:26,816
but there could be a secret floor plan.

832
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,696
If the money was here like Grace said,

833
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:32,947
then I would've known.

834
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,033
All that money won't fit
in a couple safes.

835
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,828
Yes, and we also have that room.

836
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,997
You know the movie
with a secret room, Shock Room?

837
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,915
It's Panic Room, you idiot.

838
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,502
I heard this place had a panic room.

839
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,340
Do you know about it?

840
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,304
This isn't the Yongdu-ri Quintet.

841
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,222
It's a trio.

842
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:01,392
They'll join us for drinks later
after we finish patrolling.

843
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,729
Who's that at this hour?

844
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,647
Maybe they're those men
from earlier today.

845
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,650
We should've brought a Taser or something.

846
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:11,694
-It's a taxi.
-A taxi?

847
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,279
They drove a black van.

848
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,575
Who could they be?

849
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,453
Why would they bring
a suitcase here at this hour?

850
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,621
Isn't this what they say about killers

851
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,331
-on the news?
-Should I call them?

852
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,499
Should I?

853
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,706
How have you been?

854
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,918
I definitely…

855
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,378
had…

856
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,381
a good dream last night.

857
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,409
I'm sorry.

858
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,538
This is everything except for the money
spent on the flight and hotel.

859
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,414
I bought an apartment in the U.S.

860
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,916
but I'll get the money back.

861
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,335
I'll give it to you once I get it.

862
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:52,545
I'm truly sorry.

863
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:55,589
Do you even know

864
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,925
what you've done?

865
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,177
Giving back that money won't cut it.

866
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,762
-Mom.
-I'm aware of that.

867
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,514
I know it's unforgivable.

868
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,058
I'm truly…

869
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,227
sorry.

870
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,105
It's late, and we all need to sleep.

871
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:12,273
Go to bed for now.

872
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,358
Okay. You can sleep

873
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,110
-over there--
-Don't be absurd.

874
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,864
I don't want to see you
or that thing, so leave.

875
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,616
His name is Geon-u.

876
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,829
And you have no right
to tell them to leave.

877
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:28,789
This isn't even our house.

878
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:31,709
He's right, Seon-hwa.

879
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,298
So you're going to live
with someone else's baby?

880
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:38,757
He's my son!

881
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,343
I cut his umbilical cord,
sang lullabies to him every night,

882
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,469
and bathed him myself.

883
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,096
Geon-u

884
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:47,016
said "Dad" before he could even say "Mom"!

885
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:56,400
Get up.

886
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,748
But…

887
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,886
We need to clear up some stuff.

888
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,390
What should we call each other?

889
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,060
You know my age,
so we can't be like how we used to be.

890
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,561
I don't care.

891
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,396
I care. I'm older than you.

892
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,399
Do you want me to treat you like one?

893
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,443
Ma'am?

894
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,864
I didn't return
so we could live together again.

895
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,660
-Then?
-I came to return everything.

896
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:49,578
And Jun-ho--

897
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:55,918
That bastard is planning
to use you as his scapegoat.

898
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:58,671
Stop him, or you'll end up in prison.

899
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:00,547
So you came here just to tell me that?

900
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,010
I was worried.

901
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,973
I only got married to mooch off

902
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,184
of a stupid, wealthy guy.

903
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,525
So I didn't expect you…

904
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:22,820
to care

905
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,447
so much about me.

906
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,371
No one has ever

907
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,665
treated me the way you did.

908
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:37,084
I couldn't forget how well…

909
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:41,088
you treated me.

910
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,883
I couldn't even eat well.

911
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:48,971
That's why I'm here.

912
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,514
So you came here to tell me that?

913
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,516
Really? And once you're done,

914
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,101
will you leave again?

915
01:11:58,355 --> 01:11:59,732
I feel shame too.

916
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,151
I can't live with you.

917
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,068
No.

918
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,112
I must live with you.

919
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,616
I don't care why you're here.

920
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,535
I'm going to live with you.

921
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,164
I'll never let you or my son leave again.

922
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,585
Go if you want.

923
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,046
I'll find you no matter where you are.

924
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:22,963
You really

925
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:25,716
don't listen, do you?

926
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,511
-I'm older than you.
-Be quiet.

927
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,441
-So--
-Excuse me.

928
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,444
Have some of this.

929
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,653
Thank you.

930
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:47,738
Thank you.

931
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,616
She's my master's…

932
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:53,202
-She doesn't look like a mom.
-Stop staring.

933
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,412
I heard she made quite an entrance.

934
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,330
It was insane.

935
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,415
My husband told me about it.

936
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:01,919
She appeared in the middle of the night
while holding Buddha's head.

937
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:04,254
My husband was so shocked.

938
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:07,549
He keeps getting sleep paralysis

939
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:08,634
and waking up.

940
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:09,718
I told you.

941
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,304
Chun-sik needs some black goat extract.

942
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,263
Then feed him.

943
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,223
Really?

944
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,518
Is that golden Buddha really made of gold?

945
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:18,602
Pure gold?

946
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:19,937
Beats me.

947
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:27,027
What does your hunch say? We should decide
between "like" or "dislike."

948
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,404
-What do you mean?
-I mean…

949
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:31,824
We'll run into her often,
so we need to know

950
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,868
what kind of stance to take.

951
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,578
Will we welcome or ignore her?

952
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,663
Exactly.

953
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,206
Is it like or dislike?

954
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:40,874
We'll do as you say.

955
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,420
I'm not sure yet.

956
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:47,881
You're not?

957
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:50,259
I feel bad for her,

958
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,803
but something feels off too.

959
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,596
I need to watch her a bit longer.

960
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,631
He still remembered

961
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,050
my size.

962
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,514
A round brilliant cut?

963
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,149
Didn't you go to work?

964
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,444
Yes.

965
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,489
But I forgot something.

966
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,167
I'm going to return it.

967
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,462
-I see.
-I thought about what you said.

968
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:11,089
I think I pushed ahead too much.

969
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,885
I'll return it on my way to work today.

970
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,012
I see.

971
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,640
Today?

972
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,434
This isn't what's important right now.

973
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:24,269
Don't feel bad.

974
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,230
I'm really okay.

975
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,191
I see.

976
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,568
Okay then.

977
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:49,920
What?

978
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,047
What is it?

979
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:53,674
I just

980
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:55,300
tried it on.

981
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,594
It was a new design.
I wanted to study the trends.

982
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:00,931
I can't slack off
just because I'm taking a break.

983
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,228
That's true.

984
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,854
I liked the ring.

985
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,649
You know that rings suit me awfully well.

986
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,609
You have a good eye.

987
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:13,860
I'll give you that.

988
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:15,279
But…

989
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,698
it's just that.

990
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,158
So don't misinterpret my actions.

991
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,286
Wait.

992
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,998
Are you sure
you've finished analyzing the trends?

993
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:27,874
Maybe study it more.

994
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,627
I'm done analyzing it.

995
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:31,795
I'll get going then.

996
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,097
Hae-in.

997
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:43,890
I won't return it.

998
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,810
I'll leave it where it was before.

999
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,604
You need to analyze the trends,

1000
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,397
so wear it whenever you want.

1001
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,489
A panic room? Like the one in the movies?

1002
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:02,034
For when there's a nuclear bomb?
Where there are guns

1003
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,535
and years' worth of food?

1004
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:07,623
I'm not sure about that part,
but the chairman did mention a panic room.

1005
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,750
But no one knows where it's located.

1006
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:11,168
I see.

1007
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:13,462
-What about on the register?
-It wasn't in there.

1008
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:14,421
Ask the designer.

1009
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:15,339
He passed away.

1010
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,841
The son took over the firm.

1011
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:19,301
Then ask him.

1012
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:20,719
I did,

1013
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,720
and he doesn't know.

1014
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:24,348
I asked for the floor plan,
but he had none.

1015
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:27,017
I kept calling him
and now he won't pick up anymore.

1016
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:27,934
Really?

1017
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:29,645
What'll you do then?

1018
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,521
There's not much I can do.

1019
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,857
Someone else needs to convince him.

1020
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,984
Who?

1021
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:37,027
-You.
-Me?

1022
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:39,613
Goodness, we meet again.

1023
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:41,573
You never know the future.

1024
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:42,741
I totally agree.

1025
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,785
I've met my lifesaver again.

1026
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,371
Gosh, I don't deserve that title.

1027
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,333
How's the building in Pangyo?

1028
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,168
Good, and it's all thanks to you.

1029
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,503
I almost lost it.

1030
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:58,965
By the way,
I heard my friend here pestered you.

1031
01:17:59,049 --> 01:17:59,883
I apologize.

1032
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:03,095
I didn't want to get involved
in something complicated.

1033
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,139
No, I'm sorry about asking such a favor.

1034
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,725
If this panic room
was made for evacuation,

1035
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:12,145
air pipes and electrical installations
for ventilation and communication

1036
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,814
should have been installed.

1037
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,649
But I couldn't find any on the floor plan.

1038
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:18,193
How will we find it?
We'd have to turn the house upside down.

1039
01:18:18,276 --> 01:18:19,111
What's interesting

1040
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,738
is that his elevator
that connects to the basement

1041
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:24,700
was specially built unlike the others.

1042
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:26,576
His elevator?

1043
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,453
It never felt different to me.

1044
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:38,922
It has two doors.

1045
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,758
The back side is a door as well.

1046
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:44,428
The front door leads to the family room,

1047
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:48,223
but the back door leads
to a whole different space. Is that it?

1048
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:49,641
And that's the panic room?

1049
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,436
That's my guess, but I'd have to check.

1050
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:56,064
-Can't we just raid the place?
-There's tight security.

1051
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,899
We'll be sued for trespassing.

1052
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:01,361
But what if Seul-hee
finds it before we do?

1053
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:03,113
I spoke with his doctor today.

1054
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:05,282
His doctor told me
that he hasn't been receiving

1055
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:07,242
any mandatory treatments

1056
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:09,035
like rehabilitation or memory training

1057
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,871
ever since he woke up and returned home.

1058
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:14,249
He's likely out of medication,
but he hasn't made another appointment.

1059
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:16,626
What? I knew this would happen.

1060
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,253
What should we do?

1061
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,298
We can report them for confinement

1062
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,216
and enter the house

1063
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,259
with the police.

1064
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:26,845
And check out the elevator?

1065
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:30,432
Let's all go first thing in the morning.

1066
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:11,973
You're back.

1067
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:15,894
I knew it.

1068
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,896
You seemed a bit off

1069
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,566
ever since Hae-in came by.

1070
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,488
Do you come to your senses
every now and then?

1071
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:29,574
But the duration is too short
for you to do anything.

1072
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,409
You can't request help.

1073
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,661
You can't move freely.

1074
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,120
You have no phone either.

1075
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,248
This place must be hell, mustn't it?

1076
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:38,124
You're right.

1077
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,584
This is

1078
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,670
a living hell.

1079
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:42,754
And…

1080
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:44,965
I'm being punished.

1081
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,883
That's why I gave you that pill.

1082
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,803
So that you could sleep in peace
with no worries.

1083
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:51,555
So why aren't you taking them?

1084
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,431
Moh Seul-hee.

1085
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,643
Was this always your motive
for coming here?

1086
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,525
Then did you think I truly loved you

1087
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:05,026
or something?

1088
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:09,406
Aren't I just terrible?

1089
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:10,740
Don't you miss your kids?

1090
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:11,867
You can go.

1091
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,159
Just tell me

1092
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:15,954
where your secret fund is.

1093
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,376
There's nothing you can do
when you're only sane

1094
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:23,336
for a short moment at a time.

1095
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,838
Just tell me,

1096
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:27,299
and everything will be fine.

1097
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:32,012
Tell me!

1098
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:49,881
What's going on?

1099
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,341
Hyun-woo.

1100
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,635
Did you call an ambulance as well?

1101
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,887
No, the officer I contacted
hasn't arrived yet.

1102
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:56,972
Then what's going on?

1103
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,390
Did something happen?

1104
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,729
What is it?

1105
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,523
What's going on?

1106
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:10,944
Tell me.

1107
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:15,699
-Move.
-You can't enter.

1108
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:16,616
Jeez.

1109
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,410
Hong Man-dae, age 80, has dementia.

1110
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,079
We believe a cervical spine fracture
was the cause of death.

1111
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,832
He'll be taken to Daemang Hospital soon.

1112
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,751
Dad!

1113
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,925
Dad!

1114
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:51,693
Dad?

1115
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:53,361
Father.

1116
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:55,697
Father.

1117
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,574
We're here.

1118
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:58,658
We're here now.

1119
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:01,327
Dad…

1120
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,663
Do something…

1121
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:06,249
Beom-jun.

1122
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:09,252
Do something.

1123
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:12,130
His hands are still warm.

1124
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:13,882
No.

1125
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,300
What's going on?

1126
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:16,217
Honey.

1127
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,011
Sir.

1128
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:21,264
Please give him CPR or something.

1129
01:24:21,347 --> 01:24:22,891
-Dad…
-I'm sorry.

1130
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:24,893
Do something, please.

1131
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:26,644
I'm sorry. We need to move him.

1132
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,773
We need to move him. I'm sorry.

1133
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,816
-Dad!
-Excuse us.

1134
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:33,818
Dad!

1135
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,612
Wait!

1136
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:37,072
-Dad!
-I'm sorry.

1137
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,616
-Wait.
-We need to move him. I'm sorry.

1138
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:41,451
-We have to move. I'm sorry.
-Dad!

1139
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:42,786
-I'm sorry.
-Dad!

1140
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:43,912
Grandfather.

1141
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:45,413
Grandfather.

1142
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,667
Dad…

1143
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,837
Dad…

1144
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,256
Dad…

1145
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:08,228
A prominent business mogul
passed away early this morning.

1146
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:11,356
After beginning
as a shoeshine boy in the streets

1147
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,691
and building Queens Group
into an industry leader,

1148
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,111
Hong Man-dae,
the former Queens Group chairman,

1149
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:19,030
has died at the age of 80.

1150
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:24,744
He suffered a sudden heart attack
a month ago and had been in a coma.

1151
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:29,124
Despite recently waking up,
he had showed signs of vascular dementia.

1152
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:34,921
The industry is closely monitoring
Queens Group's leadership situation.

1153
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:38,883
Hong signed the power of attorney
to his domestic partner, Moh Seul-hee,

1154
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:42,011
which grants her rights,
such as control of his shares and house.

1155
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:45,181
However, due to his passing,

1156
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:47,725
her rights will become null and void.

1157
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:16,898
Due to Chairman Hong's death,

1158
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:19,734
his entire fortune will be handed out

1159
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:21,361
according to his notarized will.

1160
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:25,406
This takes effect immediately
without needing the court's approval.

1161
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,743
Did you get that?

1162
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,078
Pack up and get going.

1163
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:31,204
Shouldn't we focus

1164
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:34,207
on wishing him peace for now?

1165
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,336
We can discuss such matters later.

1166
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:43,216
He loved this house.

1167
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:46,719
Please give him

1168
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:49,514
one final tour.

1169
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:52,183
You little…

1170
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:07,425
You're blessed

1171
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,510
with a handsome and smart son.

1172
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:10,428
Yes.

1173
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:11,971
He's good at boxing

1174
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,681
and swimming too.

1175
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,058
Right.

1176
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:15,975
Look here.

1177
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,394
He even went to
a children's Marine Corps Camp.

1178
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,605
He once

1179
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:22,732
even saved a kid from drowning.

1180
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:28,112
-What's going on?
-Don't go there.

1181
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:31,699
-What's going on?
-Hurry up!

1182
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:35,411
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

1183
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:42,126
Hae-in!

1184
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,212
Hae-in!

1185
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:32,969
-Two.
-Two.

1186
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:36,347
-Three.
-Three.

1187
01:30:40,309 --> 01:30:41,811
Why did you go in there?

1188
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,105
Are you okay? Come along.

1189
01:30:56,492 --> 01:30:58,327
Su-wan…

1190
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:01,789
No, Su-wan…

1191
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,792
Su-wan, please!

1192
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:08,171
My poor son!

1193
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:11,549
Su-wan!

1194
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:14,427
QUEEN OF TEARS

1195
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:47,501
Hae-in. Thank you.

1196
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:48,669
It was you, wasn't it?

1197
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:50,796
I told you. I want her to live.

1198
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:53,841
I'm going to leave once I'm done here.

1199
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,301
Balsam?

1200
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:57,887
It signifies my excitement
and hope for the first snow

1201
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,347
that I thought I'd never see.

1202
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:00,848
This is…

1203
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,726
what you call true fate.

1204
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:06,187
You're going to ruin this all
just for Hong Hae-in?

1205
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,647
He took the bait.

1206
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:10,858
Keep Eun-sung in the loop
so that he'll feel anxious…

1207
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,361
Hae-in!

1208
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:15,613
There's something
I didn't tell you as well.

1209
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,495
