1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,985
FINAL EPISODE

3
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,854
Hae-in?

4
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,806
Please come out, sir.

5
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,809
Come out.

6
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,033
It's a male, 35. TA patient.

7
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,493
He's unconscious.

8
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,662
-Move aside.
-Coming through.

9
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,000
Will you marry me?

10
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,881
If we do get married,

11
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,509
you might be quite surprised by who I am.

12
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,262
You probably don't know this,

13
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,723
but my family is different from yours.

14
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,808
They couldn't be that different.

15
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,101
You're wrong.

16
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,688
You just don't know,
but my family is very different.

17
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,941
So you might become flustered
and struggle to get along with them.

18
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,068
Even if you put up
with everything and feel lonely,

19
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,487
I won't be able to side with you.

20
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,034
Are you rejecting

21
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,660
my proposal?

22
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,037
No.

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,040
I would've made it short if I did.

24
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,499
That's all that matters.

25
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,086
This isn't a simple matter.

26
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,463
But I'm okay.

27
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,388
If you're really okay…

28
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,894
I want to marry you.

29
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,898
I want to live with you.

30
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,574
What are his vitals?

31
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,076
His BP is 101 over 66.

32
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,160
His oxygen is 92%…

33
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,204
Let's say we get married.

34
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,830
Even if you don't side with me,

35
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,416
I can side with you, right?

36
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,670
Then we'll be on the same team anyway.

37
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,838
That's what marriage is.

38
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,175
Being on the same side
and in the same boat.

39
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,096
And… if the boat capsizes,
then we go down together.

40
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,932
If you live, then I live too.

41
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,060
That's what it is.

42
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,188
Is that so?

43
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,361
You might not know this,

44
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,948
but life isn't easy.

45
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,158
I was a victim of a real estate scam.

46
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
But you're an attorney.

47
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,619
I know, right?

48
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,123
You see,

49
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,500
professional scammers

50
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,212
are smarter than attorneys.

51
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,923
I was totally duped.

52
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,594
But in the future,

53
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,513
there will be many times

54
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,640
when I'm even more flabbergasted,

55
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,183
wronged,

56
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,393
and upset.

57
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,646
But I'd be very delighted

58
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,692
if you were in the boat I was in.

59
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,486
Even if we need to bail water out

60
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,115
and row all night long, I'd have someone

61
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,909
to rely on.

62
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,829
Shouldn't we marry someone

63
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,956
who makes us feel that way?

64
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,458
That's why

65
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,126
I'm…

66
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,381
proposing to you today.

67
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,044
Where is he?

68
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,672
Here?

69
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,299
Where?

70
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,387
Excuse me. My son…

71
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,305
He's here…

72
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,431
Baek Hyun-woo.

73
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,225
Doctor.

74
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,644
We're looking for Baek Hyun-woo.

75
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,145
Yes, he was…

76
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,396
-What was it?
-A car accident.

77
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,981
-Yes, a car accident.
-Mr. Baek?

78
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:39,982
Is he alive?

79
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,192
Yes.

80
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,111
His ribs and liver
were severely injured.

81
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,905
There may be internal bleeding
so we need to follow-up.

82
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,115
Thank God.

83
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,116
He's alive.

84
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,575
Everything is fine.

85
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,035
Honey.

86
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,787
Doctor.

87
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,789
Where is he right now?

88
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,998
He's over there.

89
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,752
-Hyun-woo.
-He's been admitted.

90
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,759
BAEK HYUN-WOO

91
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,741
Are you up already?

92
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,242
What is going on?

93
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,548
Did you do it?

94
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,140
Did you bring me here

95
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,935
against my will?

96
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,105
I told you I'd do
anything to protect you.

97
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,857
That's why you did this?

98
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,153
Yes, I refuse to see you
get duped and hurt by Hyun-woo again.

99
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:50,988
That's why

100
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,450
I had to use force.

101
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,537
Where are we?

102
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:00,998
Answer me first.

103
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,210
Why did you go there to see him?

104
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,008
You can't answer me.

105
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,518
How long must I be understanding,

106
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,728
patient,

107
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,980
and forgiving?

108
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,026
I don't want to resent you.

109
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,947
Actually, I saw the notebook.

110
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,910
Someone had sent it from Germany.
I must've written it before the surgery.

111
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,371
It looked like my handwriting.
But the details differed

112
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,998
from what you had told me,

113
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,291
so I wanted to check.

114
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,459
That's why I wanted to confront him.

115
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,169
Is that so?

116
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,256
But to be honest,

117
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,717
anyone could've copied my handwriting.

118
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,052
There's no proof that it was me.

119
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,055
It could've been all made up.

120
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,390
So?

121
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,060
You were right.

122
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,271
I was thoughtless.
I should've asked you first.

123
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,822
I'm sorry that I suspected
and upset you. It won't happen again.

124
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,699
So…

125
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,783
let's…

126
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,411
Let's go home.

127
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,375
If I was right

128
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,629
and you were thoughtless,
then listen to me.

129
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,007
Let's leave together and…

130
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,343
get married.

131
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,428
A helicopter will come at dawn.

132
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,472
I have everything planned out.

133
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,556
You just need

134
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,433
to follow me.

135
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,277
What about the department store?
I just got reinstated.

136
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,490
A professional manager can take care of it

137
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,200
until you return.

138
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:02,995
Is that okay?

139
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,381
Answer me.

140
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,637
Okay, let's do that.

141
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,146
Due to the snow
and the unregistered license plate,

142
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,065
I don't think I can track him anymore.

143
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,441
Not even the police could.

144
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,655
-Did you find her?
-Why are you here?

145
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,448
-Weren't you in the ER?
-Answer me!

146
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,658
You're a lunatic.

147
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,743
Go back to the hospital.

148
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,702
Okay?

149
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,790
Why did you come here late at night?

150
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,880
You see…

151
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,591
Hyun-woo just called me.

152
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,759
Hae-in disappeared.

153
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,430
-Disappeared?
-She just vanished into thin air.

154
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,308
He told me not to tell you
and to look into it discreetly.

155
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,726
But I thought you should know.

156
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,936
Tell Ms. Moh

157
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,312
that Hae-in is missing.

158
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,482
It'll be faster for her to find her.

159
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,072
I think Mr. Yoon
had something to do with it.

160
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,158
Your inauguration is around the corner.

161
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,244
I'm worried
that this might cause problems.

162
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,329
Okay. You may go.

163
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,540
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,340
I have evidence.

165
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,052
So touch Hae-in one more time,

166
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,098
and I will put you behind bars
like I did with Hyun-woo.

167
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,771
Hello.

168
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,442
I'd like to move the money I have

169
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,027
in the safe.

170
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,405
Mr. Yoon converted it all
into dollars and took it.

171
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,335
She's leaving now.

172
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,943
Mr. Pyeon's killer finally had
a change of heart.

173
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,737
He didn't specifically name Eun-sung,

174
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,322
but he did mention an accomplice.

175
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,865
I bet Eun-sung heard.

176
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,785
He's probably planning
to leave the country, right?

177
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:51,872
Hey.

178
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,251
Are you sleeping?

179
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,548
Hyun-woo.

180
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,137
Hyun-woo!

181
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,681
Hey.

182
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,268
I'm not sleeping.

183
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,649
Then you should've said so
or at least snored if you were sleeping!

184
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,986
You just ran away from the ER.
Imagine how terrified I was.

185
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,071
I'm not going to die. Don't worry.

186
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,656
This is driving me nuts.

187
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,535
Hey, I'm a divorce attorney.

188
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,953
I know.

189
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,956
Divorce isn't favorable,
but all my clients say

190
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,418
that they're divorcing
to have a happier future.

191
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,212
In short, I have great pride
in helping those

192
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,964
who want to live better lives.

193
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,883
-So?
-But you're different.

194
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,634
You don't care about yourself.

195
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,637
You're digging your own grave.

196
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,099
-Yang-gi--
-Just be yourself.

197
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,852
Don't talk in a low, affectionate voice.

198
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,816
Thank you
for always being by my side.

199
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,946
Don't act so differently.

200
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,324
You're a good friend.

201
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,242
Don't compliment me!

202
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,828
Are you really dying or what?

203
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,595
Where are we?

204
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,888
It's our hunting ground.

205
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,933
-Our villa is here.
-Should I call the police?

206
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,477
I'll call you after I go in and check.

207
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,645
Call them then.

208
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,271
Hey.

209
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,398
You're going by yourself? Hey!

210
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,878
RESTRICTED AREA

211
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,079
Down that way
is a side door to the kitchen.

212
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,539
We'd transport ingredients

213
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,874
through that door
when the chairman visited.

214
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,543
Thank you.

215
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,670
By the way, is something going on?

216
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,674
Vehicles have been coming by
and transporting things.

217
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,633
I see.

218
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,886
Don't worry about it.

219
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,598
I'll explain everything
once the dust settles.

220
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,897
Why are you here?

221
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,819
Where's my money? Is it here?

222
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,487
I thought

223
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,365
you came to say goodbye

224
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,783
since I'll be leaving.

225
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,831
You can leave if you want,
but give me my money and the file.

226
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,083
What file?

227
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:26,962
I see.

228
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,717
The proof that you killed the chairman?

229
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,595
Were you really worried
that I'd expose you?

230
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,140
You know me.

231
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,811
I was always good at keeping secrets.

232
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,992
Thank you.

233
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,538
I left something behind.

234
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,705
You go ahead.

235
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,541
All right.

236
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,680
Why are you here?

237
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,933
-To see you.
-What if someone sees you?

238
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,727
I'll be there soon. Be patient.

239
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,982
Take a taxi back.

240
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,943
Mom.

241
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,904
Don't get caught.

242
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,994
Su-wan!

243
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,203
-Su-wan!
-Su-wan!

244
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,246
Su-wan!

245
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,289
Oh, no!

246
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,666
Su-wan!

247
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,961
Su-wan!

248
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,379
-Su-wan!
-Su-wan!

249
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,971
-What's going on?
-There's been an accident!

250
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:41,889
Oh, no!

251
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,015
Where are the kids?

252
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,266
Please wait.

253
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,727
Please hurry and save them!

254
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,748
Don't go there.

255
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,292
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

256
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,878
-What's happening?
-What's going on?

257
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,592
Why haven't you left?

258
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,012
Is he dead?

259
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,434
You broke the boat.

260
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,810
I saw it.

261
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,770
But Mom.

262
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,231
We can only live together if they die.

263
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,608
That's why I didn't tell anyone.

264
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,278
I thought doing that

265
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,280
would mean you'd come to me soon.

266
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,865
So I waited.

267
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,909
You probably don't know

268
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,411
how agonizing it is to wait
for someone who'll never come.

269
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,996
You're right. I don't.

270
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,707
If Hae-in had also died back then,

271
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,419
you wouldn't have disrupted
my plan in this manner.

272
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,296
That's my only regret.

273
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,760
So where's the file?

274
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,556
It's in my drawer.

275
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,851
-The passcode is your birthday.
-And the money?

276
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,186
Why?

277
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,564
You said to protect myself
with that money.

278
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,317
You said that was your way of loving me!

279
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,240
Wait.

280
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,309
Hae-in.

281
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,935
Hae-in!

282
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,730
Hae-in. Where is she?

283
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,695
What's wrong?

284
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,533
What's with your face? Did you get hurt?

285
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,744
I'm okay.

286
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,995
You don't look okay.

287
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,790
Lean onto me, okay?

288
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,792
It's okay.

289
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,836
Go straight to reach the main gate.

290
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,254
My friend is waiting there.

291
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,589
Go first. I'll be there soon.

292
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,257
What do you take me for?

293
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,803
Was I the selfish type
who'd leave my rescuer behind?

294
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,763
That's not what--

295
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,431
And I know everything.

296
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,392
I know what you meant to me.

297
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,687
I regret suspecting you.

298
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,439
I'll apologize properly later.

299
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,569
Just grab onto me.

300
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,698
We're in the same boat tonight.

301
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,409
We'll be moving together.

302
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,274
Over here!

303
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,058
Why are you with him?

304
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,895
Come to me.

305
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,104
If you do,

306
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,066
I'll turn a blind eye to everything.

307
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,652
We agreed to leave together!

308
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,111
I'm sorry,

309
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,447
but that won't happen.

310
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,909
I felt uneasy and disliked you
even when I couldn't remember anything.

311
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,119
And now, I know why.

312
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,332
Why do I make you feel uneasy?

313
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,669
Tell me. Why don't you like me?

314
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:50,215
My life was ruined because of you,
yet I still tried my best! So why?

315
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,217
Eun-sung! That's enough!

316
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,636
-It's all over now!
-Shut up! It's not over!

317
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,478
It's okay.

318
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,314
It's not too late, Hae-in.

319
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
Let's go. Okay?

320
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,776
Snap out of it!

321
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,236
I won't go. Over my dead body.

322
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,366
Really?

323
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,664
Over your dead body?

324
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,679
Really?

325
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,682
-Eun-sung!
-Drop the rifle right now!

326
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,267
We'll fire if you don't!

327
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,396
I'm sorry, Hae-in.

328
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,280
But I can't leave you here.

329
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,115
I'm going…

330
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,120
to take you with me
even if I have to kill you.

331
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:03,890
No…

332
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,892
Mr. Baek.

333
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,937
Mr. Baek.

334
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,648
Mr. Baek, open your eyes. Please?

335
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,735
Mr. Baek, no!

336
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,196
Please wake up! Please?

337
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,989
Help us!

338
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,162
Hyun-woo!

339
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,040
Baek Hyun-woo!

340
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,482
We'll take him to a major trauma center.

341
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,900
Tell them a man was shot

342
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,445
-and needs urgent surgery immediately.
-Yes, sir.

343
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,539
His bleeding won't stop.

344
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,915
Inform the hospital!

345
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,042
His BP is 80 over 50. It's dropping!

346
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,128
Sir, I'll press down on your wound.

347
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,883
Mr. Baek.

348
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,552
Open your eyes.

349
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,305
Okay?

350
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,308
We're taking you to a hospital.
You'll be okay.

351
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,310
Hang in there.

352
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,396
I'm…

353
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:39,986
okay.

354
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,628
Don't cry.

355
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,472
Don't go anywhere.

356
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,974
I'm not going anywhere.

357
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,891
I'll be waiting.

358
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,060
Don't worry about me.

359
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,604
See you after the surgery.

360
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,582
You won't go anywhere, right?

361
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,628
What if I don't remember anything
or recognize you?

362
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,256
What if I mistreat you?

363
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,633
It won't be my first rodeo.

364
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,510
That won't matter at all.

365
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,470
Just get the surgery

366
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,764
and come back.

367
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,393
Make sure you come back.

368
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,437
I'll be back.

369
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,024
Please take care of me when I return.

370
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,196
That's exactly what I did.

371
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,450
I forgot who he was.

372
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,453
I treated him like a stranger.

373
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,788
I mistreated him…

374
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,709
so much.

375
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,711
Did something happen?

376
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,004
I heard a ruckus.

377
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,214
-Do you know Mr. Yoon Eun-sung?
-Yes. Why?

378
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,841
He just passed away.

379
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,780
When will you return?

380
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,913
Mom!

381
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,874
Mom!

382
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,334
Come back soon!

383
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,920
I'll be waiting for you!

384
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,005
Mom!

385
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,507
Mom!

386
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,553
I'll be waiting!

387
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,930
Mom.

388
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,849
Don't go.

389
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,548
You're still up?

390
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,841
I can't sleep.

391
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,511
I'll wait a bit more
then take some sleeping pills.

392
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,096
What were you doing?

393
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,891
Those were happy times.

394
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,184
I agree.

395
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,103
But I only

396
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,563
realized that now.

397
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,738
Let's go to bed now.

398
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,075
I'm okay now.

399
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:24,705
We loved this beach so much
that we visited every year.

400
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,582
But we never went back

401
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,210
after that incident.

402
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,503
You're right.

403
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,633
Hold on.

404
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,468
What is it?

405
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,637
He's good at swimming too.

406
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,472
Right. Look here.

407
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,683
He even went to
a children's Marine Corps Camp.

408
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,310
He once even saved a kid from drowning.

409
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,068
What is it?

410
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:55,862
I think

411
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,657
I recognize this beach.

412
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,909
Yes, this was the place.

413
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,036
Wait.

414
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,080
Why didn't I recognize it?

415
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,290
What do you mean?

416
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,416
-I--
-Seon-hwa!

417
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,751
Beom-jun!

418
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,046
I have bad news.

419
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,016
Hey, sweetie.

420
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,687
Goodness.

421
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,730
Look…

422
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,732
We're…

423
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,526
Hyun-woo's…

424
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,320
parents.

425
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,322
I see.

426
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,493
I'm sorry.

427
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,459
I'm sorry.

428
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,383
What's going on?

429
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,427
The police said

430
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,764
he was shot.

431
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,391
Yes.

432
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,352
It was because of me.

433
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,312
He took the bullet

434
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,397
for me.

435
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,170
It's okay. Don't cry.

436
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,673
Hyun-woo…

437
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,467
will be okay.

438
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,973
So don't cry.

439
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,058
I'm sorry…

440
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,583
I had two sons,

441
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,086
but one died when he was little.

442
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,924
I thought he died
while trying to save Hae-in.

443
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,801
It wasn't her fault.

444
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,430
But I resented her.

445
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,268
I was pathetic

446
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,770
and stupid.

447
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,532
Do you remember
what you told me last time?

448
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:51,495
You said Hyun-woo
once saved a kid at a Marine Corps Camp.

449
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,830
Yes, I did.

450
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,415
A boat had malfunctioned,

451
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,959
and he saved a girl…

452
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,507
Both the location
and the date looked familiar.

453
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,802
I found it a bit odd.

454
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,734
I'll stitch it up.

455
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,321
His BP is dropping.

456
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,782
-Cardiac arrest!
-Get the defibrillator.

457
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,533
-Administer the epinephrine.
-Yes, sir.

458
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,335
I believe it was the same beach.

459
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,920
Don't go there.

460
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,506
-What's going on?
-Hurry up!

461
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,092
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

462
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,176
Hae-in!

463
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,887
Hae-in!

464
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,390
Hae-in!

465
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,194
There she is!

466
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,446
Turn the boat around!

467
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
Turn around!

468
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,909
It was Hyun-woo…

469
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,706
who had saved Hae-in.

470
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,179
Su-wan…

471
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,056
No, Su-wan…

472
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,560
Su-wan, please!

473
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,605
My poor son!

474
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,983
Unbelievable.

475
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,652
Talk about an intertwined fate.

476
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,696
I agree.

477
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,283
I was too overwhelmed by grief

478
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,994
to notice Hae-in in pain.

479
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,457
I never thought
someone could've saved her.

480
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,212
I had no idea the one who saved her

481
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,007
was with us all along.

482
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,010
I resented him, hurt him,
and gave him a tough time.

483
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,596
That's what I did.

484
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,686
It's all in the past.

485
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,608
Let bygones be bygones.

486
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,152
For now…

487
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,450
Let's just pray

488
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,537
that Hyun-woo

489
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,456
will pull through.

490
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,333
And…

491
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,835
once he does…

492
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,925
We just need to be grateful.

493
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,594
Right.

494
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,640
I'll do that.

495
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,285
YOON EUN-SUNG

496
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,714
Ma'am, I can't believe this tragedy.

497
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,594
How much of the shares
belonged to Eun-sung?

498
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,554
He had 15.9%.

499
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,972
Transfer them to me right away.

500
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,181
Sorry?

501
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,934
I just confirmed it.

502
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,771
My son is dead
which means his shares are all mine.

503
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,981
Yes, ma'am.

504
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,319
And…

505
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,698
how many additional shares
can I buy with the secret fund?

506
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,533
You could purchase 7%.

507
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,202
But will Pione Investment
want to join hands with us?

508
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,495
What's their goal?

509
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,748
They want to destroy
Queens Group, sell everything,

510
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,249
and leave with a profit.

511
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,210
Tell them that we'll sell
everything in a year

512
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,337
and let them leave.

513
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,588
They won't refuse then.

514
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,548
Yes, ma'am.

515
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,844
Eun-sung was the one
who caused all the issues.

516
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,262
They have nothing to do with me,

517
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,848
so they can't stop me
from becoming chairwoman.

518
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,267
Yes, that's correct.

519
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,102
My inauguration

520
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,313
will be grand.

521
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,694
We successfully stitched up the wound.

522
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,862
He lost a lot of blood

523
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,948
and was already suffering
from rib fractures.

524
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,493
The surgery was lengthy
due to the urgency.

525
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,536
But he pulled through.

526
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,415
However, he has yet
to regain consciousness.

527
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,625
We'll need to monitor him.

528
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:31,794
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

529
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,963
Thank God.

530
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,799
-You should go.
-No, we're staying.

531
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,967
-Hyun-woo.
-Don't.

532
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,011
Thank you.

533
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,143
So where's the file?

534
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,478
It's in my drawer.

535
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,147
The passcode is your birthday.

536
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:19,967
Come on.

537
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,721
Why aren't you waking up yet?

538
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,184
Can't you see that I'm waiting for you?

539
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,687
I was very worried.

540
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:33,605
I missed you too.

541
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,773
I feel uneasy.

542
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,316
I'm uncomfortable.

543
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,861
So please resign and find a new job.

544
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,404
I really don't want

545
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,447
to see you.

546
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,615
What's with that look?

547
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,618
You left me high and dry.

548
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,495
Do you think you can seduce me now

549
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,205
since I lost my memory?

550
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,290
Is that it?

551
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,253
I haven't apologized yet.

552
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,924
I haven't regained all my memory,

553
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,926
but I think I know why

554
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,306
my heart ached as soon as I saw you.

555
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,476
I get why I made up excuses

556
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,811
to see you.

557
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,650
The past doesn't matter.

558
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:23,071
What's important
is that we're back together.

559
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,618
So please wake up.

560
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,496
Hear me out…

561
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,167
and tell me that everything is okay.

562
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,465
I'm worried sick right now…

563
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,887
and I miss you so much.

564
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,853
I've only had water
for the past 24 hours or more.

565
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,816
I'm serious. I didn't eat.

566
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,150
I didn't sleep either.

567
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,195
Just watch me.

568
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,532
I'm going to keep going until you wake up.

569
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:52,244
You sacrificed yourself to save me,

570
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,914
and you still
haven't regained consciousness.

571
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,084
So how could I possibly eat or sleep?

572
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,378
You didn't forget, did you?

573
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,880
I still need treatment.
I need to be careful.

574
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,799
I might as well overstrain myself

575
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,801
and collapse.

576
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,723
I'm a bit dizzy right now

577
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:16,101
because I cried so much.

578
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,862
Will you still not wake up?

579
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,162
Hyun-woo, are you awake?

580
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,747
Mr. Baek.

581
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,965
Well done.

582
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,634
Well done. Thank you so much.

583
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:52,638
Hae-in.

584
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:54,389
No.

585
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,891
Don't try to talk.

586
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,352
Wait. I'll call the doctor.

587
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,526
Are you okay?

588
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,492
Come on.

589
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,453
You're making me feel worse.

590
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,247
Why are you still worried about me

591
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,707
when you almost died?

592
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,751
I'm okay.

593
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,594
Look.

594
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,598
I'm so sorry

595
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,351
that I failed to recognize you.

596
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,186
I couldn't remember anything

597
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,146
and only said harsh things to you.

598
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,356
Me too.

599
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,110
I forgot too.

600
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,365
I forgot how much I loved you.

601
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,659
I forgot how I promised

602
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,202
to be with you

603
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,540
through thick and thin.

604
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,460
I forgot everything.

605
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,882
I caused you pain.

606
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,053
I'm sorry.

607
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,101
And I love you.

608
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,243
Thank you.

609
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,384
Don't cry.

610
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,734
Hyun-woo.

611
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,611
Gosh. Hyun-woo.

612
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,447
-My baby.
-Hyun-woo woke up!

613
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,656
My baby.

614
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,116
Is he up?

615
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,952
-Hyun-woo.
-Are you okay?

616
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,995
He's okay.

617
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,997
He can speak well too.

618
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,832
-He spoke?
-Yes.

619
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,125
What did he say?

620
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,794
He said, "I love you."

621
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,254
Hyun-woo.

622
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,548
I love you too.

623
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,801
I love you, Hyun-woo.

624
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,260
No.

625
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,471
He said it to Hae-in.

626
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,974
I still love you, Hyun-woo.

627
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,727
-Dad.
-He's still in recovery.

628
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,728
He's still in pain.

629
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,979
You shouldn't hug him.

630
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:48,939
I love you.

631
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,982
-Doctor.
-Well done.

632
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,109
Hyun-woo.

633
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,945
Hyun-woo.

634
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,572
Well done.

635
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,161
Gosh.

636
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,121
A shootout in Korea?

637
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,665
I don't know if this is a company

638
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,416
or a drama set.

639
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,334
I'm so flustered.

640
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,878
I'd say this is more like
a historical drama.

641
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,881
-What do you mean?
-As a history major,

642
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,634
I see this as a battle for the throne.

643
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,386
They kill and spark a bloodbath.

644
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,554
You're wrong.

645
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,721
This is a melodrama.

646
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,348
Like The Dark Knight.

647
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,642
-That's not a melodrama.
-Yes, it is.

648
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,561
Batman goes through so much

649
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,812
just to protect his woman

650
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,230
and his beloved city.

651
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,398
Or even Titanic.

652
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,275
Jack sacrifices himself

653
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,694
for the woman he loves…

654
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:37,863
Whatever.

655
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,781
I'm not interested anyway.

656
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:41,908
How do you think it'll pan out?

657
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,120
Do you think the Queens family
will take back the throne?

658
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,163
What is it? Are you worried?

659
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,291
I hope you stayed in touch
with Mr. Hong Soo-cheol.

660
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,042
Is it too late now?

661
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,002
Of course.

662
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,838
Anyway, I learned

663
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,091
abstract nouns like love, friendship,

664
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,135
faithfulness, and loyalty

665
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,429
may not be visible,

666
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,097
but they definitely exist.

667
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:07,267
Plus, they're the most powerful.

668
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,778
It was too hectic last time to greet you.

669
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,239
I'm Hyun-woo's friend.

670
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,198
I'm Kim Yang-gi.

671
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,534
-I know.
-You do?

672
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,827
He briefly wrote

673
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,496
about those around him in his notebook.

674
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,539
I see.

675
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,749
What did he write?

676
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,667
That you were his divorce attorney.

677
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,710
I see.

678
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,128
So this isn't an excuse.

679
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,463
Yes, I was his attorney.

680
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,215
But I barely defended
and pretty much scolded him.

681
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,467
I tried to dissuade him

682
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,135
from divorcing you.

683
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,720
I see.

684
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,430
By the way,

685
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,766
-why did we get a divorce?
-Sorry?

686
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,894
I feel like you'd know best.

687
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,688
Well…

688
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,108
You fell apart due to your busy schedules
and decided to stay as friends--

689
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,611
Despite living together?

690
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,528
I know, right?

691
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,742
But I don't think
the reason matters anymore.

692
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,161
Sorry?

693
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,372
There's no point in digging into the past.

694
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:13,375
I think you should just worry
about the guy

695
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,086
who was blinded by love

696
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,755
and sacrificed himself for you.

697
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,843
You're a good friend.

698
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,762
Gosh. I'm flattered.

699
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,058
Even I didn't know
I was this great of a friend.

700
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:34,062
But the truth always reveals itself
in tough times.

701
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,230
I bet he felt the same way.

702
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,899
He seems to have finally realized

703
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,985
how much he loves you.

704
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,362
Don't compliment me!

705
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,656
Are you really dying or what?

706
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,867
You don't know anything, do you?

707
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,161
I'm going there…

708
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,957
because I want to be happy.

709
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,835
I won't be able to live with it

710
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,462
if something happened to her…

711
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,009
or if she got hurt.

712
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,346
You can never predict the future.

713
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,307
You couldn't stand her in the past.

714
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,601
But now, you're head over heels.

715
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,145
You're right.

716
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,065
Who knew?

717
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,087
Hey, Hae-in.

718
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,757
If you don't want to regret it,

719
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,467
don't you dare let Hyun-woo go.

720
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,224
I almost ripped through the paper.

721
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,726
I was in a rush.

722
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,271
I should've just focused on the surgery
if my life was on the line.

723
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,273
When did I have the time
to worry about him?

724
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,864
But then again…

725
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,577
I get why I was worried.

726
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,246
I understand.

727
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,245
I won't let you let go. I'm still here.

728
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,916
When did he read this?

729
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,668
What a sly…

730
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:07,549
Mr. Baek.

731
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,385
Wake up.

732
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,516
There's been a misunderstanding.

733
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,810
I didn't write this part.

734
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,687
My old self wrote it

735
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,314
in a hurry.

736
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,150
So why are you replying to me?

737
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,944
What? Did you smile?

738
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,738
I saw everything. Get up right now.

739
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,369
Hey, what is it?

740
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,495
Mr. Baek.

741
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,456
Why are you so cunning?

742
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,790
Who taught you?

743
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,629
Don't make me laugh. It hurts.

744
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,882
Then don't laugh and just answer me.

745
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,142
Should we just go home?

746
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,895
I think we should.

747
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:02,812
Honey.

748
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,899
What is it?

749
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,699
We should go eat.

750
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,577
-I just had a sandwich.
-That's a snack.

751
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,162
-It's not a meal.
-Right.

752
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,415
But my bag is still in there.

753
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,834
-It's that blue one next to the bed.
-Hey.

754
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,254
Your bag should be
the least of your worries.

755
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,549
Love is in the air right now.

756
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,092
Let's just go.

757
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,471
What do you say to some spicy fish stew

758
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,056
-near Namhansanseong?
-I'm down!

759
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,390
-Some makgeolli?
-Sounds great!

760
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,267
Isn't that really far?

761
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,644
Jeez.

762
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,646
It's still near the capital.

763
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,980
Hurry up!

764
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,108
We always ate around the suburbs

765
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,735
for those lovebirds' sake.

766
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,653
Goodness.

767
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,695
Well done.

768
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,364
Send us the hospital's address.

769
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,408
There's not much we can do
except send some side dishes.

770
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,911
-Hospital food isn't great.
-I agree.

771
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,913
Ms. Hong isn't fully well either.

772
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:04,791
What if she falls ill
while taking care of him?

773
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,501
I'm still envious.

774
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,546
She's taking care of a man
who took a bullet for her.

775
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,340
Plus, he's utterly beautiful.

776
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,637
Whatever. She doesn't remember him.

777
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,598
He's just someone she met recently.
Are you really envious?

778
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,059
That's the best part.

779
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,436
-What?
-Whether it's three years

780
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,480
or thirty years with your husband,

781
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,190
do you know when you're the happiest?

782
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,318
It's when you're first seeing each other.

783
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,988
When is he the most handsome?

784
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,282
When you barely know him!

785
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,827
The best part is when you're strangers!

786
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:55,383
You must take me for a fool
since I lost my memory.

787
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,469
What do you mean?

788
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,804
Let me rephrase

789
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,889
what you told me.

790
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,807
Not only…

791
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,811
are you handsome and have a nice voice,

792
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,022
but you were the top student
at law school.

793
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,316
You were even a boxing champion
when you were young.

794
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,984
You joined the Marine Corps--

795
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,903
The Special Guard Team, to be exact.

796
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,824
Exactly. So you're claiming to be

797
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,243
such a perfect guy.

798
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,163
Look here, Mr. Baek.

799
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,832
Yes, I'm looking at you.

800
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,629
I get that you want to impress me,

801
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,214
but you're pushing it. You're too perfect.

802
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,259
I mean… Am I that perfect?

803
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,971
Of course. You have
all the traits that I love.

804
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,100
Really? Do you love all of them?

805
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:53,858
I understand that you like me
and want to win my heart once again.

806
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,027
But you should be honest about yourself.

807
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,154
Don't exaggerate and tell me the truth.

808
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,280
It is the truth.

809
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,533
Be honest.
You were never a champion, right?

810
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,788
What is this?

811
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,707
I even like the way you laugh.

812
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,920
You know too much about me.

813
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:17,131
It's unfair
since I can't remember anything.

814
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,436
Father, it's me.

815
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,481
Have you finally forgiven me?

816
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,774
I'm sorry.

817
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,986
Father, the three of us
have finally gathered together.

818
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,407
Don't you worry anymore.

819
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,160
Now that we've reunited,
we'll take back what's ours.

820
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,956
We'll avenge you.

821
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,256
If you look here, she purchased

822
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,967
an additional 7%
from non-institutional investors.

823
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,761
Does that make her shares 45.1%?

824
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,681
Our frozen shares are 39.3%.

825
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,766
Will Pione Investment continue
to be on her side?

826
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,436
Judging by what I saw
in New York, probably.

827
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,396
Their goal is to sell the company

828
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,190
and leave as soon as they can
without causing a scene.

829
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:20,069
-And Seul-hee will make that happen.
-Then, we're no match legally.

830
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,654
She's the biggest shareholder.

831
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,949
She bought 13.3% of the shares
with the secret fund.

832
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,993
But secret funds are illegal,

833
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,287
and they should be returned
to the government.

834
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,206
I'm going to file a nullity suit for it.

835
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,547
Hey!

836
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,342
What do you mean?
Why should we turn ourselves in?

837
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,721
Hey, I've done my part.

838
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:58,065
Hyun-woo told me
that Ms. Hong will like these songs.

839
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,694
I doubt she'll remember anything
just by listening to them.

840
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,237
He's watched one too many dramas.

841
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:04,906
He's doing everything he can.

842
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,034
Also, a package
will be delivered from Germany.

843
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,828
Make sure she gets it.

844
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,164
Why must I do that?

845
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,175
This is from Germany.

846
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:29,514
I'll take it. Mr. Yoon wants
to check all mails sent to Ms. Hong.

847
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,354
Are these for Mr. Yoon?

848
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,563
I'll take them.

849
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,524
I'm on my way to see him right now.

850
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,491
I was their love messenger.

851
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,034
I'd say I atoned for my sins.

852
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,285
Didn't you hear?

853
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,287
If they want their frozen shares back,

854
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,998
they need to prove
that Seul-hee was behind everything.

855
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,166
We're witnesses.

856
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,292
You can do it then.

857
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,794
-Grace.
-Hey.

858
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:03,214
The most useless thing you can do
is to go down with someone.

859
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,967
At least let me mourn for you.

860
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:11,597
Grace, I don't want
to live like Eun-sung did.

861
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,308
Don't you pity him?

862
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:18,187
He was desperate for love all his life
but never received it.

863
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,731
Was there anyone with him
during his demise?

864
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,235
I want to start living an honest life.

865
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,778
No secrets.

866
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,238
No guilt.

867
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,239
No remorse.

868
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,199
I want

869
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,201
to love

870
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,078
and be loved.

871
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,206
Hey.

872
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,961
Do you think they'll take you in
even after you serve time in prison?

873
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,629
Who's going to prison?

874
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,306
EVERGREEN HOPE ORPHANAGE

875
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,267
Answer me.

876
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,560
You're not going anywhere.

877
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,728
Don't do anything stupid.

878
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,980
This is where we first met.

879
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,319
I barely remember. I was so little.

880
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,864
I was really bored here.

881
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,326
The other kids had hope
and waited for their moms

882
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,410
to pick them up.

883
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:16,913
But I had no one to wait for.

884
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:22,710
My parents didn't even leave a letter
or a note with my name on it.

885
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,213
They just left me
in an apple crate during the winter.

886
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,507
They definitely had no plans of returning.

887
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,803
Then one day, you appeared.

888
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,974
You visited once every several months,
and I waited for you.

889
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,396
Is that when you started
having feelings for me?

890
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,108
That's not it.
I could only have it when you visited.

891
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,194
Strawberry shortcake.

892
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,238
Da-hye?

893
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,658
Does this mean

894
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,161
I was your first love?

895
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,580
-Is that right?
-I was waiting for the cake.

896
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,124
And…

897
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:05,836
I doubt you recognize this.

898
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,130
It used to be yours.

899
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,550
Really?

900
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,928
And you kept it all these years

901
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,847
as a token

902
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,975
of our love?

903
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,144
This is our never-ending destiny.

904
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,062
Silly.

905
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,814
I took it from you.

906
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,821
I really liked the doll.

907
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,823
Carrying it with me

908
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:37,326
made me feel like
a rich kid who had parents.

909
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,080
It was so soft.

910
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,206
I liked how it felt.

911
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,001
I fell asleep easily even in the cold.

912
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,503
So I wanted to thank you.

913
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,130
But that was it.

914
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,132
You never returned.

915
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,968
So did you wait for me?

916
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,054
Of course.

917
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,598
The chairman gave out the same cake again.

918
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,898
But it wasn't tasty anymore.

919
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,282
Because I was waiting for you.

920
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,330
I waited a long time,

921
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,792
so it's your turn now.

922
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,046
I'll be back.

923
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,965
I need to do this to lift the burden.

924
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,341
Da-hye.

925
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,594
No.

926
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,054
Please take care of Geon-u.

927
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,099
I promise to be good forever

928
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,226
once I return.

929
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,229
I'll be a loyal, kind wife.

930
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,439
Don't be ridiculous.

931
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,609
Do you think I'll let you do this?

932
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:55,279
I'm going to hire
the best attorneys in the country.

933
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,200
I'll spend all my money if I have to.

934
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:00,493
I refuse to say goodbye!

935
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,412
I don't want to.

936
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,581
Soo-cheol, please.

937
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,920
Stop talking.

938
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,225
COURT

939
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,810
Eun-sung, the defendant's late son,

940
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:28,813
laundered 900 billion won
of secret funds through his shell company

941
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,815
and spent it on Queens Group's shares.

942
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:33,567
After his death,
the defendant received his shares

943
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,736
and spent the rest of the fund
on more shares.

944
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,239
She acquired a total
of 13.3% of the shares.

945
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:42,952
Our plaintiffs would like
to file a nullity suit regarding the 13.3%

946
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,121
that the defendant acquired illegally.

947
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:48,082
The defendant's counselor
may give their response.

948
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,670
Our defendant legally inherited
the shares and money

949
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,256
previously owned by her late son

950
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,590
through the law of succession.

951
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,301
It hasn't even been
a month since she lost her son.

952
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:02,346
It is inhumane for the plaintiffs
to file a suit against her

953
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:05,516
to take control of the company
when she's still mourning.

954
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:08,060
The defendant, Moh,
committed a two-trillion-won scam

955
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,396
in order to take over Queens Group.

956
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,232
She encouraged people to purchase
a problematic piece of land.

957
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,526
Once the construction begins,

958
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,444
we'll insinuate the licensing issue

959
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,406
related to altitude restrictions
to the investors.

960
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:24,368
She successfully made the plaintiffs
invest in the scam by fabricating

961
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,912
the business profit by fivefold.

962
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,873
Plus, she created a double contract

963
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,500
to make it seem like
the plaintiffs were behind it.

964
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:35,212
As a result, the landowners
filed a suit against the plaintiffs.

965
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,174
I'd like to submit related evidence,
records of the proceedings

966
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:41,010
regarding relocation of the army base,
the land purchase plan,

967
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:43,345
and proof
of the fabricated business profit.

968
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,222
All of these charges

969
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:49,018
are related to Mr. Yoon Eun-sung,
the defendant's late son.

970
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:52,563
They have nothing to do with her
nor is there evidence to back it up.

971
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:53,606
Your Honor.

972
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,691
My son and I have been apart for 20 years.

973
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:57,151
So how would I have known

974
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:00,487
that he had schemed all this?

975
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:03,824
Please understand that I am still grieving

976
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,118
the loss of my son

977
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:10,206
and can't elaborate any further.

978
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,544
I'd like to bring a witness to the stand
who will prove that she's lying.

979
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,050
I hid my identity

980
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:24,929
and married Hong Soo-cheol
like the defendant told me to.

981
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,681
I provided her with intimate information,

982
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,975
introduced Yoon Eun-sung
to Hong Soo-cheol,

983
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:33,062
and persuaded my husband
to invest in the scam.

984
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,565
Do you have proof that the defendant

985
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:37,733
gave you those orders?

986
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,151
I…

987
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,111
do not.

988
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,030
The defendant and I rarely met

989
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:45,074
since she was very cautious.

990
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,284
She made others give me her orders.

991
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:50,663
The witness is currently
under investigation for fraud.

992
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,706
Please keep in mind
that she could commit perjury

993
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,500
for a mitigation
of punishment, Your Honor.

994
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,212
Defendant, you may say
your closing statement.

995
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,759
Your Honor, what could I possibly want
when I've lost my son?

996
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,971
The late chairman
handed over his company to me

997
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,349
because he couldn't trust his own family.

998
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,059
He wanted me

999
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:14,144
to protect it,

1000
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:16,480
and that's all I want to do.

1001
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,159
Your Honor.

1002
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,869
I'd like to request Ms. Hong Hae-in,

1003
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,122
one of our plaintiffs,
to give a closing statement.

1004
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:34,665
She may do so.

1005
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:42,589
Three weeks ago,

1006
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,552
I was kidnapped and confined
by the defendant's son.

1007
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:49,430
That's when I overheard the two talking.

1008
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,473
The proof that you killed the chairman?

1009
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,851
If Hae-in had also died back then,

1010
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:57,354
you wouldn't have disrupted
my plan in this manner.

1011
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,439
That's my only regret.

1012
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:01,984
That's when I found out
that the boat accident 25 years ago

1013
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:06,155
and the death of my grandfather
was all related to the defendant.

1014
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,375
Goodness.

1015
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:19,918
How dare you?

1016
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:24,340
Hae-in, what are you saying?

1017
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,718
I'm innocent, Your Honor.

1018
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,475
Your Honor, the plaintiff
recently received brain surgery.

1019
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,310
-There's no proof.
-Yes, there is.

1020
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:42,441
This evidence will support her statement.

1021
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,830
Your Honor, that evidence
wasn't submitted in advance.

1022
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,207
You wanted evidence.

1023
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:00,084
I'll accept it.

1024
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,438
Wait. That…

1025
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,232
Why…

1026
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,922
Gosh, I don't know anymore.

1027
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:48,465
Is this it?

1028
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,592
I made a copy

1029
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:51,844
and put it back.

1030
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,429
She won't know that we swapped it.

1031
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:03,814
Your Honor! Wait. Please stop the video.

1032
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:05,065
No, you're probably not okay.

1033
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,193
That's what the drug does.
Ten minutes in the respiratory system,

1034
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,487
-and you'll slowly become paralyzed.
-You…

1035
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,990
You bitch. I'll kill you.

1036
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,241
You… Father…

1037
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:15,909
-Don't worry.
-Father…

1038
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,453
You won't die right away.

1039
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,746
If you do,

1040
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,040
this will be useless.

1041
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,085
I can only become your legal guardian

1042
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,506
and have a say if you're in a coma.

1043
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,466
So…

1044
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,342
be in a coma

1045
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:35,387
for two to three months before you die.

1046
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,097
Can you do that for me?

1047
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:53,447
It's… It's not true.

1048
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,364
Unbelievable.

1049
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,909
It's fabricated.

1050
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,243
That's not me.

1051
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,913
Say something!

1052
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:09,338
Please understand
that she needs to be arrested right now

1053
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:10,547
since she has a history

1054
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:13,592
of disguising herself and could flee.

1055
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,719
Ms. Moh Seul-hee.

1056
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,471
You're under arrest for attempted murder.

1057
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,265
You may hire an attorney
and file a complaint

1058
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,850
if you deem this arrest unjust.

1059
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,560
Why me? No!

1060
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,812
-Grab her.
-What did I do?

1061
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:31,485
I'm innocent! What did I do so wrong?

1062
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,028
What did I do?

1063
01:15:33,111 --> 01:15:34,071
I'm innocent!

1064
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:35,989
Let me go! I'm innocent!

1065
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,241
This is unfair!

1066
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:40,702
What did I do so wrong? I'm innocent!

1067
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,664
What did I do to you guys?

1068
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:45,666
Let me go! Hey!

1069
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,627
Let me go! Damn it!

1070
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,586
Let me go! No!

1071
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,756
The Queens Group's family
has been reinstated.

1072
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:55,759
The family filed a nullity suit

1073
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,678
against Moh Seul-hee, the domestic partner

1074
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,555
of the late Chairman Hong Man-dae.

1075
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,558
Baek Hyun-woo, the plaintiffs' attorney,

1076
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,851
successfully proved
that the late Yoon Eun-sung

1077
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,813
and Moh Seul-hee
were behind the investment fraud.

1078
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,440
As a result, the family reclaimed

1079
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:13,318
all of their lost shares
from Pione Investment

1080
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:17,030
and the joint surety.

1081
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,409
Those related to the fraud
were also convicted.

1082
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,123
A video recording
of Moh Seul-hee poisoning

1083
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:29,960
the late chairman was submitted
as evidence during the trial,

1084
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:31,253
shocking the public.

1085
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:32,754
-Call my attorney!
-Moh was arrested

1086
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,256
-for attempted murder.
-Call him!

1087
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:36,300
-Call my attorney!
-She's also being investigated

1088
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,676
for investment fraud,

1089
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,554
violations of foreign exchange
transaction laws, and identity theft.

1090
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,474
Hey, be quiet.

1091
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,602
You're being too noisy.

1092
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,104
Damn it.

1093
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,565
Let me go.

1094
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,191
Grab her!

1095
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,319
-Hey!
-Let me go!

1096
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,120
Hey.

1097
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,417
Stomp on her.

1098
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,881
That's enough.

1099
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,224
Where's everyone?

1100
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,519
Hae-in went to look at documents
before officially going back to work.

1101
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,688
And Soo-cheol… Well, it's obvious.

1102
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,439
He's bawling. Let him be.

1103
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:17,317
He'll be sobbing for some time
after sending his wife away.

1104
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:28,537
Okay. Here comes the plane.

1105
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:30,956
You eat so well.

1106
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:33,959
HONG GEON-U, SOO-CHEOL, DA-HYE

1107
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,795
Let's grow strong

1108
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,214
until Mom comes.

1109
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:42,801
-And Beom-ja?
-Beats me.

1110
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:46,805
She got all dolled up
and left after getting a text.

1111
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,849
Jeez, he's so spontaneous.

1112
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:50,684
Why does he suddenly want to meet?

1113
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:53,687
Gosh, I shouldn't have drunk yesterday.

1114
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:58,191
I'm so bloated.
Where are my double eyelids?

1115
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:06,658
Did you get lost?

1116
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,453
I purposely chose the highest building
so it'd be easier to find.

1117
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,538
You're right. I saw the building,

1118
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:14,124
but it took me some time
to find my way here.

1119
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,500
I'm sorry for suddenly calling.

1120
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,919
I liked it. My heart raced.

1121
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,052
I have something to say.

1122
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:27,929
I'm listening.

1123
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,232
Thank you.

1124
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,457
As you already know,
we are very different.

1125
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,502
Are you here

1126
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:02,422
to state the obvious?

1127
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:05,967
"I know you confessed your feelings to me,
but you're from a rich family."

1128
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,677
"Our families are too different,

1129
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:08,970
so it won't work out--"

1130
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:09,888
Beom-ja.

1131
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:10,972
Let me talk first.

1132
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,682
Okay. Go on.

1133
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,896
You've been married

1134
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:18,855
three times--

1135
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,106
I see.

1136
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,650
So that's what this is about.

1137
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:26,154
You're reluctant to date a woman
who was married three times.

1138
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,367
-I understand.
-That's not it.

1139
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,702
You've already experienced everything.

1140
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,621
You fell for others, dated them,

1141
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,748
got married, and everything.

1142
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,709
But this is a first for me.

1143
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,963
-What?
-I've never dated anyone properly

1144
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:44,631
even to this day.

1145
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,301
-Seriously?
-Yes.

1146
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:53,849
So it's difficult to walk at your pace.

1147
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:20,667
It was my first time…

1148
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,877
WAITING MEANS LOVE

1149
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,336
…waiting for someone.

1150
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,131
I've never missed a woman before.

1151
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,925
But then, I got stuck.

1152
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,137
Just like how I got lost today,
I don't know which way to go.

1153
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,058
Then…

1154
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:41,438
what would you like me to do?

1155
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,154
I'm good at cooking and baking.

1156
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:51,656
I'd like to cook meat for you
when you're struggling

1157
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,075
and bake madeleines for you
when you're bored.

1158
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:56,161
I'd like to do that.

1159
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:59,497
Why don't you visit me
when you're struggling

1160
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,583
or feeling bored?

1161
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,212
Okay, I'll do that.

1162
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,840
I'll just come to you
if you can't find your way.

1163
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:14,846
You can take your sweet time.

1164
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,898
Is getting a divorce a trend nowadays?

1165
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:27,067
Why do you want a divorce?

1166
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:31,321
If it's not about money,
women, or violence,

1167
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:33,239
then just put up with it.

1168
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,282
It's all of them.

1169
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,408
-All of them?
-All of them?

1170
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,409
Chun-sik met

1171
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,912
his first love at a reunion.

1172
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:40,580
Goodness. Hey.

1173
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,917
There are always first loves at reunions.

1174
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,419
It's normal.

1175
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:51,883
She works in insurance, and he took out
three life insurance policies.

1176
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:54,469
Unbelievable.

1177
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,596
-And he got violent?
-No, that was me.

1178
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,100
I hit him out of rage,
and he's demanding a divorce

1179
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:01,184
because of it.

1180
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,436
So? When will you divorce him?

1181
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,438
I'd love to do it right away.

1182
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,442
But our kid's midterms are coming soon.

1183
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:10,568
This is a critical moment.

1184
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:14,072
I thought of divorcing him
during the break.

1185
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,826
But we already booked a trip,

1186
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:18,952
so I can't do that.

1187
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,913
And once school starts,
the midterms will come again.

1188
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,748
-Gosh, you're right.
-Right.

1189
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:27,752
Then you'll never divorce him.
Just do it now.

1190
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:29,963
I'll join you.

1191
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,090
Join me?

1192
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:35,510
We'll suffer less damage
if we drop this bomb together.

1193
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:38,430
Let's time our announcements.
I'll go first.

1194
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,931
You can wait a couple days.

1195
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,267
Hey, are you serious?

1196
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:47,731
Gosh.

1197
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:49,691
I thought long and hard.

1198
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:51,693
-It has to be done.
-What did that woman say?

1199
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:53,903
I don't know. Her name is Jenny.

1200
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,115
She said she was his wife or something.

1201
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,325
That's what she said?
That she was his wife?

1202
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:01,953
Yes, that was the context.

1203
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:06,249
Your husband asked me
to relay this message to you.

1204
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:07,375
Jenny

1205
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,918
-is 60 years old.
-What?

1206
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,795
She's the same age as me.

1207
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,465
So he likes older women?

1208
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,216
That's not it.

1209
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,011
He left his phone at the laboratory,

1210
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:20,305
and his professor picked it up.

1211
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,557
Seriously?

1212
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,601
So she's his professor?

1213
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:27,437
He was frustrated
that he couldn't reach you

1214
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,230
-and asked me to relay this.
-Relay what?

1215
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,523
"I love you!"

1216
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,611
Why would he say it to you

1217
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:36,905
when he could've said it to me?

1218
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:40,408
He's never said those words to me before.

1219
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,077
You should unblock his number.

1220
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,828
Do you know why wars happen?

1221
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,498
It's due to poor communication.

1222
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,666
Why won't you talk it out?

1223
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,001
Jeez.

1224
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:51,503
Here.

1225
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,049
What is this?

1226
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:57,801
A gift from us, the building owners.

1227
01:24:57,884 --> 01:24:59,594
Go see him.

1228
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,889
Look him in the eye and tell him this.

1229
01:25:02,972 --> 01:25:04,140
"I love you"?

1230
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,267
"Me too!"

1231
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:10,605
Mom…

1232
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,525
Dad…

1233
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:19,072
Go away.

1234
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:22,492
Go. Go to the U.S.

1235
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:25,912
QUEENS DEPARTMENT STORE

1236
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:27,705
Secretary Na.

1237
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,958
I just got an idea.

1238
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:31,668
I'm thinking of removing

1239
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:34,796
these pop-up stores
and renovating the area.

1240
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:38,299
-I'd like to have a plaza--
-So that kids can run around?

1241
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:41,719
Yes, and I want resting spaces--

1242
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,139
We're going to make plenty of them.

1243
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:47,433
You already told me this
before the surgery.

1244
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:48,393
I did?

1245
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:51,688
I guess some things never change
despite losing your memory.

1246
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:03,283
Did you have lunch?

1247
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:04,659
I was about to.

1248
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:06,953
Enjoy.

1249
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:08,663
Enjoy your lunch.

1250
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,465
When will you get married?

1251
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,719
-Don't be absurd.
-Are you not?

1252
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:24,637
No.

1253
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:25,930
Think about it.

1254
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:29,934
He's like a stranger
I'm just getting to know.

1255
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,020
I like him, and I'm grateful.

1256
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:34,606
But our love temperatures differ.

1257
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:35,648
Do they?

1258
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,485
Of course. His temperature is about 180°C.

1259
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,156
It's hot enough to fry this chicken.

1260
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:45,700
Unlike him who's boiling hot,

1261
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:49,162
my temperature
is just enough for a cup of coffee.

1262
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:53,541
That's why it's too soon
to talk about marriage.

1263
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:56,211
Why do you ask?

1264
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,171
Is that what he said?

1265
01:26:58,254 --> 01:26:59,756
-Does he want to marry me?
-No.

1266
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:03,301
-No?
-No.

1267
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:04,969
He never said such a thing.

1268
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,930
It was just something everyone assumed.

1269
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,932
He still proposed, didn't he?

1270
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:15,104
I don't remember it,
but he did in the past.

1271
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,398
-I even have the ring at home.
-Come on.

1272
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,400
You don't even remember that,

1273
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:20,485
so it doesn't count.

1274
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:21,694
Did he not propose again?

1275
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,989
Seriously? That's cold.

1276
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:28,368
NEW MESSAGE

1277
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:34,958
Ma'am, the time has come.

1278
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,459
What do you mean?

1279
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,920
Director Baek made
a reservation at a restaurant

1280
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:41,256
where many people propose.

1281
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:43,758
Unbelievable.

1282
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:45,927
I'm not ready yet.

1283
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:48,221
Why is he getting ahead of himself?

1284
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:49,472
How can I reject him?

1285
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:53,142
I don't want to hurt someone
who took a bullet for me.

1286
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:35,518
Come on.

1287
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:37,395
He should call me

1288
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:39,439
if he booked a restaurant.

1289
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:42,900
I'm hungry.

1290
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,738
Jeez.

1291
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:47,780
BAEK HYUN-WOO

1292
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:51,909
Hello?

1293
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:52,994
Hello?

1294
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,205
I mean…

1295
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:57,290
Where are you

1296
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,584
right now?

1297
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,877
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1298
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,047
I'm having a company dinner
at a restaurant.

1299
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:07,759
Is something going on? Are you unwell?

1300
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,053
No, I'm not.

1301
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:14,182
I'm fine. Enjoy your dinner.

1302
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,355
A company dinner?

1303
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:58,476
What's that?

1304
01:29:59,393 --> 01:30:00,645
He's not a kid anymore.

1305
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:01,729
Get rid of them.

1306
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:07,610
Remove…

1307
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:10,530
all those glow-in-the-dark stars
and all the objects.

1308
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,343
How could you
move your stuff without telling me?

1309
01:30:32,426 --> 01:30:34,679
You never told me
you were emptying this room either.

1310
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,180
What are you getting at?

1311
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:39,934
Are you blaming me for the miscarriage?

1312
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:41,269
What are you saying?

1313
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:44,105
I never thought that way.
I'm just as sad as you--

1314
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:45,481
Don't lie.

1315
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,943
I know you want to say that it's my fault!

1316
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:55,324
Forget it.

1317
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:57,326
I can't talk any sense into you.

1318
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:35,948
I waited for you yesterday.

1319
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:39,243
I heard you booked a restaurant

1320
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,245
where many people proposed at.

1321
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:42,955
I was shocked because I thought

1322
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,166
you wanted to propose to me again.

1323
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:48,169
I thought long and hard
about how to let you down gently.

1324
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:53,090
So you were planning to reject me

1325
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,842
if I proposed?

1326
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,260
Yes.

1327
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:58,012
But you never did,

1328
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:01,015
so I couldn't reject you.

1329
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:04,185
I'm sorry.

1330
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,312
But why?

1331
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,773
Why would you reject me?

1332
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:10,066
Because I'm scared.

1333
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:13,778
We're on good terms.
I don't want to ruin that.

1334
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:21,953
But it's too late.

1335
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,873
I would've rejected you
had you proposed yesterday,

1336
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,125
but I've changed my mind now.

1337
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,506
I remembered my worst memory last night.

1338
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:38,177
It devastated and hurt me greatly.

1339
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,596
But I was relieved as well.

1340
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:44,892
I'm less afraid now
than when I was in the dark.

1341
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,522
We probably fell apart

1342
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,984
due to trivial matters.

1343
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:55,403
We said things we didn't mean

1344
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:57,446
and protected our ego.

1345
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,699
And that caused stupid misunderstandings.

1346
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:02,576
Instead of knocking on your door,

1347
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:04,203
it was probably easier

1348
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:07,248
to stay in my room

1349
01:33:08,457 --> 01:33:09,583
and resent you.

1350
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:11,544
But…

1351
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:14,547
I won't do that anymore.

1352
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:18,718
Then maybe we can give it a try.

1353
01:33:25,599 --> 01:33:26,726
Me too.

1354
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,519
I felt the same way.

1355
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:32,732
I'll never be afraid

1356
01:33:33,607 --> 01:33:36,027
to take another bullet for you.

1357
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:38,779
But I was afraid

1358
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,281
we'd become exhausted

1359
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:46,996
and disappointed in each other
after arguing over…

1360
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:50,708
the most trivial things.

1361
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,586
I wasn't confident
that we wouldn't fall apart

1362
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:55,588
or resent each other…

1363
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,592
once again.

1364
01:34:01,635 --> 01:34:03,387
But I can promise you this.

1365
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:20,821
I'll stay by your side.

1366
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,493
No matter what happens,

1367
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,249
I can mend things

1368
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,001
when they're broken.

1369
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:38,005
It may not always be perfect.

1370
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:42,593
But I can do that.

1371
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:46,222
If that's okay with you,

1372
01:34:46,722 --> 01:34:48,057
then will you marry me?

1373
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:54,355
Of course.

1374
01:34:58,818 --> 01:34:59,985
But…

1375
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,279
I do need more time.

1376
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,117
We're still in the beginning stages.

1377
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,330
So please don't rush.

1378
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,209
Right.

1379
01:35:15,709 --> 01:35:16,627
Okay.

1380
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:17,711
You can only hug me

1381
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:21,465
after we hold hands at least five times.

1382
01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:22,842
What…

1383
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:25,219
Five times?

1384
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,440
I'd like to have breakfast together
every morning.

1385
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:41,777
It's healthy to have breakfast,

1386
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,028
so that's fine.

1387
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:45,614
And taking walks every day?

1388
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:48,367
Vitamin D is crucial,

1389
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:49,785
so that's a good idea too.

1390
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:52,121
What about going on a trip every season?

1391
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:56,167
Getting good rest
will help us work better.

1392
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:58,752
That's a good plan.

1393
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:05,217
We'll have to be

1394
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,802
-on our toes.
-Why?

1395
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:09,221
Because life never unfolds

1396
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,098
the way you want it to.

1397
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,684
CORRECTIONAL WELFARE
THAT LEADS TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE

1398
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,617
Geon-u, why don't you go to your mom?

1399
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:39,418
Geon-u, do you know who I am?

1400
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,003
-Do you remember me?
-Yes.

1401
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:44,465
I'm sorry.

1402
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:47,635
I'm sorry. I love you.

1403
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:49,887
-Mom.
-I'm sorry, Geon-u.

1404
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,223
Geon-u can ride

1405
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:54,183
a tricycle now, honey.

1406
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:55,976
I taught him.

1407
01:36:58,854 --> 01:36:59,939
Let me show you.

1408
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:11,200
Well done.

1409
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:13,536
Come to the cafe.

1410
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:15,329
I'll give you freebies.

1411
01:37:15,412 --> 01:37:16,705
Bye.

1412
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,000
Geon-u.

1413
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:22,169
Is it really spring?

1414
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,421
Why does it feel colder…

1415
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:27,007
-What should we do?
-…out here?

1416
01:37:33,973 --> 01:37:35,015
Where are you going?

1417
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:39,853
My mom told me to pick you up.
We're going to eat together.

1418
01:37:42,773 --> 01:37:43,607
Me too?

1419
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:47,319
-Really?
-Hurry up.

1420
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,906
Ms. Kim is the best.

1421
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:53,617
-Geon-u, you grew up so much.
-She's my friend.

1422
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:56,537
Let's get a move on.

1423
01:37:56,620 --> 01:38:00,165
-Let's go!
-We forgave those we used to resent.

1424
01:38:14,346 --> 01:38:16,849
Look, Mr. Kim.

1425
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:19,685
Do you know the proportional theory?

1426
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:21,645
-It's when--
-Yes, I do.

1427
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:23,480
Time accelerates

1428
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:25,399
when there's little time.

1429
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:28,027
I'm aging quickly as well.

1430
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:30,613
My wrists ached yesterday.

1431
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:32,323
Today, my knees cracked.

1432
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,574
You should take omega-3--

1433
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,744
That's not why.

1434
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:38,662
How long will you drag this on?

1435
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:40,914
I didn't know you'd take this much time.

1436
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:51,091
We'll have our first kiss
by the time I'm all wrinkly!

1437
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:51,110
We realized that some things
won't happen even if we try hard.

1438
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:54,029
But even if that's the case,

1439
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:56,073
we learned that it's okay.

1440
01:39:56,615 --> 01:39:57,825
QUEEN'S BOXING GYM

1441
01:39:57,908 --> 01:40:00,744
Muhammad Ali once said this.

1442
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:05,124
"Live every day as if it were your last."

1443
01:40:05,207 --> 01:40:08,585
"Then you'll find the answer one day."

1444
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,213
So you should live every day--

1445
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:12,548
Hold on. I'm getting a call.

1446
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:13,757
Keep going.

1447
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,008
Keep your guard up.

1448
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:17,302
Hi, Mom.

1449
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:19,930
Don't be a terrible landlord.

1450
01:40:20,013 --> 01:40:21,348
Gosh.

1451
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:23,976
I miss Hae-in.

1452
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:27,563
She was a landlord
who didn't even know she owned this place.

1453
01:40:27,646 --> 01:40:30,065
We live every day to the fullest.

1454
01:40:36,321 --> 01:40:37,281
Gosh.

1455
01:40:39,074 --> 01:40:41,869
I can't believe
you let your brother become the chairman

1456
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:44,621
and chose to have ramyeon here instead.

1457
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:46,331
I like it.

1458
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:48,500
This is where I belong.

1459
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:54,131
I can finally say goodbye to others
without thinking about betraying them.

1460
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:57,843
This is paradise for me!

1461
01:40:58,844 --> 01:41:03,265
What kind of paradise doesn't have kimchi?
Ramyeon and kimchi go hand in hand.

1462
01:41:07,644 --> 01:41:09,563
-Is it working?
-Yes, it is.

1463
01:41:09,646 --> 01:41:12,232
Gosh. We looked everywhere for you.

1464
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:13,942
We brought some kimchi.

1465
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:16,153
The ramyeon is ready too!

1466
01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:17,571
-Good.
-Come on over.

1467
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:22,075
-Goodness. Hold on.
-Hello.

1468
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,661
-Hello.
-Don't greet her right now.

1469
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:26,038
How do I stop this?

1470
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:27,247
-The brakes!
-What?

1471
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:28,874
The brakes! Step on the brakes!

1472
01:41:28,957 --> 01:41:30,667
-Not the gear stick!
-Where are you going?

1473
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:31,919
Du-gwan, over here!

1474
01:41:32,002 --> 01:41:33,170
We can sometimes stop

1475
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:35,172
and appreciate the scenery.

1476
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:41,637
Then time will gradually begin
to flow more quickly.

1477
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:49,394
Time will slip away,

1478
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:51,563
and we won't be able
to do anything about it.

1479
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:05,452
That's how we'll spend

1480
01:42:06,578 --> 01:42:07,913
every day of our lives.

1481
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:25,013
We'll enjoy all the happiness
that life grants us.

1482
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:58,523
HONG HAE-IN
22 AUGUST 1990, 7 APRIL 2074

1483
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:02,319
SPENDING MY LIFE WITH YOU
HAS BEEN A MIRACLE

1484
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:46,947
One day…

1485
01:44:49,074 --> 01:44:51,076
when only one of us is left…

1486
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:27,529
The other one can come meet them.

1487
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:37,372
Then it won't be scary at all.

1488
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,421
-Because we'll be together.
-Because we'll be together.

1489
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:20,178
