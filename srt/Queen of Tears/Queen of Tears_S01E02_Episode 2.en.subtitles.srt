1
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,027
Well, I…

3
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,821
So what…

4
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,615
Yes?

5
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,825
…I wanted to say was…

6
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,079
I…

7
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,749
-Yes?
-"I'm sorry."

8
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,921
"About today

9
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,300
and everything that I did until now."

10
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,762
"It won't happen ever again.
I'll treat you better from now on."

11
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,224
That's what I wanted

12
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,810
to say.

13
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,103
But you only have three months to live?

14
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,814
How's that possible?

15
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,358
How can I live without you?

16
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,194
How is that possible?

17
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,072
I'm so dumbfounded

18
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,199
that I don't know what to say.

19
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,622
Are you serious?

20
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,833
Yes, you fool.

21
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,969
I love you, Hong Hae-in.

22
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,889
I love you.

23
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,184
If you can't live without me…

24
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,228
Yes?

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,523
Do you want to die together?

26
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,607
What?

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,655
You said you couldn't live without me.

28
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:41,161
I didn't mean I was certain
that I couldn't live without you.

29
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,746
I was simply wondering

30
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,876
if it was possible to do so.
I was curious.

31
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,670
Exactly. Then we should just die together.

32
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:56,217
It was an official thing back in the day.
It was called sunjang.

33
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,719
They buried you with your spouse.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,721
Right.

35
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,265
Sunjang.

36
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,601
Yes, sunjang.

37
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,439
You can treat me better in the afterlife.

38
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,356
It's not bad.

39
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,946
You've always been good
at making terrifying jokes

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,281
with a straight face.

41
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,325
Do you think I'm joking?

42
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,454
You're serious?

43
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,039
I'm saying don't be dramatic.

44
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,420
Tell me.

45
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,300
What exactly did the doctor say?

46
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,053
Where are you hurting?

47
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,014
Did the doctor really say
that it'll only take three--

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,268
That you had only three months to live?

49
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,149
Hello, Professor.

50
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,193
The test result?

51
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,823
Can you e-mail it to me?
I don't have time to go there.

52
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,137
We need to go somewhere.

53
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,683
You're free today, aren't you?

54
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,142
The car is waiting downstairs.

55
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,356
I'm not going.

56
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,736
-I didn't even tell you where we're going.
-It doesn't matter.

57
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,822
I refuse to go anywhere with you.

58
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,076
Where are you going right now?

59
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,955
I don't know.
I have no idea where I'm headed.

60
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,884
SUNGMIN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

61
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,908
Unlike normal tumors,

62
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,662
these fuzz-like tumors are scattered.

63
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,670
Hold on.

64
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,215
When did I get here?

65
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,675
Sorry?

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,679
I remember being in the lobby.

67
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,389
So how am I already here?

68
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,725
It's like I teleported.

69
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,852
Has this ever happened before?

70
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,897
I told you last time.

71
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,985
Sometimes, I had headaches
and was often forgetful. And sometimes…

72
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,696
Our VIPs loved the art class
we held in the first half year.

73
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,906
We invited famous artists…

74
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,491
Restea will be joining us.

75
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,992
These days, sleep quality…

76
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,332
Ten minutes? Thirty minutes?

77
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,669
Sometimes, I couldn't remember
what I did for the past several hours.

78
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:40,983
Ms. Hong.

79
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,696
I thought you had canceled your plans
to meet with Director Baek Hyun-woo.

80
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,948
Why are you still here?

81
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,618
I even missed an important appointment.

82
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,982
Why didn't you visit me sooner?

83
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,318
I just thought
I had dozed off or zoned out

84
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,653
due to exhaustion

85
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,823
I didn't feel any physical pain.

86
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,616
So…

87
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,287
is there something wrong with me?

88
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,873
You have Cloud Cytoma.
It's a very rare disease.

89
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,041
There aren't many cases worldwide.

90
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,378
It's safe to say
that you're our first Korean patient.

91
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,217
-Do I need surgery?
-No.

92
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,140
I see. It can be treated with medication.

93
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,309
Your case is a bit more complicated

94
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,061
because it's different
from regular tumors.

95
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,023
It's not a clear lump of tumor.

96
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:06,652
The tumor cells are dispersed
throughout your cranial nerves.

97
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,989
They're spread over a wide area.

98
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,950
It's the most concentrated
near your temporal lobe.

99
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,496
I believe this is the cause
of your temporary memory loss.

100
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,581
It's a rare disease.

101
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,876
The symptoms are nonspecific
and differ from case to case.

102
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,339
If it worsens, you could suffer from
hallucinations or personality disorders.

103
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,259
The problem is that
taking medication won't help much.

104
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,470
And it's too dangerous to receive surgery

105
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,724
since the tumor cells
have spread too much.

106
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,560
Ms. Hong?

107
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,148
Ms. Hong?

108
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,861
Are you okay?

109
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,873
-Okay.
-Pardon?

110
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,543
So that's the case for ordinary people.

111
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,670
I get it.

112
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,381
Now, tell me what treatment I can get.

113
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,925
I want to know about my case, not theirs.

114
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,511
I heard you're raising money
for a new children's hospital.

115
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,638
I can take care of that.

116
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,056
So tell me

117
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,850
how I can get rid of them.

118
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,227
To my knowledge,

119
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,146
there's no medical solution
for this as of now.

120
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,650
The best we can do is give you medication

121
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,069
to alleviate your headache
and temporary memory loss.

122
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,531
However, it's impossible to cure
the disease itself for now--

123
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,200
You've been insinuating

124
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,996
that I'll be dying soon.

125
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,873
Fine. Tell me.

126
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,750
When will I die?

127
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,461
Judging by
the spreading of the tumor cells,

128
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,424
I believe you have about three months.

129
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,724
What does he know anyway?

130
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,601
He knows best as a doctor.

131
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,104
I know my own body.

132
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,733
You're talking like a stubborn, old woman.

133
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,235
Have you ever seen me
eat instant or junk food?

134
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,112
-No.
-Exactly.

135
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,822
I've never drunk soda in my entire life.

136
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,451
Do you think I enjoyed drinking
vegetable juice and watching what I ate?

137
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,121
I meditated in the morning and did yoga
at night for my stress.

138
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,499
I watched my breathing
if there was no oxygen concentrator.

139
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,003
I've tried to stay healthy
since the moment I was born.

140
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,379
I get it.

141
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,716
Calm down.

142
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,638
Even people who harm their bodies
by drinking, smoking,

143
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,390
eating whatever they want,
and not minding their breathing

144
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,142
aren't subjected to this disease.

145
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,727
So why me?

146
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,896
I don't know either.

147
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,814
Fine.

148
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,859
I get that I'm sick.
But why can't they fix me?

149
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,820
People travel to the moon,
and cars drive themselves.

150
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,865
But they can't remove
a tiny tumor in my head?

151
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,493
That's ludicrous.

152
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,955
How about

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,127
we go to the hospital tomorrow
and check again?

154
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,088
What for?

155
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,091
We need to be sure.
What do I do if it's a misdiagnosis?

156
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,430
What do you do if it's a misdiagnosis?

157
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,517
I'd be ecstatic.

158
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,482
So let's go and reconfirm everything.

159
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,318
You're on edge right now.

160
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,614
Just forget everything and rest up…

161
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,075
Do you think I can sleep?

162
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,993
Right.

163
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,914
I'm too shocked as well.

164
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,042
I don't know if I can sleep tonight.

165
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,504
It sure feels different

166
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,216
compared to yesterday.

167
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,856
Humming? Really?
Do you want to get buried with her?

168
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,025
I'm sad.

169
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
We'll be parting ways.

170
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,950
We'll be parting ways
in three months even without a divorce.

171
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,915
No.

172
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,877
Don't smile.

173
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,756
Go down.

174
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,139
Hae-in?

175
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,979
Wait. She never sleeps in.

176
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,191
What's going on?

177
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,202
Hey.

178
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,333
It's past 7:00 a.m.

179
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,224
What?

180
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,184
What is it?

181
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,238
Morning kiss.

182
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,701
Good morning.

183
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,915
You must be in a good mood to say that.

184
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,627
Even your skin looks better.

185
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,254
You must've slept well.

186
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,423
I tossed and turned all night.

187
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,762
Me?

188
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,556
My skin?

189
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,683
You're wrong.

190
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,519
No, that can't be.

191
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,676
Let me warn you.

192
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,011
You're the only one who knows about this.

193
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,930
So if anyone finds out, it's your fault.

194
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,557
I understand.

195
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,852
But will you keep this a secret forever?

196
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,895
Yes.

197
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,856
Shouldn't your family know?

198
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,317
Of course not.
They should be the last ones to know.

199
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,027
But I think--

200
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,614
I'm very close
to joining the One Trillion Club.

201
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,368
You know what Grandfather said
when he gave me the department store.

202
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,704
"I will choose you over your father

203
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,415
if you make
over one trillion won in sales."

204
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,962
And you want me to ruin that?
When I'm this close?

205
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,048
That's why you won't tell them?

206
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,634
Hong Soo-cheol
is the type who calls my doctor

207
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,053
to confirm if I really got the flu.

208
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,140
Do you think my mom
would be any different?

209
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,059
If they find out about my illness,

210
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,437
I'll be kicked out of the house.

211
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,482
They'd fight over who would get my assets.

212
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,614
I won't allow that.

213
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,033
Over my dead body.

214
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:34,303
Why do you think Grandfather wants
to see me prior to having breakfast?

215
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,764
Does he want to give me
an earful and get it over with

216
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,848
before eating breakfast?

217
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,516
Any ideas why he wants to see you?

218
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,186
Maybe it's about

219
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,813
how I wanted to launch
that organic New York coffee brand.

220
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,775
The one that you were confident
about launching?

221
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,693
Yes, but I was wrong.

222
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:54,031
Those scumbags put one over on me
and decided to work with Yeom Sang-jin.

223
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,243
Why is this world
full of immoral scumbags?

224
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,706
Do you think Grandfather knows?

225
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,792
Even I found out only recently.

226
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,169
Risks are required to run a business.

227
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,422
Don't be afraid. It was only force majeure
that the deal fell through.

228
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,009
Yes, you're right. It was only force…

229
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,721
The deal only fell through
due to force majeure.

230
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,349
But I'm still worried that he'll get mad.

231
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,478
He's your grandfather, not Satan.

232
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,022
Be confident and tell him.

233
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,442
-I should, right?
-Yes.

234
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,199
How are you so incompetent?

235
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,202
Grandfather, this deal only fell through

236
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,955
due to force majeure--

237
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,915
What? A deal fell through?

238
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,502
What deal are you talking about?

239
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,963
The launching
of the organic New York coffee.

240
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,297
Isn't that what this is about?

241
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,341
I'm talking about how

242
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,719
you overpaid eight billion won

243
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,221
in corporate tax!

244
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,598
-What?
-Hyun-woo's Legal Team

245
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,935
found out about it
and will file a rectification claim.

246
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,273
That money would've gone down
the drain had it not been for him!

247
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,358
Isn't your brother-in-law

248
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,193
the finance director?

249
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,570
-Fire him this instant!
-But--

250
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,239
Also, you were so confident

251
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,284
about that coffee deal.
Did that go down the drain too?

252
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,660
-No--
-Answer me!

253
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,540
Why can't you do anything right?

254
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,001
Haven't you learned anything from Hae-in?

255
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,378
-Haven't you?
-You see--

256
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,338
Say something, you scumbag!

257
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,423
Talk, you scumbag!

258
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,175
Make use of that mouth of yours!

259
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,885
-I--
-Answer me, you idiot!

260
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,137
I want to reply, but I can't--

261
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,138
Then talk!

262
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,890
I can't breathe.

263
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,394
What?

264
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,229
Get up!

265
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,032
Doctor Jeong thinks he has panic disorder.

266
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,161
Goodness.

267
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,830
You must've been so stressed out
by your grandfather.

268
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,457
This is Hyun-woo's fault.

269
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,960
Why is he so good at his job?

270
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,172
I'm sorry, Mother.

271
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,716
It's my brother's fault.

272
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,967
Honey, that's ridiculous.

273
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,637
Your brother worked hard
and just made a mistake.

274
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,223
Eight billion won isn't that serious.

275
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,724
Eight billion won?

276
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,978
Is all of this just because
of eight billion won?

277
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,648
Where's Hyun-woo?

278
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,942
I'm truly sorry,

279
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,111
but the results are the same.

280
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,200
Do you mean
she really has three months left?

281
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,452
-Exactly three months?
-I can't say.

282
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,664
That's an irresponsible answer.

283
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,999
You've been a neurologist for 30 years.

284
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,878
Please be exact with the percentage.
Please give us the exact number.

285
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,463
That's enough. Let's go.

286
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,132
No, Hae-in. I need to hear this.

287
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,845
Fine then. I'm leaving first.

288
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,770
Sir.

289
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,482
I'd appreciate it if you could be exact.

290
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,776
My life is on the line here.

291
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,180
This is ridiculous.

292
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,516
I'm different.

293
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,442
Why are you here?

294
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,236
Why isn't Hyun-woo picking up?
Is he in his office?

295
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,904
I asked why you were here.

296
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,657
So what if Soo-cheol overpaid
a few billion won?

297
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,077
Hyun-woo could've taken care
of it quietly.

298
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,871
Your grandfather was livid with Soo-cheol.

299
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,623
He must've found out somehow.
Hyun-woo wouldn't do that.

300
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,375
What do you take me for?

301
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,377
I know you were behind it.

302
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,131
I have no time for that. I'm…

303
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,885
a bit distracted by a serious matter.

304
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,136
Soo-cheol had…

305
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,264
a panic attack today.

306
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,017
I see.

307
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,105
You must've been startled.

308
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,984
But, Mom,

309
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,113
I just told you
that I had a serious matter too.

310
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,908
Aren't you curious?

311
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,871
You always know what to do
whether it's big or small.

312
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,083
Right.

313
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,585
I'll take care

314
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,629
of my business.

315
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,464
You should go. This is my workplace.

316
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,299
Hey, don't mind me.

317
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,051
I'm here to see Hyun-woo anyway.

318
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,512
Stop provoking us.

319
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,765
Or I'll torment your son
until the day I die

320
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,727
no matter how busy or distracted I am.

321
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,855
-What?
-I'll torment him forever.

322
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,149
Is that so?

323
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,652
Do you think I'd just sit and watch?

324
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,570
Bring it on.

325
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,503
Why did you want to eat here?

326
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,381
Hey, I don't even feel safe
in our law firm's meeting room.

327
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,425
A public place like this feels safer.

328
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,219
Why is that?

329
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,475
Because I'm risking my life
to go against Queens.

330
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,186
Why would you?

331
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,732
I thought long and hard
after seeing you cry.

332
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,110
I'll help you. Let's have the divorce!

333
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,243
-About that--
-This wasn't an easy decision.

334
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,787
I'm risking my job.

335
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,706
Okay, but don't do it.

336
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,291
Why not?

337
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,712
I'm not getting a divorce.

338
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,675
No? Hey, didn't you tell me
that it was too unbearable?

339
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,635
Well…

340
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,180
I said that because I saw no end to this.

341
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,434
But now that I see one,

342
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,228
I think I can endure it.

343
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,897
What do you mean? What end?

344
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,858
Well…

345
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,361
God granted me a safe parting.

346
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,113
Let's just say that.

347
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,907
Explain in layman's terms.

348
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,633
Come to Hangang Jamwon Parking Lot
Section One in 30 minutes.

349
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,652
What are we doing?

350
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,905
What I'm about to tell you
is confidential.

351
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,659
-So if anyone finds out, it's your fault.
-Come on.

352
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,702
What's this about?

353
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,303
Are you serious?

354
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,431
She told me when I was about
to give her the divorce papers.

355
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,141
That she had three months left.

356
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,311
I met with her doctor today too.

357
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,188
Gosh, Hyun-woo.

358
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,692
Hey.

359
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,319
This is insane. What am I supposed to say?

360
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,404
First…

361
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,073
-Let's shake hands.
-Don't.

362
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,826
Right, you shouldn't show your happiness.

363
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,953
Let me be the scumbag.

364
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,872
So Lady Luck is on your side.

365
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,917
You would've left her
without a single penny to your name

366
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,252
had you gotten a divorce.

367
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,254
Those few seconds saved you.

368
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,590
What? Does this mean
you'll take over Queens?

369
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,552
Do you think

370
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,264
-they're that dumb?
-What do you mean?

371
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,182
Did she sign a prenup or something?

372
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,851
About not dividing her assets?

373
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,978
You know it won't matter
once you file a suit

374
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,688
unless she wrote it in her will.

375
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,815
Yes, she wrote it

376
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,067
in her will.

377
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:51,985
Seriously?

378
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,988
Yes.

379
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,615
It happened before we got married.

380
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,744
She refused to give anything to me

381
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,788
and even got the will notarized

382
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,873
before we got married.

383
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,043
Conglomerates sure are different.

384
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,586
They're extremely thorough.

385
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,754
It's okay.

386
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,173
I'm just happy

387
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,761
that I can escape from them
safe and sound in three months.

388
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,391
But think about this.

389
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:28,313
Why did God give you those three months?

390
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,148
Hyun-woo.

391
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,901
Attorney Baek.

392
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,070
Let's talk professionally.

393
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,323
You know she's free to revise
her will in those three months.

394
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,034
You just need to win her over
in the next three months

395
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,912
so that she'll think,
"Gosh, he must love me so much."

396
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:49,042
"I should hand over my beloved
Queens Department Store before I die."

397
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,088
What are you saying?

398
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,174
Three months is nothing
after serving two years in the military.

399
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,801
Consider that and it'll be easier.

400
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,636
Put your heart and soul

401
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,554
into loving her.

402
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,894
You.

403
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,231
Do you seriously think…

404
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,235
I'm that materialistic?

405
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:25,870
What's that for?

406
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,415
Today is our wedding anniversary.

407
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,041
So?

408
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,752
I had made a reservation
and prepared a surprise two years ago.

409
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,380
But you got very upset
and told me not to make a scene.

410
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,091
-So?
-So I didn't prepare anything last year.

411
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,176
But you still got mad
that I actually listened

412
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,387
and asked if I would die
if you told me to.

413
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,473
Are you here to nitpick
about my inconsistency?

414
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,267
No, of course not.

415
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,521
What kind of person
brings flowers to nitpick?

416
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,233
Then has our marriage ever been
so lovely that you'd bring flowers

417
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,276
on our anniversary?

418
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,654
To be honest,

419
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,823
I can't say yes to that.

420
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,744
But we could always
make it lovely, can't we?

421
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,874
Happy…

422
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,297
wedding anniversary.

423
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,609
Bring me a vase.

424
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,153
How are things?

425
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,823
Did they fight or anything like that?

426
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,909
No, they didn't. Rather…

427
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,495
-"Rather"?
-They've gotten closer.

428
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,830
-"Closer"?
-Yes.

429
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:54,626
He takes great care of her.
It's very unlike him.

430
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,880
Has this table always been for ten?

431
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,841
Twelve.

432
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,852
It's always been just the two of us.

433
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,149
But we sat so far apart.

434
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,363
What's wrong with you?

435
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,447
From now on,

436
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,992
I'll be sitting here.

437
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,776
There are too many cons in the contract.

438
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,071
We need to provide
the store's renovation fee.

439
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,449
I don't think
it's that big of a loss on our part

440
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,493
given the popularity of the brand.

441
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,872
Correct, but they're not required
to stay for a certain amount of time.

442
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,957
Let's say we spent five billion won

443
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,792
to bring them in.

444
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,670
We have no right to stop them
if they want to leave after a year.

445
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,840
We're also required
to pay a penalty if they find out

446
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,426
people are selling counterfeit products.

447
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,681
Are you okay?

448
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,560
Hold on. I'm okay--

449
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,728
Don't talk. Let me.

450
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,314
-Please call the ambulance.
-Sorry?

451
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,817
I'm fine.

452
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,193
Are you really?

453
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,113
I just choked on some water.

454
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,701
-Really?
-Yes.

455
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,785
So?

456
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,787
Can we resume?

457
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,414
Yes, sir.

458
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,250
No need for the ambulance.

459
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,715
What's gotten into him?

460
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,425
He's just trying to survive.

461
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,676
Goodbye, sir.

462
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,470
I'll call you later. Goodbye.

463
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,265
Had he stayed still,

464
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,310
she would've been furious
that he didn't do anything.

465
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,438
I really feel bad for him.

466
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,781
It's cold. You should just wait inside.

467
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,329
You're freezing.

468
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,666
What if you catch a cold?

469
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,835
Jeez.

470
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,257
Why are your hands so cold?

471
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,179
Secretary Na, is the car coming soon?

472
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,140
Well, yes.

473
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,017
Will you be okay?

474
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,687
Should I call an ambulance?

475
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,651
There it is.

476
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,170
It's okay.

477
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,550
Gosh.

478
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,218
They should just argue instead.

479
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,387
What's gotten into him?

480
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,439
Didn't I tell you?

481
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,315
Don't be dramatic.

482
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,863
Hae-in, I don't know how to be dramatic.

483
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,996
This is being dramatic.

484
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,841
Sorry.

485
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,812
I don't know why

486
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,356
Hyun-woo reminds me of Grace Kelly.

487
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,734
Didn't she get married to a king?

488
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,944
-He reminds me of Diana.
-That's wrong.

489
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,363
Those two got divorced.

490
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,573
-Sorry.
-Mi-seon.

491
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,867
I came here
to get my hair done, not pulled out.

492
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,410
I said I was sorry.

493
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,289
Maybe it's because we're housewives,
but you really don't treat us well.

494
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,874
-I agree.
-Be honest with us.

495
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,210
Does it annoy you
when we talk about Hyun-woo's looks?

496
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,837
Hyun-woo has always been good-looking.

497
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,922
It's not like that.

498
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,215
Right.

499
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,132
Did you hear?

500
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,635
-About what?
-The daughter of the electronics store.

501
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,137
-Whose in-laws are doctors?
-Yes.

502
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,099
-They're getting a divorce.
-Really?

503
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,517
-Seriously?
-Yes!

504
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,894
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

505
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,814
Jeez, that's not a big deal.

506
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,524
Divorces are common these days.

507
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,443
There are even TV shows
that feature divorced couples.

508
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,113
It's not a shame
to be divorced these days.

509
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,282
Her mom must be so humiliated
to see her neighbors.

510
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,286
She used to brag all the time
about her son-in-law being a doctor.

511
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,788
I thought she was a doctor too.

512
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,499
She always gave advice
to others if they were unwell.

513
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,376
-Tell me about it.
-Why are they splitting?

514
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,627
They're too different.

515
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,170
I told you before.

516
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,799
The marriage won't last if the wife
and the husband are too different.

517
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,304
But I'm not saying that's always the case.

518
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,307
Is Hyun-woo happily married?

519
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,601
Of course, he is.

520
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,311
But you know what they say.

521
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,064
Those in Seoul look down
on people like us.

522
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,149
Right.

523
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,026
And Hyun-woo is married
to a conglomerate family.

524
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,321
My sister-in-law is not like that.

525
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,907
Right. I'm sure.

526
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,703
Then why didn't she attend
your dad's 60th birthday?

527
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,874
People started gossiping afterward.

528
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,792
-Saying?
-That they're not on good terms.

529
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,752
They think Hyun-woo isn't treated well.

530
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,754
Only those who don't treat
their in-laws well

531
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,674
attend birthday parties
and pretend like they do.

532
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,843
But people like her
who are good to their in-laws

533
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,428
don't need to do that.

534
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,930
I see. But are you mad?

535
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,391
Why would I be mad?

536
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,352
Then loosen up those fists,
or you're going to land a punch.

537
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,650
-I have a headache.
-What's wrong with her?

538
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,360
-She's mad.
-I see.

539
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,237
My entire body is sore today.

540
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,322
Don't throw things.

541
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,074
Pinky is watching, you know?

542
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,996
Hyun-woo, that idiot.

543
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,333
I get it. Studying law at SNU
probably made him arrogant,

544
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,127
so it must've been difficult
to brown-nose a conglomerate family.

545
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,005
But wouldn't it be better
to brown-nose them, if anything?

546
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,466
Of course.
I brown-nose middle-schoolers every month.

547
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,426
-Why?
-So they register for the next month.

548
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,678
Hey, it's not my hands
that keep me in business either.

549
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,222
Not at all. It's my mouth.

550
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,850
"Gosh, you're so beautiful today.
Your skin is glowing!"

551
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,020
"You look ten years younger
with this new haircut." That's what I say.

552
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,897
I wish Hyun-woo could be like us.

553
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,023
Gosh.

554
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,775
I doted on him too much.

555
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,820
Mom, shouldn't you do
something about this?

556
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,949
-He might actually get a divorce.
-A divorce isn't a big deal.

557
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,408
Honey.

558
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,703
People divorce when they think
they're on the brink of death.

559
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,664
It's better to divorce then.

560
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,583
The noodles are tasty.

561
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,252
More sesame oil?

562
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,295
Yes, add more.

563
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,432
I prepared different meals for each of you

564
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,518
based on last week's blood test results.

565
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,105
As for the vice-chairman,
I prepared a low-FODMAP diet

566
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,773
for your irritable bowel syndrome.

567
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,233
Thank you.

568
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,077
Where's Grandfather?

569
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,789
He needs to fast
for his medical checkup tomorrow.

570
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:15,293
I bet he'll live up to 120 years of age.

571
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,878
Mine doesn't have any meat.

572
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,880
It's because of your cholesterol.

573
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,844
Hae-in.

574
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,761
Yes?

575
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,597
You'll receive
a certification of contents tomorrow.

576
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,642
I'm going to file a suit
for how you built your department store

577
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,186
over my land in Gwanggyo.

578
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,983
We already talked about this
when the construction began.

579
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,818
And it wasn't that much land.

580
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,780
Listen. All wars began
because one party stepped over

581
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,199
-another party's land.
-You gave me your permission.

582
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,288
I did, but Attorney Shim was against it.

583
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,083
Rumors might spread about how
I gave you special treatment,

584
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,544
and I might have to pay a gift tax.

585
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,213
So you're going to file
a suit now that the building

586
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,381
has already been built?

587
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,924
You haven't opened yet.

588
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,094
I see. Then should I just demolish it?

589
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,306
Hae-in, she doesn't want
to prolong the case.

590
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,058
She wants to negotiate.

591
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,769
-Hyun-woo.
-Yes, sir.

592
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,521
Look over it with her
and come up with an appropriate measure.

593
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,320
"An appropriate measure"?

594
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,784
What does that mean?
Should I be afraid and back off?

595
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,787
Is this what you meant
when you said bring it on?

596
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,247
You're threatening me with that lawsuit.

597
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,707
What I'm saying is--

598
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,708
I think…

599
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,630
Hyun-woo.

600
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,340
Did you just cut me off?

601
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,217
I apologize.

602
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,887
But since
you've already filed a complaint,

603
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,306
we'll look over it and give you our reply.

604
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,518
However, the press
will learn about this in the process.

605
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,978
And that could cause
a fall in the stock price and more.

606
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,980
I'll have to inform her grandfather.

607
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,275
I'll do that.

608
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,195
Yes, ma'am. Then that'll be all.

609
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,825
She's feeling a bit unwell.

610
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,327
Please excuse us.

611
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,846
You wanted to keep it
a secret from your family.

612
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,431
But?

613
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,725
But wouldn't they suspect
that something's up

614
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,603
if you're all tense
and your fists are trembling?

615
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,775
Right. I know I was acting
out of character.

616
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,944
But what about you?

617
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,531
You interrupted my mom and sided with me.

618
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,324
You also looked me in the eye lovingly.

619
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,207
You were the most suspicious.

620
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,210
Just act like you always have.

621
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,965
When did you ever peel shrimp for me?

622
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,641
It just won't work for us.

623
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,608
It's impossible.

624
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,486
How can we change
after years of living as strangers?

625
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,570
But wasn't that the case

626
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,071
-three years ago?
-What was?

627
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,323
Weren't you in love?

628
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,326
-That was--
-You were both head over heels.

629
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,703
She visited you on a helicopter

630
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,538
and disobeyed her parents. You too.

631
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,165
You weren't sane back then either.

632
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,125
You were crazy in love.

633
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,586
So wasn't that love?

634
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,215
That was years ago.

635
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,634
Yes, you're right.
But let me give you an example.

636
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,762
We learn how to survive in water as kids.
Then we don't swim for decades.

637
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,014
Even if we end up in water again,
we'll still float.

638
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,309
You may think you forgot it all,
but your body remembers.

639
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,644
It's the same with love.

640
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,812
You may think you forgot how to do it,

641
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,398
but your heart remembers
once you get into it.

642
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,192
But this isn't like swimming.

643
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,528
Of course, it is.
Being in love isn't special.

644
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,659
It's strange, isn't it?

645
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,620
We get married because we're in love.

646
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,414
So why does that love disappear?

647
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,208
As a divorce attorney,

648
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,711
I think the problem
is that marriage is exclusive.

649
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,214
Couples don't find the need to try.

650
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,007
So they get disappointed and fight.

651
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,052
Then they come to me.
Marriage just makes it impossible

652
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,763
to stay in love.

653
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,396
-Do you think so?
-I think it's best not to marry

654
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,566
if you want to be in love for a long time.

655
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,434
Please accept this
as a token of my love and loyalty.

656
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,075
Honey.

657
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,203
Are you crazy? She's not your honey.

658
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,788
Long time no see, Secretary Kim.

659
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,915
Hello, ma'am.

660
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,795
You're getting married? You two?

661
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,213
And in Korea at that?

662
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,090
Right.

663
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,468
You must've heard that I was in jail.

664
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,386
That's why you came back.

665
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,971
But what a shame.

666
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,682
I got out.

667
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,149
Calm down, honey.

668
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,028
What did I tell you?

669
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,946
I said I'd spare your life

670
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,201
as long as you left
the country and lay low.

671
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,661
-Right.
-So how dare you

672
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,288
get married in front of all your relatives

673
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,623
when you cheated on me?

674
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,631
Honey.

675
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,841
Honey.

676
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,351
Honey.

677
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,896
Honey!

678
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,499
Ma'am, you have blood--

679
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,875
It's not mine.

680
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,381
-Where?
-On your cheek.

681
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,175
You shouldn't do this
when you're on probation.

682
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,928
You could get aggravated punishment
for assault and defamation.

683
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,598
Defamation? What I've done so far
to those cheaters is far from that.

684
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,811
Should I show you
what true defamation is like?

685
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,856
You could be behind bars
until you're 60 if you do that.

686
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,149
Will that be okay?

687
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,318
I've settled with their attorney.

688
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,361
How much?

689
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,155
-Do you want to know?
-Forget it.

690
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,490
It'll be enough
to build a pool in their house.

691
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,117
You shouldn't have done that.

692
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,661
Do you still resent them?

693
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,709
Do you smoke?

694
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,461
-I quit.
-Because I do.

695
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,964
I learned how to smoke
because all my ex-husbands cheated on me.

696
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,218
You can't smoke here.

697
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,595
Let's go.

698
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,513
Go? Where?

699
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,684
Damn it.

700
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,603
I was dying to get out of jail.

701
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,523
But now that I'm out,
there's nowhere to go.

702
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,693
You should go home.

703
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,113
The chairman is waiting for you.

704
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,541
Beom-ja.

705
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,419
I heard you didn't eat all day.

706
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,263
What's it to you
if I starve to death or not?

707
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,599
You put me behind bars
because you didn't care.

708
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,685
Gosh, it wasn't me who did that.

709
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:58,106
You assaulted an innocent woman,

710
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,150
so you were punished for your actions.

711
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,278
I see.

712
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,864
The woman who killed Mom
and became the madam of the house

713
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,158
is completely innocent.

714
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,036
She's not the madam of the house.

715
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,205
She's not in our family register.

716
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,333
All I did was gently grab her
by the hair, but I'm the sinner here.

717
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,002
You can't say it was gentle
when her disc slipped.

718
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,798
Exactly! So mind your own business
and let me die for slipping her disc!

719
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,056
Hey, Beom-ja.

720
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,684
You have the wrong idea about her.

721
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,895
Seul-hee doesn't want anything from us.

722
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,189
She's not interested
in fortune or becoming family.

723
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,569
That's even scarier.

724
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,489
What grand plan could she be scheming
to live with you and not want anything?

725
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,826
You're just a geezer with tons of money!

726
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,413
Hey!

727
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,248
Gosh.

728
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,835
I wonder when she'll wise up.

729
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:04,131
I shouldn't have hope
since she's already in her fifties, right?

730
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,799
Don't let it bother you.

731
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,760
By the way, I know I'm no match for you.

732
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,388
But you're not focused on the game at all.

733
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,765
What do you mean?

734
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,606
-Goodness.
-Staring at the board won't help.

735
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,941
You need to see the bigger picture.

736
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,526
You're right.

737
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,406
You'll get caught if you run away in fear.

738
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,789
But if you try to catch the tiger

739
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,376
without being prepared,

740
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,129
you'll lose everything.

741
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,464
Goodness.

742
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,760
This is why janggi
can teach you life lessons.

743
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,623
I took over your palace.

744
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,459
Where will the king flee to now?

745
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,752
Checkmate.

746
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,090
Did you see this coming?

747
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,926
Or were you just lucky?

748
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,886
I'm not sure.

749
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,140
You need to grant me
one favor since you lost.

750
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,392
What is it?

751
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:42,020
I'll tell you when I have one.

752
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,323
Honey, did you see that?

753
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,575
I think I just saw a shooting star.

754
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,955
I didn't know I could see them in Seoul.

755
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,624
You dreamed of shooting stars
before having Hae-in.

756
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:06,795
Did I?

757
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,258
You were excited because you thought
you'd be having a baby girl.

758
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:14,803
I'm not sure. I don't quite remember.

759
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,598
Honey, don't be so harsh on Hae-in.

760
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,144
What did I do?

761
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,773
How long will you let your past haunt you?

762
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,693
You should let go and move on.

763
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,197
That's what you said back then.
Your father didn't want any issues,

764
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,782
so you obliged.

765
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,577
I still don't understand
why Su-wan had to die.

766
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,788
It was just an accident.
No one is to blame.

767
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,666
You're right. It's no one's fault,

768
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,460
but Su-wan is gone.

769
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,173
I'm still upset and in pain
every single day.

770
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,091
To others…

771
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,219
To you, it's just a past event.

772
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,054
But I relive that moment every day.

773
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,809
I'm haunted by the day
when I lost my child.

774
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,273
So don't expect me to be reasonable.

775
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,280
Why hasn't she come home yet?

776
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,659
Is she really sick?

777
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,537
She has great stamina.

778
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:10,919
To be honest,
her chance of survival is very low.

779
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,004
But miracles do happen.

780
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,798
Sorry?

781
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,510
How often do these miracles occur?

782
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,470
Do they happen often?

783
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,972
During my 30 years as a doctor,

784
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,810
I've witnessed many patients
recover miraculously

785
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:30,272
from even less hopeful illnesses.

786
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,190
Don't lose hope.

787
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,027
CLINICAL CASES FOR BRAIN TUMORS

788
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,407
MALIGNANT TUMOR
DON'T GIVE UP ON TREATMENT

789
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,962
"Given three months to live
but still alive after 30 years."

790
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,422
Thirty years?

791
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,883
Seriously?

792
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,890
I didn't know it was this common.

793
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,811
I guess a doctor's prediction
isn't always correct.

794
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,522
This is-- Gosh.

795
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:14,816
This is unlike the dramas.

796
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:21,281
"The tumors disappeared after waking up.
A medically impossible case."

797
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,910
How could it be medically impossible?

798
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,579
Is this the reality

799
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:31,541
of modern medicine? Really?

800
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,952
TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS CAN STILL RECOVER

801
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,287
GIVEN 3 MONTHS TO LIVE,
BUT STILL ALIVE AFTER 30 YEARS

802
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,470
THE MIRACULOUS HEALING
OF MY PANCREATIC CANCER

803
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,638
THOSE WHO CLING ONTO HOPE

804
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,108
Hey, Hae-in.

805
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,112
When did you come in?

806
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,744
Why are you sleeping here?
Sleep on the bed.

807
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,330
Right, I should.

808
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,083
You should too.

809
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,502
Good night.

810
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,475
Hyun-woo.

811
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,352
Yes?

812
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,605
To be honest,

813
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:03,693
I suspected you.

814
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,030
What?

815
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,704
I thought you'd be happy
to hear that I was dying.

816
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,416
I thought that was why
you were being so good to me.

817
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,754
I also suspected that you had

818
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,006
an ulterior motive.

819
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,384
I admit.

820
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,178
I was a bit suspicious.

821
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,057
I didn't know
you had looked up those things.

822
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:47,070
These miracles happen
more often than you think.

823
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,865
What…

824
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,535
You don't have to come here.

825
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,167
Don't worry. I will live no matter what.

826
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,504
I acted tough,

827
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,589
but I was shocked to hear my diagnosis.

828
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,591
I was dispirited.

829
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,345
A part of me didn't care
about what would happen to me.

830
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,348
"But if I really had only three months,

831
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,059
would receiving treatment even help?"

832
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,352
"Should I just give up?"

833
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,148
"No one would mourn my death."

834
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,108
"Not even my family."

835
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:27,861
I had all sorts of thoughts.

836
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:31,739
I see.

837
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:35,076
But there's one person.

838
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:41,541
You of all people want me to live.

839
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,251
Me?

840
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,088
Yes. Of course.

841
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,175
Yes, I do.

842
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,595
It had been tough for me.

843
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:59,559
It was too much to handle,
but seeing you gives me hope.

844
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,020
I did my own research.

845
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,898
Unlike in Korea,
there were similar cases abroad.

846
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,109
There are many labs out there
that are developing new drugs.

847
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,614
They'll be able to speed up the process
as long as they have the funds.

848
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:16,284
I'm going to actively look
into supporting them.

849
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,703
Really?

850
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,331
Are you that happy?

851
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,459
Yes.

852
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,045
Of course, I am.

853
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,010
Don't worry.

854
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:39,015
I'm not going to die
that easily for your sake.

855
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,056
Is this for your social media account?

856
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,141
What if it's just a part of your face?

857
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,102
I really want the world to see you.

858
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,145
But the media will post articles about me.

859
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,649
And your parents don't want that.

860
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,359
I don't want to worry them.

861
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,694
You're really…

862
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,613
All right.

863
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:39,951
Also,

864
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:43,871
Jun-ho told me to keep it a secret
since it wasn't confirmed yet.

865
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,957
Our finance director? About what?

866
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,960
He feels terrible
about the eight billion won.

867
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,628
It's totally fine.

868
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,546
Still.

869
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,799
He's trying to hook you up with someone
to make up for that.

870
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,218
-Who?
-A private equity fund investor.

871
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,386
He was the one

872
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:01,723
who invested in the organic coffee deal
for Yeom Sang-jin.

873
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,141
Really?

874
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,520
His name is David Yoon.
He's Korean-American.

875
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,023
He recently came to Korea.

876
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,233
He has control
of Middle Eastern oil money,

877
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,485
and he's here to find new investments.

878
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,238
He's looking to invest
at least a couple trillion won.

879
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:35,340
Hae-in has been trying
to bring Hercyna into her store.

880
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,510
And David is the reason
why the brand could launch

881
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,514
their first Asian flagship store in Seoul.

882
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,652
Hi.

883
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,616
Hi.

884
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,371
Congratulations. I'm loving
your food section's new renovation.

885
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,915
I eat at your food court often these days.

886
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,543
Right. I heard you came by often.

887
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,713
Anyway, Royal still has
a long way to go to be on your level.

888
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,131
Our desserts need some tweaking.

889
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,425
We have a lot to do.

890
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,554
Once the fountain plaza is built
on the first floor,

891
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,223
we're going to bring in Hercyna

892
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,849
and we'll work from there.

893
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,061
No, we need to work harder.

894
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,313
So what if our food section is great?

895
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,733
A department store without Hercyna
is just a big restaurant.

896
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,653
We also have space for Hercyna.

897
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,075
Do you want a tip?

898
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,120
Sure, if you want to give me one.

899
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,204
Okay.

900
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,290
I'm sure you know that Mr. Hermann

901
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,876
puts company value and mindset
before anything else.

902
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,255
He believes that those
who form good relationships with others

903
01:01:57,338 --> 01:02:00,299
are the best business partners.

904
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,926
That's his belief.

905
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,886
-So?
-Look around you.

906
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,681
Everyone here has brought
their spouse, lover, or family members.

907
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,142
You're the only one here

908
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,018
who came alone.

909
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,812
What?

910
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,359
You impress me.

911
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,319
Everyone knows that you have no friends,

912
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,489
but how could you think of coming here
of all places by yourself?

913
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,201
You're the only lone wolf here.

914
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,704
It's just you, Hae-in.

915
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,873
Poor you.

916
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,181
BAEK HYUN-WOO

917
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,479
-Where are you?
-I'm in a trial.

918
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:04,864
What did he say?

919
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,119
What do you mean?

920
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,538
You were frantically calling
your husband for help.

921
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,664
Is he not coming?

922
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,125
-He's in a trial.
-How fitting.

923
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,252
-What?
-What can you do?

924
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,463
You can't tell him to bail.

925
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:23,424
I think that was a fitting excuse.

926
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,928
It's not an excuse.
He's really in a trial.

927
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,305
Why are you so serious?
I was just kidding.

928
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,392
Hey, don't mind the rumors.

929
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,894
I don't believe them.

930
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,188
-What rumors?
-I'm sure you heard.

931
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:40,942
That you two have separated
and will divorce soon.

932
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,862
That he only married you for your money.
I don't even want to talk about them.

933
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,447
But you have.

934
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,033
I've barely begun.

935
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:51,285
You should've had an ordinary marriage.

936
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:54,580
Even gossipers wouldn't have much
to talk about had you married someone

937
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,415
on your own level.

938
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,376
I've realized something in life.

939
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:01,712
Marriage is about finding a life partner

940
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:05,299
who looks in the same direction as you.

941
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,679
My past four years of marriage

942
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,347
have been nothing but peaceful.

943
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,767
And that piqued my curiosity
about couples who couldn't get along.

944
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:19,230
How does it feel?
I've never been mad at my husband before.

945
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,773
Why are you asking me?

946
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,111
You shouldn't take your anger out on me

947
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,280
for not being loved by your husband.

948
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,082
You should've just married Yoon Eun-sung.

949
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,418
Why would you suddenly bring him up?

950
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,670
You don't know anything, do you?

951
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,673
He's Mr. Hermann's right-hand man.

952
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,384
He's the key to reaching Mr. Hermann.

953
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,386
What?

954
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,181
Hey, he became really successful.

955
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,100
He's not the same guy from university.

956
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,395
He's in charge of managing
sheikhs' finances now.

957
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,982
That's why I went
to greet him at the airport.

958
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,859
Eun-sung.

959
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,207
It's been a while.

960
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,423
You should've let me know
if you were back in Korea.

961
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,261
Don't you remember
the last thing you said to me?

962
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,138
To not contact you.

963
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,308
-I did?
-Yes.

964
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,185
I doubt that.

965
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,855
"Let's continue to stay in touch."

966
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:44,941
Isn't that what I said?

967
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,911
You're right. I told you
not to reach out to me ever again

968
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,704
because you kept crossing the line.

969
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,416
Right. But now,

970
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,336
it seems like you have something to say.

971
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,714
I'm sure you already know this,

972
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,300
so I'll just say it.

973
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,844
Ye-na and I are in a brutal competition

974
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,930
to bring Hercyna into our stores.

975
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:19,475
It seems like you have
a good relationship with Mr. Hermann.

976
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:20,935
So tell me.

977
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,688
-Can you help me?
-Me?

978
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:27,900
Why should I?

979
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,405
To be honest,
I don't remember much of the past.

980
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:37,034
So why don't we just say that we broke up

981
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:38,869
on good terms?

982
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,312
When will the trial end?
Is it almost over?

983
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,317
-What about the trial?
-I won.

984
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,694
I won quickly to come here.

985
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:47,623
Here you go.

986
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:54,880
One non-alcoholic cocktail, please.

987
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,801
What did you say marriage was again?

988
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,846
Finding a life partner who looked
in the same direction as you?

989
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,142
I didn't get it at first,
but seeing your husband made it clear.

990
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:07,977
What do you mean?

991
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:09,728
You see,

992
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:14,650
I'd rather look at my husband
than elsewhere.

993
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,362
He's that handsome.

994
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,322
Here you go.

995
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,749
Honey, have you tried this yet?

996
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,793
It's really something.

997
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,838
-Did you come here to eat?
-What?

998
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,381
I don't want to see it.

999
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,219
I'm talking about your face.

1000
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,138
Go away.

1001
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,765
A heart? You little…

1002
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:56,066
Here.

1003
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,861
Thank you.

1004
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,783
I thought of Hae-in now and then.

1005
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,703
So it feels odd

1006
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:09,914
to meet her husband.

1007
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,004
Sorry?

1008
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:20,007
Well, Hae-in and I

1009
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,970
had a good relationship in the past.

1010
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,431
I see.

1011
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,476
Hae-in isn't the type

1012
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,896
who has had
many good relationships in her lifetime.

1013
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,440
That's quite impressive.

1014
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,860
To be honest,

1015
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,614
I liked her a lot.

1016
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,659
I see.

1017
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:49,995
It doesn't bother you?

1018
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,164
Sorry?

1019
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,959
That only means one of two things.

1020
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,671
You trust her completely,
or you just don't care.

1021
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,007
Is it the latter?

1022
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,639
I'm just kidding.

1023
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,813
Mr. Yoon.

1024
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,314
Coming.

1025
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:18,899
Goodbye.

1026
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:27,741
That bastard.

1027
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:32,830
How did he know?

1028
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,626
I'm offended.

1029
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,384
How ridiculous.

1030
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,095
To be honest, I liked her a lot.

1031
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,431
If he truly

1032
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,599
liked her a lot,

1033
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,352
then he should've worked hard
and married her.

1034
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,646
Then he would've saved my life.

1035
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:02,484
What's the point of telling me
about his feelings now?

1036
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,738
Is he teasing me or what?

1037
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,121
What an annoying scumbag.

1038
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:12,805
Hello.

1039
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,474
-We meet again.
-Hello.

1040
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:20,104
Gosh. Isn't this place teeming?

1041
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:24,274
You're right.

1042
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,945
More than half of these people
came to see him.

1043
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:29,655
They want to meet him.

1044
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:36,703
What does he do?

1045
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:37,788
He's a tycoon.

1046
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,249
Even the wealthiest people
from Wall Street

1047
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:44,169
borrow oil money from him.

1048
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,672
Even Chairman Yeom is dying to meet him.

1049
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,967
Soo-cheol is trying to meet with him too,

1050
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,468
but it's not easy.

1051
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,805
And this Yoon Eun-sung attended
the same university as Hae-in?

1052
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:56,140
Yes.

1053
01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:00,102
I don't know
what to say to you at times like this.

1054
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,020
Why would you feel bad?

1055
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,397
I should've introduced

1056
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,650
someone like him to Ms. Hong Hae-in.

1057
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:09,403
What can she do? She dug her own grave.

1058
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,448
Still, I regret not trying harder.

1059
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:13,407
To do what?

1060
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,250
I think you're mistaken.

1061
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,044
I'm always grateful

1062
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,840
that you didn't try harder.

1063
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:33,302
I'm truly thankful
that you excluded me from your list

1064
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,678
of marriage candidates.

1065
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:39,057
So spare yourself that useless guilt.

1066
01:14:42,352 --> 01:14:43,228
Why did you call?

1067
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,771
You overheard us.

1068
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,941
Invite Yoon Eun-sung to our family hunt.

1069
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:55,991
Right. I can guarantee
that he'll come if I tell him to.

1070
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,080
But why should I do that?
I have no reason to.

1071
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:05,792
I'll withdraw…

1072
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:09,254
the lawsuit.

1073
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:40,619
Hae-in.

1074
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,626
Here is the number of preys you can catch.

1075
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,794
There's no limit for magpies and crows.

1076
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:16,798
As for boars, water deer, and pheasants,
you can each catch a maximum of five.

1077
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,636
An accident might occur
if you get in each other's way

1078
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,971
and mistake each other for an animal.

1079
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,724
So make sure you stay in your course.

1080
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,102
You should not hunt boars by yourself.

1081
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:34,399
Do not aim or turn your back on them
if you're alone.

1082
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:35,734
Can we let her use a firearm?

1083
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:36,818
As you already know…

1084
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,154
What can we do? She chose to carry one.

1085
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:41,448
What if she commits murder?

1086
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:48,747
Look at that murderous look.

1087
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,374
She should've gone

1088
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:53,085
to a mental hospital, not jail.

1089
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:55,462
Let's go.

1090
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:57,005
Aunt, we need to move.

1091
01:17:59,966 --> 01:18:01,134
Over here.

1092
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,682
Don't hold the firearm like that.

1093
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:17,776
Did I hit it? I can't see very well.

1094
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:19,653
You did, Father.

1095
01:18:19,736 --> 01:18:22,614
The biggest one fell. Gosh.

1096
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,033
I saw it too, Grandfather. Gosh!

1097
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,912
Did you? I believe I did as well.

1098
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:30,539
You did.

1099
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:33,750
Did you really get it?

1100
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,378
I don't think any of them fell.

1101
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:44,010
Hyun-woo, are you a Native American?

1102
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,596
Or a Mongolian hunter?
Is your vision that great?

1103
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,765
I think it fell into the woods.

1104
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:51,184
I'll tell our men to get it.

1105
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,397
What if Hyun-woo goes home
empty-handed this year as well?

1106
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:56,356
Right.

1107
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:57,983
He's right.

1108
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:02,779
You've never caught anything on our hunts.

1109
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,952
We come here every year. You should learn.

1110
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,913
Are you afraid of guns?
You served in the military.

1111
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,373
So? Should I teach you?

1112
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,584
That's okay.
You should worry about yourself.

1113
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,962
I'm already good at it.
That's why I offered to teach you.

1114
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,215
What about you? Are you any good?

1115
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,094
I'm not sure.
I doubt I can hold a candle to you all.

1116
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,263
He's humble in every way.

1117
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,348
Right.

1118
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:34,436
Let's see who'll catch the pheasants
for this year's dumpling soup.

1119
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:35,604
Let's begin.

1120
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,564
Let's go.

1121
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:39,232
-Let's go.
-All right.

1122
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,334
Catch something for once.

1123
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:02,589
There's a reason why
my grandfather brings us to this mountain

1124
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:04,257
to hunt every year.

1125
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,258
What is it?

1126
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:09,054
Does he want us to pretend
like he successfully shot a duck

1127
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:10,096
and praise him?

1128
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,350
Stamina is important when hunting,

1129
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:16,061
but quick judgment
and objective decision are also required.

1130
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:19,606
And those are all virtues
that those who do business should have.

1131
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,525
Is that why you catch so many every year?

1132
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:23,944
To prove to him
that you're a worthy businesswoman?

1133
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,904
Of course.

1134
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:29,241
And I'll catch the most this year as well.

1135
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,079
Take your time.

1136
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,337
Yes, it's ready.

1137
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,383
It's near the middle

1138
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,343
of that course.

1139
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,470
WILD BOAR HABITAT

1140
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,389
RESTRICTED AREA
PROPERTY OWNED BY QUEENS

1141
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,494
Where in the world is she?

1142
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,163
Your call cannot be connected.

1143
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,248
Darn it.

1144
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:47,110
Sorry. I thought you were a water deer.

1145
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:49,487
Why are you here?

1146
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,740
This isn't your course.

1147
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,201
Is it not? This is my first time hunting.

1148
01:21:56,286 --> 01:22:00,290
Don't you know it could be fatal to invade
someone else's territory when hunting?

1149
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,128
I didn't know that.

1150
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:09,007
I look forward to learning more from you.

1151
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:27,484
You shouldn't do anything
in other people's territory.

1152
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,030
You wanted me to teach you, didn't you?

1153
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:57,263
What's wrong with me?

1154
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,558
That's just a dumpling.

1155
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,894
That's just pheasant soup.

1156
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,270
It's a pheasant dumpling.

1157
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,148
Pheasant soup.

1158
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:16,426
Don't fool yourself. This isn't real.

1159
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:18,428
Snap out of it, Hae-in.

1160
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,556
Snap out of it.

1161
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,038
What do you say?

1162
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:54,214
I'm dying. I have three months left.

1163
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:56,966
I love you, Hong Hae-in.

1164
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,302
I love you.

1165
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,796
Are you okay?

1166
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:59,696
You refused to date
that civil servant or that music teacher.

1167
01:25:59,779 --> 01:26:01,573
Why do you suddenly want a housewife?

1168
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:04,325
Didn't you say
that intern was going to get fired soon?

1169
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,702
Someone who's jobless?

1170
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:09,706
I don't want to pressure you, but how
will you save up money to buy a house?

1171
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:10,665
I agree.

1172
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:14,043
I didn't expect a wealthy daughter-in-law

1173
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,379
just because you studied law at SNU.

1174
01:26:16,462 --> 01:26:17,839
I just hoped

1175
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,133
she wouldn't be poorer than us.
That's all.

1176
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:22,760
-Exactly.
-I've never felt this way before.

1177
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:27,724
She's always

1178
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:30,351
on my mind.

1179
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:33,730
I wonder why her clothes
always have holes in them.

1180
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:37,483
I'm worried
that she'll go around kicking things.

1181
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,986
I'm worried that she'll get scolded again.

1182
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:41,946
I think of her when I eat tasty food.

1183
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,448
I want to bring her some.

1184
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,283
I'm so distracted

1185
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,494
because of her.

1186
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:50,914
She'll be the death of me.

1187
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,295
Then marry her.

1188
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,923
-Honey.
-Mom.

1189
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,466
Marry her if it's that serious.

1190
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,885
It's better than dying.

1191
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:06,679
Yes, that's true but…

1192
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,934
Yes, I will.

1193
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,731
We're going to get married.

1194
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,903
And I'll protect her forever.

1195
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,664
QUEEN OF TEARS

1196
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:02,902
Are there women whose hearts still race

1197
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:05,238
when they see their husbands
despite being married

1198
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:06,864
for over three years?

1199
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:09,117
No way.

1200
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,577
I noticed that the fence was pried open.

1201
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,247
You actually believe that he loves you.

1202
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:15,665
Yes, I do.

1203
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:21,129
I've never been this annoyed
at someone's smile.

1204
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:23,047
I'm going to kill

1205
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,383
every single scumbag who betrays

1206
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:27,343
and stabs me in the back.

1207
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,762
Don't be afraid.

1208
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:32,890
It was because I was scared.

1209
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,143
That's why my heart was racing so much.

1210
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:41,941
