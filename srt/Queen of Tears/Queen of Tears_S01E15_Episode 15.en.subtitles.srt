00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,983
QUEEN OF TEARS

2
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,526
EPISODE 15

3
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,602
Baek Hyun-woo.

4
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,688
Baek Hyun-woo.

5
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,191
Baek Hyun-woo.

6
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,991
Don't forget that name.

7
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,953
Baek Hyun-woo.

8
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,206
Baek Hyun-woo.

9
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,375
Baek Hyun-woo.

10
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,503
Baek Hyun-woo.

11
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,270
Why did they change her doctor
and nurses all of a sudden?

12
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,396
Beats me.

13
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,525
That guy is Ms. Hong's fiancé,
and he spoke with the director.

14
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,528
He donated a ton to the foundation too.

15
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,781
The director told us
to keep our mouths shut

16
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,574
or else we'd get sued.

17
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,034
What about the other guy?

18
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,953
-Wasn't he her fiancé?
-I don't know.

19
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,871
He claims to be her fiancé too.

20
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,873
I wonder who the real one is.

21
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,214
So…

22
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,300
my ex-husband had followed me here?

23
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,218
Yes.

24
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,846
He persistently asked you
prior to the surgery

25
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,056
to revise your will.

26
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,182
Of course, you refused.

27
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,184
We got into an accident
before the surgery.

28
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,229
A truck crashed into our vehicle.

29
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,023
I believe he was behind it.

30
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,484
-No way.
-Baek Hyun-woo won't hesitate

31
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,028
to do anything when he has a grudge.

32
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,905
He threatened me numerous times.

33
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,284
How did we survive the crash?

34
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,368
Right.

35
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,914
Thankfully, we weren't in the car.

36
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,292
But I thought you were, so I hurt my hand

37
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,294
trying to break the window.

38
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,633
Are you okay?

39
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,679
It's nothing.

40
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:10,059
I just want to stop
seeing you being tormented by him.

41
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,105
When he had an affair
and wanted to divorce you…

42
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,862
you tried to take your own life.

43
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,743
I tried to kill myself
over a guy who cheated on me?

44
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,413
I was pathetic.

45
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,957
Not at all.
You were too softhearted and kind.

46
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,170
I couldn't do anything back then

47
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,672
since you were still married,
but not anymore.

48
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,383
I'm going to keep you safe no matter what.

49
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,975
This is the bus stop
near Sambang Reservoir.

50
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,101
Isn't that you?

51
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,562
Why were you there
around the time of his death?

52
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,565
We had agreed to meet,
but he never showed up.

53
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,359
Is that so? Then why was your hair found

54
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,570
in the victim's car?

55
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,864
I believe it was planted.

56
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,032
All right.

57
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:07,950
How about this?

58
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,203
We found this knife near the crime scene.

59
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,997
It had your fingerprints and his blood.

60
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,583
His puncture wounds match the blade.

61
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,835
-Will you still play dumb?
-If I had

62
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,504
truly used that knife,

63
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,631
then would I have left it behind?

64
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,467
Did you get that injury from stabbing him?

65
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,969
I was in an accident in Germany.

66
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,223
I hurt myself
while trying to break a car window.

67
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,559
If I had gotten this because
my hand slipped while using the knife,

68
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,562
the cut would've been in my palm,

69
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,688
not the back of my hand.

70
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,898
I don't believe you.

71
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,566
Claim innocence all you want,

72
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,945
but it won't be easy
with all the solid evidence that we have.

73
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,364
Coming clean will grant you
a lighter sentence.

74
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,282
Shouldn't you know
as an attorney yourself?

75
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,792
Hyun-woo, if this ever happens again,

76
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,211
don't save me.

77
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,241
When he had an affair
and wanted to divorce you,

78
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,951
you tried to take your own life.

79
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,046
HYUN-WOO
HAE-IN

80
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,174
ONE MONTH LATER

81
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,343
-Hae-in!
-Hae-in!

82
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,803
It's me, Mom. Do you recognize me?

83
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,931
Goodness. How are you?

84
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,932
Are you well now?

85
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,017
Hae-in, it must've been rough.

86
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,607
Hello.

87
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,610
Father.

88
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,404
Mother. Aunt.

89
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,951
Hong Soo-cheol, ma'am.

90
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,288
I've heard a lot about you.

91
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,208
We should grab a meal sometime.

92
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:05,586
Hae-in?

93
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,004
Hae-in…

94
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,091
is a bit tired from flying.

95
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,970
She should go home and rest.

96
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,972
You have no right to butt in.

97
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,931
Mr. Hong.

98
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,434
Please mind your manners
in front of Mr. Yoon.

99
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,019
-Hae-in.
-Hae-in.

100
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,273
Do you even know
what he did to our family?

101
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,278
They'll claim that I kicked them out
and took over Queens.

102
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,487
But here's the truth.

103
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,073
Chairman was sick
of his family fighting over his money

104
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,284
and gave me his position
before he passed away.

105
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,369
He also asked
my mother to take over his assets.

106
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,621
He wanted you to inherit everything,

107
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,416
but he knew
the family wouldn't allow that.

108
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,751
Your so-called family members

109
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,588
were delighted to hear
that you were dying soon.

110
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,591
Sure.

111
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,261
I have a rough idea.
I read many news articles as well.

112
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:59,348
I believe we were never close enough
to be this happy

113
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,683
about seeing each other.

114
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,518
Did my family ever reach out to me?

115
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,812
Yes, and they talked about the same thing.

116
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,732
They wanted your voting right
for the stockholders' meeting.

117
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,401
They're worried
because I want to reinstate you.

118
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,778
They wanted to speak to you,
but I said no.

119
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,114
You had asked me
to do so prior to the surgery.

120
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,327
Seeing how I came here alone
for this major surgery shows

121
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,787
what kind of relationship we had.

122
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,205
I must've lived

123
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,874
a lonely life.

124
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,334
You did.

125
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,877
You were always alone.

126
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,755
But the same goes for me.

127
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,886
That's why all we had was each other.

128
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,973
Don't trust your family.

129
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,727
I don't want them to exploit you

130
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,437
anymore.

131
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,566
You're wrong.

132
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,778
I don't know what he told you,
but don't trust him.

133
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,196
Trust your family instead.

134
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,616
I heard you carried around
a talisman in your wallet,

135
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,910
hoping that it'd weaken my energy.

136
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,079
Gosh.

137
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,456
-You told her?
-I was stating a fact.

138
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,833
Mom gave it to me.

139
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,381
That's not important right now.

140
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,675
-Hae-in--
-I heard

141
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,678
you sued me
for the department store in Gwanggyo.

142
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,223
Then I dropped the lawsuit right away.

143
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,100
I'm not trying to confront you.

144
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,936
I just hope you won't think
that our bad blood

145
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,313
can be erased
just because I lost my memory.

146
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,484
Hae-in.
It's true that our family had issues.

147
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,861
But we can explain everything.

148
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,280
Yes, and he shouldn't be here.

149
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,449
Your husband should be here instead.

150
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,452
Right. Do you mean my ex-husband?

151
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,247
Who secretly prepared the divorce papers
before I found out?

152
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,124
What?

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,876
That's true, but…

154
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,588
You make him sound very evil,

155
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,257
but it's a long story.

156
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,634
I heard he's imprisoned for murder.

157
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,062
You won't go anywhere, right?

158
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,731
You need to be by my side
when I open my eyes.

159
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,748
Why do you want to go home?

160
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,501
I already got a place where you can stay.

161
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,463
I want to go back home
and live the way I used to.

162
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,174
It might help me regain my memory.

163
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,718
I want to do that.

164
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:46,015
I'm worried that your family
might get in your way.

165
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,976
Your parents made it very hard
for you to be reinstated.

166
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,896
The directors kept claiming
how you were incompetent

167
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,564
-due to your condition.
-I know.

168
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,982
I'll make sure that won't happen.

169
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,400
Thanks for your concern.

170
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,152
You've thanked me enough.

171
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,947
Keep your promise.

172
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,617
You said we'd get married

173
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,535
after the surgery.

174
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,165
Leave the wedding preparations to me.

175
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,515
Hello.

176
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,517
-Long time no see.
-I have a question.

177
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,645
There was a car crash
prior to Hae-in's surgery.

178
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,939
-Were you behind it?
-Yes.

179
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,490
She didn't die though.

180
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,116
So what's the issue?

181
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,123
What's with that look? You knew.

182
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,959
I already warned you that

183
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,920
she could get hurt again
if you remained by her side.

184
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,798
And it won't change.

185
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,675
Are you done threatening me?

186
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,385
Then it's my turn.

187
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,391
It was this room, wasn't it?

188
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,476
Where Chairman Hong collapsed.

189
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,397
I saw what you did through that painting

190
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,357
that I had gifted him.

191
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
I have evidence.

192
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,579
So touch Hae-in one more time,

193
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,957
and I will put you behind bars
like I did with Hyun-woo.

194
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,417
How…

195
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,545
How… dare you?

196
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,546
That's right.

197
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,798
I'm your obstacle now.

198
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,718
Get rid of me if you dare.

199
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,646
What if she says
she's going to marry Eun-sung?

200
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,440
-No way.
-I could totally see that coming

201
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,649
judging by what I saw today.

202
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,734
She's a different person.

203
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,444
No, she won't do that.

204
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,864
Actually, I've been keeping an eye on her.

205
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,742
Hong Gil-dong's Detective Agency?

206
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,828
Yes, Gil-dong is our family's ancestor.

207
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,830
People also called me one of a kind

208
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,582
and praised my many talents.

209
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,042
So I've kept that name.

210
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,877
What?

211
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,379
Subtract ten billion
and give 1.5 billion to Mr. Kim.

212
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,464
The building can stay.

213
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,467
-I bought it out of boredom.
-It's okay. He's a detective too.

214
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,345
I see. Disguising myself
is my second nature.

215
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,262
I see.

216
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
Mr. Nam, come out.

217
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,808
Staking out is my second nature.

218
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,521
They're my right and left hands.

219
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,149
They're ordinary-looking as you can see,

220
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,525
so they can get in anywhere.

221
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,195
Detective Hong is the brain of our agency.

222
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,906
She's always been a bookworm
and used to have

223
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,240
a book-related business.

224
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,159
What kind of business?

225
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,203
I ran a comic book store.

226
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,998
Comic books are the ultimate database
that contain

227
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,041
all kinds of cases.

228
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,293
They're the foundation of my work.

229
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,046
Which cases have you investigated?

230
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,673
Any famous ones?

231
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,426
That's for you to find out.

232
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,555
A competent detective
wouldn't ask such a question.

233
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,309
By the way,
how much of the expenses do you reimburse?

234
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,394
Ma'am.

235
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,480
Let me ask the trivial questions.
How much is the food compensation?

236
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,774
We charge 8,000 won per meal,
but it's a bit tight.

237
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,360
Seafood jajangmyeon costs 12,000 won
in our neighborhood.

238
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,196
-What?
-The prices nowadays are crazy, right?

239
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,116
We should focus on the economy
rather than the suspect.

240
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,162
He's tight-lipped.

241
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,540
Tight-lipped. Write that down.

242
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,458
Goodness.

243
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,044
-You were here already.
-Yes, sir.

244
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,547
Good work.

245
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,048
Who are they?

246
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,343
They followed Hae-in
to Germany and kept me updated.

247
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,639
Our Hong Gil-dong's Detective Agency
will always give you a discount.

248
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,600
We keep an eye on our target,
analyze the cause and their psychology,

249
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,103
offer a solution,
and even give you a warranty.

250
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,439
We offer the full package
as we follow our target.

251
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,356
Goodness.

252
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,316
Not bad, you guys.

253
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,901
-So tell me.
-What?

254
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,362
-What did you find out?
-We'll tell you now.

255
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,907
You'll be free of all your worries.

256
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,193
Why is it so empty?

257
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,787
We slept in different rooms.

258
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,663
Is that it?

259
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,992
We have a similar taste in music.

260
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,289
Sure, that's possible.

261
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,710
What kind of person is he?

262
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,589
I'd be unbeatable
if I knew my enemy and myself.

263
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,424
But I don't know myself.

264
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,009
In that case,

265
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,012
shouldn't I at least know my enemy?

266
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:09,898
Yes.

267
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,152
This is the safest place to see him.

268
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,862
How heinous could he be

269
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,905
that he's here after stalking his ex-wife

270
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,074
whom he cheated on and murdering someone?

271
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,955
I must've been a bad judge of character.

272
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,957
Why would I fall for him?

273
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,542
Hae-in.

274
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,880
Sit down, Mr. Baek.

275
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,022
Are you healthy now?

276
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,358
If not, why would I be here?

277
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,861
Did the surgery go well?

278
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,448
Are you still getting treatment?
Are you in pain?

279
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,825
Are you worried about me?

280
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,666
I was…

281
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,087
I was very worried.

282
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,546
That's funny.

283
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,759
You must think I'm stupid
since I lost my memory.

284
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,969
I missed you too.

285
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,477
I know everything.

286
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,730
I know why you married me,

287
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,359
how you prepared for the divorce,
and what you did afterward.

288
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,528
I heard and confirmed it all.

289
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,823
Hae-in.

290
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,118
I don't know what Eun-sung told you,

291
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,995
but none of it is true.

292
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,706
I know you're confused,

293
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,457
but if you trust me--

294
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,959
I only believe what I see.

295
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,169
The divorce papers
you prepared behind my back

296
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,714
and the fact that you're in here
as a murder suspect

297
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,215
are what I've confirmed.

298
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,551
Then why did you come here?

299
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,470
If you confirmed and know everything,

300
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,848
then why are you here?

301
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,559
Isn't it because you're doubtful?

302
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,020
I came here…

303
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,733
because…

304
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,446
Let's just say

305
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,116
it's so that we won't ever meet again.

306
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,494
I was curious to be honest.

307
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,787
But now that we've met,

308
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,165
we won't see each other again.

309
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,249
No.

310
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,294
We will meet again.

311
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,255
Because I won't give up.

312
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,091
I'll stay by your side.

313
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,720
That's rich coming from someone
who's locked up.

314
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,527
I promised…

315
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,949
to be by your side when you woke up.

316
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:50,952
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

317
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,456
I'm truly sorry

318
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,875
that you had to come here.

319
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,877
But…

320
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,463
I'll get out no matter what.

321
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,882
I promise you this.

322
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,926
So you--

323
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:06,885
Inmate 9971.

324
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,095
Your time is up.

325
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,473
Eat well, don't worry about anything,

326
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,600
and continue getting treatment.

327
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,518
Inmate 9971.

328
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,686
Just stay healthy.

329
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,315
Please do that for me. Okay?

330
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,275
Hae-in.

331
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,006
KOREA CORRECTIONAL SERVICE

332
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,594
I almost answered back.

333
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,056
He's very cunning.

334
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,600
How could he be so deceiving
even as an inmate?

335
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,312
I can understand
how he duped me in the past.

336
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,732
He sure is eloquent.

337
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,370
I need nausea medication. My heart

338
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,039
is racing.

339
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,125
I feel nauseous.

340
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,919
I'm so out of it.

341
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,004
One minute.

342
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,968
I'm so dizzy that I want to cry.

343
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,017
Thank you.

344
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,696
Where have you been?

345
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,533
Why are you here?

346
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,869
Answer me first. Where have you been?

347
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,456
I don't want to answer.

348
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,541
Can you leave?

349
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,003
I don't want anyone to be here
without my permission even if it's you.

350
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,464
Right.

351
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,591
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,260
But you're still receiving treatment,
and I told you.

353
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,346
You were in danger multiple times.

354
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:15,931
I know.

355
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,141
And Hyun-woo was behind them.

356
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,143
But he's locked up, so aren't I safe?

357
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,356
I'm just…

358
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,781
anxious when you're not around

359
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,282
since things keep happening.

360
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,037
I'm sorry for worrying you.

361
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,126
All right.

362
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,629
Rest up.

363
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,639
No way. I guess the rumors
about their marriage is true.

364
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,350
Is it over with Director Baek?

365
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,977
Watch what you say.

366
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,937
We all signed the NDA.

367
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,023
-Especially you.
-What's there to worry about?

368
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,108
I no longer work for her.

369
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,736
We won't see each other.

370
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,866
Ms. Hong!

371
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,535
Hello.

372
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,329
I heard about you.

373
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,456
Are you all better now?

374
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,373
Yes.

375
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,417
I'm truly relieved. Really.

376
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,628
Thanks to you paying
for the surgery and the hospital fee,

377
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,713
Cho-rong…

378
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,466
She has a real name now.

379
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,383
So-yul.

380
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,969
So-yul is healthy now.

381
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,139
I'm glad.

382
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,183
Thank you so much. I'll never forget this.

383
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,860
-Did I do that?
-Sorry?

384
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,737
Did I really do what he said?

385
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,323
I'm not sure. It was before I got hired.

386
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,746
Thank you for keeping your promise.

387
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,706
Promise? What promise?

388
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,920
You promised to return before I finished
paying off the installments for this.

389
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,756
So you were my secretary?

390
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,882
Yes.

391
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,550
Then you must know a lot about me.

392
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,262
Of course.
Consider me a human external hard drive.

393
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,807
I see. In that case,

394
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,683
what kind of person was I?

395
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,103
Well…

396
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,813
You were--

397
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,897
Ms. Hong.

398
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,025
Ms. Hong, I was elated to hear

399
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,986
that you came back. Are you well now?

400
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,364
She's an employee whom you knew.

401
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,782
Hello.

402
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,367
Thanks to you,

403
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,079
my mother received all her treatments
and passed away in peace.

404
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,791
You sent flowers to her funeral,
covered the cost,

405
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,209
and even came by.

406
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,753
You may not remember, but I always will.

407
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,879
Thank you.

408
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,132
No problem.

409
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:47,809
I sent flowers
to my employee's family member's funeral?

410
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,352
How sensitive of me.

411
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,522
-That was Director Baek--
-What?

412
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,607
It's nothing.

413
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,359
You were a good person.

414
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,238
It's about time we cut off all the brands

415
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,240
that hinder our sales.

416
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,867
You were warmhearted.

417
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,620
Is this creative? Which part? How?

418
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,914
I'm just purely curious.

419
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,999
Answer me.

420
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,418
Which part? How? Why?

421
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,171
-You were kind too.
-Was I really like

422
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,007
Mother Teresa?

423
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,510
Yes, I guess.

424
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,345
I knew it.

425
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,431
I saw a stray cat on my way here,

426
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,184
and I wanted to feed it some snacks.

427
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,769
So I bought some and fed it.

428
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,813
It feels like I'm desperate to do good.

429
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,150
I may have lost my memory,

430
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,819
but my true nature still remains.

431
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,199
I hope we get along.

432
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,743
-Sorry?
-You're my external hard drive.

433
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,662
I'm like a motherboard
that's undergone a factory reset.

434
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,373
I need my external hard drive
that contains my data.

435
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,630
But I'm in another department.

436
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,923
I'll take care of it.

437
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,929
Look through
the prosecution's evidence record.

438
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,056
-What? Why?
-It's a murder case.

439
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,225
They'd want to gather
as much evidence as possible.

440
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,311
If there's anything
they didn't submit as evidence,

441
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,813
it must be in our favor.

442
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,153
So the evidence that they didn't submit

443
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,948
is this component analysis
of the trace evidence at the crime scene?

444
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,491
Yes, a piece of green fiber.

445
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,494
-So it's not Hyun-woo's.
-That's why they omitted it.

446
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,830
I think it was from
the real killer's clothes.

447
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,749
And we need to find them.

448
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,626
The knife used as the murder weapon

449
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,628
is indeed mine.

450
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,171
So why was it there?

451
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,632
-Maybe it was stolen.
-I believe

452
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,635
it was missing a few days
before we left for Germany.

453
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,804
-I didn't think much of it though.
-So it was stolen.

454
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,222
I'll check out the CCTV cameras.

455
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,349
One more. Please check the bus dashcams

456
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,060
that operated near the scene
around the time of the murder.

457
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:58,022
Maybe there's a suspicious car,
or the killer could've gotten on a bus.

458
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,570
Hello. How often does it get deleted?

459
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,655
Sir, may I ask you something?

460
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,700
Are there any cameras
near the fishing site?

461
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,377
Dad, I got rid of all of them
from the roof.

462
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,336
Rid of what?

463
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,796
The crows were crying all day.

464
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,382
Hey. I'm glad you did that
before today's hearing.

465
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,550
I mean…

466
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,469
I know the hearing will go well.

467
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,554
I do.

468
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,931
But crows aren't favorable.

469
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,433
Jeez, just eat already.

470
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,394
Honey.

471
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,272
-Not the laver.
-Why not?

472
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,816
You'd be wrapping it.

473
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,820
You're all banned
from wrapping, dunking, or mixing

474
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,488
any food today.

475
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,033
Don't drop anything either.

476
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,535
It'll feel ominous

477
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,870
if you did.

478
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,956
Good morning.

479
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,416
Gosh, it's cold.

480
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,544
Da-hye is tired and wants to sleep in.

481
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,470
No, that doesn't count.

482
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,056
They didn't fall.

483
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,351
Soo-cheol just placed them

484
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,894
on the floor

485
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,104
like this.

486
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,650
He's right. You placed them

487
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,401
on the floor, didn't you?

488
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,861
No, I dropped them.

489
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,781
But I'm pretty easygoing
and don't mind it.

490
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,868
I'll wrap it in some laver,
dunk it in the soup…

491
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,330
This soup is really tasty, ma'am.

492
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,754
The defendant was near the crime scene
around the estimated time

493
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:48,216
of the victim's death
between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.

494
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,719
Plus, the defendant's hair
was found in the victim's car.

495
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,930
The victim's blood
and the defendant's fingerprints

496
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,640
were also found on the murder weapon.

497
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,935
Therefore, we'd like
to charge Baek Hyun-woo for murder.

498
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,561
Do you admit to this charge?

499
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,398
No, Your Honor.

500
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,610
It's true that I had agreed
to meet the victim that day,

501
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,195
but he never showed up.

502
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,989
Therefore, I never got to see him.

503
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,992
The defense may make their argument.

504
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,576
Your Honor.

505
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,328
My client has claimed innocence

506
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,081
since the very beginning
of this investigation.

507
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,291
If it's true,
the true killer is out there.

508
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,837
Let's look at the murder weapon
that the prosecution claims

509
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,089
to be their most decisive evidence.

510
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,716
The kitchen knife had traces

511
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,676
of the defendant prints,
the victim's blood,

512
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,179
as well as a piece of green acrylic.

513
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,766
As you can see,
the defendant wasn't wearing green.

514
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,020
Even still, that can't prove
that it belonged to someone else.

515
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,438
I agree.

516
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,315
However, what if someone dressed in green

517
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,154
stole the knife from his house

518
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,282
which was found near the crime scene?

519
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,299
It's a knife.

520
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,759
Yes, you're right.

521
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,346
It's the knife
that was used in the murder.

522
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,183
He happens to be wearing green as well.

523
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,517
Next footage, please.

524
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,563
The same individual is seen burning

525
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,357
his t-shirt, gloves,
and other clothing about 2 km away

526
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,942
from the crime scene.

527
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,154
I requested an analysis
of the burned fiber and the one

528
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,655
found on the murder weapon.

529
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,200
The infrared spectrophotometer showed…

530
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,911
…that these fibers were identical,

531
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,747
and the victim's blood and DNA
were found on the t-shirt.

532
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,707
This is all circumstantial evidence.

533
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,044
The murder weapon
only had traces of the defendant's prints.

534
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:51,005
What if I have even more definite proof?

535
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,174
For example,
photos and videos of the crime scene

536
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,134
that the killer took himself.

537
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,346
He must've taken photos or videos.

538
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,722
We need his phone.

539
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,183
Do you mean he recorded his own crime?

540
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,936
Yes, if he was a hitman.

541
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,730
He needs proof to get paid.

542
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,524
He needs to click on this URL.

543
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,362
YOUR ITEM WILL BE DELIVERED AT 2:00 P.M.

544
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,279
COPYING…

545
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,116
He did it. I can now duplicate his phone!

546
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,867
An anonymous individual

547
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,077
sent me photos and videos

548
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,579
of the crime scene
that were in the killer's phone.

549
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,540
-I'll submit this as evidence.
-Objection.

550
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,126
We did not agree
on this evidence beforehand.

551
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,003
It could've been acquired illegally.
Please dismiss it.

552
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,465
This decisive evidence
will greatly affect the trial!

553
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,522
BENCH

554
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,439
I'll accept it.

555
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,880
The real killer of the Yeongjin-gun
Sambang Reservoir Murder

556
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,173
has been arrested.

557
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,341
The Busan Coast Guard arrested Yoo

558
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,677
who was attempting
to stow away on a fishing boat

559
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,430
at 11:00 p.m. last night
about nine nautical miles south.

560
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,309
Yoo claims that he committed
the crime single-handedly.

561
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,187
Meanwhile, Baek,
who was arrested as the suspect,

562
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,814
was acquitted
during today's first hearing.

563
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,482
He was set free immediately.

564
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,320
Why isn't he coming out?

565
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,155
Did something happen?

566
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,073
He'll come out when it's time.

567
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,576
But why are we here?

568
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,787
I should be on my toes
since my dangerous stalker

569
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,915
-has been set free.
-He didn't stalk--

570
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,752
To be honest, you're more like a stalker.

571
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,420
-I'm not--
-There he is.

572
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,011
Over here!

573
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,222
My baby brother!

574
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,729
I can't believe this.

575
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,481
Are you okay?

576
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,523
I'm fine.

577
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,566
Gosh.

578
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,776
You must've been worried.

579
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,487
I guess everyone has their set quantity
of problems in life.

580
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,906
Hyeon-tae and I
always caused trivial problems,

581
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,407
but never anything this big.

582
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,993
Hyun-woo didn't do anything.
He was framed.

583
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,995
Yes, you're right.

584
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,831
-Gosh.
-You're safe now, okay?

585
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,753
What?

586
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,838
I guess they're close.

587
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,058
"An amicable family."

588
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,688
-Eat this.
-No thanks.

589
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,981
-What?
-It's okay.

590
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,358
I guess he doesn't eat tofu.

591
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,403
"Doesn't eat tofu."

592
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,031
Does he dislike it?

593
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,451
-Why? It's tasty.
-What are you doing?

594
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,919
What are you doing?

595
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,547
Did he see me?

596
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,841
-He did, didn't he?
-He left.

597
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:24,969
Did he?

598
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,354
Good. Let's secretly follow them.

599
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,024
What? Are we seriously stalking him?

600
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,234
Of course not. I just want

601
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:45,239
to keep an eye on him
and see if he'll scheme anything else.

602
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,366
That's what stalking is.

603
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,160
Just get going already.

604
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,588
Make sure it's leveled right.

605
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,423
I'm doing it right now.

606
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,758
Go down if you're scared.

607
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,926
I need to check though.

608
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,556
Du-gwan, will you be okay?

609
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,143
Of course. If I could,
I'd hand out everything for free.

610
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,770
HYUN-WOO DISCHARGED
HALF PRICE SALE!

611
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,480
Would you like to buy that too?

612
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,026
Goodness, you must like dumplings.

613
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,944
This is on the house.

614
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,905
Why, thank you.

615
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,324
-I'm more thankful.
-Congratulations as well.

616
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,492
Thank you, ma'am.

617
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,702
Goodbye.

618
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,329
Goodbye, ma'am.

619
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,917
Do you finally get
my marketing philosophy?

620
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,878
Totally. I should ask
my customers for love,

621
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,837
not money.

622
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,797
Exactly.

623
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,007
I'm following that philosophy
when I go back.

624
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,592
Good.

625
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,010
Good luck.

626
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,013
Sir, are these steamed buns half off too?

627
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,765
Steamed buns? Hey!

628
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,809
Half off, my foot!

629
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,143
Move aside.

630
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,563
They're free. Knock yourselves out.

631
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,735
The ice cream is free too!

632
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,237
Won't he regret it tomorrow?

633
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,531
Tomorrow? He'll regret it tonight.

634
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,659
Hey, get in line!

635
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,910
That must be Hyun-woo.

636
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,996
Goodness! Hey!

637
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,873
YONGDU-RI SUPERMARKET

638
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,500
-Goodness!
-Honey.

639
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,752
It's Hyun-woo.

640
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,134
I'm home, Father.

641
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:29,844
Good.

642
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,595
Welcome home.

643
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,931
I'm sorry.

644
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,182
Don't say that.

645
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,645
Why would you apologize
when you did nothing wrong?

646
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,481
-Well done, Hyun-woo.
-Congratulations.

647
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,649
You did well.

648
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,484
-Congratulations.
-Well done.

649
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,736
It must've been tough.

650
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,946
Thank you.

651
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,830
Welcome back, Hyun-woo.

652
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,665
Isn't that Soo-cheol?

653
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,918
Yes, he's been staying here
and avoiding his mother.

654
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,295
But why here?

655
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,132
It's his sister's
ex-husband's parents' house.

656
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,300
Is he comfortable?

657
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,302
I guess.

658
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,471
Look at how happy they are.

659
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,932
They're such an odd family.

660
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,728
It's snowing!

661
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,397
-Gosh!
-Gosh!

662
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,416
Honey.

663
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,710
Mom.

664
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:46,921
You're back.

665
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,132
I made sweet red-bean porridge,
your favorite.

666
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,847
You must've been so worried.

667
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,974
Hey, I didn't worry

668
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,809
one bit

669
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,063
because justice will always prevail.

670
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,190
Not me.

671
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,193
I was worried sick.

672
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,779
-Me too.
-Me too.

673
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,115
My poor baby went through so much.

674
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,328
I was worried sick!

675
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,164
His parents look kind.

676
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,254
He must not like tofu,
but enjoy sweet red-bean porridge.

677
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,838
Is he a kid or what?

678
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,051
"Enjoys eating…

679
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,264
sweet red-bean porridge."

680
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,266
You remind me of myself in the past.

681
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,850
What do you mean?

682
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,103
I was like you
before I fell in love with BTS.

683
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,729
True love isn't,

684
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:49,149
"Gosh, I love him so much."

685
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,236
It's, "What is this? What's his deal?"

686
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,862
That's how it begins.

687
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,784
Did you always
speak your mind in front of me?

688
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,702
Yes.

689
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,289
I was a laid-back boss.

690
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,165
Do you not remember anything?

691
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,126
Then…

692
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,628
do you remember agreeing
to give me 100 million?

693
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,923
There's no way.

694
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,636
You may not remember,
but you still have clear judgment.

695
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,763
So why don't you know?

696
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,640
Know what?

697
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,185
Whom you truly love.

698
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,731
And who's that?

699
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,069
I can't say since my job is on the line.

700
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,155
But I'll say this.

701
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,324
Your heart lies

702
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,492
where your body goes.

703
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,278
What is that?

704
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,491
Mr. Ivan found it in the trash
and said we should look for its owner.

705
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,700
Does it have a name?

706
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:26,121
No, and I can't read it
since it's in a foreign language.

707
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,498
Then how will we find its owner?

708
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,999
Just throw it away.

709
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,209
Maybe it's that notebook.

710
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,669
Mr. Baek's attorney

711
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:37,216
called from Korea and asked us
to return a notebook to him.

712
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,884
-I'll be going.
-Okay, bye.

713
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,263
Yeong-song.

714
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,765
She's back again.

715
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,754
Aunt Beom-ja,
do you live here or something?

716
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,467
I'm here to congratulate Hyun-woo.

717
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,469
The catering service will arrive soon.

718
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,513
Should I tell them
to go to the community hall?

719
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,973
Hello, Beom-ja.

720
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,308
Goodness. You were here too.

721
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,312
I prepared many gifts, too,
because I was in a good mood.

722
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,814
-Come by later.
-Gosh, gifts?

723
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,982
Such as?

724
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,317
Supplements and massagers.

725
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,862
The grand prize
is the latest front load washer.

726
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:40,779
Gosh, a washer?

727
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,573
-No way.
-A washer?

728
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,075
Goodness, we were planning
on getting a new one.

729
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,412
Is this how the rich flex their money?

730
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,373
I'd love to live like her in my next life.

731
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,667
Like me? And what's that?

732
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,336
You have money. You're gorgeous.

733
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,338
And, most of all,
you got married three times.

734
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,466
I'm the most envious of that.

735
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,968
You don't need to mention that.

736
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:03,886
Why not?

737
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,512
Not everyone can do that.

738
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,514
Gosh, I agree.

739
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,642
I can't change my washer,
let alone my husband.

740
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,979
Don't say that in front of a bachelor.

741
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,898
By the way,
will you really not get married?

742
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,858
I can vouch for that kindergarten teacher.

743
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,319
Bang-sil's right.
She really jumped through hoops.

744
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,403
Just meet that lady.

745
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,321
Guys.

746
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:23,822
You shouldn't let him

747
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,157
decide for himself.

748
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,533
You need to urge him on.

749
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,744
You need to push ahead.

750
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,786
How about next week?

751
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,079
-Yeong-song--
-Excuse me.

752
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,248
Where's the community hall again?

753
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,000
LUCKY DRAWS

754
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,086
CELEBRATING BAEK HYUN-WOO'S DISCHARGE

755
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,843
Applaud!

756
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,931
Everyone! I'd like to thank you all

757
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,392
for attending
the celebration of my brother

758
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,811
Baek Hyun-woo's discharge!

759
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,942
Here's the highlight of the party.

760
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,320
He'll cut the tofu. Applaud!

761
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,868
Let's do it together.

762
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,411
Okay. One, two, three.

763
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,289
That's a clean cut.

764
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,833
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

765
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,293
I got it!

766
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,587
I won a TV!

767
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,467
The next prize is supplements.

768
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,597
My sister, Ms. Baek Mi-seon,
will pick the winner.

769
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,890
Come on out.

770
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,105
Pick one.

771
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,111
The lucky number is…

772
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,824
seventeen!

773
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,243
Who is it?

774
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,911
-It's Bang-sil!
-It's me!

775
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,746
It's me!

776
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,956
Bang-sil!

777
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,421
Congratulations.

778
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,090
Thanks, Hyun-woo.
I'll become even prettier now.

779
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,761
Congratulations.

780
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,599
-The long-awaited grand prize…
-I'm fated to never go hungry.

781
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,684
…the washer, is the only one left.

782
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,270
Ms. Hong Beom-ja,
who prepared all these gifts,

783
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,981
will announce the winner. Applaud!

784
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,877
The winner is…

785
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,590
Five! Congratulations!

786
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,675
Who is it?

787
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,055
-What?
-Gosh, it's Yeong-song!

788
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,514
Yeong-song, you won!

789
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,059
It's Yeong-song!

790
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,602
Yeong-song!

791
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,020
It's yours!

792
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,438
You won!

793
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,939
-Gosh.
-You can have it.

794
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,608
What?

795
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,109
-Really?
-Why?

796
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,278
I don't need one, but you guys do.

797
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,364
-Seriously?
-No way!

798
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,168
Thank you!

799
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,844
YONGDU-RI COMMUNITY HALL

800
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,471
Wait, Mr. Kim!

801
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,432
Yes, Beom-ja?

802
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,393
How are you so selfless?

803
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,144
You won a washer.

804
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,104
It's yours.

805
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,731
But my washer works just fine.

806
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,609
I know it's very old
and unstable. I saw it.

807
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,778
It still does its job.

808
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,864
This one is the latest model.

809
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,451
It has an AI system.
It can wash blankets and shoes.

810
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,328
I see.

811
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,581
"I see"?

812
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,751
You should grab onto opportunities.

813
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,213
The same goes for washers and people.
Why won't you grab onto them?

814
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,804
I won't be coming back here
once I leave today.

815
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,848
Will you still not grab onto me?

816
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,933
What if you never see me again?

817
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,144
What's stopping me
from getting married again?

818
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,605
Are you getting married again?

819
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,817
That's not what I meant.

820
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,407
I'll say this once.

821
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,328
I'm interested in you.

822
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:41,997
No.

823
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,582
I like you.

824
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,835
So won't you do anything about it?

825
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,839
Once I leave, I won't be returning.

826
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,431
Ms. Hong--

827
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,640
One minute.

828
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,018
I have a question to ask him.

829
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:03,935
I'll go in soon.

830
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,729
-That's not why.
-What?

831
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,522
-What is it?
-Well…

832
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,648
That…

833
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,608
This thing…

834
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,570
It's wireless.

835
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,865
It's connected to the indoor speakers.

836
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,495
The same goes for washers and people.

837
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,954
Why won't you grab onto them?

838
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,581
I won't be coming back here

839
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,957
once I leave today.

840
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,751
Will you still not grab onto me?

841
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,169
What if you never see me again?

842
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,087
What's stopping me
from getting married again?

843
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,005
Goodness!

844
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:32,923
She's so cool.

845
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,341
Gosh.

846
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,385
Are you getting married again?

847
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,303
Is he stupid?

848
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,680
That's not what she meant.

849
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,724
That's not what I meant.

850
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,686
I'll say this once.

851
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,438
I'm interested in you.

852
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,481
No.

853
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,398
I like you.

854
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,737
So won't you do anything about it?
Once I leave, I won't be returning.

855
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,113
Goodness.

856
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,867
She's an embarrassment to our family.

857
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,753
Yeong-song! Answer wisely!

858
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,547
Aunt Beom-ja!

859
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,589
It's okay!

860
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,008
-It's all right!
-Damn it.

861
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,219
Where are you going? No, wait!

862
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,597
No, you should keep nudging him!

863
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,182
Keep going!

864
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,476
Go after her! Hurry!

865
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,188
Yeong-song!

866
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:37,028
Sir, Baek Hyun-woo asked
the personnel committee to reinstate him.

867
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,697
His murder charge was dropped,

868
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,657
so there's no legal way
to refuse his request.

869
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,243
Jeez, is he a zombie or what?

870
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,870
He's a tenacious one.

871
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,122
You're right,
but there's a bigger problem.

872
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,165
The LPs' meeting
will take place in New York.

873
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,710
They're going to vote
regarding the dismissal of the chairman.

874
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,300
What are you talking about?

875
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,010
If the chairman fails to provide

876
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,138
or fabricates the financial documents
to the investors,

877
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,390
the LPs can hold a meeting
and dismiss the chairman--

878
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,600
Exactly!

879
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,937
Who handed over those documents?

880
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,690
Was it Baek Hyun-woo? Am I right?

881
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,401
No, it wasn't.

882
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,362
What do you think? I'm wearing this
for my chairman inauguration.

883
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,990
I see. The inauguration.

884
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,328
Must I say anything?

885
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,413
It suits you perfectly.

886
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,664
Doesn't it?

887
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,625
I should've found my place sooner.

888
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,506
Call the bank.

889
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,966
Tell them to double

890
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,968
the previous transaction
and make it 4.2% in CD.

891
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:42,886
All at once?

892
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,639
I have no time.
I need to buy as many stocks as I can,

893
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,808
so they won't be able to kick me out.

894
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:50,810
All right.

895
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,105
He purchased 4.2% at once.

896
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,148
He must be in a rush.

897
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,817
Of course.
He's finally spending the secret fund.

898
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,404
Have we found the files
that Mr. Pyeon was supposed to hand over?

899
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,822
No, sir.

900
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,158
However, I did receive something else.

901
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,619
This will prove that Eun-sung and his men

902
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,497
conducted a two-trillion investment fraud
to take over Queens.

903
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,749
Goodness. Who gave it to you?

904
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,596
Did you bring it?

905
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,562
That's the money from the U.S.

906
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,189
-That's it.
-Damn it.

907
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:37,148
Come on, now.

908
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,066
What do you mean?

909
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,735
I gave you all the money
I got from Seul-hee. That's it.

910
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,698
And the money you gave to the Hong family?

911
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,324
That belonged to them.

912
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,538
And the USB?

913
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,748
It was Da-hye who gave it to you?

914
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,208
Yes.

915
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,376
I told you.

916
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,128
That's my lifeline, so I hid it.

917
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,254
Your lifeline?

918
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,298
Jeez, what an idiot.

919
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,759
That's why you'll die.

920
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,096
-What?
-Ms. Moh has had enough of you.

921
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,473
I adored you, so I went easy on you.

922
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:14,978
I'm sure you know
that she detests adorable girls.

923
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,106
Stay still.

924
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,941
I told you to stay still.

925
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,484
-Open up!
-Stay still!

926
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,783
That idiot.

927
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,118
-Hey, step on the gas.
-Open up!

928
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,161
Stay still.

929
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,287
Stay still!

930
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,246
Stop the car!

931
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,331
Stay still!

932
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,127
Stop the car!

933
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,420
Let Da-hye go!

934
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,507
Soo-cheol.

935
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,676
Damn it! Open the door!

936
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,193
Damn it.

937
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,587
What's wrong with him?

938
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,215
Is he high on something?

939
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,299
Is he?

940
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,804
You son of a bitch!

941
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,722
I told you to let her go!

942
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,224
Stay still.

943
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,809
Soo-cheol! Run!

944
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,811
Do you want to die?

945
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,066
Soo-cheol!

946
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:43,983
Soo-cheol!

947
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,238
-Oh, no!
-Damn it.

948
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,489
Mr. Hong.

949
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,908
Leave while I'm still being nice.

950
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:52,826
Okay?

951
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,996
Stop getting beaten up and run!

952
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,584
Why are you trying to be a hero?

953
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,294
-Run!
-Stay still!

954
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,974
Damn it.

955
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,688
Soo-cheol!

956
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:26,943
Die!

957
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,319
Die!

958
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,906
-Die!
-Run!

959
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:45,962
Da-hye!

960
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,005
Geon-u!

961
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,841
What if I need to protect
my family in the future,

962
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,676
but I can't?

963
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,470
I'm dreading it.

964
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,183
Oh, man…

965
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,810
Exaggerate.

966
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,104
So that they'll feel arrogant and think,

967
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,064
"He's no match for me."

968
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,983
"I pretty much won."

969
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,193
"I'm surprisingly strong."

970
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,652
Let's go.

971
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,363
Jeez.

972
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,158
Soo-cheol!

973
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,119
You must wait
until they let down their guard

974
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,371
then land your critical punch.

975
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,637
Let's go. Get rid of the bicycle.

976
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,679
Get rid--

977
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,298
What…

978
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,591
What's that?

979
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,720
Soo-cheol.

980
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,931
Soo-cheol, open your eyes.

981
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,224
Soo-cheol.

982
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,151
Police? We're at the Yongdu-ri railroad.

983
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,611
Soo-cheol.

984
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,363
Wake up.

985
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:37,282
Soo-cheol.

986
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,243
Is he dead?

987
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,122
Soo-cheol.

988
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:45,999
Soo-cheol.

989
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,376
No, Soo-cheol.

990
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,837
Soo-cheol.

991
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,589
I love you. Don't go.

992
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,090
No, Soo-cheol.

993
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,675
Soo-cheol…

994
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:01,723
Me too.

995
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,811
Come on.

996
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,151
Why did you do that?

997
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,321
I'm sorry, Soo-cheol…

998
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,173
Wait. Why did I avoid him?

999
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,132
I'm the CEO.

1000
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,093
How funny.

1001
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,639
Who allowed him back here?

1002
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,558
I should ask.

1003
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,911
I need to talk to you.

1004
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,457
Likewise.

1005
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,668
You were reinstated?

1006
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,378
Yes.

1007
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,671
Why?

1008
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,714
Is it because of me?

1009
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,299
This is my workplace.

1010
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,385
You could've gone elsewhere.

1011
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,011
That's my choice.

1012
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,054
I feel uneasy.

1013
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,184
I'm uncomfortable.

1014
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,436
So please resign and find a new job.

1015
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,063
I really don't want

1016
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,108
to see you.

1017
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,487
What's with that look?

1018
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,949
You left me high and dry.

1019
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:46,577
Do you think you can seduce me now
since I lost my memory?

1020
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,870
Is that it?

1021
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,750
You said I'd always be your ideal type

1022
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,669
and that you'd fall for me again.

1023
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,379
You were so confident.

1024
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,091
So I thought you'd recognize me soon.

1025
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,343
Fall for you?

1026
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,553
But it's okay.

1027
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,929
I saw this coming.

1028
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,101
You're more shameless than I thought.

1029
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,311
Did my family promise you something?

1030
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,479
Why are you trying so hard?

1031
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,148
-Hae-in--
-Don't say my name.

1032
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,858
I might've easily fallen

1033
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,485
for your gaze and voice in the past,

1034
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,403
but not anymore.

1035
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,156
I don't want to see you again.

1036
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,457
What are you doing?

1037
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,959
Don't do this.

1038
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,966
-No--
-I don't want to hear it.

1039
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,718
Don't grab onto me.

1040
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,430
Let me go.

1041
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,394
SENDER
GRÜNWALD MEDICAL CENTER

1042
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,527
Hae-in!

1043
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,367
Hey, it's me. Grace.

1044
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,454
Goodness.
You really don't remember anything.

1045
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,750
I was your favorite person

1046
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,253
whom you trusted the most.

1047
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,343
What is it?

1048
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:09,053
Excuse me.

1049
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:12,682
I don't think we were close enough
to talk casually and hug each other.

1050
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,141
What's wrong?

1051
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,935
-It's me.
-Excuse me.

1052
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,482
How did she know?

1053
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,360
What's going on?

1054
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,070
If her hunches are so accurate,

1055
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,447
why is she still getting fooled
by Eun-sung?

1056
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,837
YOU'VE GOT MAIL

1057
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,005
What is this?

1058
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,424
THE AQUA
SENDER: HONG HAE-IN

1059
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,717
This is from me?

1060
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:52,555
I sent myself an invite?

1061
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,482
You may enter.

1062
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,401
Okay.

1063
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,157
She's entering now.

1064
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,663
Why is this big place empty?

1065
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,330
Why are you here?

1066
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:00,706
I'd like to ask you that.

1067
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,797
You had sent me an invite.

1068
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:25,940
We'll begin the wedding

1069
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,692
of Hong Hae-in, the bride,

1070
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:30,653
and Baek Hyun-woo, the groom.

1071
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,446
Here comes the groom.

1072
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:33,674
Well…

1073
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:37,511
How are you doing,
Hyun-woo from the future?

1074
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,639
Don't tell me you got a divorce.

1075
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,516
Do you have kids?

1076
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,768
One? Two?

1077
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:46,103
It doesn't matter though.

1078
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,065
Because all I need is Hae-in.

1079
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,275
Don't make her cry.

1080
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,194
Make her happy.

1081
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,992
Dear Hae-in from the future.

1082
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,579
I doubt you'll be watching.
But if you are,

1083
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,872
why are you?

1084
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,832
Turn this off and get to work.

1085
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,168
I won't ask how you're doing since I know

1086
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,586
you'll be doing fine.

1087
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,713
You'll be just as pretty, healthy,

1088
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,673
and the most successful.

1089
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,759
With Hyun-woo

1090
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,385
by your side, of course.

1091
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,696
Mr. Baek Hyun-woo?

1092
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,614
That's me.

1093
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:44,078
Ms. Hong rented out the entire aquarium
and sent you these flowers.

1094
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,497
I rented out

1095
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,749
this aquarium?

1096
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,376
When?

1097
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,377
About a month ago.

1098
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,920
And four years ago as well.

1099
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:55,256
Well, then…

1100
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,510
They said this was the best dating spot,

1101
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,970
but why is it so empty?

1102
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,431
Ms. Hong, these days

1103
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,184
it feels like the entire universe

1104
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:09,937
is on our side.

1105
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:13,691
You're right.

1106
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,237
I see.

1107
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,949
It wasn't the universe.

1108
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:23,868
It was you.

1109
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:25,703
I never knew.

1110
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:28,497
I don't know what this is about,
but I'm leaving.

1111
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,218
Baek Hyun-woo.

1112
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,845
Don't try to skip the wedding

1113
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,598
just because I lost my memory.

1114
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,684
Since I've lost my memory,
I may as well wear a wedding dress again.

1115
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:49,810
Did I write this?

1116
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,312
That can't be.

1117
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:54,690
Did I really want
to remarry the guy who had an affair

1118
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,275
behind my back?

1119
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,152
No way.

1120
01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,486
You're right.

1121
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,447
You wouldn't have.

1122
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,369
You wouldn't have done this

1123
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,289
had I really cheated on you.

1124
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,667
So start doubting.

1125
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,711
You don't have to believe me,

1126
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,505
but don't believe Eun-sung either.

1127
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,008
Don't believe anyone. Doubt everything.

1128
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:23,802
Eun-sung…

1129
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,096
never protected you.

1130
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:31,810
He's been isolating you
from your family and me.

1131
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,946
Thankfully, we weren't in the car.

1132
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:45,074
But I thought you were,

1133
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,826
so I hurt my hand
trying to break the window.

1134
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,705
Is something wrong?

1135
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,750
This is nice.

1136
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,673
You're worried about me.

1137
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,592
I have a question.

1138
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,803
Hold that thought.

1139
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:52,516
I'm going to have another glass.
Would you like one?

1140
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,268
I'm okay.

1141
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,363
YOU HAVE UNOPENED FOOTAGE
WATCH NOW

1142
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,042
TRUST CAMERA

1143
01:12:58,832 --> 01:12:59,666
Hae-in.

1144
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:03,462
Should we go to the U.S.?

1145
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,172
-What?
-Both of us

1146
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,383
were abandoned by our families.

1147
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:08,759
So…

1148
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,719
let's just…

1149
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,264
leave.

1150
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,893
We can have a happy life there.

1151
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,273
Are you sure I was abandoned?

1152
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:25,609
What's wrong?

1153
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,446
Do you think I'm lying?

1154
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,077
That's not why.

1155
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,287
Let's talk again

1156
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:39,581
when you're sober.

1157
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,756
You had a question for me.

1158
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,307
I don't think I need to ask.

1159
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,437
Bye.

1160
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,248
Secretary Na, it's me.

1161
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,876
I lost my old phone.

1162
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,294
So…

1163
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,629
could you give me

1164
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,466
Mr. Baek's number?

1165
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,802
Yes, text it to me.

1166
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:58,660
SECRETARY NA
HERE IS DIRECTOR BAEK'S NUMBER

1167
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:07,377
DIRECTOR BAEK

1168
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:15,928
Mr. Baek?

1169
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:17,804
It's me, Hong Hae-in.

1170
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,724
I need to talk to you.

1171
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,310
Where are you?

1172
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,233
Okay, I'll be there soon.

1173
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,835
RECIPIENT
HAE-IN HONG

1174
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:39,803
To Baek Hyun-woo.

1175
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,807
You'll probably be reading this
while I'm in surgery.

1176
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:45,934
If I fail

1177
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,228
to wake up,

1178
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,480
then this could be my will.

1179
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,277
I won't ask you to mourn me
for three years like in the past.

1180
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,905
But I'd like you to miss me

1181
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,283
throughout the four seasons

1182
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,243
and call out to me when you're drunk.

1183
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,787
But after that,

1184
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,957
forget about me and live your life.

1185
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,879
Fall in love passionately, get married,

1186
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,672
and have a family of your own.

1187
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,216
I promise not to be jealous.

1188
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,931
I'm already jealous.

1189
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,895
As for my assets,

1190
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,230
spend them how you deem fit.

1191
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:36,026
Thinking that I might die

1192
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:37,361
is making me rush.

1193
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:41,239
Could I go to Heaven
if I hurriedly did some good deeds?

1194
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,742
That way I can meet you again.

1195
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,787
Just thinking about this

1196
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:48,705
makes me sad.

1197
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,083
But…

1198
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:55,087
what if the surgery is a success,

1199
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:57,923
but I forget who you are?

1200
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,510
What if I treat you like a stranger?

1201
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:05,847
Or even worse,

1202
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,391
what if I mistreat you?

1203
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,937
What if you can't take it anymore
and get sick of me?

1204
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,272
What should I do then?

1205
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:16,900
Even if that happens,

1206
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:19,236
don't get sick of me.

1207
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,197
Don't get exhausted.

1208
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,074
Keep loving me.

1209
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,287
My ideal type will never change,

1210
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,581
so I'll fall for you again.

1211
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,251
You said I'd always be your ideal type

1212
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:35,669
and that you'd fall for me again.

1213
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,170
You were so confident.

1214
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,923
So I thought you'd recognize me soon.

1215
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,843
Please be patient until then.

1216
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,345
We won't see each other again.

1217
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,597
We will meet again.

1218
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:50,600
Because I won't give up.

1219
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,812
I'll stay by your side.

1220
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,484
And when I finally remember you,

1221
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,780
let's get married again.

1222
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:18,503
And, Hong Hae-in,

1223
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,089
if you're reading this,

1224
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:25,469
it must mean the surgery was a success
and you can't remember anything.

1225
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:29,389
So let me introduce him to you.

1226
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:36,980
Hyun-woo can fix anything.

1227
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,525
This is a tray. You just need to pull it.

1228
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,777
-But he nags a lot.
-Ms. Hong.

1229
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,405
Remove the paper if it says
that it's stuck.

1230
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,823
Why would you kick it?

1231
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,617
Because the paper is stuck.

1232
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,328
I was doing the Heimlich maneuver.

1233
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:53,205
Please don't kick it.

1234
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:55,415
Just ask me for help.

1235
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:02,339
Don't your feet hurt?

1236
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,132
Well…

1237
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:06,843
Just a little bit.

1238
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,350
Should I take a look at it?

1239
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,531
He's easy to fool.

1240
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,324
Mr. Baek, did you know?

1241
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:32,410
A raccoon lives on our rooftop garden.

1242
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,538
Her name is Yeong-suk.

1243
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:35,747
Yeong-suk.

1244
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:40,377
He can get pretty cute
when he's drunk, so watch out.

1245
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,712
I'm drinking instead of her.

1246
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:44,548
Did I make you uncomfortable back there?

1247
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,557
I thought you were dead.

1248
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,142
He pulls at your heartstrings
when he cries,

1249
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:57,602
so don't make him cry.

1250
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,605
He's awfully sexy with his sleeves up,

1251
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,399
so cover him up.

1252
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,862
If you're still confused,

1253
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,572
just remember this.

1254
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:11,199
He's the reason why

1255
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,161
I didn't want to lose my memory.

1256
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,998
And even if I did,

1257
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:20,667
he's the reason why I wanted to live.

1258
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,964
Baek Hyun-woo is the person

1259
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,384
I want to remember forever.

1260
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,773
I was so happy to have him by my side.

1261
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:48,153
I desperately pray

1262
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,488
that he'll be by your side

1263
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,283
as well.

1264
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,370
I'm sorry, Hyun-woo.

1265
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:00,916
I'm so sorry.

1266
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,603
HAE-IN

1267
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:40,622
Hae-in!

1268
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,916
Stay there! I'll come to you!

1269
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:17,283
Hyun-woo.

1270
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:20,870
I'm sorry.

1271
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,808
I followed Mr. Yoon and Ms. Hong
in Germany.

1272
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:33,193
First of all,
he took care of her diligently.

1273
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:45,246
Should we go inside if you're cold?

1274
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:46,289
It's okay.

1275
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:49,125
They could've easily passed
as a match made in heaven.

1276
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:51,836
But they couldn't fool my sharp eyes.

1277
01:24:57,383 --> 01:24:58,927
It's okay. Let me.

1278
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:02,472
Hae-in.

1279
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:04,766
It's okay. Let me.

1280
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:14,317
It's okay. I can walk by myself.

1281
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,861
A woman never refuses a man's help

1282
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,405
if she has feelings for him.

1283
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:20,782
She tries to get him involved.

1284
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,867
But Ms. Hong was adamant.

1285
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,995
Her heart still knew
despite her losing her memory.

1286
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:27,330
"I'm not attracted to him."

1287
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,998
As a result, Mr. Yoon

1288
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,417
is pining with unrequited love,

1289
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,002
the loneliest kind of love.

1290
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,171
He's dealing with
a lonely, unrequited love.

1291
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,881
That's my conclusion.

1292
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,927
Are you saying they'll break up soon?

1293
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,388
Their relationship
is bound to come to an end.

1294
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:47,142
But he could seriously act out
once the reality sets in.

1295
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,352
We need to watch out.

1296
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:12,417
He could cause danger to all of us.

1297
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,378
QUEEN OF TEARS

1298
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,744
Is he alive?

1299
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,038
Is he dead?

1300
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,457
Thank you

1301
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,209
for always being by my side.

1302
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,462
No matter what happens…

1303
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,963
Baek Hyun-woo!

1304
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,548
I'll protect her.

1305
01:27:06,846 --> 01:27:08,848
