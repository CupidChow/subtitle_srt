[Episode 4]

4
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,580
Just tell me how much you want.

5
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,140
Any less than 500,000 yuan,

6
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,050
and we won't rent it out.

7
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,420
Yes, we can't take any less than 500,000 yuan.

8
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,410
Any less and we won't rent it out.

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,060
We refuse to rent it out for any less than that!

10
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,460
Wait, wait.

11
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,220
Chief, you were the one who said 200,000 yuan, right?

12
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,389
It's only been a few days.

13
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,900
Why has it suddenly gone up to 500,000 yuan?

14
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,020
That price is what everyone wants.

15
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,980
Yes.

16
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,560
We can't take any less than 500,000 yuan.

17
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,920
It's what everyone wants.

18
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,110
Talk nicely, what's with the ruckus?

19
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,790
Chief, we're from the same company.

20
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,540
It doesn't matter who you talk to.

21
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,000
How about I rent it for another ten years?

22
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,700
We can sign the contract at one go.

23
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,380
We'll make the terms flexible for the additional ten years.

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,100
If the price for this plot of land rises in the future,

25
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,380
we'll pay an increased rent too.

26
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,620
We'll follow the market prices.

27
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,820
You can maximize your profits for this piece of land, how about it?

28
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,620
You're self-employed, aren't you?

29
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm not self-employed.

30
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,060
We are a limited liability company.

31
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,100
We have a business license. Look.

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,829
Don't think that I don't know much because I'm old.

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,660
Owners of small businesses like you

34
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,780
are not like big companies,

35
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,100
You might just run away at any moment.

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,180
People told me that I should err on the side of caution.

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
As the saying goes,

38
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,520
a rabbit's tail won't grow much longer.

39
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,880
Things won't end up well if we work with independent companies.

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,300
Those are all biased opinions.

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,980
I won't run away if you rent it to me.

42
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,560
Let's settle this quickly.

43
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,620
If you lower the price, I'll rent it from you right away.

44
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,430
I've told you several times.

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,300
Several companies in the city have visited.

46
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,660
Even the province's pharmaceutical company wants to rent this plot.

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,700
If you don't believe me, go ask them.

48
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,620
We won't take anything less than the price we gave.

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,020
We would rather give them a discount

50
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
than rent it to a small company.

51
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,620
Especially since you're a girl.

52
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,420
What if you don't hold to your side of the bargain and make a fuss,

53
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,060
what should I do then?

54
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,300
Did you get the hint?

55
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,050
This old loach dislikes you for two things.

56
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,670
Firstly, you're a self-employed business owner.

57
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,100
Secondly, you are a woman.

58
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,490
Chen, look for another place.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,970
We can't just put all our eggs in this one basket.

60
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,540
Okay, got it.

61
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,540
I already boasted about it.

62
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,300
Without this storage yard,

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,340
we can't do anything.

64
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,339
Hello?

65
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,660
What did you tell your dad this afternoon?

66
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,400
He got so angry that his blood pressure shot up.

67
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,380
He's in the ER now.

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,680
The doctor said he needs emergency treatment.

69
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,860
His life is in danger.

70
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,940
Come over quickly.

71
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,700
Hurry up. We're in the hospital.

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,159
Which hospital?

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,520
How much interest can the bank give on this money?

74
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,060
How can it compare?

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,900
It's safe to put it in the bank.

76
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,659
It's risky to lend it to her.

77
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,100
Kuan said

78
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,180
she can give us a high interest rate on this.

79
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,300
No.

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,850
But...

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,980
What's wrong?

82
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,790
Look at how your dad was pressured.

83
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,910
Why are you here?

84
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,100
You were the one who asked me to come.

85
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,780
I'll leave then.

86
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,180
My child, take this.

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Take a look.

for Qian's mum and your sister.

91
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,180
If you take this all away,

92
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,330
I'm really worried that

if I can't make it through today...

How is she supposed to

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,420
support her and her daughter all alone in the future?

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,330
So,

99
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,630
if you sign this mortgage agreement,

100
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,090
I'll lend you the money.

101
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,980
We'll also need to notarize this at the Notary Office.

102
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,940
Otherwise, I won't be able to rest in peace.

103
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,740
I'll go through the procedures as soon as I get the money.

104
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,780
If I don't see the money, none of these will work on me.

105
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,350
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,540
Why are you trying to talk business with your family?

107
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,420
He is your biological father.

108
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,100
We'll do the procedures after the money gets to me.

110

The results of the test won't be out until tomorrow.

112
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,160
Go back home first.

113
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,580
I'm worried about our daughter staying at home alone.

114
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,900
What if something happens to you?

115
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
What should we do?

116
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,420
I won't die so easily.

Don't worry.

If he really ends up dying of anger,

120
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,440
you don't have to lend me money anymore.

121
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:35,990
You...

122
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,260
Xu, don't be angry.

123
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,590
Your heart can't take it.

124
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,690
It's okay. Go back first.

125
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,500
I'll be off.

126
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,659
I haven't smoked for a whole day.

127
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,900
Can you help me buy me a box first?

128
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,840
You want me to buy cigarettes for you?

129
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,290
Then I won't come back.

130
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,370
No, no, no.

131
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,430
I don't have a choice.

132
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,620
She forced me.

133
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,630
The life I'm living now

134
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,210
is just like I'm being persecuted.

135
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,330
Right? You saw it.

136
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,680
Your heart's not feeling good?

137
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,090
Chest tightness, shortness of breath.

138
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
My hands are swollen from all the needles.

139
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,060
Ever since the day you came in our house.

140
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,980
It was like this at first.

141
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,620
Qian's mom's workplace is trying to commercialize our housing.

142
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,460
We have to buy out the house in full.

143
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,980
I wanted to get some money from you

144
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,880
to pay this off.

145
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,409
But I didn't expect you to ask me first.

146
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,780
Moreover,

147
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,900
you're asking for 500,000 yuan.

148
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,020
How would I have that kind of money?

149
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,730
Dad, since I was a kid,

150
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,740
when have I ever asked you for money?

151
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,100
It's because I have no other choice now.

152
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,220
Or else I wouldn't want to ask you either.

153
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,840
Please help me with this.

154
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,300
Can you?

155
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,540
Yes, running a business is difficult.

156
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,260
I know.

157
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,020
But,

158
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,480
please help me out first.

159
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,100
Sign an agreement and get it notarized,

160

-I’ll give you the money. -No way.

161
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,780
What are you doing?

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,300
You...

163
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,310
What am I supposed to do if you don't sign this?

164
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,740
I'm having a hard time now.

165
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,500
I have no choice.

166
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,100
My mom left me the house.

167
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,670
I won't sign it.

168
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,020
What are you doing, Banxia?

169
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,530
How do you expect me to go home?

170
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,700
How can I face Qian, your sister,

171
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,660
and her mother?

172
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,660
I can't go home now.

173
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,980
Then don't go back.

174
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,900
When I get rich, I'll give you one million.

175
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,980
Get a divorce and I'll support you.

176
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,140
You live with me, how's that?

177
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,580
You...

178
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,860
You can pretend to be anything, just don't pretend to be sick.

179
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,470
After a while you'll really be sick.

180
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,510
You... The agreement.

181

What are you practicing?

182
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,440

184
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,300
This is lightly salted water.

185

It's good to drink this in the morning. Here.

No, thanks.

187

Don't worry.

188
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,420
I poured it out to drink.

189
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,130
The mouth of the bottle is clean.

190

How did you know?

194
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,850
I smell some disinfectant on you.

195
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,320
Don't run anymore.

196
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,380
Running will hurt your knees.

197
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,780
I exercise here every morning,

198
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,250

I mean no harm.

203

I just think you're pretty good.

204

I'm pretty good?

205
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,750
You can tell that?

206
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,740
Of course.

207
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,310
I see so many people every day.

208

I can tell who's good and who's not.

My surname is Su.

I work in the General Surgery Department of Renmin Hospital.

You can come to me if you need anything.

I'm the chief physician.

I have a favor to ask you.

218

My dad always says he has a heart condition.

219

Can you help me find someone to have a look at him?

Sure, no problem.

I'll be in surgery this morning.

Weren't we all so happy when coming here?

It may be rusty,

231
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,180
but we can spray some paint over and it'll be good as new.

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,700
As long as it works, it's a good car.

Boss, does it even work?

234

Why not?

235
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,540
The car door fell off.

236
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,320
So what?

237
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,300
Just install it back.

238

Captain Tong, do you think it will work?

239

The cars behind are in even worse shape.

240
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
They're sure to fall apart once they go on the road.

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,900
So what if they fall apart?

We'll fix them.

You haven't fallen apart.

Have a seat in the chief's office first.

It's been more than seven hours and he's not out yet.

330
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,420
Chief, I can't stop him.

331
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,130
Chief, let me call in the food for you.

332
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,260
Is all the paperwork done?

333
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,790
Yes.

334
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,070
This is the hospital.

335
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,520
Okay.

336
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,910
Chief Su, thank you.

337
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,020
Not at all.

338
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,570
I'll be off work in half an hour.

339
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,520
Let's have dinner together later

340
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,980
at the hospital cafeteria.

341
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,940
The hospital cafeteria has a few pretty good dishes.

342
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,430
Chief Su, let my dad and I take you out for dinner.

343
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,980
No way.

344
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,100
He has a check-up tomorrow.

345
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,670
You don't know what he can eat,

346
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,480
and what he can't, do you?

347
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,670
You're leaving your dad in my care.

348
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,740
What's there to worry about?

349
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,220
That's right. Get back to work.

350
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,140
I'll be quite alright with Su.

351
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,860
I'll go with you.

352
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,260
Your dad will be doing check-ups in the next two days.

353
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,570
Come over if you're free.

354
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,900
Don't bother if you're busy.

355
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,340
Chief Su, my dad is...

356
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,330
It's okay, Kuan. Get back to work.

357
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,430
Why do you call me Kuan like my dad?

358
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,980
My surname is Xu, X-U Xu.

359
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,090
You can just call me Xu.

360
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,590
Okay, Kuan.

361
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,660
I still think this name is pretty fun.

362
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,020
What's the meaning behind it?

363
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,620
♫Today I...♫

364
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,700
♫watch the snow floating by in the cold night♫

365
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,630
♫With a cold heart I drift away♫

366
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,800
♫Chasing in the wind and rain♫

367
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,930
♫I can't distinguish the traces in the fog♫

368
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,140
♫The vast sky and wide oceans, you and me♫

369
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,460
♫Will we change♫

370
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,430
♫How many times♫

371
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,580
♫Were we faced with cold stares and mockery♫

372
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,650
♫But yet we never gave up our ideals in our hearts♫

373
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,640
♫In a momentary daze♫

374
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,700
♫If you ever feel lost♫

375
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,890
♫It's already faded before you know it♫

376
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,520
♫The love in my heart♫

377
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,380
♫Please forgive me for being unrestrained and wanting to be free in this life♫

378
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,530
♫I'm also afraid I'll fall one day♫

379
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,200
♫Anyone can betray their ideals♫

380
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,410
It's done!

381
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:24,980
It's done!

382
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,540
It's done!

383
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:33,490
♫I'm not afraid even if there's only you and I left one day♫

384
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,210
Dinner is ready.

385
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,990
How can you put my Popular Cinema underneath?

386
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,340
What?

387
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,980
Are you afraid your darling gets scalded?

388
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,780
It's none of your business.

389
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,970
How's the search?

390
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,690
I've scoured the entire seaside nearby.

391
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,140
There's no suitable place.

392
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,180
What about you?

393
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,000
Did you manage to borrow the money?

394
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,100
I've been dragging it out with the village chief for two days as you told me to.

395
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,180
If it doesn't work,

396
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
I guess we'll have to settle for 500,000 yuan.

397
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,620
At most,

398
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,390
we can discuss with him to not pay it all at once.

399
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,740
In my opinion, even 200,000 yuan is too much for him.

400
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,100
We're giving him face.

401
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,500
After we finish eating,

402
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,430
I'll make a trip to ask my parents.

403
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,740
I told you already,

404
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,820
stop asking your parents.

405
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,370
They won't lend you money.

406
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,980
I'll be honest with you.

407
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,820
See if you believe it or not.

408
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,180
They don't like you.

409
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,080
Why are you looking for them?

410
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,140
Just tell me,

411
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,580
are we still going to the north?

412
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,940
Are we still going to buy the steel?

413
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,220
Are we going to make a comeback?

414
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,420
Do you still want to build this storage yard?

415
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,650
At this point,

416
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,620
Tell me what else I can do.

417
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,230
Give me a solution.

418
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,850
Where can I get money?

419
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,840
I've fixed a couple of cars already.

420
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,740
I'll find some jobs tomorrow onwards.

421
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,720
Every little counts.

422
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,320
Let me tell you again.

423
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,700
Stop going to find those nasty people.

424
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,180
Those nasty people have already started working.

425
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,300
They're fixing the cars.

426
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,660
Have you registered a license for your team?

427
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,620
Yes.

428
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,730
We've even got a name.

429
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,540
What's it called?

430
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,900
Top Squad.

431
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,750
What?

432
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,440
Yes Sir, Madam.

433
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,670
Top Squad.

434
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,220
Bro, can you be more civilized?

435
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,820
Look, he's watched too many movies.

436
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,780
Can you be a bit more cultured?

437
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,530
I like it. It's none of your business.

438
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,090
She said she'd come to get me, why isn't she here yet?

439
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,540
It's okay, Uncle. We'll wait for a bit more.

440
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,240
She must be busy.

441
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,260
Su, come.

442
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,500
We are destined to meet.

443
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,120
Actually, we are in the same field.

444
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,220
Really?

445
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,250
Uncle, you used to study medicine too?

446
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,460
It's a long story.

447
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,820
My grandfather, or Banxia's great-grandfather,

448
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,770
was a famous doctor.

449
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,300
He was a legendary doctor in the area.

450
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,630
I'm the fourth generation of the practice.

451
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,370
By the way, let me check your pulse.

452
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,660
It's free.

453
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,180
Your pulse is good. It's pretty strong.

454
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,410
You're just too tired.

455
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,620
Not that I want to nag,

456
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,540
but you doctors like to stay up late,

457
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,180
and work overtime.

458
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,060
She's here, Uncle.

459
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,390
-Let me. -Okay.

460
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,540
Here.

461
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
Take care of yourself and rest well.

462
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,350
Thank you.

463
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,420
You're welcome, Uncle.

464
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,900
Your dad is in good health.

465
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,740
Uncle,

466
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,090
remember to come to me for a checkup every year.

467
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:52,890
Okay.

468
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,530
Don't piss your dad off again.

469
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,260
Fatty.

470
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,730
Your dad told me everything.

471
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,580
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

472
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,500
Doctor Su, thank you.

473
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,190
You're welcome.

474
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,620
-Bye. -Bye, Uncle.

475
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,740
I've been quite comfortable

476
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
in the hospital these two days.

477
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,300
Su Guodong is really capable.

478
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,360
I think he’s a good match for you.

479
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,390
What do you mean?

480
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,650
You accept people's favor and now,

481
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,670
you're starting to take his side?

482
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,370
No.

483
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,950
He's the Chief of General Surgery.

484
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,300
He's the expert in terms of his skills.

485
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,380
Everyone in the hospital has to listen to him.

486
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,320
When Guodong was doing his daily rounds,

487
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,060
he came to the ward to greet me every day.

488
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,090
Even when I was doing my checkups it was always

489
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,260
the head nurse bringing me everywhere.

490
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,830
He's not trying to get close to me.

491
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,480
He's trying to get in your good books.

492
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,060
Think about it.

493
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,860
You have a good think about it.

494
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,110
Think about what?

495
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,930
You're really something.

496
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,900
You even told them my nickname is Fatty.

497
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,340
With two more cigarettes,

498
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,410
you'd probably sell me off.

499
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,310
No way.

500
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,680
You underestimate your father.

501
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,300
He just kept asking about you, from your childhood till now.

502
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,530
If there was really something wrong with my heart

503
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,370
and I had to stay there for a month,

504
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,300
I'd probably not be able to hold back and spill everything.

505
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,940
Stop for a moment, stop.

506
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,860
Pull over to the side for a bit.

507
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,580
I still have something to tell you.

508
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,560
It's about our house.

509
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,870
What do you mean?

510
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,600
You don't want to lend me money again?

511
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,300
I'm going to mortgage the house tomorrow.

512
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,620
I really don't know what to do next

513
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,380
if we can't build this storage yard.

514
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,760
I lose money with every day that passes.

515
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,420
Take pity on me.

516
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,420
You're my daughter. How could you

517
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,560
think of your dad as that kind of person?

518
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,110
Then,

519
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,410
How about this?

520
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,460
I'll go down and do it myself tomorrow.

521
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,930
I promise, every single cent

522
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,330
will be transferred to your account.

523
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,270
Don't worry.

524
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,290
Don't worry about the family.

525
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,820
Even if Qian's mother cries and makes a scene,

526
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,300
I'll deal with all of the consequences no matter what happens.

527
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,270
At most if we fight, she can kick me out.

528
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,250
Right?

529
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,830
I have a daughter.

530
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,490
There's someone to take care of me.

531
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,040
♫I want a home♫

532
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,170
Who do I have to be afraid of?

533
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,400
♫It doesn't have to be a fancy place♫

534
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
This house

♫When I'm tired♫

536
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,610
was left for you by your mom.

537
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,130
♫I'll think of it♫

538
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,760
It's also a memory.

539
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,780
♫I want a home♫

540
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,780
We have to keep it for ourselves.

♫It doesn't have to be a big place♫

♫When something scares me♫

543
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,300
If your mom were still alive,

544
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,090
♫I wouldn't be afraid any longer♫

545
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,890
We wouldn't end up like this huh?

546
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,550
♫Who wouldn't want a home♫

547
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,990
♫But there are just people who don't have one♫

548
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,530

♫When tears stream down my face♫

550
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,220

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,150
♫I can only gently wipe them away myself♫

552
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,060
you can't just look at her from the surface.

553
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,370
♫I really envy her♫

554
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,050
She actually still cares about this family,

555
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,660
and she's also willing to take care of me.

556
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,210
♫She can go home when she's hurt♫

557
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,020
It's just that Qian's still young now.

558
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,990
♫But I can only be all alone♫

559
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,610
We have to prioritize her in the family.

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,690
♫Looking for my home all alone♫

561
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,790
You have to understand that.

562
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,820
No matter what happens between us,

563
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,280
♫Although I never had a warm home♫

564
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,650
you have to let me be able to

565
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,550
give them a proper explanation.

566
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:30,310
♫But I still grew up gradually♫

567

♫I can't blame anyone♫

570
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,550
Let me off here.

571
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,590
I'll go back now.

572

♫I can only rely on myself♫

573
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,770
You have an early night too.

574
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,460
Drive slowly.

♫Even though you have a home and you don't lack anything♫

♫You always say there's no love♫

579
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,590
Good. Have you eaten?

580
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,790
♫You don't go home at all♫

581
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,940
I haven't eaten yet.

♫We're the same age♫

583

00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,580
Come on.

585
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,810
♫But we have different hearts♫

586
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,180
Let's go eat.

587
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,980
♫Let me have a home♫

588
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,870
Several companies

589
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,460
have come to visit this plot of land.

590
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,090
I could only give all of the offers

591
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,020
to the village committee

592
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,400
to let them discuss it.

593
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,330
The village leaders are all here today.

594
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,830
I'll let you know

595
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,620
the result of our discussion.

596
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,770
Actually, we're not too happy with

597
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,730
your qualifications.

598
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,440
But we really want to help you.

599
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,380
It's just that the price,

600
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,340
we're not too happy with it.

601
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,700
You want to raise the price again?

602
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,900
Young man, it's not that I want to raise the price,

603
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,730
but the whole village disagrees with the previous price.

604
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,310
After this round of discussions, we've set a price.

605
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,680
On top of the 500,000 yuan we originally settled on,

606
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,220
let's add an additional 200,000 yuan.

607
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,120
700,000 yuan a year.

608
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,450
At least a 10 year lease.

609
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,580
Are you kidding us?

610
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
Watch your mouth.

611
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,040
What are you doing? Don't move.

612
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,740
If you don't rent it to us,

613
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,940
you can't even rent it out for 200,000 yuan.

614
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,480
Do you believe me?

615
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,300
Young man,

616
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,730
don't rent it if you think it's expensive.

617
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,550
We have several other companies lined up behind you.

618
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,810
No, Chief.

619
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,700
How many times have we been here?

620
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,220
My boss came last time.

621
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,620
You saw our sincerity.

622
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,220
Right?

623
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,640
Can you please give us some respect?

624
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,500
Stop playing tricks with us.

625
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,130
If you rent this intertidal zone out

626
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,250
to those pharmaceutical factories and printing factories,

627
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,760
they'll pollute all of the seawater here.

628
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,470
Let's not talk about these useless things.

629
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,780
Rent it if you want to, if not just leave.

630
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,130
If you have no money,

631
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,980
then stop acting like a big boss here.

632
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,530
What kind of attitude is that?

633
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,120
Nasty hooligan!

634
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,300
Who are you calling a hooligan?

635
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,260
Chief! Chief!

636
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,780
Xiaoqi.

637
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,900
I'm in the mood for a fight.

638
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,490
Xiaoqi.

639
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,630
Let me tell you, you'll still see me around.

640
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,610
How can you do business without money?

641
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,610
Go back and get the money.

642
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,740
Go get the money.

643
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,000
Why did you stop me?

644
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,100
We should have smashed his teeth with a good punch.

645
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,280
Old loach.

646
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,370
I'll be guarding the village entrance from tomorrow.

647
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,620
Let's see who wants to rent it.

648
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,180
I won't even let him in the village.

649
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,020
If it's contaminated,

650
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,640
he won't be able to rent it out.

651
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,220
What do you mean?

652
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,550
I'm saying,

653
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,790
if it's contaminated,

654
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,900
he won't be able to rent it out.

655
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,440
How?

656
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,630
Waste motor oil.

657
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,150
Cheers.

658
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,060
Thank you.

659
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,970
Thank you.

660
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,190
Thank you.

661
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,060
Thank you.

662
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,710
Is the wine good?

663
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,250
Hello, Miss.

664
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,960
Which room are you going to?

665
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,010
I'm looking for someone.

666
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,370
Try the food I've ordered for you.

667
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,630
Today is really...

668
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,280
Come on, enjoy the dinner.

669
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,330
Well nowadays, the Commonwealth of the Independent States

670
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,060
is not the same as the Soviet Union of before, so,

671
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,260
We can't do this business.

672
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,030
Okay.

673
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,200
Thank you for your advice today.

674
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:00,820
Thank you.

675
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,380
Bye. See you.

676
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,700
Bye.

677
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,030
Bye.

678
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,630
Mr. Zhao.

679
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,500
How do you know I'm here?

680
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,980
You are such a famous person

681
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,200
in our industry.

682
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,140
What can I do for you?

683
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,570
I want to talk to you

684
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,010
about buying steel in the north.

685
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,910
I should be talking to Wu Jianshe about this.

686
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,430
If you trust Mr. Wu,

687
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,820
you wouldn't call me

688
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,300
after the Luzhou Fair

689
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,820
and ask me if this is reliable.

690
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:26,900
You wouldn't

691
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,450
go ask your foreign friends now either.

692
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,860
Firstly, eavesdropping is rude.

693
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,630
Secondly, even if Wu Jianshe is untrustworthy,

694
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,020
he's still more capable than you.

695
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,350
You're right.

696
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,580
Mr. Wu and any of his counterparts

697
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,780
are all more capable than me.

698
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,790
But for them,

699
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,860
this is just a business deal.

700
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,340
If you don't do it with them,

701
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,560
they can find someone else.

702
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,710
It's just a matter of how much money they'll make.

703
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,790
But for me,

704
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,300
if I fail,

705
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,620
I'll go bankrupt.

706
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,410
All of the money I'm spending on building the storage yard is borrowed.

707
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,520
My house and car

708
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,620
have both been mortgaged.

709
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,390
If I can't get the scrap steel this time,

710
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,020
I'm really done for.

711
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,450
All the money I've invested into this will be gone.

712
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,470
So, Mr. Zhao,

713
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,680
please help me.

714
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,380
I'm really desperate.

715
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,280
I hope you can give me a chance

716
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,840
and listen to my thoughts.

717
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:10,350
Please.

718
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,310
I just don't understand.

719
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,100
Since you don't have the ability,

720
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,860
why do you still work so hard?

721
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,660
I know hopes are slim,

722
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,340
but I still want to fight for it.

723
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,400
We all start from the bottom.

724
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,990
If you're willing to work with me,

725
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,020
I will do my utmost best for you.

726
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,200
Do you believe

727
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,970
I am willing to accept

728
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:28,940
any of the requests you make now?

729
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,280
I'll give you five minutes.

730
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
We'll take a ton of scrap steel to be 350.

731
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,710
So 15,000 tons

732
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,620
will work out to be 5.25 million.

733
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,260
The rates for international freight now

734
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,660
is about 36 USD a ton.

735
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,570
According to today's international exchange rate, 8.2,

736
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,540
the shipping fee back to China

737
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,810
will be nearly 300 yuan.

738
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,310
So the shipping for 15,000 tons

739
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,270
will work out to be 4.4 million.

740
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,750
I have one million now.

741
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,820
So I'll  need to prepare

742
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,360
at least 8.69 million.

743
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,550
Four minutes left.

744
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,960
After buying back 50,000 tons of steel,

745
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,750
I believe my price for 15,000 tons

746
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,760
will be lower than any of the other companies,

747
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,020
Which allows your profit margin to be much higher.

748
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,860
And you need to find a place, right?

749
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,820
You can also save on the renting of a storage yard

750
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,409
for this 15,000 tons of steel.

751
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,820
I took this trip to procure the scrap steel

752
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,820
also to find out

753
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,699
how things will work out if we do this.

754
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,030
I believe you'll need this channel

755
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,570
in the future too.

756
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:21,659
So I hope

757
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,500
we can establish a long-term partnership.

758
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,600
If you need to buy steel from the north in the future,

759
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,580
I can go.

760
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,520
You just have to give me 20%

761
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,050
of the difference in the price of scrap steel

762
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,650
for that day as remuneration.

763
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,699
If you want to work with me for a long time,

764
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,889
Besides importing scrap steel from the North,

765
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,739
do you have any long-term plans?

766
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:44,650
Yes.

767
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,739
I'm planning to also

768
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,719
rent the land near the storage yard.

769
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,350
And in the future

770
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:49,120
I plan to build

771
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,560
a port where 10,000-ton ships can dock at.

772
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,020
Then the steel we import

773
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,420
can all be docked at our own port.

774
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,900
That way, we can save a lot

775
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,050
on our shipping.

776
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,270
It'll be easier to get a loan from the bank in the future.

777
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,730
The port business is not good these days.

778
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,430
Why don't you rent one?

779
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,000
Building your own

780
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,170
will put a lot of financial pressure on yourself.

781
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,910
So I want to do it step by step.

782
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,870
Get the supporting facilities ready,

783
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:12,970
and make money first.

784
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,130
Here's what I think.

785
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,380
if this channel to the north

786
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,530
goes smoothly,

787
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,550
Mr. Wu and the others will also bring in more.

788
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,240
The amount I bring in will also increase.

789
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,320
And your company's...

790
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,490
Sorry.

791
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,610
I've also calculated the amount for your company.

792
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,190
In that case,

793
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,450
we won't lose too much.

794
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,280
With the location of my storage yard,

795
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,890
it makes no sense not to build a yard

796
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,040
in the future.

797
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,940
Our storage yard, coupled with a port,

798
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,250
will make our business more accessible

799
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,490
in the future.

800
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,140
Tong Xiaoqi.

801
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,920
What?

802
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,300
I want to see your storage yard.

803
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:53,700
Okay.

804
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,170
How about the day after tomorrow?

805
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,050
Okay.

806
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,010
Stop! Stop!

807
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,410
Stop!

808
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,170
Stop!

809
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,910
Captain.

810
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,730
I’m fine.

811
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,170
Let's check on Plunger.

812
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,850
Captain.

813
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,190
OK.

814
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,890
Are you okay?

815
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,260
Plunger!

816
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,420
Plunger, are you okay?

817
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,300
I'm fine.

818
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:15,770
Let's go.

819
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,860
Let's go.

820
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,110
Stop.

821
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,710
Let's go.

822
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,560
Stop!

823
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,860
It's gonna be too late.

824
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,450
Go!

825
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,630
Stop!

826
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,120
Stop!

827
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,010
Go!

828
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,590
Stop!

829
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,770
Go!

830
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,210
Go!

831
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,730
Go!

832
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,060
Stop!

833
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,020
Let's go. It's too late.

834
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,450
Stop!

835
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,450
Let's go!

836
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,580
Go!

837
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Let's go!

838
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,660
Run!

839
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,990
Go! Go!

840
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,700
Go!

841
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,790
Run!

842
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:57,510
Oh no.

843
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,000
What are you doing, not picking up the phone?

844
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,330
No matter what,

845
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,580
you have to take down the intertidal zone tomorrow.

846
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,450
I just promised the foreigner

847
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,490
to take him to the storage yard the day after tomorrow.

848
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,160
He'll lend us money if we have a storage yard.

849
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,160
Okay.

850
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,310
I was the one

851
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,180
who did it.

852
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,220
It was my idea.

853
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,940
The blame is not yours to take.

854
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,010
Whose car was it?

855
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,560
Who was the one who hired the guys?

856
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,230
None of your business.

857
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,830
What are you talking about?

858
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,640
I'll go in.

859
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,130
The company can only do well

860
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,880
if you work together with her.

861
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,980
If you take the blame, what about her?

862
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,230
What about the company?

863
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,340
You just came out, you know?

864
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,180
You'll be dealt a severe sentence if you go in again.

865
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,490
Are you stupid?

866
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,810
Look at you.

867
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,430
Such a skinny fellow.

868
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,460
People might scare you to death if you go in,

869
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,040
you know?

870
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,000
Do you know how to become

871
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,830
the leader inside?

872
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,220
Do you know how to behave

873
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,970
so that you can come out early?

874
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,690
You just focus on

875
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,850
living well outside

876
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,150
and make sure the company succeeds.

877
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,420
I'll look forward to coming out and having a slice of the pie.

878
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,390
Excuse me.
