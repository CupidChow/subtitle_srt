[Episode 21]

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,850
I'm off work.

5
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,580
Bye.

6
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,280
Xinyi! Xinyi!

7
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,940
Are you still angry?

8
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,820
Let's have dinner together and watch a movie after work.

9
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,509
I'm not going.

10
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,820
Haven't you always wanted to watch this?

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,390
I finally got the tickets.

12
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,810
It's been so long.

13
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,829
I've already known the plot and the ending.

14
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,310
A group of people got on a boat.

15
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,780
A young lady

16
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,090
fell in love with a poor guy.

17
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,780
Not long after they fell in love,

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,030
the boat crashed into an iceberg.

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,740
That poor guy died.

20
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,520
By the way,

21
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,300
I applied for a course at the night school.

22
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm going to study computer.

23
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,390
I also registered one for you.

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
These are textbooks and materials.

25
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,900
It's your call whether to go or not.

26
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,500
Remember to prepare more of this cold medicine.

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,660
-Okay. -It's their first time to spend winter in the South.

28
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,990
Although it's not as cold as the Northeast,

29
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,890
they must not be used to it.

30
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:09,780
-Then… -I'll arrange it this afternoon.

31

Get more of this heated blanket

33
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,820
Okay.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,650
There's an old man in this family.

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,480
Remember to put handrails

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,320
beside the bed and in the bathroom.

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,060
Especially in the shower cubicle,

38
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,700
put a bath mat there.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,550
Got it.

40
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,620
Okay, I'll get someone to do it this afternoon.

41
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,780
Okay, go ahead.

42
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,630
-No problem. -Okay, Mr. Chen.

44
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,940
I have some news.

45
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,870
A good one and a bad one.

46
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,890
Which one do you want to hear first?

47
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,250
Spill the beans.

48
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,380
The bidding time for State No.2 Steel

49
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,470
is scheduled for the next week.

50
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
I know this. What about the other one?

51
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,110
The other one is

52
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,580
Chen had chemotherapy several times

53
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,040
and lost a lot of hair.

54
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,620
You need to be mentally prepared.

55
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,590
When you see him,

56
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,570
don't look too serious. Be happy.

Boss.

59
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,260
You really should persuade him.

60
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,100
I was told

61
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,790
cancer is not scary. It can be cured.

62
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,460
As long as he cooperates in his treatment,

63
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,260
he'll live ten to twenty more years,

64
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,080
but he didn't listen.

65
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,610
I've asked around.

66
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,300
Several kinds of medicines abroad

67
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,170
are very effective.

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,710
I've asked someone to get it for me.

69
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,540
Let's try them all then.

70
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,670
I don't believe he can't be cured.

71
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,659
You should really persuade him.

72
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,860
Let him read these books.

73
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,900
Let him read them carefully.

74
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,050
He's ignorant and disobedient.

75
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,090
Coming.

76
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,000
Fatty.

77
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,570
Well,

78
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,270
why didn't you tell me you were back?

79
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,810
Your new hairstyle looks good.

80
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,800
I think it's good too.

81
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,770
Come in please.

82
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,380
I've brought you some specialties from the Northeast.

83
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,180
Zhou Qian.

84
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,970
Take it.

85
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,180
Have a seat.

86
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,040
Why don't you go to the hospital?

87
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,100
Why hospital?

88
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,000
I thought only Xiaoqi would buy into these,

89
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,330
but you also believe them?

90
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,870
It's all a lie.

91
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,620
I'm gonna throw them away.

92
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,060
I've discussed with Zhou Qian.

93
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,210
I'll take her to Maldives when you come back.

94
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,870
I've brought a lot of materials from the travel agency.

95
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,860
Look at this.

96
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,600
The sea.

97
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,770
Have you seen such a blue sea?

98
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,830
It's so beautiful.

99
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,650
And this.

100
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,980
White beach.

101
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,260
I heard from the tourists who had been there that

102
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,150
they would bring the sand back.

103
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,790
Have some water.

104
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,970
I've prepared some bottles. I'll bring some sand back.

105
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,710
Do you want to go with us?

106
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,790
Why should I go?

107
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,150
To be the third wheel for you?

108
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,490
Fine.

109
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,100
I'll bring you some sand then.

110
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,310
Don't worry.

111
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,730
I'll send you postcards when I get there.

112
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,540
Okay?

113
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,740
What do you think?

114
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,049
Is that okay?

115
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,270
Okay?

116
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,690
-Okay? -It's up to you.

117
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,810
I have something to trouble you.

118
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,110
Could you help me find a lawyer?

119
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
I want to

120
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,140
make a will in advance.

121
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:01,940
Cut it out.

122
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,300
Chen looks good.

123
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,520
You've taken good care of him.

124
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,200
Thank you for what you did during this time.

125
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:19,960
Miss Xu.

126
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,160
I need more money.

127
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,590
How much?

128
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,960
You saw how Chen looks.

129
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,710
After every chemotherapy,

130
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,340
he would keep vomiting.

131
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,360
He couldn't eat at all.

132
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,010
He lost a lot of hair.

133
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,880
I watched him

134
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,600
get closer to death step by step.

135
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,110
That's how I've been suffering

136
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,950
everyday.

137
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:53,820
Tell me.

138
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,440
How much more should you pay?

139
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,740
I'll pay you double.

140
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,800
I can't pretend anymore.

141
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,480
Don't.

142
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,780
Hang in there for a while.

143
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,520
I'll double your payment.

144
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,330
I'll pay you as much as you want.

145
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,630
Apart from money,

146
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,990
what else do you have?

147
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,510
It has nothing to do with what I have.

148
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,480
I'll do as much as I can.

149
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,130
Actually, this steel mill

150
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,610
is also Chen's dream.

151
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,750
I'm in a race against time everyday.

152
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,000
Although I know

153
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,860
he might not be able to see it in the end,

154
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,120
I just want him to be happy.

155
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,870
I want to give him everything.

156
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,520
You did this

157
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,790
only to make yourself feel better.

158
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,060
No matter what I do,

159
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,190
I'm sorry for him my whole life.

160
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,980
Yes, it's me.

161
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,620
Is it? Good.

162
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,100
Okay.

163
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,230
But right now is not a good time.

164
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,120
What about next month?

165
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,520
Yes.

166
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,270
Yes.

167
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,550
Next month I'll be OK.

168
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:01,650
All right.

169
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,520
Thank you for your understanding.

170
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,580
Okay, bye.

171
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,370
I just got a call.

172
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,660
The British company I applied for

173
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,380
called me.

174
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,300
They wanted to meet me

175
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,480
next month in Shanghai.

176
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,110
You finally found yourself a foreign company.

177
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,980
What are you talking about?

178
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,840
Didn't we agree?

179
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,320
Besides, I won't go there right away.

180
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,420
I'll go after the bidding.

181
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,660
Why are you panicking?

182
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,000
I won't stop you.

183
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,020
I know this day will come sooner or later.

184
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,740
I just didn't expect it to come so soon.

185
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,930
I accept it.

186
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,660
Don't be like this.

187
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,920
Don't always accept everything.

188
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,590
I know what you're thinking.

189
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,130
You can tell me.

190
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,830
What's the use of telling you?

191
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,620
Will you stay if I tell you?

192
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,720
Maybe.

193
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,370
Tell me.

194
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,270
I

195
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,390
don't dare to expect anything,

196
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,220
especially love.

197
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,480
What I care about will eventually leave me,

198
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,560
so I dare not ask you.

199
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,390
I don't want to ask you either.

200
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,190
One by one.

201
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,510
One by one. No hurry.

202
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,660
In the South,

203
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,470
we eat tangyuan when we move.

204
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,830
It means reunion

205
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,300
and happiness.

206
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,070
Come here.

207
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,380
Good luck.

208
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,140
Here you go.

209
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,700
Here, good luck.

210
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,780
Thank you for coming.

211
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,970
This is a convention.

212
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,300
Come on.

213
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,260
It's hot.

214
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,250
Welcome everybody.

215
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,100
No hurry. One by one.

216
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,000
One by one.

217
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,410
One by one. No hurry.

218
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,560
One by one.

219
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,160
Guys,

220
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,140
find your luggage after eating tangyuan.

221
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,980
No hurry.

222
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,740
Take your time.

223
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,720
Take your time.

224
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,220
Go to the second floor.

225
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,300
Both the first and second floor.

226
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,820
You could find your names on the form.

227
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,740
There's hot water in every room.

228
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,540
The elderly are on the first floor and the second floor.

229
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,660
Your names are on the form.

230
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,620
Are you tired, Mom?

231
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,300
-No, I'm okay. -Dad.

232
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,660
It's okay.

233
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,820
-It's good. -You must be tired.

234
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,040
Have some tangyuan.

235
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
Are you used to it?

236
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,690
Yes, we are. It's nice.

237
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,220
Thank you.

238
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,190
It's warmer here.

239
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,320
I've arranged a place for you to stay.

240
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,270
Okay.

241
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Sister, come.

242
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,180
You must be tired all this way.

243
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,840
Here, let me get one for you.

244
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,370
Jia, do you want one?

245
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,510
No, thanks.

246
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,120
Fatty.

247
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,420
We'll go there first.

248
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,020
Okay.

249
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,500
Go ahead.

250
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,320
Miss Xu.

251
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
-Mr. Wu. -You're finally back.

252
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,900
It's been a long time.

253
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,490
Mr. Wu.

254
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
You must take a lot of effort.

255
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,950
Why are you here?

256
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,420
Is it hard to find here?

257
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,090
Many people know your place.

258
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,200
I heard you had brought back a lot of people.

259
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,620
What now?

260
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,000
You don't buy steel scrap

261
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,260
but human resources?

262
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,450
I didn't expect that either.

263
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,900
I didn't bring any technical equipment

264
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,430
this time when I went back from Shenyang,

265
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,900
but a group of people.

266
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,580
But they used to

267
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,060
work in Shenyang Steel Factory.

268
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,930
Everyone is talented.

269
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,540
What can I do for you?

270
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:03,980
Xu.

271
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,830
I have thought about it.

272
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Last time,

273
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,090
I wasn't thoughtful enough when dividing shares.

274
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,550
To be honest,

275
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,550
I still don't want to be separated from you.

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,170
Indeed,

277
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,060
as someone elder,

278
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,550
I did something wrong.

279
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,100
I apologise to you.

280
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,510
Let's

281
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,420
do business together.

282
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,250
Isn't that great?

283
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,640
No hurry.

284
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,620
Xu, how about this?

285
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,120
I'll call Feng.

286
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,710
You two are close.

287
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:35,920
Listen to what he says.

288
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,360
Hello?

289
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,500
Feng.

290
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,540
I'm with Xu.

291
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,840
You talk to her.

292
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,150
Say it.

293
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,300
Xu, listen.

294
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,270
Listen to him.

295
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,110
Hello, Feng.

296
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,490
Xu.

297
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,740
Hear me out before you talk.

298
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,240
Mr. Wu decided to make a call at this time.

299
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,230
He asked me to persuade you.

300
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,630
I understand what he means.

301
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,720
I don't care about the shares.

302
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,410
You can decide

303
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,579
no matter what you want.

304
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,700
Give me 10%

305
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,089
or even 1%.

306
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,520
Anyone can be the boss.

307
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,280
Just let me know when you make a call.

308
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm hanging up.

309
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,930
I'm fishing.

310
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,869
It took the bait.

311
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,670
It took the bait.

312
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,390
I'm hanging up.

313
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,819
How is it? Did I lie to you?

314
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,840
Mr. Wu, to be honest,

315
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,850
I have to

316
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,390
take over this steel mill.

317
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,220
No hurry. It's hot.

318
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,590
It's extremely important to me.

319
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,740
Have some more.

320
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,970
Thank you for coming.

321
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,970
So don't blame me for competing with you.

322
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,930
I'm determined to get it,

323
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,240
but I can make it up to you in the future.

324
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,000
Are we good?

325
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,060
How are you going to make it up to me?

326
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,480
How do you want me to do it?

327
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,700
I didn't mean that.

328
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,800
You can do whatever you want.

329
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,150
I really can't

330
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,100
let you take this steel mill away from me.

331
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,930
There you go.

332
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,380
Have some more.

333
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,600
Coming.

334
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,310
Okay.

335
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,660
Be careful, it's hot.

336
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,820
Be careful. It's hot.

337
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,760
Leave it there. I'll make my bed later.

338
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,450
It's okay. I'll do it.

339
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,170
That day,

340
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,290
I told Fatty

341
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,690
we're going to Maldives.

342
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,830
She agreed.

343
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,290
She asked us to bring her gifts

344
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,300
when we come back.

345
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,850
So I don't want to wait anymore.

346
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,820
Let's go to Maldives tomorrow.

347
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,610
Tomorrow?

348
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,320
I've found a lot of things lately.

349
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,140
For example, I found that

350
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,560
Xiaoqi is quite competent.

351
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,650
I thought this bastard

352
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,360
would make a lot of troubles everyday,

353
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,400
even at night.

354
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,240
I didn't expect that

355
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,310
he arranged everything so well.

356
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,770
Wildcat also

357
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,000
manages the company's finances well.

358
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,550
I feel like I'm not that important.

359
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,750
Besides, Fatty is back.

360
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,050
So

361
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,090
let's go to Maldives tomorrow.

362
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,180
It doesn't require visas.

363
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,140
We can leave after buying tickets at the airport.

364
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,470
It's like watching a movie.

365
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,070
Good night.

366
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,720
How's it going with your night school study recently?

367
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,540
Xu Banxia asked you to do that?

368
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,990
Can't it be I want to do it myself?

369
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,440
Why would you

370
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,980
want to do that?

371
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,470
Mom,

372
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,600
everyone is learning computer nowadays.

373
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,340
It took me a lot of effort to sign up for the course.

374
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,740
We don't use

375
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,380
physical business cards anymore in our company.

376
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,960
Now we're using that website.

377
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,180
Su is working on it.

378
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,900
He said

379
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,700
that could make

380
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,840
a national steel trade meeting.

381
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,230
If I don't learn now,

382
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,040
I won't be able to keep up to date.

383
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,920
Even if I can't be a pioneer,

384
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,540
I don't want to be left behind.

385
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,940
You've been very active lately.

386
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,840
Did Su teach you that?

387
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,320
Let me tell you something.

388
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,990
When I was in the office the other day,

389
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,330
I saw him

390
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,020
staring at the screen and smiling.

391
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,130
I asked what he was looking at.

392
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,910
It turned out he had fallen in love.

393
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,150
He said it's online dating.

394
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,870
Isn't it funny?

395
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,830
Online dating?

396
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,770
Can someone start a relationship without meeting in person?

397
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,050
What's wrong with online dating?

398
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,780
Online dating is about communicating thoughts.

399
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,130
They can reach a consensus mentally.

400
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,430
At least they are the same kind.

401
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,340
Your relationship is not much better than his.

402
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:09,990
Well,

403
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,130
when you're in a relationship without seeing each other,

404
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,150
can it be called love?

405
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,770
What do you think is love?

406
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,390
At least, he has to be with me all the time.

407
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,180
I see him everyday.

408
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,860
He's all around me.

409
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,060
How about having a dog?

410
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,000
Sorry, I was wrong.

411
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,310
What you think is love

412
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,520
is not love.

413
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,810
What is love?

414
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,440
It's well explained

415
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,790
in biology.

416
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,250
Love is dopamine in the first ten minutes.

417
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,740
After that, it's all about relationship.

418
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,870
When two people are in a relationship,

419
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,170
they need to grow together,

420
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
nurture each other,

421
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,900
and find each other's value.

422
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,710
You were so determined

423
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,070
to change your Top Squad.

424
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,860
Have you talked to Tong Xiaoqi?

425
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm going to break up with him.

426
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,080
You're right, Mom.

427
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,610
Dopamine won't last long.

428
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,630
I can't stand it. I can't change him.

429
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,680
That's it.

430
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,400
Tell me.

431
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,120
What happened?

432
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,860
That's what he said.

433
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,130
I wouldn't say that.

434
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,360
Of course not.

435
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:41,820
He said he'll go to Maldives

436
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,700
tomorrow morning.

437
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,060
I can't persuade him.

438
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,260
How could I instigate him?

439
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,380
Why don't you believe me?

440
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,150
Who are you calling?

441
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,380
I...

442
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,620
I'm calling Tong.

443
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,620
Aren't we going to Maldives tomorrow?

444
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,000
I want to tell them.

445
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,200
Why?

446
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,840
I think it's too urgent.

447
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,140
Urgent?

448
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,470
Hello?

449
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,260
Hello?

450
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:37,490
Hello, boss.

451
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,980
You know what?

452
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,940
Chen is going to Maldives soon.

453
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,540
He's leaving tomorrow.

454
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,940
He said you agreed.

455
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,360
Tomorrow?

456
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,700
Looks like he's determined to go.

457
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,260
Then let him go.

458
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,340
What are you talking about?

459
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Are you crazy?

460
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,230
If he goes now, he'll die.

461
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,420
This may be his last wish.

462
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,410
Why don't we agree?

463
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,530
He can't go anywhere now.

464
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,190
He can only be hospitalised.

465
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,650
What are you doing?

466
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,440
Take you to the hospital.

467
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,740
I'm not going.

468
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,890
I'm not sick. Why should I go to the hospital?

469
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,280
What are you doing?

470
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,390
Cover him with a blanket.

471
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,220
Don't let him catch a cold.

472
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,440
Call Zhou Qian over.

473
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,960
You traitor!

474
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,320
I'm not going.

475
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,790
Go.

476
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,980
I'm not going.

477
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,580
You can't go to Maldives.

478
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,980
Your platelet count is too low.

479
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,500
I'm not going.

480
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,340
You have to go to the hospital.

481
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,100
-Cut the crap. -Wait for me.

482
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,180
Can you wait until I'm back?

483
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,690
I'll definitely go there when I'm back.

484
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,730
Wait for me.

485
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,830
I'll go to the hospital when I'm back.

486
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,810
I'll stay there for a month then, okay?

487
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,360
I'm not going.

488
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,140
Tong.

489
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,890
I'm really not going to the hospital.

490
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,110
Open the door.

491
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,420
-Open the door. -I'm going to Maldives.

492
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,060
Put me down.

493
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,540
-Don't move. -Tong

494
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,260
-Don't move. -Tong.

495
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,290
-Zhou Qian. -Put him in.

496
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,540
You traitor! I'm not going!

497
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,340
-Stop it. -I'm really not going.

498
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm not going.

499
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,980
Are you done?

500
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:37,210
♫I can't forget the sparkling tears in your eyes♫

501
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,050
Do you want to stay with us for a few more years?

502
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,390
♫You seem to know I'm lying♫

503
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,420
Do you still want to see that steel mill?

504
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,910
♫I went to the wrong place♫

505
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,230
♫But I dared not look back♫

506
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,140
We...

507

♫I don't want to leave you in the spring rain♫

508
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,830
All of us

509
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,400
are busy around you.

510
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,190
Can you listen to us?

511
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,690
♫Happy smiles♫

512
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,550
I beg you.

513
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,390
♫Flow away in rains and winds♫

514
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,930
I beg you.

515
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,520
♫In a dream♫

516
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,340
♫How many precious times have passed in your life?♫

517
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,210
♫Share with the person you love♫

518
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,550
Let me in.

519
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,880
♫I always choose the wrong direction♫

520
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,720
Hand.

521
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,050
♫I'm sad but I can't forget♫

522
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,960
♫I miss you so much that I can't let you go♫

523
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,680
♫There's no place to talk about my sadness♫

524
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,200
♫When I look back, the light is fading♫

525
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,820
♫Will you still be there?♫

526
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,940
Feng.

527
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,510
You're in the city?

528
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:54,930
Bro.

529
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,460
How's your country life?

530
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,530
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

531
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,430
Time for us to gather.

532
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,230
Have a seat.

533
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,790
What happened?

534
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,780
You're sweating.

535
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,290
Here, wipe it.

536
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,820
Who upset you?

537
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,700
Didn't you ask us to come here?

538
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,630
Tell me. What is it?

539
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,040
I heard you went to see Xu Banxia

540
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,480
and promised to give her

541
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,590
40% of the shares.

542
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,620
Who do you think I am?

543
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,890
He asked me.

544
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,860
I thought you guys

545
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,290
discussed about it.

546
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,260
Xu Banxia is really something.

547
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,420
She recruited 100 people

548
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,930
from the Northeast.

549
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,700
It's obvious that

550
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,170
she wants to take over this steel mill on her own.

551
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,290
Can't you tell?

552
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,020
You even went to her?

553
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,430
Look how arrogant she is now.

554
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,700
Last time,

555
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,820
we went to her shamelessly.

556
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,750
What did she do to us?

557
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,970
Was she being nice to us?

558
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,740
Qiu.

559
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,020
Don't be mean.

560
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,110
I'm not.

561
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,930
Qiu,

562
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,100
I did go to Xu Banxia.

563
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,450
But

564
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,710
I was forced because of money.

565
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,580
If we have enough money

566
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,310
for the bid,

567
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,940
why should I go to her?

568
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:05,980
Besides,

569
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,860
if we can cooperate

570
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,220
to take over the steel mill,

571
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,550
it's not a bad thing.

572
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,220
It seems that I can't do anything about it.

573
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,740
Now you know you can't do anything?

574
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,670
Bro,

575
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,480
I may sound straight.

576
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,240
Please don't mind.

577
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,790
If you still want to

578
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,370
unite everyone

579
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,340
and be fair,

580
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,140
it's impossible.

581
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,820
Don't give her sweet dates

582
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,780
after you slap her in the face.

583
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,970
You're trying to be the good guy,

584
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,620
but you disappointed us.

585
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,810
I've been working for you all these years.

586
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,460
Let alone bidding for State No.2 Steel,

587
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,490
now I can't even enter State No.2 Steel.

588
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,590
If that's the case,

589
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,300
I'll stop bothering with it.

590
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,150
Like Feng Yu,

591
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,220
I'd better retire.

592
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,010
Go ahead.

593
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,140
Qiu,

594
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
at this critical moment,

595
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,820
what's the use of saying this crap?

596
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,820
Just tell me your attitude towards the steel mill.

597
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,740
Do you want to bid for it or not?

598
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,590
If you don't,

599
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,700
I'll leave now.

600
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,150
No, no, no.

601
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,370
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

602
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,140
No, no, no.

603
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,500
Calm down.

604
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,860
We're all friends.

605
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,510
Let's talk

606
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,860
in peace,

607
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,330
okay?

608
00:28:59,370 --> 00:28:59,760
Qiu.

609
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,120
Bro.

610
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:02,940
Don't worry.

611
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,060
Sit down.

612
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,060
We're just talking.

613
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,570
Take a seat.

614
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,990
No need. I can sit on my own.

615
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,510
Bro.

616
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,490
I really want to

617
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,900
take over this steel mill with you,

618
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,210
and make it bigger.

619
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm just worried.

620
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,110
Look how anxious I am.

621
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,400
I was speechless.

622
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,480
Let's get to the point.

623
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,230
Yes, let's get to the point.

624
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,710
Here's the thing.

625
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,770
People from the province are choosing candidates for this bidding.

626
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,020
To put it simply, it depends on

627
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,530
how much money one has.

628
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,410
As you said,

629
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,580
Xu Banxia has hired hundreds of people

630
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,630
from the Northeast.

631
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,410
She's so determined.

632
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
She risks everything she has.

633
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,750
Since we're here together,

634
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,780
we can discuss

635
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,020
how to move forward.

636
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,020
Feng,

637
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,090
do you want to say something first?

638
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,210
Xu did

639
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,100
come to me before.

640
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,940
Seriously,

641
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,940
if you want to run a steel mill,

642
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,190
I'll definitely follow you.

643
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,620
You are experts.

644
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,670
But

645
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,170
we need to talk about

646
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,210
how much we have to raise now.

647
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,700
She is not the same Xu Banxia

648
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,620
who went to import the steel scrap with us.

649
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,310
I did some math for Xu Banxia.

650
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,300
The business line for the steel scrap she imported from abroad

651
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,210
has been open.

652
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,740
She makes money here,

653
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,730
but she wants to

654
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,750
expand the production there.

655
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
I guess she has

656
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,590
as much as 30 million in cash.

657
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,790
In addition to that,

658
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,990
she can get a large loan of 10 million

659
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,980
from the bank.

660
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,920
That is 40 million.

661
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,650
I've analysed her character.

662
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,260
She likes to play dumb.

663
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:35,970
Right?

664
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,560
So I bet she has more.

665
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,940
So that's somewhere

666
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,990
between 45 million and 50 million.

667
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,420
If we can gather

668
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,180
50 million to 60 million,

669
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,700
we'll definitely get this deal.

670
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,970
I didn't work

671
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,880
this year.

672
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,520
I only have five million.

673
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,250
I don't have more.

674
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,160
How much do you have?

675
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,500
17 million.

676
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,060
Qiu,

677
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,050
do you think you can fool me?

678
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,570
17 million?

679
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,380
You have more than that

680
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,330
in terms of the sales of your factory.

681
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,620
Just tell me if you don't want to provide more.

682
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,500
Bro.

683
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,250
Even you said it's sales.

684
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,670
Over these years, my factory

685
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,460
has spent more than 20 million

686
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,460
updating the equipment.

687
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,440
You saw it.

688
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,220
There were also salaries and other expenses.

689
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,340
It's all money.

690
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,980
I really...

691
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,550
I've counted in

692
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,090
the advance payment

693
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,080
so that I could

694
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,530
get the 17 million.

695
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,620
That's Feng's limit.

696
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,340
We know his situation.

697
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,000
If you don't work harder, Qiu,

698
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,740
this thing will become what you said.

699
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,110
Then it's over.

700
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,750
Qiu, think of another way.

701
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,140
If there's no other way,

702
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,900
sell the factory like me.

703
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,780
What are you talking about? How can I sell my factory?

704
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,700
I'm not divorced yet.

705
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,940
Bro, you have to believe me.

706
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,220
I swear to God now.

707
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,940
I really have no money.

708
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,100
If I have money, I'll give it all.

709
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,610
How about this?

710
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,700
I'll ask my wife

711
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,050
to see how much money she has.

712
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
I'll take as much as she has.

713
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,470
I'll provide 20 million.

714
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,010
You have to leave some money for me.

715
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,470
My son is still studying in the UK.

716
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,840
I have to save some living expenses for him.

717
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:25,560
That's all.

718
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
You're really Qiu Bizheng.

719
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,710
That's all.

720
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,820
So you mean

721
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,470
I'll make up the rest?

722
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,320
Fine.

723
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,070
You call me brother after all.

724
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,230
It's a deal.

725
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,130
I'll try

726
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,750
as hard as I can

727
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,900
to find a way

728
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,180
to get the rest of the 30 million.

729
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:54,610
Bro.

730
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,890
I have full trust

731
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,860
in you.

732
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,160
[Clinic]

733
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:42,900
Okay.

734
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,770
Mr. Zhao.

735
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,710
Can we have a word?

736
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:50,960
Okay.

737
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,540
What's wrong?

738
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,950
I sent Chen to the hospital today.

739
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,250
I guess he won't have much time.

740
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,330
You know

741
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,889
the relationship between boss and Chen.

742
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,320
I'm afriad

743
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,100
boss won't be able to accept it

744
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,960
if Chen is really gone.

745
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,650
I knew it.

746
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,949
My boss likes you.

747
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,449
She looks much softer than before

748
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,570
after she came back from the Northeast this time

749
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,320
How was she like before?

750
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,739
She has had a hard life since she was young.

751
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,510
Her mother passed away early.

752
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,100
Her father didn't like her.

753
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,639
So she moved out at a young age.

754
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,090
Luckily, she met Chen.

755
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,550
They relied on each other

756
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,400
and suffered all the hardships.

757
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,680
So you must be good to her.

758
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,950
Thank you for telling me this.

759
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,800
I will.

760
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,930
Recently, I've found that

761
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,350
the longer

762
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,960
one can spend their life

763
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,970
with someone they love,

764
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,490
the more meaningful their life is.

765
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,820
For example, Chen.

766
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,150
When he's about to leave,

767
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,880
I realized

768
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,640
how much time I had wasted.

769
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,850
I regret

770
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,020
not traveling with him.

771
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,310
Now I can only keep him with me

772
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,230
in this selfish way.

773
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,950
Sometimes people are like this.

774
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,700
You'll only cherish something when it's gone.

775
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,770
You'll only regret if you lose it.

776
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,710
How is it? Is it getting better?

777
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,310
A genetic blood disease.

778
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,600
There are many factors. It's complicated.

779
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,950
It's hard to explain.

780
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,330
Although medicine is advanced now,

781
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,540
there's nothing we can do

782
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,660
about an inherited functional defect

783
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,290
like his.

784
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:16,830
Let me get you some water.

785
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,110
How much time does he have?

786
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,030
I can't answer this question

787
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,070
as a doctor.

788
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,100
Based on my experience,

789
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,110
at least a month,

790
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,520
or up to half a year.

791
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,800
Chen is still young.

792
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,260
I think he's in a good state.

793
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,570
But you need to be mentally prepared.

794
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,370
All these years,

795
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,190
I've been busy making money.

796
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,870
I even ignored

797
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,370
my closest friend.

798
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,470
That winter,

799
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,340
I went to import steel scrap.

800
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,050
He was at the storage yard alone.

801
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,070
We didn't have money at the construction site.

802
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,150
He didn't mention anything to me.

803
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,830
He never blamed me.

804
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,210
Whenever I asked him,

805
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,810
he always said nothing.

806
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,330
It's okay.

807
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,160
It's all my fault.

808
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,690
It's all my fault.

809
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,190
It's not easy for him to keep it up until now.

810
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,010
A hereditary disease like this

811
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,800
can't be avoided.

812
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,900
If you didn't

813
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,140
force him to come here for a check-up,

814
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,050
the situation will be even worse.

815
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,580
When I was a freshman in medical school,

816
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,490
we had an anatomy class.

817
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,290
Many students were afraid to cut,

818
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,310
or they couldn't have eaten for a month

819
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,680
after cutting.

820
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,480
But I didn't.

821
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,100
Because I knew

822
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,760
there's only a body left after someone dies.

823
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,920
So the living people

824
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,670
should continue to live their lives well.

825
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,720
Miss Xu.

826
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,040
Go back. I'll take care of him.

827
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,370
It's okay. I'll take care of him.

828
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,580
Tell me if you need anything.

829
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,860
Tell me if you need money.

830
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,290
I'll pay.

831
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,900
The key is about these details.

832
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,940
Let's talk about it when I go back.

833
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,650
Every word needs to be verified.

834
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,230
Hello, President Gao.

835
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,260
Hello, Mr. Wu.

836
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,100
Hello.

837
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,160
Long time no see.

838
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,700
Yeah, it's been a while.

839
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,740
What brings you here?

840
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,200
Sorry to bother you, President Gao.

841
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,190
President Gao,

842
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,680
I came here

843
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,470
to talk about the bidding for State No.2 Steel...

844
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:33,970
Thank you.

845
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,430
Can I ask some questions

846
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,420
about the bidding of the State No.2 Steel?

847
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,350
As for the bidding of the State No.2 Steel,

848
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,090
it's well explained in the document.

849
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,420
We also have a specific department

850
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,060
who is in charge of this.

851
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,680
Let Zhang talk you through.

852
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,140
No, thanks.

853
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,950
The reason I came here

854
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,400
is to talk about something with you in person.

855
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,300
Mr. Wu, I'm sorry.

856
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,180
I have to go

857
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,630
in five minutes.

858
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,620
I'll make it short.

859
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,100
I still want to discuss with you

860
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,340
about the bidding for State No.2 Steel.

861
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,600
We will treat this

862
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,190
in fair.

863
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,020
We can't talk about it in private.

864
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:17,880
Right.

865
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,060
President Gao.

866
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,800
Look, President Gao.

867
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,040
I heard that you like tea.

868
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,750
I asked an old friend of mine in Yunnan

869
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,700
to get some Pu'er.

870
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,340
Please try it.

871
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,010
I don't know if it suits your taste.

872
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,730
President Gao,

873
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,330
we've been friends for years.

874
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,010
Just tell me the truth.

875
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,170
Tell me the minimum range of the bidding

876
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,680
and how much money I need to prepare

877
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,980
in order to get State No.2 Steel.
