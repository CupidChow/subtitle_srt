President Gao.

5
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,050
Mr. Wu.

6
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,990
You want me to make a mistake?

7
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,380
Do you want this

8
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,660
to be appeared in the Commission for Discipline Inspection

9
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,380
or the Public Security Bureau?

10
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,380
President Gao.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
That's not what I mean.

12
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,630
This is my sincerity.

13
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,150
President Gao.

14
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,260
I'm an old man.

15
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,040
It's my first time...

16
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,700
Take it back.

17
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,770
I'll pretend nothing happened.

18
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,780
I know

19
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,970
you are determined to get this steel mill.

20
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,870
The same goes for others.

21
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,050
Wu.

22
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,540
It's different now.

23
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,050
Yes.

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,910
This is the market. It's a competition.

25
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,270
We have to follow the rules of competition.

26
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,530
Yes.

27
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,150
Maybe someone

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,320
will give you what you want.

29
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,210
But that person will never be me.

30
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,080
We're old friends.

31
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,710
I hope you can respect me

32
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,760
and respect yourself.

33
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,960
Who can get State No.2 Steel

34
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,360
is the same for us.

35
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,040
The key is who can manage it well.

36
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,990
Do you understand?

37
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,190
Yes.

38
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,079
Five minutes are up.

39
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,820
I'm sorry, President Gao.

40
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,980
Please don't be angry.

41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,860
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,870
Hello, President Gao.

43
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,930
Xu Banxia.

44
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,450
I hope you won't play any tricks

45
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,180
on the bidding.

46
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,370
I didn't do anything.

47
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,830
I know.

48
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,530
I hope you won't do it in the future.

49
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,440
I won't do it in the future. Don't worry.

50
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,779
Also, let me remind you.

51
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,620
Wu Jianshe is determined to win this bidding.

52
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,380
Okay.

53
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,440
Is that all?

54
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,920
Have you added the money from the mills in the countryside?

55
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,950
Yes, Mr. Wu.

56
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,100
Okay.

57
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,740
All right, you may leave.

58
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,810
Hello.

59
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,810
Mr. Wu.

60
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,980
There's a new situation.

61
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,480
Let me introduce him first.

62
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,080
This is Mr. Wu, Wu Jianshe, who is recognized

63
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,840
as the leader in our industry and province.

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,500
Mr. Wu.

65
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,840
This is Manager Hong,

66
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,940
the chief representative

67
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,480
of America Weida Steel Trading Company in China.

68
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,840
This company just joined China,

69
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,510
but it keeps developing.

70
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,890
Amazing!

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,230
Nice.

72
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,310
Nice to meet you, Manager Hong.

73
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,500
I look forward to working with you.

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,650
You're welcome.

75
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,060
Mr. Wu. Mr. Qiu.

76
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,420
I have high blood pressure. I can't drink.

77
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,500
He's a patient.

78
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,370
Manager Hong,

79
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,040
you must know

80
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,640
State No.2 Steel is going to be bid for.

81
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,870
Mr. Wu and I also participated in this.

82
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,570
You know President Gao of this province, right?

83
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,270
President Gao had Mr. Wu's promise.

84
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,700
President Gao said

85
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,360
that she was very confident in our company.

86
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,010
Yes.

87
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,140
In this bidding, you have

88
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,620
favourable timing, geographical and human conditions.

89
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,510
Our company is new here.

90
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,920
We just came to Jiangdong Province.

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,780
I need your help.

92
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,670
If there's anything I can help you with,

93
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,980
just let me know.

94
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,230
Look.

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,690
Since Manager Hong said so,

96
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,010
I won't hide it anymore.

97
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,800
We really need your help.

98
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,830
Mr. Wu has agreed

99
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,910
that when we succeed,

100
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,190
most of our company's orders and discounts

101
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,840
will be given to you.

102
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,030
I wonder

103
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,600
what we can help you.

104
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,210
It's just a small matter.

105
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,100
I don't know if you know it.

106
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,900
Have you received a resume

107
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,000
sent by a man named Zhao Lei?

108
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,970
You got up?

109
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,280
How are you feeling, Chen?

110
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,390
You're here.

111
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,130
I brought you porridge.

112
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,380
Look at my clothes.

113
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,660
Am I really like a patient?

114
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,190
They told me

115
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,930
you'll recover after treatment.

116
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,260
No matter who told you, it must be a lie.

117
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,150
After a few weeks,

118
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,250
someone has to help me wipe my butt.

119
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,820
All right, stop.

120
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,490
I'm not hungry. Have a seat.

121
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,450
I'm not hungry. Come.

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,250
Come and sit.

123
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:58,950
Come here.

124
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,580
I want to hug you.

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,340
I left you some money.

126
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,240
You can open a clothing shop in your hometown.

127
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,240
Don't you like clothes?

128
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,430
I'll ask Xiaoqi to help you with the stock.

129
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,950
He's been to many places. He knows the way.

130
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,500
I don't want your money.

131
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,940
I don't know how to run a shop.

132
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,200
You can do it.

133
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,590
It's not difficult.

134
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,720
Don't do your former job.

135
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,650
It's risky, and it's not good for you.

136
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,250
They will lead you astray.

137
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,340
I'm not bad at all.

138
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,570
I know.

139
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,580
The money is for you.

140
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,220
Keep it.

141
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,810
I still have money for my parents.

142
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,370
I don't want it.

143
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,220
The money Fatty gave you belonged to Fatty.

144
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,280
It's mine.

145
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,910
Don't tell Fatty

146
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,990
I know this.

147
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,810
She can't repay you no matter how much money she gives you.

148
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,480
Thank you for being with me.

149
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,400
What are you doing?

150
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,070
I'm still alive.

151
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,260
Don't have a long face.

152
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,190
Isn't it good to make more money?

153
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,790
I don't want your money. I don't want hers either.

154
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,850
What do you take me for?

155
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,620

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,380
it'll not just about drinking

172
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,330
and fighting.

173
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,760
♫In the face of the fate♫

174
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,230
♫We can do nothing♫

175
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,830
♫I've been living a normal life♫

176
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,690
I knew I'd be like this when I was little.

177
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,170
♫But I feel that there should be someone else♫

178
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,980
See? I'm not crying.

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
♫And I gradually realize♫

180
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,150
♫You are the one that I care about forever♫

181
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,950
♫How many love can be started over?♫

182
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,370
♫How many people are willing to wait?♫

183
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,510
Chen Yuzhou.

184
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,630
♫When I know how to cherish it♫

185
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,830
I've never been in a relationship before.

186
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,890
♫I don't know if that love♫

187
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,150
♫is still there♫

188
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,870
We're even.

189
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,390
♫How many love can be started over?♫

190
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,590
♫How many people are worth waiting?♫

191
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,790
♫When love has gone through ups and downs♫

192
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,300
♫Do you still have the courage to love?♫

193
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,360
♫When love has gone through ups and downs♫

194
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,600
♫Do you still have the courage to love?♫

195
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,470
Kuan.

196
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,230
Let me help you.

197
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,740
Call me sister.

198
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,220
Don't call me Kuan like them.

199
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,710
Dad! Mom!

200
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,950
Kuan is here.

201
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,650
Kuan is here?

202
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,750
Kuan, you came back from the northeast?

203
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,340
Why are you so polite?

204
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,710
You even brought us gifts.

205
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,930
Did you thank your sister?

206
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,770
Thank you, sister.

207
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,630
Where's my dad?

208
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,150
Xu, Kuan is here.

209
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,220
Okay.

210
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,380
You really know how to buy things.

211
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,700
The sound of the imported piano is different.

212
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,650
Play it well.

213
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,160
She's been practicing this song for days.

214
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,150
She wants to play it to you.

215
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,050
Dad.

216
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,600
Kuan.

217
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,820
Sit down and talk.

218
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,140
Here. Warm your hands.

219
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,220
Thank you.

220
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,130
Kuan.

221
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,600
I heard that you're going to take State No.2 Steel.

222
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,820
State No.2 Steel.

223
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,350
Why are you so good?

224
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,540
Amazing.

225
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,170
That's a big mill.

226
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,550
Qian's uncle once worked there.

227
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,780
He was quite arrogant during those days.

228
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,620
He didn't even take off his uniform after work.

229
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,950
Seriously.

230
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,730
The family of Xu

231
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,860
is so lucky.

232
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,420
You have a manager of a big mill.

233
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,700
Yes.

234
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,850
Kuan is really capable.

235
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,660
Kuan.

236
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,060
We are family.

237
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,410
When you take the mill,

238
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,010
can you find a job for Qian's uncle in your mill?

239
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,740
He was a model worker and set a benchmark for technology.

240
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,180
I can guarantee his character.

241
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,900
Are you done?

242
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,410
What's wrong?

243
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,840
I want to talk to her.

244
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,700
Just talk to her here.

245
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,180
Qian is playing the piano.

246
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,260
Let's talk outside.

247
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,610
Let's go outside.

248
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,590
Her uncle.

249
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,760
I know.

250
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,090
Qian, play it well.

251
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,650
What are you doing? Why are you so mysterious?

252
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,610
I just want to ask you.

253
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,130
They said you brought over 100 people

254
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,500
when you came back from the northeast.

255
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,660
Have you figured out what you want to do?

256
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,110
Didn't she say that I want to open a steel mill?

257
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,020
I employed workers.

258
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,090
They are the skilled workers

259
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
I emplyed from the northeast.

260
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,350
Her uncle is not capable.

261
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,620
Keep an eye on her.

262
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,660
Don't let anyone work in my company.

263
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,700
I can't take care of them.

264
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,230
I know.

265
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,820
But you haven't got the steel mill yet.

266
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,890
What if you can't handle it?

267
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,590
We can't bear the loss.

268
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,670
What are you doing?

269
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,780
I haven't started yet.

270
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,900
You started to pour cold water on my business?

271
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,860
No, I didn't.

272
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,750
Look at you. Your business is doing well.

273
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,410
Can't you

274
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,140
use your money

275
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,470
to live a normal life?

276
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,840
Why do you have to torture yourself?

277
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,090
Dad, how could you say that?

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,540
What do you mean?

279
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,580
You don't know it. Why are you worried?

280
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll take care of it.

281
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,070
I know it.

282
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,860
State No.2 Steel used to be state-owned.

283
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,050
It was run by the country.

284
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,310
Do you understand?

285
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,570
Can you manage it well?

286
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,450
You used to be a scrap dealer.

287
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,220
Dad, what's wrong with being a scrap dealer?

288
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,080
The money I gave you

289
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,830
was earned by collecting scrap.

290
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,920
I wouldn't have come this far if I hadn't be a scrap deale.

291
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,550
You don't know it. Mind your own business.

292
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,670
Fine. You...

293
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,700
Don't go that way.

294
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,660
I know. I know.

295
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,870
How about this?

296
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,710
I can't help you.

297
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,830
Take this.

298
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,730
It's yours. Leave now.

299
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,760
Don't let Qian's mother see it.

300
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,940
Leave now.

301
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,080
Excuse me.

302
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,580
Where is ward 12?

303
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,000
Go straight and turn left.

304
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,090
You're still in the mood for eating?

305
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,270
What are you doing?

306
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,860
You should be disabled in the car accident.

307
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,540
I'll be fine after a few days.

308
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,690
What did I tell you?

309
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,050
Don't overload trucks.

310
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,700
Why didn't you listen to me?

311
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,580
I didn't overload the truck.

312
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,610
You didn't overload the truck?

313
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,420
OK. Just a little.

314
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,700
But we all used to do that.

315
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,780
Don't be stubborn.

316
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,700
It's not my fault.

317
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,230
The driver in front suddenly braked.

318
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,180
I slammed on the brakes.

319
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,740
I wrote down the rules and regulations and hung them.

320
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,930
You didn't follow them.

321
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,420
I was unlucky this time.

322
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,060
Do you want to continue working?

323
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,680
Get lost if you don't want to.

324
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,190
I'll be more careful in the future.

325
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:07,940
Where is the bill?

326
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,060
What bill?

327
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,319
What are you doing?

328
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,890
What are you looking for? I...

329
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,730
Can I pay the medical expenses myself, boss?

330
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,030
I'll pay myself.

331
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,150
The tube.

332
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,900
Look at what you've done.

333
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,240
You're lying here.

334
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,390
You can't earn money,

335
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,310
and I have to pay your medical expenses.

336
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
It's fine to repair the truck.

337
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,160
It's fine to be punished for breaking the rules.

338
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,130
But you always get into trouble.

339
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,080
The traffic police recorded it.

340
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,810
They will come to us every day.

341
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,660
You know?

342
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,520
Are you out of your mind?

343
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,340
Boss.

344
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,100
Dad!

345
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,540
Dad.

346
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,630
Here.

347
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,510
-Why are you here? -Dad.

348
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,400
Dad.

349
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,810
I'm fine.

350
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,740
Dad, does it hurt?

351
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm fine.

352
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,900
Dad.

353
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,910
Your wife went to buy you food.

354
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,720
She'll be back soon.

355
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,300
Thank you, Cat.

356
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,660
Well...

357
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,660
We all will listen to you.

358
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,210
Those rules and regulations.

359
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,870
Punish me.

360
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,590
I swear to you, okay?

361
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,510
Don't swear to me.

362
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,690
Your life is yours.

363
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,060
I beg you, Cat.

364
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,600
Don't be angry with our boss.

365
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,930
Cut the crap.

366
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,950
It's none of your business.

367
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,830
I've come to the traffic police.

368
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,930
The truck was also sent to be repaired.

369
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,020
I'll talk about compensation.

370
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,090
And this.

371
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,530
Does it hurt, dad?

372
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,410
Is your hand OK?

373
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,120
Yes.

374
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,380
Copy the rules and regulations ten times.

375
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,950
Do you hear me?

376
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,100
Do you hear me?

377
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,300
OK.

378
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,600
Keep an eye on him.

379
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,670
Okay.

380
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,700
Madam.

381
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,750
We didn't know you were coming.

382
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,740
There's nothing to treat you here.

383
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:40,960
Have some water.

384
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,650
Boss.

385
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,700
Ms. Gao.

386
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,980
Go out to eat.

387
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,910
Why are you here?

388
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,400
What's your life plan?

389
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,050
What's your plan for the future?

390
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
I have no plans.

391
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,720
I want to manage the truck team well.

392
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,340
This one.

393
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,110
Can you manage it well?

394
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,130
I know why you are here.

395
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,380
I can agree with her

396
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,740
about other things.

397
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,860
I can let her do whatever she wants.

398
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,590
But I can't agree with her

399
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,030
about the truck team.

400
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,850
You know

401
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
what happened to my brothers.

402
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,540
She set many

403
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,390
rules and regulations.

404
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,670
They can't live anymore.

405
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,940
I have to think for them.

406
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,240
You should know

407
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,740
what Gao Xinyi wants.

408
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,750
What do you want?

409
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,340
I really don't want anything.

410
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,010
I want to manage the team well

411
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,140
and live a good life with Xinyi.

412
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,920
Is she living a good life?

413
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,720
I know my daughter very well.

414
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,810
Gao Xinyi is stubborn.

415
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,600
She will do

416
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,370
whatever she is determined to do.

417
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,290
She takes after her father.

418
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,680
Her father was in jail too.

419
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,130
Five years.

420
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,750
In order to let the workers in the factory

421
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,870
live a good life

422
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,000
and increase the production capacity,

423
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,070
he took desperate measures.

424
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,590
When he was released,

425
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,770
he fell ill.

426
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,180
He and Gao Xinyi

427
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,560
are best friends.

428
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,110
They can say anything.

429
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,340
He indulged Gao Xinyi with everything.

430
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,230
Later, Gao Xinyi listened to the rock music.

431
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,760
Her dad tried his best

432
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,680
to buy her a ticket to the band Beyond's concert.

433
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,710
I remember that night,

434
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,990
they were so happy.

435
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,460
Shoulder to shoulder.

436
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,990
They kept singing "I like you".

437
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,570
Again and again.

438
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,070
Their eyes lit up.

439
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,610
I didn't agree with your relationship.

440
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,620
She is my daughter

441
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,220
But then I saw how you were like

442
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,210
when you were together.

443
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,780
Do you know why she likes you?

444
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,810
You're like her father.

445
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,250
But I have to remind you

446
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,730
you're not her father.

447
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,800
You are her boyfriend.

448
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,830
Your growth environment is different.

449
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,340
Don't think you can forget who you are

450
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,740
after making some money.

451
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,020
You have to keep up with Gao Xinyi.

452
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,690
Otherwise, your distance

453
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,830
will become longer.

454
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,300
And you'll have more problems.

455
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,540
I didn't want to meddle in your affair.

456
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,970
That's all.

457
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,140
Shallot pancakes. Fresh shallot pancakes.

458

459

I don't want it. I'm here to help.

470

My mom will kill me if she knows.

00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,230
This is the deal.

508
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,250
Whoever dares to do it, each person has to give him five yuan.

509
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,020
Do you agree?

510
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,660
Yes.

511
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,270
Pay up.

512
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,370
Here.

513
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,320
Hurry up.

514
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,210
I only have three yuan.

515
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,980
Three yuan is fine. Watch carefully.

516
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,700
Can you do it?

517
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,100
Don't be a coward. Go up.

518
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,570
Don't go back on your word.

519
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,560
Hurry up.

520
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,750
Hurry up.

521
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,620
Can you do it?

522
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,440
Go!

523
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,700
It's still early.

524
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,740
Hurry up.

525
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,310
The teachr is here. Hurry up.

526
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,020
Stop running!

527
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,810
Who dares to run?

528
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,740
You're making trouble too.

529
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,610
Where is Tong Xiaoqi?

530
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,980
I searched the factory for two times,

531
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,830
but I didn't see him.

532
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,850
His mother was sent to the emergency room.

533
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,310
Tong Xiaoqi! Get down!

534
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,360
Get down now.

535
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,060
What?

536
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,180
Get down.

537
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,820
Which ward is Kuang Meili in?

538
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,860
Go to the nurse station ahead and ask.

539
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,730
Which ward is Kuang Meili in?

540
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,900
Who are you?

541
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,670
She is my mother.

542
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,710
Ward 6.

543
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,590
Wait.

544
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,370
You haven't paid for your mom's hospitalization yet.

545
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,060
That's not enough.

546
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,040
If you don't pay tomorrow, the medicine will be cut off.

547
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,510
Oh my gosh!

548
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,790
Mom.

549
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,630
Mom, how are you?

550
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,090
How dare you come here?

551
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,820
The teacher said you skipped the class again.

552
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,920
Are you trying to piss me off?

553
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,410
You want to piss me off?

554
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,000
-Mom. -You naughty boy.

555
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,750
I went to make money.

556
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,620
I paid for your hospitalization.

557
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,180
I won money from them.

558
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,740
Under the pillow.

559
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,730
Give me the bill.

560
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,290
Listen.

561
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,460
Go to the factory and ask them to reimburse me.

562
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,380
Do you hear me?

563
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,940
Got it.

564
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,480
The patient in bed 12

565
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,380
will be transferred next week.

566
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,310
Let me go first. I'm in a hurry.

567
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,580
We are queuing up.

568
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,350
Go to the back.

569
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,990
Kuang Meili.

570
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,600
How is your mom?

571
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,400
The doctor said her heart rate is unstable.

572
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,490
She has cardiovascular problems.

573
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,540
She needs surgery.

574
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,150
The hospital of the power plant can't do it.

575
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,250
She has to be transferred to the provincial hospital.

576
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,120
Then transfer.

577
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,930
40% this time.

578
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,890
Uncle Li.

579
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,730
Don't you reimburse her for the cost of surgery?

580
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,430
You didn't reimburse her for it the first two times.

581
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,070
You have to find the manager of the plant.

582
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,160
The rules were not set by me.

583
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,400
I want to go to Beijing Hospital.

584
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,360
I want to go abroad.

585
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:43,980
Uncle.

586
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,930
-My mom... -76.4 yuan.

587
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,690
Count it.

588
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,690
Please make an exception.

589
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,510
Add more.

590
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,130
Hurry up.

591
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,920
[Finance Department]

592
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,350
Everyone is in a hurry to work.

593
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:50,900
Hurry up.

594
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,830
Why are you so noisy? I'm also in a hurry.

595
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,590
Come on. So many people are waiting.

596
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,540
Mr. Zhao.

597
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,080
Manager Hong.

598
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,260
I didn't expect to see you here.

599
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,050
If it weren't for Manager Hong,

600
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,010
I wouldn't have a chance to see you.

601
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:49,970
Have a seat.

602
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,990
Let's sit down and talk.

603
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,050
It seems that it's Mr. Wu who wants to talk with me.

604
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,970
Take it easy. Sit down and talk.

605
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,680
Mr. Zhao, here is the thing,

606
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,140
some time ago,

607
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,620
my company received a lot of resumes.

608
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,300
Many of them are excellent like you

609
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,270
and were educated overseas.

610
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,940
Later, Mr. Wu said he was an old friend of yours.

611
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,150
He strongly recommended Mr. Zhao to us.

612
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,010
That's why we meet today.

613
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,580
Handsome Zhao is a famous man

614
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,370
in our industry.

615
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,120
Many big companies want to poach him.

616
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,300
Since he's interested in your company,

617
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,810
I just built a connection

618
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,340
to help him.

619
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,560
Mr. Wu,

620
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,640
let's cut to the chase.

621
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,730
What I want to say is here.

622
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,460
Mr. Zhao, take a look at this.

623
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,210
The general agent in Jiangdong Province.

624
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,630
The salary is one million a year?

625
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,490
That's what we can give you now.

626
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,290
Of course,

627
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,680
you're a talent.

628
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,770
If you are not satisfied,

629
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,680
we can ask the headquarters for more.

630
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,440
If you're willing,

631
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,700
the headquarters also hopes

632
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,300
you can work in America.

633
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,880
We'll pay all the expenses.

634
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,490
And your position in Chinese mainland

635
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,000
will be the same as that in the headquarters in America.

636
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,760
In other words, if you work in America,

637
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,690
you'll still be a top executive of our company.

638
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,500
Look. What a good condition!

639
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,440
If I were 30 years younger,

640
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,500
I would want to go there too.

641
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,710
I can't speak English.

642
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,990
Mr. Wu, you must be joking.

643
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,950
Of course.

644
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,540
I know

645
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,210
you're doing well with Xu.

646
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,720
It's not that tiring.

647
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,770
But the American company of Manager Hong

648
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,850
is where you should go.

649
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,860
The company you're working in is too small.

650
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,950
Mr. Zhao.

651
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,540
If there's anything you feel inappropriate,

652
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,560
we can discuss more.

653
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,100
I don't think it's easy to sign this.

654
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,020
What should I do?

655
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,140
It's easy.

656
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,000
In the bidding conference of State No.2 Steel,

657
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,240
I hope you can help me get State No.2 Steel.

658
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,900
Actually, I'm doing this

659
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,720
for Xu's sake.

660
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,350
She thought it was easy.

661
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,850
It's not just about getting it.

662
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,450
Getting it doesn't mean she can make money soon.

663
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,510
I've explored it more than once.

664
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,640
The mill still needs a lot of investment.

665
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,490
The infrastructure needs to be built.

666
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,910
New equipment also needs to be imported.

667
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,920
Xu Banxia is a little girl.

668
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,330
She can't stand it.

669
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,840
She is young

670
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,640
and inexperienced.

671
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,210
Our company

672
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,130
will speed up and occupy the market.

673
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,310
Next year,

674
