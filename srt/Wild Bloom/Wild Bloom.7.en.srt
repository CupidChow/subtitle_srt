His father and I are old comrades.

154
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,490
When I was the commander,

155

his father was a instructor.

156
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,720
Now he is successful.

157
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,860
He was naughty when he was young.

158
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,120
He always hit our windows with a slingshot.

159
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,780
I hit him a lot.

160

Well, you can call him Yang.

Hello.

172
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,030
Okay.

173
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,000
Uncle, let me tell you.

174
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,850
Thanks to my fiancée Nina.

175
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,460
Otherwise, we wouldn't be

176
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,140
able to buy the steel at such a low price.

177
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,210
Because her father

178
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,930
was the director of this steel mill.

179
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,620
See? No wonder.

180
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,030
Great.

181
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,299
Her father and I are on the same level.

182
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:34,820
Absolutely.

183
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,260
Nina, they're finally here.

184
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,169
Look at them.

185
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,740
They're from the countryside.

186
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,770
They must have no money.

187
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,020
Don't worry. They all have money.

188
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,780
No matter what,

189
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,180
you have to give me the money tonight.

190
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,490
OK. OK. Fine.

191
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,160
Don't worry.

192
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,990
Just act well.

193
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,000
I will.

194
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,820
What about you?

195
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,620
Can you act well?

196
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,740
Don't worry.

197
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,010
It's okay, Uncle. She's just too enthusiastic.

198
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,130
She said it's not easy for you

199
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,930
to come all the way here.

200
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,540
She just asked the people in the room

201
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,530
to prepare all the good wine and dishes.

202
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,700
When we arrive tonight,

203
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,540
we can directly have a big meal.

204
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,100
Thank you.

205
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,300
Thank you.

206
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,730
We're finally here.

207
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,940
This is the house.

208
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,580
Hello.

209
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,370
Come on.

210
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,050
Let me do it.

211
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,700
Okay.

212
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,090
Nina, hold this for me.

213
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,370
That's not part of the promise.

214
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,740
You really have the spirit of contract.

215
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,610
Be careful.

216
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,600
Uncle Wu, these are my friends.

217
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,810
Let's go inside.

218
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,700
When you get in, the dinning room is on your left side.

219
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,060
Okay.

220
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,940
I'll go in first.

221
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,490
Okay.

222
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,250
Here.

223
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,820
Thank you.

224
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,690
I'll carry one.

225
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,440
Okay.

226
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,730
Look, it's all made of wood.

227
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,380
How is it, Uncle Wu?

228
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Boss, this...

229
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,370
Is this their villa?

230
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,100
Of course.

231
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,810
Isn't it magnificent?

232
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,580
This kind house is everywhere.

233
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,240
Didn't you see it?

234
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,650
It's nice and comfortable.

235
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,050
We're eating already?

236
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,170
No, no, Uncle Wu.

237
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:13,970
Let me tell you.

238
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,690
This is how they treat guests.

239
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,270
Bread with salt.

240
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,860
Okay.

241
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,450
I see. I see. I see.

242
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,860
Lenin once said

243
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,790
there will be bread and milk.

244
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,660
That's what

245
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,410
Vasily said.

246
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:26,940
Va...

247
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,740
Have you seen the movie?

248
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,450
Who is Vasily?

249
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,350
I... I don't know who said so.

250
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,170
But I know

251
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,080
this should be

252
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,260
the best etiquette to entertain guests here.

253
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,570
You have to eat this piece by piece.

254
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,780
Don't touch it.

255
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,250
Don't.

256
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,970
Let me demonstrate to you. I'll show you how to eat it.

257
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,300
Come on.

258
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,930
Come on.

259
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,380
Not like this.

260
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,260
Get a small piece from the top and dip it in salt.

261
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:43,900
You see.

262
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,180
So particular.

263
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,100
I understand.

264
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,210
Come on.

265
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,470
I've prepared the rooms upstairs.

266
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,780
You can pack up,

267
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,620
go upstairs

268
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
and assign the rooms.

269
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,180
I'll prepare wine and dishes for you downstairs.

270
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,920
Let's eat after you're done.

271
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,460
Keep the bread for me.

272
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,260
Go upstairs first.

273
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,370
Keep the bread. Don't worry. We'll prepared everything.

274
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:03,860
Let's go upstairs.

275
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,980
Okay.

276
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,680
The doors are open.

277
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,770
Let's go inside.

278
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,170
Qiu,

279
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,820
I'll live in this one.

280
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,300
OK, you go there.

281
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,820
All right, you can stay inside.

282
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
Qiu and I are old.

283
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,760
We'll guard the door for you.

284
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,540
Yours is larger. I'll take this one.

285
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,960
Yours is larger.

286
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,770
Fu, why are you looking for me?

287
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,720
Mr. Chen, this is not easy.

288
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,480
You asked me to see this?

289
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,100
I'm telling you, this won't work.

290
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,530
Once the big truck passes,

291
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,770
it will be crushed.

292
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,690
There is mostly sand under it.

293
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,970
It's too soft.

294
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,470
I asked you here to solve the problem,

295
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,250
not to tell me the problems.

296
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,570
It's too cold.

297
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,650
We can't use concrete.

298
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,260
Think of a way.

299
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,430
There's only one way. To dig deeper.

300
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,260
Then go ahead.

301
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,500
So...

302
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,360
Hold on.

303
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,750
As for the digging, Mr. Chen.

304
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,630
Listen to me.

305
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,380
I have to find someone to dig.

306
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,180
I need more people and equipment.

307
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,930
The workload will be huge.

308
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,370
So you need to add some budget for me.

309
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,890
Don't fool me, Fu.

310
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,200
No.

311
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,500
We've agreed on the contract.

312
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,480
You must finish it on time.

313
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,020
I have a contract.

314
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,530
Yes, I know.

315
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,090
But I didn't expect

316
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,740
that there was so much sand.

317
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,580
Do it according to the contract!

318
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,750
Chen Yuzhou,

319
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,980
Are you kidding me?

320
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,530
Can't I talk to you nicely?

321
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,870
I won't do this.

322
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,190
Find whoever you want.

323
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,630
Stop! Stop!

324
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,890
Come on, stop! Stop!

325
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,490
Pack up and go home.

326
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,370
What are you doing?

327
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,170
Stop.

328
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,700
What are you doing?

329
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,380
Come on.

330
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,890
What are you doing?

331
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,060
I'll buy you a drink.

332
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,820
It's not like that.

333
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,700
Let me propose a toast.

334
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,130
From the Steel Fair

335
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,990
till now,

336
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,770
thank you for trusting me

337
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,520
and willing to invest together with me.

338
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,140
This time,

339
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,380
we came all the way

340
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,420
from Binhai.

341
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,310
This is our destiny.

342
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,060
It's our fate.

343
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,410
I haven't finished yet.

344
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,250
Uncle Wu,

345
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,780
Nina's father is the director of this steel mill.

346
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,740
She has been spoiled since she was little.

347
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,060
We should also tolerate her.

348
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,370
After all, we need her to do this business,

349
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,880
right?

350
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,590
Uncle Wu,

351
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,100
I apologize to you on her behalf.

352
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,340
It's okay.

353
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,450
Let me apologize to you.

354
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,020
Come on.

355
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,340
I'm hungry.

356
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,770
Does your father know

357
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,570
you will marry a local wife?

358
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,170
You need to teach your wife well.

359
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,050
You have to tell her

360
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,950
the traditional virtues in China

361
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,610
of respecting the elderly and caring the young.

362
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,820
Uncle Wu, you're right.

363
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,570
I'll talk to her later.

364
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,450
Yes, talk to her.

365
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,180
Mr. Wu.

366
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,920
Let's do as the Romans do.

367
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,180
I suggest

368
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,970
that we should have a drink together.

369
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,080
We didn't eat anything good

370
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,580
on our way here.

371
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,060
This meal is not easy to get.

372
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,650
Come on.

373
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,620
Feng is right.

374
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,770
We've been travelling for two weeks

375
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,710
from Beinhai.

376
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,810
I not only lost my temper,

377
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,970
I almost die.

378
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,100
We are friends until death now.

379
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,050
Yes.

380
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,780
Come on.

381
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,130
You must be tired.

382
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,140
-Thank you. -Thank you.

383
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,480
OK.

384
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,470
Yang, let's get down to business.

385
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,970
How's everything going?

386
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,370
Uncle, don't worry.

387
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,430
I've arranged everything.

388
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,650
Tomorrow morning,

389
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,460
I will take the you to the steel mill to see the goods first.

390
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,540
Then we can sign the contract.

391
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,060
I've contacted the shipping company.

392
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,220
It's the largest company here.

393
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,450
After signing the contract,

394
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,770
we can load the boat, deliver the goods,

395
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,730
and send them back to China from Vostochny.

396
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,890
Don't worry.

397
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,790
Okay.

398
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,970
Okay.

399
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,860
We still need to pay in cash here.

400
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,680
Do you have cash with you?

401
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,090
Cash?

402
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,250
Yes, in cash.

403
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,490
Cash?

404
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,110
Excuse me. I'd like to know that

405
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,240
why we need to pay in cash.

406
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,940
If we sign it,

407
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,400
it's a regular business contract.

408
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,890
It should be able to use International Bill of Exchange.

409
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,730
Yes.

410
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,180
Yes.

411
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,020
Why do you need cash?

412
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,450
We only brought International Bill of Exchange.

413
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,580
Here's the thing.

414
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,000
This matter

415
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,120
is a bit complicated to explain.

416
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,630
To be honest,

417
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,450
it's all thanks to Nina.

418
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,130
Nina's father

419
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,740
agreed to

420
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,910
to do this business with me in private.

421
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,090
That's why I can get

422
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,990
such a low price.

423
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,380
Because it can't be carried out from the company's account.

424
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,840
Her father and I have discussed on it several times

425
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,040
to get so much steel.

426
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,030
So after you go back to China,

427
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,810
please keep the secret for me.

428
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,100
How about this, Uncle Wu?

429
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,090
Let's go to the steel mill to check the goods tomorrow.

430
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,740
When we see the goods,

431
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,280
you'll decide whether to sign it or not.

432
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,700
At that time,

433
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,040
if you think it's not suitable,

434
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,270
I won't force you to buy it.

435
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,660
I won't.

436
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,330
Yang, here's the thing.

437
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,650
You should understand our concerns.

438
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,920
It's a big business after all.

439
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:33,800
Right?

440
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,710
We should be careful, right?

441
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,490
But we still trust you.

442
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,130
It's okay, Uncle Wu.

443
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,890
I understand.

444
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,070
This is your first time coming here.

445
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,410
It's OK if you have worries.

446
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,860
But it's okay.

447
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,280
When you come next time,

448
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,850
we'll be familiar with each other.

449
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,500
Yang,

450
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,850
Can I ask for 10,000 tons more?

451
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,170
Is that OK?

452
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,090
Xu, eat well.

453
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,130
Why are you talking about this again?

454
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,060
I'm asking you.

455
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,250
The quota.

456
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,130
has been set in advance.

457
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,650
Am I right, Yang?

458
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,020
Yes, Uncle Wu, you're right.

459
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,020
Thanks to

460
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,980
Nina's father,

461
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,700
I can get this much.

462
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:13,619
Otherwise,

463
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,730
where can I get so much steel?

464
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,010
Right?

465
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,260
Did you hear that?

466
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,300
Have your meal.

467
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,490
If you keep asking this,

468
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,450
you can't even get 5,000 tons.

469
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,640
Let's dig in.

470
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,290
Nina.

471
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,210
What?

472
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,079
Toast to everyone.

473
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,490
It's your turn.

474
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,210
What a drag.

475
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,400
Let go!

476
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,740
Behave yourself.

477
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,010
Don't mess it up.

478
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,970
Poor idiots.

479
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,300
Have a good trip.

480
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,620
Cheers.

481
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,530
What is she saying?

482
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,450
Nina said

483
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,860
you don't need to be restrained.

484
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,650
Just eat and drink as much as you can.

485
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,010
Don't just focus on business.

486
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,610
Yes.

487
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,090
I think Nina is right.

488
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,370
I think

489
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,260
we should toast

490
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,500
to them, right?

491
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,050
Yes. Anyway,

492
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,840
they are getting married.

493
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,950
Let's wish them happiness

494
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,490
and our success this time

495
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,300
with the wine.

496
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,940
Cheers.

497
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,380
Okay.

498
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,770
Cheers! Cheers!

499
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,180
We've arrived.

500
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,090
OK.

501
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,610
Is everything going well?

502
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:21,770
Don't worry.

503
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,170
I'm not worried.

504
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,450
Why not?

505
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,690
I took so much money from you.

506
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,110
Shouldn't you care more about your money?

507
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,420
It's useless to worry.

508
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,730
So I have to trust you.

509
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,020
So you mean

510
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,610
you still don't trust me?

511
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,050
I'll call you later.

512
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:48,860
What are you doing?

513
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,590
I didn't know you had this special hobby.

514
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,490
Lower your voice.

515
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,220
I think there's something wrong between them.

516
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,810
I've been listening here for a long time,

517
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
but nothing happened.

518
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,330
Don't you think

519
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,250
their relationship is a little strange?

520
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,600
Don't look at me like that.

521
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,130
How about we

522
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,980
eavesdrop here together?

523
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,650
Are you crazy? Who wants to do it with you?

524
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,930
Why are you doing this?

525
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,970
What can you hear?

526
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,180
You...

527
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,480
What the hell?

528
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,120
Look.

529
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,770
This way.

530
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,090
Beautiful.

531
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,620
Over there.

532
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,710
Feng Yu, look!

533
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,330
Uncle Wu,

534
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,390
if you have any questions

535
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,140
while we're visiting the steel mill,

536
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,030
just ask me.

537
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,770
They have the ready-made contract.

538
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,650
When we see the goods,

539
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,770
just sign it and everything will be fine.

540
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,270
Okay, I agree with you.

541
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,570
Okay.

542
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,470
Hello.

543
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,240
You can't go in. Go back.

544
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,600
The one in charge of the workshop

545
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,470
have promised us to enter.

546
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,730
We didn't receive any notice.

547
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,100
We've told the person in charge that there would be a car to enter.

548
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,920
You can't go in without permission.

549
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,450
Is everything fine?

550
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,610
It's fine, Uncle.

551
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,010
Everything is fine. Don't worry.

552
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,610
It's nothing.

553
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,010
Please do me a favor.

554
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,970
Just go in for an hour.

555
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,850
I won't cause you any trouble.

556
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,170
Just one hour.

557
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:39,980
Okay.

558
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,970
Thank you.

559
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,880
Go inside.

560
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:45,770
Okay.

561
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,850
It's fine now, no problem.

562
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,570
Don't worry, Uncle.

563
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,610
No matter where you go,

564
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,010
only money works.

565
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,660
Let's look at the steel.

566
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,570
Look!

567
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,650
Steel...

568
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,770
Stop the car! Stop the car!

569
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,050
There are rules here.

570
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,890
It can't stop.

571
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,550
We can only watch it while driving.

572
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,670
What kind of rule is that?

573
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,660
These are all quality steel rolls.

574
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,850
This is not scrap steel.

575
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,250
This is how they are.

576
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,850
It's too messy here.

577
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,810
They mix these

578
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
into this scrap steel to sell.

579
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,330
These steel is in high quality

580
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,210
even in the international market.

581
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,130
We can sell them back as the finished steel.

582
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,150
It will be great.

583
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,210
What are we waiting for, Boss?

584
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,810
Just sign the contract.

585
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,830
It's all money, Boss.

586
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,570
Yang.

587
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,490
Well,

588
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,370
according to the procedure we agreed yesterday,

589
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,000
50,000 tons, okay?

590
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,210
No problem, Uncle.

591
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,730
Just sign the contract

592
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,670
after checking it.

593
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,020
These goods can be shipped out tomorrow.

594
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,690
50,000 tons. Just the right amount.

595
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,770
This is great.

596
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,670
Great.

597
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,090
We've got the fortune this time, Boss. Right, Feng Yu?

598
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,850
We don't need to worry about food and drinks.

599
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,010
Why are we here?

600
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,210
I thought we were going to the mill to sign the contract.

601
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:03,890
It's nice here.

602
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,610
Watch the steps.

603
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,690
Take care.

604
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,130
It's OK.

605
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,530
Here, Dong.

606
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,330
Take a look

607
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,770
and check the date of arrival.

608
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,670
Okay.

609
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,530
No problem, Boss.

610
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,930
The goods can be delivered at this time.

611
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,210
That's good.

612
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,620
Yang,

613
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,290
when will the representatives of the factory

614
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,050
arrive?

615
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,410
Uncle, they don't have to be here.

616
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,880
We can just sign with Nina.

617
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,530
Her father has given her full authority.

618
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,740
No, this should be...

619
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,950
sealed.

620
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,330
They're all here.

621
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,700
Nina, take out the seal.

622
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,720
What a drag.

623
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,770
I have this with me.

624
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,810
Okay.

625
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,380
Aren't you going to take a look at the contract?

626
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,130
No.

627
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,080
Are you still angry?

628
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,000
All right, Xu.

629
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,570
How about this?

630
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,740
I'll give you 6,000 tons.

631
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,260
Don't worry about the deposit, okay?

632
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,330
You don't have to.

633
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,570
I can pay it myself.

634
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,410
Xu,

635
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,680
it's inappropriate for you to be so awkward.

636
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,140
Mr. Wu,

637
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,610
as for this contract,

638
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,540
don't you think you're not cautious enough?

639
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,800
Is there any problem?

640
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,960
Is it appropriate to sign the contract in a cafe shop,

641
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,020
instead of in the  steel mill?

642
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,830
You're too young.

643
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,130
Few contracts can be signed

644
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,430
through the official channel of the steel mill.

645
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,260
They're in a mess here.

646
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,020
Good steel and scrap steel

647
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,650
are all sold together.

648
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,590
Behave well, you hear me?

649
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,820
I'll bring you here too next time.

650
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,750
Uncle, is the contract okay?

651
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,440
Yes.

652
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,570
Let's sign the contract then.

653
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,810
Come on. OK.

654
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,370
Come on.

655
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,130
Done?

656
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,080
Nina.

657
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,130
One more.

658
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,220
Here. One more.

659
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,650
Okay.

660
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,130
Here.

661
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,050
Here.

662
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,650
We'll save one. And you save another.

663
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,930
Yes.

664
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:00,800
Happy cooperation.

665
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,570
Wish us a happy cooperation.

666
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,420
Okay.

667
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,210
Well,

668
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,170
Let's take...

669
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,810
take a photo.

670
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,490
Yes.

671
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,430
As a souvenir.

672
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,170
Okay.

673
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
Come on.

674
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,400
One, two, three.

675
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,370
Cheese.

676
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,970
Okay.

677
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,850
Okay.

678
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,170
Great! Great!

679
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,680
OK.

680
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,740
Uncle Wu, we've signed the contract.

681
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,970
How about the deposit?

682
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,920
We take it with us.

683
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,220
Great.

684
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,570
I've booked a restaurant

685
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,810
across the Red Square.

686
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,170
Let's go there later

687
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,280
to celebrate again.

688
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,130
I'll

689
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,290
pick you up at nine tomorrow morning.

690
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,490
Let's keep an eye on loading and shipping.

691
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,240
Okay.

692
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,250
Thank you.

693
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,440
It's okay. It's my pleasure.

694
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,050
It's my pleasure.

695
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,830
This is great.

696
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,010
We're here.

697
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,670
Uncle Wu.

698
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,210
We're here.

699
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:55,650
Uncle Wu.

700
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,200
It's slippery. Be careful.

701
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,360
Uncle Wu, your key.

702
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,280
Okay.

703
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,290
You don't get off the car?

704
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,400
I won't. It's too late.

705
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,250
Have a good rest.

706
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,490
I'll pick you up at nine tomorrow morning.

707
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,010
Yes.

708
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,130
Bye. Bye.

709
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,240
Take care.

710
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,110
Bye. Bye.

711
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,710
This kid is so enthusiastic.

712
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,530
What are you doing? Open the door.

713
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,610
I can't put it in.

714
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:17,990
Come on.

715
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,220
It's over 30 degrees below zero. Hurry up.

716
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,170
You're so stupid. Why are you offering light?

717
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,090
Light her up.

718
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,610
Come on.

719
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,790
Give some light for her.

720
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,180
An imported lighter.

721
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,040
Don't burn

722
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,790
Xu's hat.

723
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,130
Can you two make it or not?

724
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,330
Can the three of you open the door?

725
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,850
This key can't be plugged in.

726
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,330
Let me do it.

727
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,690
It's too cold.

728
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,360
This is definitely not the right key.

729
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,210
Is is OK?

730
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,980
It's really not the key.

731
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,520
Hurry up. Call that kid.

732
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,290
Did you give the wrong key?

733
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,170
He was too careless.

734
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,650
How could he give the wrong key to us?

735
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,730
This is really the wrong key.

736
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,500
Hurry up.

737
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,820
Why is everything gone inside?

738
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,660
Come and have a look.

739
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,410
What's wrong?

740
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,500
It's empty inside.

741
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,310
What?

742
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,020
What's gone?

743
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,530
What?

744
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,650
Someone must have been in here before.

745
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,570
Why is everything gone?

746
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,480
It's really empty inside.

747
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,760
He powered off his phone.

748
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,120
Mr. Wu, take a look inside.

749
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,100
There's really nothing here.

750
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,050
That's not right.

751
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,990
What's going on?

752
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,860
Don't worry about anything else.

753
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,960
Open the door first.

754
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:13,930
Hurry up.

755
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,500
Harder. Yes.

756
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,560
Use your foot.

757
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,770
Can you do it or not?

758
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,530
Enough.

759
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,690
Don't waste your energy.

760
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,850
Knock the glass open.

761
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,090
I'll smash it then.

762
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:25,850
Watch out.

763
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,270
All right.

764
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,850
There's another layer.

765
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,970
Don't hurt yourself.

766
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,770
Mind your step.

767
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,450
Feng.

768
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,570
Be careful not to hurt your head.

769
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,120
Okay.

770
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,290
Be careful.

771
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,410
It's done.

772
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,850
Hurry up. Get in.

773
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,090
It's so slippery.

774
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:42,770
Watch out.

775
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,400
Turn on the lights.

776
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,170
The lights can't be turned on.

777
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,690
Let me check my luggage.

778
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,360
Mind your step.

779
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,450
Can you turn on the lights on the second floor?

780
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,490
Hello.

781
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,730
Who broke the door?

782
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,690
Come with us.

783
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,210
Sir.

784
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,890
We live here.

785
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,170
Where did you come from?

786
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,010
We were lied by the fraud.

787
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,130
Show me your ID.

788
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,730
We've checked the scrap steel

789
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,210
and gave them the money.

790
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:39,900
Listen.

791
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,240
Something happened downstairs.

792
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,210
Let's go and check.

793
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,280
What happened?

794
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,740
Take them away.

795
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,630
Over there.

796
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,450
Go.

797
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,690
Take them away.

798
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,610
Take them away.

799
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,810
Go!

800
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,800
Based on your introduction,

801
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,720
I think they might be cheated.

802
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,290
When I see them later,

803
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,010
I'll find out more about the situation, okay?

804
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,170
Hello.

805
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:40,850
Hello.

806
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:41,960
Hello.

807
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,400
Hello.

808
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,810
My name is Yang Jinkai.

809
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,090
I'm from the Chinese Embassy.

810
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,650
-I came as soon as I got the call. -Hello. Hello.

811
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,680
The situation is that

812
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,260
one of the neighbors sued you for burglary.

813
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,490
No, no.

814
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,780
We rent that house.

815
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,760
Yes, we opened it with the key.

816
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,410
Our belongings are inside.

817
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,530
Don't worry. Listen to me, okay?

818
00:28:59,570 --> 00:28:59,940
Okay.

819
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm here to help you

820
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,900
solve the problem.

821
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:02,810
Don't say anything now.

822
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,480
I need to figure out a few things.

823
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:05,680
Okay, go ahead.

824
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
Why are you here?

825
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,120
I have a comrade named Yang Jun.

826
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,850
We had a chat at the party.

827
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:12,890
Yes.

828
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,450
He heard that I am doing steel business.

829
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,290
He said his son is here,

830
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,760
and asked if I could do business with him.

831
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,950
His son...

832
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,210
Yang

833
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,030
I still don't know his full name.

834
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,040
So I contacted him.

835
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,530
When he heard that our conditions are very good,

836
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,550
he sent me all the information of steel

837
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,730
with photos to me.

838
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,860
Then we came here.

839
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,180
Here's the thing.

840
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,210
Do you have his number?

841
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,330
Only his phone number, but his phone is off.

842
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,020
After you met him,

843
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,110
do you know any of the locals

844
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,430
who also participated in it?

845
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,150
Several.

846
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,080
He has...

847
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,720
He said she's his fiancee.

848
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,170
Nina.

849
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:44,690
Her name is...

850
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,570
Nina.

851
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,770
Nina. Yes, Nina.

852
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,630
They have

853
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,380
at least 100,000 women named Nina here.

854
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:50,880
Then...

855
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,990
I knew they were swindlers.

856
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,020
On my first day here,

857
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,130
I knew they were swindlers.

858
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,970
-You knew they were swindlers? -What about the situation?

859
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,130
-Why didn't you tell us? -They were cheated.

860
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,410
Didn't you see

861
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,640
when Yang was about to hug Nina,

862
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,160
his hands were pushed away by her.

863
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,730
That's obviously not a normal relationship.

864
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,490
You have high blood pressure. Slow down.

865
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,210
What do you mean?

866
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,170
I didn't bring you here.

867
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,330
Talk to him properly.

868
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,220
-Who did you come with? -Why did I bring you here?

869
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,540
It has nothing to do with me.

870
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,150
Stop arguing, okay?

871
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,810
Can arguing solve the problem?

872
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,990
Speak one by one, okay?

873
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,680
I want to go to the toilet.

874
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,800
Many Chinese do business

875
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,240
in this country.

876
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,600
People are of varying quality.

877
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,850
And the Chinese and local swindlers

878
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,590
are united.

879
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,000
So it's hard to solve the case.

880
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,240
You're doing such a big business.

881
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,860
You should have investigated it in advance.

882
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,360
Yes.

883
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,960
What's your future plan?

884
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,330
I still want to wait for the news.

885
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,450
Can we ask the embassy

886
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,050
to contact him on behalf of us?

887
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,570
I've been here for almost ten years.

888
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,890
Since the reform and opening-up,

889
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,130
many Chinese

890
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,100
started to do business here.

891
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,180
Listen,

892
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,490
don't be reckless

893
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,290
and trust others.

894
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:52,930
You guys

895
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,030
can't even speak the language,

896
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,980
how dare you do business here?

897
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,050
You are over brave!

898
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,960
Guys,

899
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,830
the embassy has booked a hotel for you.

900
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,010
I'll send you there now.

901
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
You guys get in that car, okay?

902
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:02,960
Come.

903
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,770
Excuse me.

904
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,870
-Go ahead. -Listen to me.

905
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,210
Go back early.

906
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,720
In order to solve the case here,

907
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,920
you can only rely on luck.

908
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,580
Get in.

909
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,860
Enough, Boss. Stop calling.

910
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,330
It can't be got through.

911
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,310
[Steel Export and Import Contract]

912
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,380
Then I'll

913
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,380
take this contract

914
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,220
and go to their steal mill.

915
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,190
I'll ask them

916
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,910
if they can give us an explanation.

917
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:25,930
Boss,

918
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,640
I shouldn't say this.

919
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,480
You are too naive.

920
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,190
The police said

921
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,660
this is a group of professional swindlers.

922
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,970
They don't have anything to do with the steel mill.

923
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,520
Besides, even if you have the contract

924
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,270
with the seal on it,

925
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,380
it may not be real.

926
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,300
What do you think?

927
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,300
I told you there's no such good business.

928
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,310
But now, we've lost everything.

929
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,260
Our money is not the windfall.

930
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,380
I don't even dare to answer my wife's call.

931
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,250
Enough, Feng Yu

932
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,200
You've been talking this

933
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,980
all night.

934
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,930
What's the point?

935
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,370
What should I do then?

936
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,590
How would I know?

937
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,140
What do you mean?

938
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,570
Can you stop talking?

939
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,260
What's the most important thing now?

940
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,710
We need to decide whether to leave or stay.

941
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,780
Boss will definitely...

942
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,400
Fine. Boss is right.

943
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,380
But all the money is gone.

944
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,710
The more you move, the hungrier you get.

945
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,320
Can you stay quiet for a while?

946
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,230
I was wondering if I would eat it.

947
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,530
You boil the same kind of noodles every day.

948
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,090
Can you change another one?

949
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,420
You're quite demanding.

950
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,980
If you don't like it...

951
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,460
I will eat it.

952
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:57,870
Is it good?

953
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,300
Boss,

954
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,110
I have something to discuss with you.

955
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,490
Go ahead.

956
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,910
Someone owes a lot of money.

957
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,949
His boss

958
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,429
hired us to kidnap that person.

959
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,670
You know, my uncle was a ranger on the mountain.

960
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,199
He has a hut.

961
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,460
The police can't reach there.

962
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,550
I think that

963
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,620
if we kidnap him and force him to hand over the money,

964
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,190
each of us can get at least several thousands.

965
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,389
Kidnapping?

966
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,190
Just one time.

967
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,850
When your boss comes back,

968
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,940
we'll continue to be kind people.

969
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,000
How can people be bad and good at the same time?

970
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,179
Don't worry.

971
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,239
I've made a plan.

972
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,560
Eelhead and I are responsible for kidnapping.

973
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,290
You and Wei drive the car.

974
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,880
Let's change another car when we get down the mountain.

975
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,820
Plunger, you're quite smart.

976
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,220
Do they know?

977
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,060
Yes.

978
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,470
But Wei is a little hesitant.

979
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,070
His daughter will go to college.

980
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,050
He's afraid of being caught.

981
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,950
The others will all listen to you.

982
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,610
How much do you want to earn

983
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,450
for the Spring Festival?

984
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,340
It's hard to say.

985
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,560
We've been working for so long.

986
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,360
If we don't have a pile of money

987
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,940
on the table,

988
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,190
who will be nice to you?

989
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,660
The kids are also looking forward to the Spring Festival.

990
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,350
If I buy a bunch of toys

991
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,990
and give them when I see them,

992
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,340
they'll call me "father" all over the street.

993
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,210
Your son is also a talent.

994
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,920
So you have discussed on it, haven't you?

995
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,070
We're waiting for your decision.

996
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:46,630
OK.

997
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,770
Guys.

998
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,970
Come here.

999
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,790
Have a seat.

1000
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,660
You too.

1001
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,240
Okay.

1002
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:13,600
My dear friends,

1003
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,420
do me a favor.

1004
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,690
Don't beat me to death. Hit me from the back.

1005
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,250
Chinese New Year is coming.

1006
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,490
I want to relieve your anger.

1007
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,400
You didn't get the money in months.

1008
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,090
I free sorry for you.

1009
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,950
You've been working very hard.

1010
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,540
The New Year is around the corner,

1011
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,480
but you can't even get the money back.

1012
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,910
But you're my friends,

1013
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,980
and she's my boss.

1014
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,130
What can I do?

1015
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,180
Plunger. I know you are angry.

1016
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,950
Hit me. I mean it.

1017
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,300
But for my sake,

1018
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,380
don't leave.

1019
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,890
We can't do this.

1020
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,260
Hit you?

1021
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,010
Does it help?

1022
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,870
I have to get money for the Spring Festival.

1023
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,980
Let's go.

1024
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,110
Are you crazy?

1025
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,150
It's impossible to hide a dead child in the snow.

1026
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,420
You'll be sent in the jail

1027
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,900
soon if you do this, you know?

1028
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,330
Trust me, everyone. Trust my boss.

1029
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,140
Although we didn't get money during these months,

1030
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,380
when she comes back,

1031
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,050
everything will be settled.

1032
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,520
Don't go. Please.

1033
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,600
The festival is coming.

1034
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,970
Everyone is waiting for money to use.

1035
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,350
It's not easy for everyone.

1036
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,170
But why did we set up this team?

1037
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,290
Why do we work so hard?

1038
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,920
We're like muddy monkeys every day.

1039
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,820
We just don't want to go back to jail, right?

1040
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,860
Boss.

1041
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,370
I was wrong.

1042
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:38,900
I'm not going.

1043
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,790
I've promised my boss

1044
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,440
to be a good person in my whole life.

1045
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,900
Since I've said it,

1046
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,110
one minute

1047
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,880
or one second less

1048
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,840
is not acceptable.

1049
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,080
The luggage

1050
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,270
is from the landlord.

1051
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,400
Let me tell you.

1052
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,620
The Yang you've been looking for

1053
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,810
is a professional swindler.

1054
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,000
The police has already filed a report.

1055
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,280
And they've been tracking him down.

1056
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,550
Our embassy

1057
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,280
also got in touch with the steel mill.

1058
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
They only receive visitors,

1059
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,820
not for business.

1060
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,290
This is the situation now.

1061
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,120
If you have any questions,

1062
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,390
you can contact our embassy anytime.

1063
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:30,790
Okay.

1064
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,930
Excuse me, I'd like to know

1065
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,120
if we can get the money back.

1066
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,050
As long as we catch him,

1067
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,360
it's likely to get the money back.

1068
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,790
But no one knows how long it will take.

1069
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,390
It's hard to tell, right?

1070
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,340
If you're willing to wait,

1071
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,900
you can wait here.

1072
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,030
If you decide to come back to China,

1073
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,810
you can come to me.

1074
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,200
I can ask someone to buy you tickets.

1075
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,040
Thank you.

1076
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,980
I'm leaving.

1077
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,920
Be careful.

1078
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,010
Okay, thank you.

1079
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:54,460
Thank you.

1080
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,870
Okay, bye.

1081
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,220
Thank you.

1082
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,300
Thank you.

1083
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,520
Take care.

1084
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,700
Excuse me. I'd like to express my idea.

1085
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,170
Under this circumstance,

1086
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,550
I should take the responsibilities

1087
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,910
as your older brother.

1088
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,250
I brought you here before I've figured everything out.

1089
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,880
My bad.

1090
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,770
The money you have lost

1091
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,080
and been cheated

1092
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,030
will be on me.

1093
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,200
It's all on me.

1094
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,110
Consider it as an apologize

1095
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,110
to all of you.

1096
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,160
Don't be like this.

1097
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,100
We did lose a lot this time.

1098
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,870
But you have the biggest loss.

1099
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,890
It's not appropriate to let you take the responsibility alone.

1100
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,150
We can take this business trip

1101
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,030
as a special trip.

1102
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:08,910
Right?

1103
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,410
We've seen the Lenin's statue,

1104
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,440
eaten local food,

1105
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,170
and been to the Red Square.

1106
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,900
It's not bad.

1107
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,440
We can brag about it for half a year.

1108
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,960
Feng, what do you think?

1109
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,010
Yes.

1110
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,610
-Yes. -Yes.

1111
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,040
It's not your fault.

1112
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,440
We came with you willingly.

1113
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,240
If someone must be blamed for,

1114
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,330
just think

1115
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,870
there is no such thing as a free lunch.

1116
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,440
Yes.

1117
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,690
We've been friends for years.

1118
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,710
What's the point of saying this?

1119
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,910
Let's think about

1120
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,120
what to do next.

1121
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,890
I think the most important thing now

1122
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,960
is to stop the loss immediately.

1123
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,110
So we should be more practical.

1124
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,600
Compared with wasting time here, we should go back early.

1125
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,680
If you have no objections,

1126
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,890
I'll contact the embassy

1127
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,090
to book tickets for us.

1128
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,150
Xu, what do you mean?

1129
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,650
You guys leave. I'm not leaving.

1130
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,090
What?

1131
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,380
What are you gonna do?

1132
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,800
I can't leave. I have to get the money back.

1133
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,880
Don't worry. I...

1134
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,100
Didn't I tell you just now?

1135
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,000
I'll pay for your loss.

1136
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,610
Besides, you didn't lose that much.

1137
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,750
It's not safe for you

1138
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,540
to stay here alone. Be good.

1139
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,750
I've lost a lot.

1140
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:31,530
Well...

1141
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:32,950
I don't believe

1142
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,190
this is the only steel mill here.

1143
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,620
-Xu. -I have to try.

1144
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,820
Why?

1145
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,070
Miss Xu, that's how it is already.

1146
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,750
-Don’t always rebel against us. -Be good.
