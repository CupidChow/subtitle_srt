4
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,660
I just want to get some fresh air

5
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,160
after staying in hospital for the past few days.

6
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,780
No wonder Chen always wanted to go out

7
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,810
when he was hospitalised.

8
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,400
You've only been here for a few days.

9
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,430
It's hard enough.

10
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,210
Just sit tight.

When you are discharged,

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,490
there's a lot of work for you to do.

13
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,950
How long are you going to stay?

14
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,950
I'll be back before the day after tomorrow.

15
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,079
If Su hadn't called you,

16
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,800
you would have forgotten me.

17
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,170
The year-end is fast approaching.

18
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,350
There's a lot of work at the company

19

for me to deal with.

20
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,420
I need to finish them as soon as possible.

21
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,050
I'll try to spend a few more days with you

A few more days?

24
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,950
Five days or a week?

25
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,200
Have you ever thought about

26
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,230
quitting your job in Shanghai

27
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,940
and going back to Binhai?

28
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,810
Spend more time with me.

29
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,860
We didn't meet very often.

30
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,650
I've thought about it,

31
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,660
but I'm just used to

32
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,149
working at a foreign company.

33
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,019
We talked about this before.

34
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,020
Although it has just started in Shanghai,

35
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,640
I think it's going well.

36
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,680
It's busy, but there are also opportunities.

37
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,220
So I want to continue working in Shanghai.

38
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,440
Got it.

39
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,030

Hello?

41
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,550
Yes, I know that order.

42
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,480
Yes.

43
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,660
But the price of spiral ribbed steel bar and small structural steel

44
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,620
dropped four percent.

45
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,300
Yes.

46
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,960
We can't use the price we previously agreed on.

47
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,180
It's because of the international route and the arrival time at the port,

48
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,700
right?

49
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,410
It's 20 days late.

50
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,510
Then we can't use the price we previously agreed on.

51
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,230
So you go negotiate with them.

52
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,760
I can tell you our bottom line.

53

58

We quarrelled so many times before,

59
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,140
but I never thought

60
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,610
we would really break up.

It seems different this time.

But I still want to tell you

I really love you.

65

when we talked about it that day.

68

I wasn't saying that to make you feel better.

69

I admit

70
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,290
I'm selfish

I know you're always worried about me.

73

You think we're getting farther and farther apart.

The difference between us is getting bigger and bigger.

There are several companies doing the appraisal.

136

I'll see who offers a higher price.

137
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,710
I'll give you all the money from the sale then.

00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,220
It has nothing to do with me.

173
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,200
Why not?

174
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,800
Don't try to avoid it.

175
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,380
Listen.

176
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,340
Just tell me.

177
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,460
Will you persuade him when he comes?

178
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,380
-Fine. -Are you going to persuade him or not?

179
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,300
Okay, no hurry.

180
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,060
Don't worry, okay?

181
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,210
Your blood pressure will come up.

182
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,580
I'll figure it out.

183
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,690
When he comes, I...

184
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,940
Sorry.

185
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,620
I was so busy that I came late.

186
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,340
Come over. Have a seat.

187
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,450
Take a seat.

188
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,800
The three of us

189
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,660
have been busy this year.

190
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,260
We even didn't have time

191
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
to have a meal together.

192
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,270
-Have a seat. -Have a seat.

193
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,910
Come on. Take this as my apology.

194
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,180
Good for you.

195
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,120
Come on.

196
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,980
Bottoms up.

197
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,330
Boss.

198
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,710
Make yourself comfortable.

199
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,260
Good boy.

200
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,540
I'm starving.

201
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,720
Let's dig in.

202
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,020
Come on.

203
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,590
After you.

204
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,930
Mr. Wu.

205
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,040
Before you came,

206
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,450
Qiu told me

207
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,850
to tell you something.

208
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,400
Well,

209
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,390
you know I'm using dung

210
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,570
in my garden.

211
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,760
It's organic.

212
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,670
We don't use fertiliser anymore.

213
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,320
We were all farmers.

214
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,040
Do you understand

215
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,720
what I mean?

216
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,460
What's the first thing you do

217
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,620
in the morning?

218
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,630
Open the curtains and look at the garden.

219
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,290
Go to the toilet.

220
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,970
Look.

221
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,500
All you think about is your own business.

222
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,820
Every morning when I open my eyes,

223
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,160
I wonder how much money I owe.

224
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,370
Thousands of people are counting on me.

225
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,090
How much is the expense?

226
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,680
How much is the fine this year

227
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,140
because of the environmental issue?

228
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,220
I have to give you an explanation anyway.

229
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,110
We are in debt now.

230
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,150
We should be united.

231
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,430
Xu Banxia's factory

232
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,300
will be established in a few years.

233
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,950
That's when ours will be closed down.

234
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,450
It's hard now,

235
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,900
but we have to find a way

236
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,570
to get the capital back.

237
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,880
Can the factory shut down now?

238
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,530
Right. Look.

239
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,190
What did I say?

240
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,160
Boss has made up his mind.

241
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,700
We can't close down the factory.

242
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,380
Did I say closing down the factory?

243
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,580
Enough, Qiu.

244
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,520
I know what you're thinking.

245
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,340
It's all your idea.

246
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,480
Anyway, it's hard for you to understand as an outsider.

247
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,580
Now I'm the one who's in charge of this factory,

248
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,760
but it doesn't belong to me alone.

249
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,810
It belongs to all of us.

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
If it's mine,

251
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,780
I don't care if it shuts down or not.

252
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,130
At this point,

253
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,660
it's okay if you don't help,

254
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,860
but you can't cause trouble.

255
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,090
Boss,

256
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,650
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

257
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,000
I want to help you,

258
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,890
but it is illegal.

259
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,230
Qiu,

260
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,270
let's put this aside for now.

261
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,980
Although I said it's hard now,

262
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,340
have you calculated

263
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,480
how much the loss will be if the factory shuts down?

264
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,630
I'm really scared.

265
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,050
The investigation team will be here soon.

266
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,550
Once they come to our factory,

267
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,220
they'll definitely find out something wrong with our factory.

268
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,190
Besides, President Gao told me in person

269
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,720
that the higher-ups will take it seriously this time.

270
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,310
May I suggest something?

271
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,200
Our factory does have a pollution problem.

272
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,900
Let's buy the pollution control equipment.

273
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,630
Let's just do it.

274
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,060
Ignore the profit of the year.

275
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,140
Easy for you to say.

276
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,360
If we lose the annual profit

277
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,240
and Xu Banxia

278
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,620
builds her factory

279
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,060
within a year,

280
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,270
we'll be doomed then.

281
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,330
That's better than going to jail.

282
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,330
Enough, stop talking.

283
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,280
I understand.

284
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,230
How about this?

285
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,150
Since we are all here,

286
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,500
let's raise our hands to vote.

287
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,160
Raise your hand if you agree to suspend production and change the equipment.

288
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,560
Feng Yu.

289
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,640
Feng.

290
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,350
Feng Yu.

291
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,630
Stop hesitating.

292
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,230
Am I wrong?

293
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,790
What we are arguing now

294
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,220
is not about who's right or wrong.

295
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,550
We've been working for Mr. Wu since the beginning.

296
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,800
It's been so many years.

297
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,540
At this time,

298
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,349
shouldn't we trust him?

299
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,089
We have to trust him.

300
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,380
As for the problem you mentioned,

301
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,589
we can discuss it in private.

302
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,060
Don’t make trouble for boss now.

303
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:27,579
Who did?

304
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,790
What are you talking about?

305
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,540
We do business not for money

306
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,740
but for harmony.

307
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,580
Don't make it hard for everyone.

308
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,860
-Don't' make it look bad, okay? -Feng Yu.

309
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,280
I finally know you completely today.

310
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,790
You're a jerk.

311
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,740
Qiu, listen to me.

312
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,020
-Let him go. -Don't stop me. Don't.

313
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,660
Qiu.

314
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,440
Ignore him.

315
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,790
No, Boss...

316
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,310
He's always like this.

317
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,760
He always retreats if something happens.

318
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,100
Ignore him. Let's drink.

319
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,650
Cheers.

320
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,020
Your meeting will end in one hour.

321
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,440
You know that, right?

322
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:40,920
Yes.

323
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,230
This way.

324
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,770
No. 315.

325
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,440
Yes.

326
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
No. 315, sit down.

327
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,570
Yes.

328
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,500
Why are you here?

329
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,470
How's the business?

330
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,980
You're the owner of the steel factory now.

331
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,530
How's everything in there?

332
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,390
Dong.

333
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,990
I'm here today

334
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,860
to tell you something.

335
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,290
I'm sorry.

336
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,850
Sometimes when I think back,

337
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,470
I think our previous small factory was good.

338
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,520
We didn't worry about food or clothes.

339
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,190
People are too greedy.

340
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,430
Now the factory is big.

341
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,970
There are more things to do.

342
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm really tired.

343
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,890
Let me tell you something sincerely today.

344
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,210
I might come in a few days to keep you company.

345
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,220
Plunger, what’s wrong?

346
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,130
Wildcat.

347
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,540
Is the company going to be sold?

348
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,170
What happened?

349
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
What's going on?

350
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,820
Apart from bringing us food,

351
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,710
Boss only asks someone to assess the company.

352
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,890
What should we do if the company is sold?

353
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,820
I told Wu Jianshe.

354
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,630
He's so stubborn. I can't persuade him.

355
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,320
Withdraw.

356
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,470
Withdraw immediately.

357
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,690
How?

358
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,280
I've invested money in it.

359
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,100
You want me to come out empty-handed?

360
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,230
You have to withdraw no matter what.

361
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,820
According to

362
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Chapter 6

363
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,360
of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution,

364
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,070
you'll not only be fined,

365
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,050
but also be legally responsible for what you did.

366
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,130
You're playing with fire.

367
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,820
Marx said

368
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,510
commercial civilisation of the capitalism

369
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,800
makes people

370
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,420
bound each other with only interests.

371
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,050
There's no other connection.

372
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,860
If you give him ten times of the profit,

373
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,500
he'll do anything.

374
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,280
If you give him a hundred times of the profit,

375
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,870
he'll even kill people.

376
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,850
If he wants to kill someone,

377
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,190
are you going to do that too?

378
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,510
Don't mention Marx to me.

379
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,870
I don't understand what you're talking about.

380
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,970
Wu Jianshe hasn't killed anyone.

381
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,740
You're killing people.

382
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,020
Dong.

383
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,330
Tell me.

384
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,980
Is there any other way

385
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,500
other than withdrawing shares and falling out with him?

386
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,680
Qiu,

387
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,860
what I just told you

388
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,550
is the only thing

389
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,340
that I think you should do now.

390
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,880
Then what should I do with the money withdrawn?

391
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,390
Going back to gardening like Feng Yu?

392
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,390
If you can take out the money,

393
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,790
invest it to Xu Banxia.

394
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,270
Only her steel factory is the future.

395
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,360
Well...

396
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,890
Let alone whether Xu Banxia will accept me or not,

397
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,620
Wu Jianshe can kill me for that.

398
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,810
Think about your relationship.

399
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,840
How long is it before you fall out with him?

400
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,980
It's a matter of who taking the first move.

401
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,500
If this goes on, Qiu,

402
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,860
you'll wear the same clothes

403
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,330
as me.

404
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,000
There's no other way.

405
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,580
Qiu,

406
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
you've already thought it through.

407
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,210
Wildcat.

408
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,770
Wildcat.

409
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:31,970
Get out.

410
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,420
What are you doing?

411
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,490
Who is she?

412
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,730
We haven't finished yet.

413
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,710
I'm the boss here.

414
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,930
I'm not selling it. Get out.

415
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,190
Go.

416
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,490
Go.

417
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,820
Go!

418
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,270
Where is Tong Xiaoqi?

419
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,030
I can't find him.

420
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,320
He doesn't care. You don't care.

421
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,380
If the company is sold,

422
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,590
there will only be us left here.

423
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,350
Exactly.

424
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,220
Did you call him?

425
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,400
Yes, he didn’t answer.

426
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,750
Right, Wildcat, come here.

427
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,170
And here.

428
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,240
Come.

429
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,440
Someone sends us food on time everyday.

430
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,880
We've been eating the same food

431
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,000
for a week.

432
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,240
The point is it's not tasty.

433
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,370
Did you look for him?

434
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,750
We did. We couldn't find him.

435
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:17,720
Plunger.

436
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,440
We found him.

437
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,810
-You found him? -Let’s go.

438
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,100
Who are you?

439
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,660
We're looking for someone.

440
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,690
Looking for someone?

441
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,700
Do you have any ID?

442
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,560
What ID?

443
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,340
Sorry, sir.

444
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,330
What ID do you need?

445
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,810
Student ID. Who are you looking for?

446
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,760
Tong Xiaoqi.

447
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,750
Tong Xiaoqi.

448
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,990
Tong Xiaoqi.

449
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,190
Tong Xiaoqi, what's wrong with you?

450
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,630
Why are you learning cooking here?

451
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,130
Why are you selling the company?

452
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,290
Why are you here?

453
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
I've asked around.

454
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,810
Sichuan cuisine is the most popular food in the Chinatown of the US.

455
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,450
♫Your gentle sweetness♫

456
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,020
♫Is like a bird flying in the sky♫

457
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm telling you.

458
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,710
Sichuan cuisine is the hardest to cook.

459
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,730
♫It's only because♫

460
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,220
If you add less pepper, it won't taste good.

461
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,440
♫We love and hug each other♫

462
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,930
It'll be too bitter if you add too much.

463
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,540
♫Your eyes♫

464
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,830
And this bean paste, salt...

465
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,620
♫My tears♫

466
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,910
If you add too much, it'll be too salty.

467
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,390
♫It's precious even if it's painful♫

468
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,890
So you have to control the heat.

469
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,910
♫It's only because♫

470
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,840
Do you know which two dishes are the most popular ones abroad?

471
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:06,010
♫You're by my side♫

472
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,970
Mao Xue Wang and Kung Pao Chicken.

473
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,010
I need to learn how to cook these two dishes.

474
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,710
♫I said I only have you in my eyes♫

475
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,710
Otherwise, how can I make money when I go abroad?

476
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,250
♫You're the only one I can't forget♫

477
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,630
♫Spend every night♫

♫Never be apart♫

486
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,790
What's this smell? It stinks.

487
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,310
Someone must have discharge pollutants underground.

488
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,470
This is so immoral.

489
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,490
It will pollute the environment.

490
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,320
Isn't that a sin?

491
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,880
Right.

492
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,740
How can the villages nearby use water

493
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,160
since it's discharged underground.

494
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,930
It'll kill one's life if someone drinks it.

495
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,950
-Yeah. -Of course.

496
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,820
It won't recover soon.

497
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,090
Right.

498
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,830
I guess the whole area is polluted.

499
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,660
Of course.

500
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,620
How can we live? Can we use this water?

501
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,980
The pollution is too serious.

502
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,620
Look at this.

503
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,700
Move aside.

504
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,740
Miss Xu is here.

505
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,230
Look.

506
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,790
What's wrong?

507
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,630
Not only this one.

508
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,260
There have been many places with polluted water

509
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,890
in our construction site.

510
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,320
We built the well ourselves.

511
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,770
Now the water in the well is polluted.

512
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,700
That means the underground water is contaminated.

513
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,870
Miss Xu.

514
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,180
Many of our people

515
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,440
have been sent to the hospital

516
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,240
only because they drunk the polluted water.

517
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,500
I'll report it to the regulator

518
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,110
to deal with the pollution as soon as possible.

519
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,420
As for your daily use,

520
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,340
I will ask the truck team

521
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,070
to bring us food and water.

522
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,600
We'll ensure your safety.

523
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,790
Please rest assured.

524
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,740
You know

525
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,750
how big our project is.

526
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,290
We can't stop for a day.

527
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,290
Please go back to your work.

528
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,750
Let's go back to work.

529
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,420
Okay.

530
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,500
Go back to work.

531
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,340
Go.

532
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,080
Be careful.

533
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,660
Did you hear what Miss Xu said?

534
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,630
Okay, don't worry.

535
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,410
Go back to work.

536
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,400
Let's go.

537
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:29,940
Let's go.

538
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,870
Let's go.

539
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,000
Mom.

540
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,850
Time to eat.

541
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,690
Yes.

542
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,800
As we discussed in the meeting,

543
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,490
all numbers

544
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,670
need to be precise at the unit of integer.

545
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,190
Okay, thank you.

546
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,000
Okay.

547
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,840
Let's dig in.

548
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,810
Mom, look.

549
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,510
I cooked all of them.

550
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,410
Come on. Cheers.

551
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,150
How much money do you want this time?

552
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,520
I'm getting married

553
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,400
on December 31,

554
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,520
Tong Xiaoqi and I will hold a century wedding.

555
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,180
When did you

556
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,310
just say?

557
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,150
December 31.

558
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:44,900
We still have time.

559
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,640
Xu Banxia, Su and Jia Chang'an

560
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,670
are helping me prepare it.

561
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,400
We've already chosen a place.

562
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,010
You don't have to worry about anything

563
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,370
or spend any money.

564
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,860
As long as you're there.

565
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,340
Are you telling me

566
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,830
my daughter is getting married?

567
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,770
Don't you think

568
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,780
you should discuss it with me first?

569
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,880
Now the whole world knows,

570
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,480
but I'm the last one to be informed.

571
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,450
Do you still take me as your mother?

572
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,300
You're going abroad next year.

573
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,010
Are you kidding me?

574
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,890
At least three years or up to five years later,

575
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,690
you two will break up.

576
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,190
It's not two places within a country,

577
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,270
but two countries.

578
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:25,970
How can you communicate?

579
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,520
Aren't you too impulsive?

580
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,790
He'll go with me.

581
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:30,960
Mom.

582
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,220
Tong is learning cooking.

583
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,740
He said he would open a restaurant in the US,

584
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,230
so he can stay with me.

585
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,330
I'll marry no one but Tong Xiaoqi.

586
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,270
In our city,

587
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,810
we don't have any heavy industry except steel.

588
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,650
So this sewage

589
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,350
could only be from Wu Jianshe's factory.

590
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,220
Judging from the current situation,

591
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,900
it won't take long

592
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,040
before they're found discharging sewage.

593
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,460
They're playing with fire.

594
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,720
Miss Xu.

595
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,830
Miss Xu.

596
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,970
I've been looking for you.

597
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,230
I knew you would be here.

598
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,970
You guys continue.

599
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,900
I'll go to the construction site.

600
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,470
Okay.

601
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,150
What's wrong, Mr. Qiu?

602
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,870
Did you come here tracing the smell of the sewage?

603
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,410
You knew about that?

604
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,840
I understand.

605
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,540
You use marriage to appease Tong Xiaoqi.

606
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,870
What about Tong Xiaoqi?

607
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,090
He learns cooking for you,

608
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,940
and takes care of your life in the US, right?

609
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,990
He's loyal, isn't he?

610
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,680
Marriage is not about one or two days.

611
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,360
What's going to happen three or five years later?

612
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,060
You're going to study.

613
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,320
Your world will get bigger and bigger.

614
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,690
How can you communicate with each other?

615
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,460
Then you two

616
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,460
will have less and less in common, you know?

617
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,410
Mom, it's impossible.

618
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,250
How is that impossible?

619
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,370
You know nothing.

620
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,790
You study international trade.

621
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,240
You'll have a broader view.

622
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,150
But he's in a kitchen

623
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,020
dealing with cookers.

624
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,250
Can you communicate with each other?

625
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,040
What are you talking about?

626
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,130
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

627
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,220
Fried potatoes.

628
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,520
-Fried ribbon fish. What else? -Mom.

629
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,070
Mom, stop it.

630
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,540
I...

631
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,730
How can we only talk about these dishes?

632
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,850
We have a lot to talk about.

633
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,540
And we will make progress together

634
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,940
and manage our lives together.

635
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,180
We'll get better and better.

636
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,220
You don't understand

637
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,300
the world of our young people.

638
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,290
I came from your age, okay?

639
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,139
Mom.

640
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,500
Why didn't you get married again

641
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,020
after dad was gone?

642
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,270
There were many people who liked you back then.

643
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,130
What are you talking about?

644
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,310
I just want to say

645
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,870
because you told me

646
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,310
you chose my dad.

647
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,560
You would never regret it.

648
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,949
So do I.

649
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,230
I'll never regret it.

650
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,960
You're asking for it.

651
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,500
I tried to persuade him.

652
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
But he didn't listen.

653
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,490
You know

654
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,430
Wu Jianshe's temper.

655
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,210
But you can't do this.

656
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,890
I know the equipment in our factory

657
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,990
is out of date.

658
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,140
Your factory will be established in three to five years at most.

659
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,280
Our factory is destined to be obsolete.

660
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,120
Wu and I are old.

661
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,190
We just want to make as much as we can

662
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,290
before your starts your factory.

663
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,510
Is this how you make money these years?

664
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,820
If this keeps going,

665
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,890
you and Mr. Wu

666
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,040
will go to jail soon.

667
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,210
So I'm here to see you.

668
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,150
What for?

669
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,160
Here's what I think.

670
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,650
I want to withdraw my money

671
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,680
from Wu Jianshe's factory

672
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,240
and the decoiling plant,

673
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,470
so he will be short of capital.

674
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,520
Once he's short of money, the production needs to stop.

675
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,580
Once the production stops,

676
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,710
the pollution problem will be solved.

677
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:10,910
Mr. Qiu,

678
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,120
you're ruining Mr. Wu.

679
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,900
It's not fair.

680
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,700
There's no fairness in business.

681
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,660
It's all about money.

682
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,070
Besides, if I do this,

683
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,030
he'll lose a factory at most.

684
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,220
What if I don't do this?

685
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,240
Like you said, he'll be in jail.

686
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,770
Besides,

687
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,740
I can't let my money go in vain.

688
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,440
It needs to be spent on something worthwile.

689
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,590
I have to use it to make more money.

690
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,100
Tell me how you want to make money.

691
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,940
Here's what I think.

692
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,980
I want to invest all my money in your factory,

693
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,680
plus a decoiling plant,

694
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,080
so you don't need to build another one.

695
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:52,930
What do you think?

696
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,490
Mr. Qiu, you're trying to get yourself out of it.

697
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,230
You've even thought of a way out for yourself.

698
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,710
As a businessman,

699
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,520
we can negotiate everything.

700
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:16,940
Mr. Qiu.

701
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,640
Jia Chang'an has made a clear plan

702
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
about the new factory and the production line.

703
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,870
♫Your gentle sweetness♫

704
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,680
My hands are tied.

705

what you think every morning.

712
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,730

How much do you need to borrow?

720

♫I said I only have you in my eyes♫

♫Never be apart♫

736
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,960
How much can you invest?

737
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,340
At least 20 million

738
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,940
and all the manufacturing equipment at the decoiling plant.

739
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,840
My equipment is new.

740
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,800
It won't be obsolete in ten years.

741
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,810
If you don't believe me,

742
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,260
you could ask Jia Chang'an to check the equipment now.

743
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,210
You have to pay in a month.

744
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,070
One month is too tight.

745
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,300
I need to see the money in one month.

746
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,890
After a month,

747
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,140
what I promised you doesn't count.

748
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,440
Think it over.

749
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,620
Okay, one month.

750
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,650
[Jian She Steel Mill, Jiangdong Province]

751
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,250
Two deposits just came in.

752
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,840
How come there's no money in the account?

753
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,840
Six million in total.

754
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,120
Why was it transferred to Hongfa Decoiling Plant?

755
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,530
What's going on?

756
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,840
Mr. Qiu said he had told you.

757
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,960
The decoiling plant needs to buy new equipment.

758
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,510
He was in a hurry.

759
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,390
I thought you knew it.

760
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,070
Bullshit.

761
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,550
Six million.

762
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,530
You have three days.

763
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,320
Why didn't you report it?

764
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,040
Manager Liu, please go out.

765
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,280
I need to talk to boss.

766
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,440
Don't go. Let's talk here.

767
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,230
Boss.

768
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,630
We haven't talked

769
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,110
since the factory opened.

770
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,280
I'm free today.

771
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,360
Let's talk.

772
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,510
Manager Liu.

773
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,160
Get out.

774
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,530
How many years

775
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,850
have we been working together?

776
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,150
How much money have you hacked me all these years?

777
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,820
If I remember correctly,

778
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,340
we became wealthy

779
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:45,980
after we came back from the North.

780
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,520
Xu Banxia

781
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,370
is really something.

782
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,470
It was her who expanded the business channels,

783
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,100
so that we earned money

784
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,280
and you afforded to buy the State No.2 Steel.

785
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,170
Tell me the truth.

786
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,480
What are you going to do with that six million?

787
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,620
Sometimes I think

788
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,560
if we didn't fight Xu Banxia...

789
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,670
Let's forget about the past. Talk about the present.

790
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,420
Return the six million.

791
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,410
After we sell these goods,

792
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,030
we can discuss about your problem.

793
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,040
And then?

794
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,160
Dig a hole.

795
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,300
Fill the hole.

796
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,120
Qiu Bizheng,

797
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,150
if you don't return the six million,

798
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,250
we have to suspend production.

799
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,740
Both of us will be doomed.

800
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,690
It's useless.

801
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,440
How many years can you hold on? Three years at most.

802
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,060
When Xu Banxia's factory is established,

803
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,690
what should we do next?

804
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,020
Qiu Bizheng,

805
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,250
you've been working with me for so many years.

806
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,870
Have I ever forgot about you when there were good things?

807
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,770
You're sticking to me like a dog.

808
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,970
It's the same now.

809
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,990
We live together.

810
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,070
We die together.

811
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,340
That's you. I don't want to die.

812
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,910
I just need you

813
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,510
to return my factory and shares.

814
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,380
20 million. I'll leave immediately.

815
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,430
Qiu,

816
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,840
I've never been so sad.

817
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,210
Cut me some slack.

818
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,230
When the goods are sold,

819
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,550
I promise I will solve your problem first.

820
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,730
Boss.

821
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:36,990
All these years,

822
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,180
I've been treating you as my real brother.

823
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,990
I support you no matter what you do.

824
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,560
But now you insist on polluting the land.

825
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,800
You're poking the beehive.

826
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,080
You're playing with fire.

827
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,330
You have a large ego and you can't quit.

828
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,750
I'm different.

829
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,420
I have a big family to provide for.

830
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,560
Bro.

831
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,490
Please let me go.

832
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,880
Qiu Bizheng, let me tell you.

833
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,210
Not only can't you quit,

834
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,300
but you won't get a penny from here.
