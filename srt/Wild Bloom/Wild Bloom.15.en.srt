4
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,050
Don't tell Fatty about this.

5
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,250
I don't want her to control me.

6
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,220
She doesn't allow me to do anything.

7
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,770
I'm in a relationship.

8
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,860
I have to see Zhou Qian every day.

9
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,580
I don't know if you're like me

10
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,220
when you're in a relationship.

11
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,740
Anyway,

12
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,740
I want to see her every day.

13
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,820
Although I see her every day,

14
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,500
the more I see her, the more I want to see her.

15
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,740
You're deeply in love.

16
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,820
Let's go. I'll treat you to dinner.

17
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,780
Tell me more

18
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,060
about love.

19
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,820
You need to go to the hospital first.

20
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,340
I'll tell you after that, okay?

21
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,940
No. Let's eat first.

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,460
Let me introduce him.

23
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,060
This is Su Guoliang.

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,200
He's a new colleague of our company.

25
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,460
Let's welcome him.

26
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,640
Thank you.

27
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,030
Just call me Su.

28
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,940
I majored in computer science.

29
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,180
If you have any problems with computers,

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,900
you can come to me directly.

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,420
Okay.

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,790
Su, come here.

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,180
Okay.

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,420
Chen.

35
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:41,980
Where's Chen?

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,620
He went to the toilet.

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,180
Su.

38
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,540
Let me introduce her.

39
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,300
She is Gao Xinyi.

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,620
She's in charge of the finance of our company.

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,780
If you need any help or reimbursement

42
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,150
in the future,

43
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,860
you can come to her.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,329
Got it.

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,060
Hello, Miss Gao.

46
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,370
Call me sister.

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,620
Sister Xinyi.

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,700
I just graduated. I don't know much.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,060
Please teach me more when you have time.

50
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,540
You're quite sweet.

51
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,020
Sister, what's his position?

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,260
Su.

53
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,980
Our company works in the steel trade.

54
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,980
You majored in computer science.

55
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,290
What can you do in the company?

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,300
Tell me what you think.

57
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,780
I can lead you

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,560
to the international Internet.

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,380
On the international Internet,

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,220
we can see

61
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,740
information about steel trade all over the world.

62
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,300
I'll create a website

63
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,340
for our company

64
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,340
and promote our company on the website.

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,180
In this way,

66
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,420
the whole world will know

67
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,680
our Banxia Steel International Trading Co., Ltd.

68
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,900
Miss Xu, I know

69
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,250
when you first imported steel abroad,

70
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,220
it took you half a month on your way.

71
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,510
With this website,

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,260
we can save our time, energy

73
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,660
and money.

74
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,980
Really?

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,700
Yes.

76
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,660
What do you need?

77
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,500
I need everyone in the company

78
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,540
to be equipped with a computer.

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,620
And I'm going to create

80
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,660
a trading information exchange website.

81
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,780
So I need some R&D funds.

82
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,820
How much do you need?

83
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,740
100 thousand yuan.

84
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,190
You just began to work. Why do you ask for money?

85
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,900
50 thousand yuan is fine.

86
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,220
What's wrong with you?

87
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,220
Brother, research and development need money.

88
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,060
Research and development?

89
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,860
Can you be down-to-earth

90
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,540
and focus on you work?

91
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,780
Banxia, don't listen to him.

92
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,300
Miss Xu.

93
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,220
Come out!

94
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,820
Su.

95
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,940
Give him 500 thousand yuan

96
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,570
as start-up capital.

97
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,750
I'll set up a separate department for you.

98
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,620
I hope you can do well

99
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,290
on the Internet

100
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,860
and show me the influence

101
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,450
you have on the company.

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,210
Bao'er

103
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,820
Don't tire yourself out.

104
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,330
OK?

105
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,820
-It's not hard. -Take a break.

106
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,060
I've signed up for the night school to learn accounting.

107
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,980
I'll understand it when I finish the course.

108
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,740
Who dares to bully me at that time?

109
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,580
Well,

110
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,260
you don't have to tire yourself out.

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,850
Just hire someone

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,480
to do it for you.

113
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,930
Just be who you are before.

114
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,300
Eat and play what you like.

115
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,770
No, I can't.

116
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,170
I have to be a good wife.

117
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,660
I want to help you

118
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,940
run this factory.

119
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,660
OK. OK.

120
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,660
Is the return rate so high now?

121
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,820
Many goods are still here now?

122
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,340
Some workers left.

123
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,140
Why didn't you tell me?

124
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,900
Who left?

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,330
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Huang,

126
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,380
and Mr. Li.

127
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,770
I can't remember.

128
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,860
That's impossible.

129
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,100
These workers have worked here

130
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,220
for most of their lives.

131
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,260
Some worked here longer than me.

132
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,500
How could they leave just like that?

133
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,260
They were being backseat drivers.

134
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,300
I don't like it.

135
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,020
And he even contradicted me.

136
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm their boss's wife.

137
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,370
How could they bully me like that?

138
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,040
So I made a decision

139
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,220
to fire them

140
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
in order to warn others.

141
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,830
Feng, will you blame me?

142
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,500
Feng, today,

143
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,300
some people called and asked for money.

144
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,380
Where is the cash in our factory?

145
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,850
There's no cash for now.

146
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,420
She took all the cash

147
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,030
when she left.

148
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,980
It's okay. We can make money.

149
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,440
By the way,

150
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,590
you can ask

151
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,720
your brothers for help.

152
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,960
You are so close.

153
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,110
They can help you with this.

154
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,260
Bao'er.

155
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,740
At this time,

156
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,080
it's impossible for them to lend me money.

157
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,390
It's because...

158
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,060
How about this?

159
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,810
I can sell

160
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,860
this factory.

161
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,760
Let's take the money back.

162
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,500
OK?

163
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,420
Why?

164
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,670
I'm soft-hearted.

165
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm not suitable for business.

166
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,040
Let alone Qiu Bizheng,

167
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,900
I can't even

168
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,080
catch up with Xu Banxia now.

169
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,230
Let's sell the factory and get the money back.

170
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,780
Let's go on a trip.

171
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,980
We can go anywhere we want.

172
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,460

that you are very rich.

can't be solved with money.

300
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,760
Let me put it this way,

301
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,300
do you know how much does a steel mill

302

which has five thousand employees

303
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,790

That's why I need you.

306

What you need most is talent, not me.

307
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,740
You also need an effective management system.

308
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,500
An effective management system

309
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,400
is a secret in world-class companies.

310

311
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,040
And talent.

312
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,810
You need a lot of skilled workers.

313
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,560
How do you get them?

314
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,420
Poach them from every steel mill?

315
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,480
You'll be exhausted.

316
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,940
I believe If I have you,

317
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,140
these problems can be solved one by one.

318
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,470
Even if you have me,

319
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,580
even if we work together,

320
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,650
it will take a long time

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
to have these.

322
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,730
Miss Xu, in a word,

323
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,330
actually,

324

the conditions of this matter are not ripe yet.

325

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,580
I live in the house opposite.

343
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,690
Come to me if you need anything.

344
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,730
I'll help you carry your luggage.

345
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,660
Anything else?

346
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,210
Yes.

347
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,460
Where is Wildcat?

348
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,780
She went to the tax bureau.

349
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,980
She'll be back soon.

350
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,100
What are you doing?

351
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,480
I'm doing the accounts. What else can I do?

352
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,950
There's a signal.

353
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,240
Whose call are you waiting for?

354
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,690
I'm waiting for Zhou Qian's call.

355
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,380
I bought her a mobile phone.

356
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,940
She said she would call me when she went back to the factory.

357
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,100
She hasn't called me yet.

358
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,770
Take it easy.

359
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,660
Don't buy everything for her like an easy touch.

360
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,760
What do you mean?

361
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,330
I bought a mobile phone for my girlfriend.

362
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,800
What's wrong?

363
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,820
Your truck team

364
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,990
was also given to Wildcat.

365
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,540
Stop talking about me.

366
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,020
Which factory does she work in?

367
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,000
Have you been there?

368
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,460
No. We're busy.

369
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,560
How busy can a person who works in a factory be?

370
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,120
She even doesn't have time to call you?

371
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,980
Tong Xiaoqi.

372
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,280
Shut up if you don't know how to speak.

373
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,820
OK?

374
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,180
I have a lot of things to do.

375
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,550
I need to finish the accounts.

376
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,580
I have an appointment with Zhou Qian for Western food.

377
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,680
I've reserved the seats.

378
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
You'll have Western food?

379
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,090
Take me and Wildcat along.

380
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,660
We can meet each other.

381
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,200
Tong Xiaoqi.

382
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
Are you bored?

383
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,170
If you have nothing to do,

384
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,600
I'll assign you some work, okay?

385
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,500
How about I assign some work to Wildcat

386
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,180
and you do it for her?

387
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,870
Don't bother me here.

388
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,430
Can you wait outside?

389
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,300
This is the financial department. Idlers are not allowed in.

390
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,220
Get out.

391
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,730
Take it easy.

392
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,700
Get out.

393
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Mom, come in.

394
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,500
You go first.

395
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,650
My son-in-law is here.

396
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,680
Auntie, why are you here?

397
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,579
Have a seat.

398
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,140
OK.

399
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,900
Sit down.

400
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,619
Bao'er.

401
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,730
Come here.

402
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,270
Let me ask you.

403
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,260
Did you take the key to my safe?

404
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,220
What's wrong?

405
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,480
Why did you take my key?

406
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,530
Give it to me.

407
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,460
Son-in-law.

408
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,780
Come here.

409
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,260
Let me tell you.

410
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,080
Auntie.

411
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,650
You can call me Feng

412
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,950
or my full name.

413
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,180
OK.

414
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,540
Feng.

415
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm here

416
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,420
to discuss

417
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,580
the wedding with you.

418
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,940
The sixth of next month is a good day.

419
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,460
There's no hurry.

420
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,610
Bao'er, give me the key.

421
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,910
They are waiting for me to stamp the company name.

422
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,660
Feng, my mom rarely comes to Binhai.

423
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,680
She came here specially

424
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,310
to talk about this.

425
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,100
Auntie.

426
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,500
Look.

427
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,090
I've discussed this matter

428
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,610
with you before.

429
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,060
Let's not hold a wedding ceremony for now.

430
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,030
When will you hold it?

431
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,260
I'm

432
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,970
making a big deal.

433
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,580
It's about buying shares in a steel mill.

434
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,900
Look at my messy place.

435
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,950
I'm doing the accounts.

436
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,480
I have to sell this factory first.

437
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,580
Sell it?

438
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,340
Why should we sell

439
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,260
such a good factory?

440
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,340
If we don't sell it,

441
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,260
we won't have money to buy shares.

442
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,470
Auntie, please give me two to three months.

443
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,480
Feng,

444
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,300
I hate being asked to wait for two days,

445
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,760
two months or two years.

446
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,180
Jinbao will be 30 next year.

447
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,920
Mom, don't be like this.

448
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,540
Feng said

449
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,180
we'll

450
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,620
-sit down and talk about this later. -When I was at her age,

451
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,340
Jinbao was in elementary school.

452
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,190
Auntie, it's a special time

453
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,950
and situation.

454
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,150
No matter how special it is,

455
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,680
my daughter is still unmarried.

456
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,620
Besides,

457
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,820
she doesn't have an identity now.

458
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,020
Tell me. In your factory,

459
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,620
who treats her like a boss's wife?

460
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,200
Mom, it doesn't matter.

461
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,140
What matters is Feng and I

462
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,540
-can be together forever. -Shut up!

463
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,540
Auntie.

464
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,070
This

465
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,490
is my second marriage.

466
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,000
There's a rule.

467
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,760
People who are married

468
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,380
would rather go bankrupt than divide up family property.

469
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,860
Then why do you be with my daughter?

470
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,180
Aren't you being irresponsible?

471
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,820
Don't say that, Mom.

472
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,210
Feng is serious about me.

473
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Auntie.

474
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,340
Don't be angry, okay?

475
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,060
Don't worry.

476
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,620
I promise to give Bao an identity.

477
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,500
As for the wedding, let's put it aside for now, okay?

478
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,060
No way!

479
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,580
Listen.

480
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,600
My daughter should have a grand wedding.

481
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,380
Even if there's only one person coming, you should hold it.

482
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,220
Do you understand?

483
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,300
Mom.

484
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,390
Can you stop making things difficult for Feng?

485
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,420
I'm happy

486
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,680
to be with him.

487
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,620
You're such a disappointment!

488
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,830
So disappointing!

489
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,060
Auntie.

490
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,720
Don't hit her.

491
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,900
Auntie, what are you doing?

492
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,520
Don't hit her.

493
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,390
Go away!

494
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,560
-Auntie, calm down. -Let me teach her a lesson.

495
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,780
Auntie, let's talk nicely.

496
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,700
Auntie, let's talk nicely.

497
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,420
Go away!

498
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,440
Stop fighting!

499
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,610
OK! I'll do as you wish!

500
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,420
Crouch down!

501
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,740
Are you crazy?

502
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,070
How dare you steal my things?

503
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,370
No.

504
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,150
Tell me.

505
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,420
What do you think?

506
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,220
I heard

507
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,770
that there are machine guns and cannons

508
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,860
in your warehouse.

509
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,370
I didn't mean to steal your things.

510
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,040
I just wanted to come in and have a look.

511
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,350
Planes and cannons?

512
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,940
It's illegal, you know?

513
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,540
Send him to the police station.

514
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,480
-No. -Let's go.

515
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,910
Wait for me there.

516
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,620
Stand there.

517
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,580
This road is hard to walk on.

518
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Why are you here?

519
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,530
Wait. Wait for me there.

520
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,220
You told me

521
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,330
your storage yard is in Xiutan Village.

522
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,080
I didn't expect you to come.

523
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,210
Chen, the big mill

524
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,100
and the steel

525
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,220
are all yours?

526
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:17,650
Right.

527
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,240
They all belong to our company.

528
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,660
Let me show you

529
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,020
another big storage yard over there.

530
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,620
Chen.

531
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,150
What's wrong?

532
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,250
Let's not see each other anymore.

533
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,970
What do you mean?

534
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,810
You should find a good girl

535
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
to have a real date.

536
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,460
I'm not the one.

537
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,020
Can I know

538
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,060
the reason?

539
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,700
You're a good person.

540
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,220
Sir, drive forward.

541
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:25,940
Why is there so little?

542
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,440
That's all I have.

543
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,900
Go on.

544
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,950
I quit.

545
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,290
Go back.

546
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
Change another one for me.

547
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,420
Go back. Let's talk about it tonight.

548
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,540
Change another person for me.

549
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,440
He's not suitable.

550
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,720
[Huilai Road]

551
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,310
You are here.

552
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,580
What are you doing?

553
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,980
Are you crazy? Why are you drinking after coughing blood?

554
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,030
What happened?

555
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,110
Are you dumped?

556
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,030
Come with me.

557
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,100
Zhao Lei, you're back.

558
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,030
I cooked some food for you.

559
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,950
Keep the door for me.

560
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,140
I cooked some dumplings for you.

561
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,750
I'll put the rest in your fridge.

562
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,480
So many dumplings.

563
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,850
Just boil them when you're hungry. It's convenient.

564
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,700
Okay.

565
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,310
You decorated the house again?

566
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,180
Yes. Do you think it's okay?

567
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,050
You have good taste.

568
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,620
Friedman.

569
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,220
One of the most famous economists in America.

570
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,180
A professor in the University of Chicago.

571
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,620
In 1976,

572
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,180
he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.

573
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,450
He's your idol?

574
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,200
Not bad.

575
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,640
I've attended his lecture in America.

576
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,990
He claimed that a real deal

577
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,100
should be willing and free.

578
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,100
I also hope our deal

579
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,760
is free and willing.

580
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,060
I have three conditions.

581
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:50,540
Say it.

582
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,400
First, I can leave anytime

583
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,330
when I find a new job.

584
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,530
You can't refuse.

585
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,530
Let's part happily.

586
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,200
Help ourselves.

587
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,590
OK.

588
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,380
Second,

589
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,100
you can't reject my suggestions.

590
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,220
If you reject a suggestion,

591
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,620
our contract will automatically terminate.

592
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,530
No problem.

593
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:12,890
Third...

594
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,210
Really? How could you agree to them?

595
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,100
What's your third condition?

596
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,320
I haven't thought about it yet.

597
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,670
I'll tell you after I think about it.

598
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,380
Okay.

599
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,730
Dumplings are delicious.

600
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,060
Are you serious? You prepared that?

601
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,700
I'll write down the first two conditions you said.

602
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,370
When you come up with the third one,

603
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,190
I'll write it down.

604
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,500
As long as we print our thumb prints on it,

605
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,740
it'll be effective.

606
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,730
Why don't you reconsider it?

607
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,470
Aren't you being too impulsive?

608
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,770
I believe you won't hurt me.

609
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,420
Sign it.

610
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,530
You're really something.

611
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,350
They introduced a stingy man to me.

612
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,490
I spent a whole day with him but he didn't buy me any water.

613
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,580
I'll ask them to change one for me tomorrow.

614
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,690
My man

615
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,090
was willing to spend money

616
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,080
on eating, drinking, and playing.

617
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,500
Once I asked him for something, he would turn against me.

618
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,260
So I think

619
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,430
Zhou Qian is lucky.

620
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,700
Yeah.

621
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,000
Why is her man so good?

622
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,230
He insisted on buying things for her.

623
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,270
He bought her expensive things.

624
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,380
I've never met someone like him.

625
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,090
Yeah.

626
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,240
Zhou Qian, what're you thinking? Why do you want to change another one?

627
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,630
Give him to me if you don't want him.

628
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,580
Right.

629
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,650
Give him to us.

630
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,300
Give him to me.

631
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,100
Yes, I want him too.

632
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,730
Coming.

633
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,590
Right.

634
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,820
Who are you looking for?

635
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,900
Zhou Qian.

636
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,820
Zhou Qian, he's here for you.

637
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,460
Coming.

638
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,540
Are you Zhou Qian's boyfriend?

639
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,340
Well, have you eaten?

640
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,620
I'll treat you to dinner.

641
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,850
Zhou Qian, your boyfriend is so generous.

642
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,990
We're just friends.

643
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,450
Well,

644
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,580
go and eat. Bring some for me.

645
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,830
Okay, let's go eat.

646
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,840
Come on.

647
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,510
-Look how generous his boyfriend is. -Get dressed. Let's go.

648
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,150
Right.

649
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,060
All right. Don't be jealous. Just go.

650
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,580
You're not lucky.

651
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,300
Hurry up!

652
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:48,830
Go.

653
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,650
Coming.

654
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,060
How did you find me?

655
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,970
Why did you break up with me?

656
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,610
That day,

657
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,430
I saw two men

658
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,820
blocked your way in the alley.

659
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,300
They're my brothers.

660
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,440
Who are they?

661
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,330
They don't look like good people.

662
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,260
Are you done?

663
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,090
-Cousin. -What are you doing?

664
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,340
-Go away! -Don't get him wrong.

665
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,760
You are the one who pesters Zhou Qian every day, right?

666
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,530
Come out.

667
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,490
What do you mean?

668
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,380
In the law of the People's Republic of China,

669
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,700
is it illegal to pester others?

670
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,790
Zhou Qian and I

671
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,280
are in a relashionship.

672
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,110
-I'll hit you. -Stop glaring at me!

673
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,010
Did I talk to you?

674
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,580
Fine. Let's come out.

675
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,680
Just fight.

676
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:10,530
Well...

677
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,630
Cousin, I can handle it.

678
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,590
Get out of my way.

679
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,090

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,400
♫China, I'll forever bless you♫

848
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:17,010
♫With my love and devotion♫

849
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,470
I really don't think it's realistic.

850
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,130
Let's talk about the blast furnaces.

851
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,290
It has been used for almost 30 years since 1970.

852
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,020
Not to mention the equipment is old,

853
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,470
the maintenance of the old equipment

854
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,420
will cost a lot.

855
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,230
These are not the most important.

856
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,040
Money is essential.

857
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,300
Miss Xu, your money

858
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,810
is enough for 30% of the previous payment.

859
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,910
What about the rest?

860
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,120
I've asked a bank for help.

861
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,690
But banks are not omnipotent.

862
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,790
I still suggest

863
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,750
that we can't do the projects

864
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,120
which put the company in danger

865
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,400
in a hurry.

866
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,760
Mr. Zhao, I invited you here

867
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,780
because I want this steel mill.

868
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,190
What if you can't?

869
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,730
I'll try everything to have it.

870
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,820
How about we talk in another way?

871
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,490
Let's not think about the funds first.

872
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,500
If you were a trader,

873
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,140
how would you solve the problems of having the old equipment

874
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,550
which needs to be replaced?

875
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,220
Consider it as my question.

876
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,490
Shenyang.

877
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,060
Congratulations!

878
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,030
I'm really late.

879
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,900
I have something to do at home.

880
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,270
Please take this red envelope.

881
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,800
-What's the hurry? -I'll finish the wedding wine.

882
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,390
Please congratulate the bride and groom for me.

883
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,350
There's no hurry.

884
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,120
Drink slowly.

885
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,270
Stay a little longer.

886
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,400
I have something to do. See you.

887
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,120
Why are you in a hurry?

888
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,650
Please forgive me.

889
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,570
Thank you.

890
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,050
Thank you.

891
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,120
Help yourselves.

892
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:41,750
Look.

893
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,320
I'm here to propose a toast.

894
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,190
We're leaving.

895
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,480
Stay a little longer.

896
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,480
Are you leaving too?

897
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,160
Look at you.

898
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,930
Have a drink before you leave.

899
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,850
Feng,

900
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,950
the former sister-in-law used to take care of everything.

901
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,050
Let me ask you.

902
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,480
Who's in charge now, you or the new sister-in-law?

903
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,140
It must be her.

904
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,840
OK

905
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,370
Feng Yu is so wet.

906
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,190
Talk more.

907
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,300
-I can't bear sitting here. -Don't go.

908
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,720
I'm leaving.

909
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,240
Cut the crap.

910
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,270
What's the hurry?

911
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,180
He only has a few friends.

912
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,730
We must be the last one to be toasted.

913
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,770
Congratulations.

914
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,690
Congratulations.

915
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:18,800
Mr. Zhao.

916
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,730
I apologize to you.

917
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,890
I shouldn't have

918
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,120
pulled your tie that day.

919
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,280
I did drink too much.

920
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,400
You also fought back.

921
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,580
Let's forget about that matter, okay?

922
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,250
Mr. Wu, the one who should apologize

923
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,840
is me.

924
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,030
I wasn't calm that day.

925
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,060
Let's not talk about this anymore.

926
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,190
Okay.

927
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,980
Look at you two.

928
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,420
You finally sit together.

929
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,090
Mr. Wu, what do you mean?

930
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,790
Mr. Zhao is working in my company now.

931
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,980
You need to make it clear.

932
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,930
We're colleagues.

933
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,190
Yes. That's what I mean.

934
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,210
Look, a powerful alliance.

935
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,530
Mr. Zhao

936
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,070
always defends you.

937
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,950
That's not right.

938
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,330
About the steel mill I talked about that day,

939
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,040
I didn't single anyone out.

940
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,110
I have no bias

941
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,160
against Mr. Wu and Mr. Qiu.

942
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,910
I just said my opinion.

943
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:17,580
Mr. Qiu.

944
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,720
Cheers.

945
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,140
Don't go. Stay a little longer.

946
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,370
You have something to do?

947
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,700
-Look at you. -See you.

948
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,580
See you next time.

949
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,620
Have a seat.

950
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,800
Take a seat. Don't hurry to leave.

951
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,200
I'll toast others first.

952
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,190
Go ahead.

953
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,700
Okay.

954
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,680
Enjoy yourselves.

955
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,610
Have a seat.

956
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,370
Enjoy yourselves.

957
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,030
Keep drinking.

958
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,390
Here.

959
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,120
Mom, sit here for a while.

960
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,800
There aren't many people left anyway.

961
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,240
What kind of wedding is this?

962
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,100
What is this?

963
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,160
Mom, I just got divorced.

964
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:59,010
This is our second marriage.

965
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,130
Besides,

966
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,860
I told you not to hold it,

967
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,540
but you insisted.

968
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,720
This is the result.

969
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,620
Feng Yu!

970
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,890
What do you mean?
