4
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,540
Dude.

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,730
Hello.

6
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,670
Where is your village chief?

7
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,190
The village chief? He's over there.

8
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,990
Chief, someone is looking for you.

9
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,670
Who is it?

10
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,310
Chief.

11
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,180
Chief.

12
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,230
Nice to meet you.

13
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:26,630
Chief.

14
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,790
You are...

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm from Binhai Banxia Steel Co., Ltd.

16
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,550
Chen Yuzhou.

17
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:34,950
What's the matter?

18
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:36,310
Chief.

19
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,310
Does the mudflat in the west of the village

20
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,190
belong to your village?

21
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,110
I heard that

22
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,450
it is for rent now, right?

23
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,550
How do you want to rent it?

24
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,990
We just took a look.

25
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,980
Its area should be about 4 hectares.

26
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,329
We want to rent 2 hectares of it.

27
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:53,870
Sure.

28
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,430
How long will you rent it? What for?

29
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,630
We plan to build a storage yard.

30
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,790
What is a storage yard for?

31
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,560
Just for piling things,

32
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,510
like some scrap steel and scrap iron.

33
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,550
The tenancy should be at least five years, and 0.2 million yuan a year.

34
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,110
We require one-off payment.

35
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,150
Chief,

36
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,910
could you please

37
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,990
lower the price a little bit?

38
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,010
Let me tell you.

39
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,780
Though we only rent 2 hectares for now,

40
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,980
we also plan to build a wharf later,

41
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,990
and will definitely rent a larger area of it

42
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,170
for many years.

43
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,220
We just entered the village.

44
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,630
The road is a bit awful.

45
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,750
After we rent it,

46
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,110
we can build all the roads in your village

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,110
into asphalt ones.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,630
So, could you please lower the price?

49
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,150
I didn't ask much from you.

50
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,230
Many companies want this land,

51
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,750
like the provincial medical companies,

52
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,270
and...

53
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,900
And...

54
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,710
many people have come to see it anyway.

55
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,230
If you really want to rent it, you have to hurry.

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,670
Is your company state-operated?

57
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,840
It's a private enterprise.

58
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,630
Self-employed?

59
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,140
Not entirely.

60
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:58,910
It's a company.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,650
It's just not that big.

62
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,100
You plan to build a wharf?

63
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,030
It's a large scale.

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,110
Don't worry.

65
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,670
As long as you rent it to us,

66
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,710
we will keep our promise.

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,710
Who are you?

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,920
Take out your cigarettes.

69
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,380
Chief, I'm a businessman.

70
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,920
You? Running business here?

71
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,120
About that mudflat,

72
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,550
it was originally left for poultry raising.

73
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,790
And that's also some villagers' will.

74
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,430
So, we still need to hold a village meeting

75
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,390
to discuss about whether to rent it out.

76
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,030
I can't decide it on my own.

77
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,030
To rent it or not?

78
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,590
You can think about it.

79
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,670
Okay, I understand.

80
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,270
Chief, we'll come back later.

81
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,350
See you.

82
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,670
The village chief is definitely an old slick.

83
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,150
You were too anxious.

84
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,590
I was not.

85
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,310
Which eye of yours saw me being anxious?

86
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,470
Wait, I haven't said anything about you.

87
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,550
Now are you even blaming me?

88
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,630
Listen.

89
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,590
Can you prepare some good cigarettes from now on?

90
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,190
Nowadays, you have to look like a businessman.

91
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,910
Was that about cigarettes?

92
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,230
I don't know business.

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,190
But I can tell

94
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,870
whether he's bad or not.

95
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,660
Let me tell you.

96
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,590
If you pretend to hesitate for a few days,

97
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,550
he will definitely hurry to rent it.

98
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,750
You're getting more and more self-proud, aren't you?

99
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,390
You think I didn't notice it?

100
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,110
I knew he must be a sly guy

101
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,670
at the first sight of him.

102
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,470
Fine, you're the smartest.

103
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,980
What are you doing? Where are your manners?

104
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,620
Drive carefully.

105
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,310
How is it going?

106
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,100
What are you doing?

107
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,030
What are you doing here?

108
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,710
I didn't mean it.

109
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,510
Have the days in jail made you an idiot?

110
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,870
Go watch movies.

111
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,460
Take it away.

112
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,890
I'm just afraid that it's too spicy for you.

113
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,750
Why do you add so much chili for noodles?

114
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,909
None of your business.

115
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,090
Just some ledgers. Is it necessary to be this angry?

116
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,830
You know nothing.

117
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,790
Let me tell you.

118
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,920
The ledger of Guo Qidong

119
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,630
is really made flawless.

120
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,310
If Qiu Bizheng finds it out,

121
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,340
he's gonna kill him.

122
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,970
What kind of friends are you making?

123
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,630
They don't look like good people at all.

124
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,790
They look wicked.

125
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,150
You know nothing.

126
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,870
This is business.

127
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,390
Hello.

128
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,640
Fatty.

129
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,550
Where are you?

130
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,060
Okay, I got it. Right away.

131
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,870
Pack your things, quickly.

132
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,350
Let's go.

133
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,910
Let's go out.

134
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,550
For what business?

135
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,030
You'll know when you get there.

136
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,560
Put on your clothes. Let's go.

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,110
Here.

138
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,810
You have nothing to do here.

139
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,150
Chen and I got you over a dozen trucks.

140
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,690
They look battered,

141
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,790
but should still work if repaired.

142
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,560
Boss.

143
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,909
I can't take them.

144
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,640
You're in urgent need of money.

145
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,480
Don't worry about me.

146
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,910
I'll figure it out myself.

147
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,150
Never mind,

148
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,790
we can still afford to these battered trucks.

149
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,410
The construction of the storage yard is to start,

150
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,750
we have our own trunks.

151
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,590
We don't need to hire others.

152
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,990
In the future, you have to work on your own with your trucks

153
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,870
and make some money for our company.

154
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,710
No, I still can't take them.

155
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,910
I'm not capable of managing so many trucks.

156
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,150
It costs a lot of money to repair them.

157
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,740
It's better for you to use them.

158
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:28,900
Enough.

159
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Stop pretending.

160
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,270
This is your gift

161
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,390
from Fatty and me.

162
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,100
Just take it.

163
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,130
By the way,

164
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,600
be sure to get some good drivers.

165
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,590
That's easy.

166
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,549
All of my buddies released from prison together with me can drive.

167
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,370
We used to do this in jail.

168
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:45,990
No.

169
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,750
You can't contact those guys anymore.

170
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,830
Why?

171
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,200
Where can I find someone else?

172
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,750
Just hire some professional truck drivers.

173
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,190
I don't want you to have any connection

174
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,150
with those guys.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,040
What do you mean?

176
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,480
If you ask me to look for drivers,

177
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,270
then I definitely will contact my buddies.

178
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,120
Everyone I know has a criminal record.

179
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,990
I don't know anyone without a criminal record.

180
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,670
I don't care.

181
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,510
I just won't allow it.

182
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,430
Figure it out yourself.

183
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,310
What's wrong with my buddies?

184
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,590
Besides,

185
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,430
they had nothing to do with my going to jail.

186
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,270
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,230
Fatty,

188
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,990
I think it's fine.

189
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,990
Just hire his buddies.

190
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,790
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on them.

191
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,480
It's okay.

192
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,080
Apologize.

193
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,990
I didn't mean that.

194
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,230
Forget it. I don't want the trucks.

195
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,580
Can you be more sensible?

196
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,630
Fatty, don't take it to heart.

197
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,830
He didn't mean that.

198
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,670
That's what he meant.

199
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,120
Can you be good?

200
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,980
Can you be good?

201
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,670
I didn't mean that.

202
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,510
Don't take it to heart.

203
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,480
Later, remember to get licenses for the trucks.

204
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,230
Okay, no problem.

205
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,110
Thank you, boss.

206
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,040
Today is a big day for the Xiaoqi.

207
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,830
Let's take a photo.

208
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:24,850
Big day?

209
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,030
What big day?

210
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,230
Today

211
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,680
is a big day for you to start a good life.

212
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,950
Five seconds.

213
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,340
I just got a call from my friend.

214
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,200
It's said that the price of roll materials is very stable this year.

215
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,950
Why is your price

216
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,660
so high?

217
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,030
Mr. Qiu,

218
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,870
is this friend of you

219
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,990
the Mr. Liu who just came from Guangzhou two days ago?

220
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,540
Yes.

221
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,220
Those in Guangzhou

222
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,710
are indeed cold-rolled sheets imported from Japan.

223
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,630
And their price is actually 200 yuan less than ours.

224
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,050
But have you thought about why?

225
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,350
You tell me, why?

226
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,050
They have a large amount of the materials.

227
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,270
Don't take all of them out later.

228
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,620
Take whatever I tell you to.

229
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,250
OK.

230
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,510
Our market is not satisfying this year.

231
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,880
Not only us.

232
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,750
It's the same condition for every company.

233
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,990
Enough.

234
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,070
Who is it?

235
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,550
Mr. Qiu.

236
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,510
Ms. Xu.

237
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,180
Why are you here?

238
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,150
You should have told me before coming here.

239
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,830
Mr. Guo is here too...

240
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,120
Since you're here,

241
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
you'd better stay.

242
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,420
Let's have dinner today.

243
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,410
Come, have a seat.

244
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,920
Go and order some dishes.

245
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,900
Be sure to prepare both liquors and cold dishes.

246
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:05,940
Go now.

247
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,040
I can ask Sun to do this.

248
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,850
He usually does such things.

249
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,510
Why?

250
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,510
You go in person.

251
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,990
I hate the food Sun ordered the most.

252
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:14,990
Not tasty at all.

253
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,630
Mr. Xu is here today.

254
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,710
We should show our hospitality.

255
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,610
Go in person.

256
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,710
Go now.

257
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,710
Hurry up.

258
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,910
I'll wait for you to come back.

259
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,550
Mr. Qiu, have you ever done underground work?

260
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,610
I have no choice.

261
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,430
I must do so.

262
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,080
How is it going?

263
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,310
We found some problems.

264
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,630
But Mr. Qiu,

265
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,830
you know better than me

266
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,090
whether Guo Qidong has problems or not.

267
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,740
You asked me to investigate him.

268
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,940
Aren't you afraid that he'll find out?

269
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,350
I'm not afraid of anything now.

270
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,970
I only want one result.

271
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,190
What's the result?

272
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,830
Tell me

273
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,890
what happened between you two.

274
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,660
How did your relationship come to be like this?

275
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,840
It can already be a laughing stock.

276
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,710
Guo Qidong

277
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,230
worked with me as soon as he graduated from college.

278
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,070
At that time, I also lived a tough life too.

279
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,070
I sold these scrap metal on the street,

280
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,480
and even have been a currency trader.

281
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,500
Gradually, my life got better,

282
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,670
and then I built this factory.

283
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,970
I asked him to come to help me.

284
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,950
It was not bad in the first few years.

285
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,190
We've made money.

286
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,750
But recently,

287
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,390
I always feel something is wrong.

288
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,600
But I can't find any evidence.

289
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,810
I did want to ask him to leave,

290
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,350
but my factory can't live without him.

291
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,440
If there could be any other choices,

292
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,530
I wouldn't be so anxious,

293
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
and wouldn't trouble you.

294
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,220
Mr. Qiu,

295
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,020
this should be an internal matter of your factory.

296
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,770
And it's inappropriate for me to get involved.

297
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,230
Don't say that.

298
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,410
You know the current condition in this factory.

299
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,670
I work outside all day long for business.

300
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,550
And the whole factory now

301
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,050
is under his control.

302
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,230
And no one can do anything about it.

303
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,070
What should I do?

304
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,640
If this goes on,

305
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,960
in a few years,

306
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,870
this factory will no longer be mine,

307
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,870
but belong to Guo Qidong.

308
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,070
Mr. Qiu.

309
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,230
I'm here to talk to you

310
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,650
about purchasing scrap steel from the north.

311
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,510
I'm wondering whether you're willing

312
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,590
to share the quota with me?

313
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,550
Wait.

314
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,300
As you know,

315
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,160
I want 15,000 tons.

316
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,320
We are talking about Guo Qidong.

317
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,860
Why do you skip to the scrap steel thing?

318
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,950
You shouldn't talk about the quota with me.

319
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,930
It's decided by Wu Jianshe.

320
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,710
You have to talk to him.

321
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,910
I can't intervene in it.

322
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,470
I got it.

323
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,270
It's up to Mr. Wu.

324
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,000
Then can you come together with me?

325
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,910
Show him your attitude.

326
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,490
Tell him that you're willing to share with me your quota.

327
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,510
How do you think?

328
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,980
Look.

329
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,590
I only have a quota of 15,000.

330
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,670
If I give you the quota,

331
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,470
how should I make money?

332
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,110
You have to go to Mr. Wu.

333
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,450
He's the one with the say in it,

334
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,630
right?

335
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,030
Right.

336
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,030
If you don't want to share the quota,

337
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,070
it'll be difficult for me to check the accounts.

338
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,490
What do you mean?

339
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,610
It's unreasonable.

340
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,830
The situation seems to be that

341
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,220
you two haven't found any problems,

342
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,040
and are here to blackmail me?

343
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,030
Tong.

344
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,430
Photos.

345
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,870
Guo Qidong is a talent.

346
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,390
If he doesn't work for you,

347
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,850
he can still do a great job on his own.

348
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,670
Tong,

349
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,350
introduce it to Mr. Qiu.

350
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,790
Mr. Qiu.

351
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,330
We kept watch for some days and took these photos.

352
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,770
These are the production lines and raw materials of the steel plates.

353
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,970
And these

354
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,730
are factories he built in the countryside behind your back.

355
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,050
The legal person is Guo Qidong.

356
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,160
The procedures and equipment in the factory

357
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,090
are almost the same as yours.

358
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,220
I've asked

359
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,150
the price of their cutting steel plates

360
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,470
is much cheaper than yours.

361
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,340
You know what I mean.

362
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,140
But whether he stole your dealings

363
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,910
to his factory or not,

364
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,280
I'm not sure about it.

365
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,530
This is just a part.

366
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,320
Damn Guo Qidong.

367
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,040
Damn it.

368
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,390
Mr. Qiu,

369
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,800
your vice president doesn't really have good morality.

370
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,090
He tricked you into eliminating old equipment.

371
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,500
Then he bought the equipment at a low price and built his own factories.

372
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,580
He obviously wants to compete with you for business.

373
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,980
Why are you back so early?

374
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,530
What do you two want to do?

375
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,710
What do you want to do?

376
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,030
What's this?

377
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,110
About this factory,

378
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,390
and the production line, give me your explanations.

379
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,510
Bro,

380
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,280
you really misunderstood me.

381
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,830
This factory belongs to my brother-in-law.

382
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,830
He's uneducated.

383
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,860
And that's why I became its legal person.

384
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,190
Yes, I invested some money in it,

385
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,670
because we are relatives.

386
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,770
But there's one thing.

387
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,830
I've never done anything harmful to you.

388
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,710
Nonsense!

389
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,670
Do you believe what you said?

390
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,080
Xu, what do you mean?

391
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,670
Are you trying to destroy the long-time relationship

392
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,310
between Qiu and I

393
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,630
with these damn photos?

394
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,030
Do you have any proof?

395
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,630
What do you want...

396
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,660
Watch your mouth.

397
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,110
What are you doing?

398
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,550
Don't vent your anger on them.

399
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,580
Come at me.

400
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,910
How have I treated you all these years?

401
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,510
Touch your heart and ask yourself.

402
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,860
How did I treat you?

403
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,670
Bro,

404
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,750
if you say so,

405
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,110
you'll break my heart.

406
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,740
I've been with you for so many years.

407
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,870
Now, how can you lose trust in me

408
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,420
and doubt me

409
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,610
just because these two damn guys

410
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,460
come with three damn photos?

411
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,110
Qiu Bizheng!

412
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,630
You hit me?

413
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,950
Don't.

414
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,510
Mr. Qiu,

415
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,990
how about you handle your internal matter first?

416
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,200
We'll come again another day.

417
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,910
This thing...

418
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,310
Don't.

419
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,790
Come here. I have something to tell you.

420
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,620
Qiu Bizheng!

421
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,150
You...

422
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:39,670
Mr. Qiu,

423
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,870
you've been fighting like this...

424
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,990
Let's talk another day.

425
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,560
Please don't.

426
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,490
We have to keep investigating.

427
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,910
-Don't move. -What are you doing?

428
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,710
Don't move.

429
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,710
This is in my factory. You ask me not to move?

430
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,110
Get up.

431
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,700
Why are you shouting?

432
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,990
Feel guilty?

433
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,290
I hate people like you who betray friends for profits.

434
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,540
Do you know how to be a man?

435
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,810
I'll teach you today.

436
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:01,510
Get down!

437
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm an educated man. You want me to listen to...

438
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,190
Head in your hands!

439
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,720
If you can't give me the quota,

440
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,190
can you lend me some money?

441
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,310
How much do you want to borrow?

442
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,230
Three million.

443
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,030
I don't have that much.

444
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,180
100,000.

445
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,230
Two million.

446
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,640
150,000.

447
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,750
One million.

448
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,990
This ledger should be worth so much, shouldn't it?

449
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,180
I can tell you for sure

450
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,230
there are many other problems in the account.

451
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,750
If you don't lend the money to me,

452
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,870
you will lose much more

453
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,020
than a million in a year.

454
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,110
Think about it.

455
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,690
Don't worry,

456
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,070
I'll pay you interest.

457
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,670
One million.

458
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,050
No more talk for any lower amount.

459
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,000
Annual interest of 20 percent?

460
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,590
That's a deal.

461
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,190
One million.

462
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,100
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

463
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,740
Mr. Qiu.

464
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,830
You're not young anymore.

465
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,690
Don't hit people in the face.

466
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,030
I know how to deal with such guys.

467
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,380
Call me if you need anything.

468
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,960
Still eating?

469
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,110
Have you finished your homework?

470
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,750
Wash your hands and finish your homework.

471
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,610
How about I get a table for you tomorrow?

472
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,990
You can eat on the street,

473
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,390
and enjoy the food with cold wind wuthering around.

474
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,860
Kuan promised to pay higher interest.

475
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,560
We can consider it.

476
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,270
It's just to put the money in another place, right?

477
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,750
You always think about interest.

478
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,760
Let me tell you.

479
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,350
You'll lose everything in the end,

480
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,920
you know?

481
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,540
-Things won't be that terrible. -She has the Real Estate Ownership Certificate.

482
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,070
She can come to ask for the money

483
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,030
whenever she wants.

484
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,140
I can't even sleep.

485
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
It's not that serious.

486
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,270
Kuan has done everything

487
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,790
that she promised.

488
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,750
Besides, I'm her father.

489
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,050
Qian is also her sister.

490
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,980
If we need any help, she will also help us, right?

491
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,350
That won't be possible at all.

492
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,120
She lost her money.

493
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,350
She can't even take care of herself.

494
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,260
How can she help you?

495
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,140
Ridiculous!

496
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,320
Stop eating.

497
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,990
Guo Qidong,

498
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,110
how have I treated you all these years?

499
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,280
Ask yourself.

500
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,740
You can ask me for help if you need money.

501
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,550
But you can't steal.

502
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,620
How dare you!

503
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,370
Qiu Bizheng.

504
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,990
How can you do this to me?

505
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,350
You hit me

506
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,350
just for those two guys' words.

507
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,040
I work so hard day and night,

508
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,470
but have you ever trusted me?

509
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,390
Didn't I?

510
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,190
If I didn't trust you,

511
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,510
why would I sell the production line?

512
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,510
Your stupid production line?

513
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,470
How much extra payment can be made on each ton of raw materials?

514
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:07,910
Have you ever calculated it?

515
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,080
How many extra electricity fees can it cost?

516
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
And how much extra labor pay can it cost?

517
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,530
Can you calculate it clearly?

518
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,510
Can you?

519
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,870
But that doesn't mean you can sell it to your brother-in-law!

520
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,580
How much is a ton of plates?

521
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,020
How much is a ton of wire rods?

522
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,030
Can you calculate it clearly?

523
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,310
You...

524
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,310
Qiu Bizheng.

525
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,560
Do you know how much money

526
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,700
I've saved for our company?

527
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,030
Then how much did you get

528
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,190
from this production line of mine?

529
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,790
What?

530
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,230
Qiu Bizheng.

531
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,150
Have you ever thought about why Xu Banxia

532
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:28,990
slandered me in front of you?

533
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,630
Have you ever thought about it?

534
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,960
She wants to borrow money from you!

535
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,220
She wants you to thank her.

536
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,510
Do you know who is lying to you now?

537
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,950
Have you figured it out?

538
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,310
I quit.

539
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,160
Stop going through it.

540
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,950
I've checked these two ledgers heaps of times.

541
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,780
No extra amount of money can be found.

542
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,670
I'll urge our debtors to pay us back later.

543
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,270
That's not much.

544
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,710
Although you got one million,

545
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,330
there's still a large amount of money needed.

546
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,980
I'll ask my parents

547
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,110
to see if they can mortgage their house.

548
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,750
Forget it.

549
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,290
Don't get involved in this.

550
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,710
You've asked your dad for money.

551
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,540
At this point,

552
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,870
why can't I go?

553
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,390
I can just put aside my pride and go into their house.

554
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,830
I don't believe they can kick me out.

555
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,810
Your parents...

556
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,710
Sell the trucks.

557
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,190
I can find a job and support myself.

558
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,680
-Absolutely not! -Absolutely not!

559
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,950
How's it going with the mudflat?

560
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,770
We went to talk.

561
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,910
The village chief is a sly guy.

562
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,790
The mudflat is obviously of no use.

563
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,870
There were only some kids and old men

564
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,990
picking up crabs when the tide went down,

565
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,070
Guess what?

566
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,270
He asked us to pay the rent at once.

567
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,350
One million.

568
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,670
How arrogant he was!

569
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:02,970
Let him think about it for some days.

570
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,760
I'll go there again a few days later.

571
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,620
We must get the mudflat,

572
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,830
and build the storage yard.

573
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,990
We've come this far.

574
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,910
We must buy the steel,

575
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,150
and borrow money too.

576
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:27,670
Where are you going?

577
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,430
To go to Feng Yu.

578
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,800
How about I go with you?

579
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,270
Forget it.

580
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,040
I can't get money if you go with me.

581
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,130
That can be a disaster.

582
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,530
Mr. Feng.

583
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,260
Feng.

584
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,310
Ms.

585
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,140
Ms.

586
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,510
Where is Mr. Feng?

587
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,690
Looking for him for what matters?

588
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,430
Ms.,

589
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,410
during the last transaction meeting,

590
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,470
Feng said you were not feeling well.

591
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,240
I was afraid that I might bother you, and didn't go visit you.

592
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,160
How have you been?

593
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,550
Are you feeling better?

594
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,540
Have you received the fabric I gave you last time?

595
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,230
Yes. Thank you.

596
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,190
Feng always tells me that you have good taste,

597
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:57,850
and are very strict with the quality.

598
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Only good fabric is suitable for you.

599
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,470
I have good taste?

600
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,380
If I had good taste,

601
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,030
I wouldn't marry him.

602
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,550
I was out of mind.

603
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,070
Ms.

604
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,670
I know a very good tailor.

605
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,270
He's a very famous cheongsam-maker.

606
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,770
Are you free today?

607
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,950
My car's outside. I can drive you there.

608
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,270
You want to send me away

609
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,640
so that Feng

610
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,230
can be with his Bao, right?

611
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,690
Go away.

612
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,080
Ms.

613
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,950
There's no Bao at all.

614
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,150
That's just a joke.

615
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,020
Don't take it seriously.

616
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,680
I came to see him for business.

617
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,710
What business?

618
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,060
We are discussing to go north.

619
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,560
Ms.

620
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,240
The price of scrap steel there

621
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,670
is much lower than the domestic one.

622
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
If the market is satisfying,

623
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,190
we can sell it at twice the price.

624
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,710
I just want

625
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,270
to discuss with Mr. Feng about it

626
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,460
and make this big deal

627
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,030
so that he can share your burden.

628
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,080
Okay, you guys talk.

629
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,190
Ms.,

630
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
where's Mr. Feng?

631
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,350
Banxia,

632
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,710
if someone asks you to get married,

633
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,200
don't listen to him.

634
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
Women become ugly when getting old.

635
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,150
And ugliness makes women hated by men.

636
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,910
It's better to stay alone than be hated.

637
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,250
Remember it.

638
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,720
Why are you here?

639
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,510
You scared me.

640
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,000
You've been squatting here?

641
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,040
Or where can I go?

642
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,620
She asked you to squat here?

643
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,770
I can only do as she says.

644
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,070
She can treat me however she likes.

645
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,690
I'm certainly much more tolerant than her.

646
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,400
You scared me to death.

647
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,890
Did you expose yourself again?

648
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,700
Xu,

649
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,590
I have to tell you

650
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,110
Bao and I

651
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,710
are so in love now.

652
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,150
Feng, I don't want to know this.

653
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,350
I'm here to borrow money from you.

654
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,020
For buying scrap steel?

655
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,990
I went to see Qiu Bizheng

656
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,740
and got a million from him.

657
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,100
How much can you lend me?

658
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,230
He lent you one million?

659
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,110
Qiu Bizheng?

660
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,660
It's hard to get money from him.

661
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,870
When did you get

662
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,570
so close to him?

663
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,950
He doesn't lend me money without requirements.

664
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,470
Qiu Bizheng suspected that Guo Qidong betrayed him,

665
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,390
and asked me to check his ledgers.

666
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,100
I found out problems.

667
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,240
In the end,

668
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,130
Guo Qidong was hit and even got a nosebleed.

669
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,470
Was it that serious?

670
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,490
Xu,

671
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,180
I have to remind you.

672
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,210
Don't always get involved in their matters.

673
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,790
You have to be careful.

674
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,710
You reminded me.

675
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,420
Guo Qidong's price for selling you cutting boards

676
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,760
is higher than the price for others.

677
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,630
Do you know that?

678
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,430
Yes.

679
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,300
Actually, he did it to help me.

680
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,530
You know my situation.

681
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,320
I don't have the decision-making power.

682
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,340
I can only get my money out

683
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,570
by buying from him with a higher price.

684
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,390
Otherwise,

685
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,390
where can I get money for my Bao?

686
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,420
Bao has no money.

687
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,190
She even has no money to buy clothes for herself.

688
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,790
You know?

689
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,310
Fine.

690
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,710
I have no interest

691
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,700
in how much you love her.

692
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,390
You colluded with outsiders to deceive your wife,

693
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,230
harming your own family,

694
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,880
don't you feel guilty?

695
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,010
Sister, then you tell me, what should I do?

696
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,270
I'm not young anymore.

697
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,950
How can I let Bao

698
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,970
suffer with me?

699
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,790
If I don't see her every day,

700
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,910
I would feel like being on fire.

701
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,630
I only feel relieved

702
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,710
when I see her.

703
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,770
Now I understand,

704
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,400
only this is love.

705
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,580
Bro, stop it.

706
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,960
Without your wife

707
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,030
helping you manage the factory for these years,

708
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,540
how could you have gotten such good development?

709
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,220
If she really finds your affair,

710
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,360
you will terribly regret it.

711
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,310
Why would I regret it?

712
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,900
I have Bao with me.

713
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,870
This factory belongs to her family.

714
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,270
When I first came here,

715
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,790
she fell in love with me first.

716
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,230
And I just got...

717
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,110
G-G-Got married.

718
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,930
The factory director is my father-in-law.

719
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,990
This factory has nothing to do with me

720
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,390
from the beginning.

721
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,430
She can take it back whenever she likes.

722
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,110
Nothing can't be better than that.

723
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,990
I'll take Bao with me

724
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,940
to go travel.

725
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,720
Feng,

726
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,760
how much can you lend me?

727
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,220
How much do you want to borrow?

728
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,090
I really don't have one million.

729
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,350
How much do you have?

730
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,830
What are you doing?

731
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,190
Why are you pulling the curtains?

732
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,690
Don't worry.

733
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,090
You have no idea

734
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,250
how hard it is for me.

735
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,790
You're really good at hiding money, dude.

736
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,950
This is 0.2 million yuan.

737
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,860
I can't give all of it to you.

738
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,970
I can lend you 0.1 million.

739
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,550
I have to keep the rest of it for myself.

740
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,230
I want to borrow one million from you.

741
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,830
You only lend me 0.2 million?

742
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,110
And keep 0.1 million for yourself?

743
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,810
I still need more than three million.

744
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,430
Xu, I'll keep all of it if you don't want it.

745
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,820
What do you mean?

746
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,450
You want to do business just by borrowing money

747
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,710
without paying a penny yourself?

748
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,390
Of course not.

749
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,810
I really don't have enough money.

750
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,540
I still have to build that storage yard.

751
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,620
Brother, to be honest,

752
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,190
I'll run out of money

753
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,910
after completing them.

754
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,120
How about this?

755
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,760
I can take you to ask Mr. Wu for help.

756
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,750
I've been with him for half of my life anyway.

757
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,270
Maybe he can do us this favor.

758
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,220
Are you going or not?

759
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,030
Can he be willing to lend me money?

760
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,370
If he is willing,

761
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,820
then I can vouch for you.

762
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,870
Come, Mr. Zhao.

763
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,590
Overseas returnees like you

764
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,020
love this.

765
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,590
I specially prepared it for you.

766
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,070
I really can't accept the taste.

767
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,380
Mr. Wu asked me here

768
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,230
not just for coffee, right?

769
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,720
Just say it.

770
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,330
Didn't you promise

771
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,950
to buy the 50,000 tons of steel of mine?

772
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,010
The current situation is neither good

773
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,430
for Feng nor for Qiu.

774
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,600
How about this?

775
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,430
You can pay us part of the deposit first

776
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,230
so that I can let them rest assured

777
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,470
as their big brother.

778
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,070
The deposit?

779
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,190
Sure, no problem.

780
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,340
Great. Thank you.

781
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,190
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

782
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,980
Ten percent. Is that OK?

783
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,470
Of course.

784
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,710
Thanks for your generosity.

785
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,630
Thank you.

786
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,830
But there's one problem.

787
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,190
As you know,

788
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,870
the steel price is not stable.

789
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,830
It can change from 1,000 to 900 in a day,

790
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,950
and then reach 1200 in another day.

791
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,390
What price should we pay

792
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,420
for the ten percent of the deposit?

793
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,380
Right.

794
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,230
Mr. Zhao, how about this?

795
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,760
Let's take the average.

796
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,710
How about 1,000?

797
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,420
50 million for 50,000 tons.

798
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,940
Ten percent of 50 million is okay, right?

799
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,570
Mr. Wu, how about this?

800
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,500
After the steel is brought here

801
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,820
and arrives at the port,

802
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,230
we can trade

803
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,370
according to the price in that day.

804
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,980
I'll decide

805
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,350
the price of the steel.

806
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,590
What do you think?

807
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,290
Mr. Zhao, I mean...

808
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Right, you have a point.

809
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,770
But it can be hard for me

810
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,590
to bring the 50,000 tons of steel here.

811
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,110
I can't guarantee

812
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,770
what the final price will be

813
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,340
when the steel arrives at the port.

814
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,980
You can't let me

815
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,320
be like your laborer, right?

816
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,090
How do you think?

817
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,510
Come in.

818
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,450
Hold on.

819
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,390
Boss.

820
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:38,930
Mr. Wu.

821
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,130
Why are you here?

822
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,980
Mr. Zhao is here.

823
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,910
Mr. Zhao.

824
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,350
What's up?

825
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:45,870
Mr. Wu,

826
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,990
since you have a guest,

827
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,730
let's talk about this later.

828
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,430
I’m leaving.

829
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,470
No, wait.

830
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,850
Well...

831
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,310
You can talk first.

832
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,510
We can wait next door.

833
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,350
-Okay. -Don't...

834
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,230
You go first. We're not in a hurry.

835
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,590
-We can talk later. -Wait, Mr. Zhao, this...

836
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,340
This is a big deal.

837
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,990
They have nothing important.

838
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,000
Just say it and leave.

839
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,270
Xu's going to purchase scrap steel with us, right?

840
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,590
She came to borrow money from me. But how can I have the money?

841
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,489
I just want to borrow some money from you.

842
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,190
Xu, don't bother.

843
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,440
I'll give you 5,000 tons.

844
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,600
And you don't need to go.

845
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,710
Isn't it good for you to earn money without paying anything?

846
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,929
Mr. Wu, we've reached an agreement last time.

847
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,000
You promised to give me 15,000 tons.

848
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,270
Why is it changed to 5,000 tons?

849
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,429
When did I promise you?

850
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,380
Please reconsider it.

851
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,949
Why are you talking about this now?

852
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,199
You're just a little girl.

853
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,239
Don't always think about making money now.

854
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,070
Your priority now

855
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,730
is to find a good man and get married.

856
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,280
Good men have all gotten married.

857
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,840
Well...

858
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,630
I'm still young. If I don't want to make money,

859
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,230
then what should I think about?

860
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,030
Mr. Wu,

861
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,710
I have a storage yard.

862
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,310
You can just put your scrap steel

863
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,219
in my storage yard

864
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,710
so that you can save a lot of money.

865
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,800
Absolutely tall talk.

866
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,389
Where is your storage yard?

867
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,510
I can take you to see it.

868
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:50,980
Fine.

869
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,730
I believe you.

870
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,739
I'll think about it if you really have a storage yard.

871
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,270
Okay?

872
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,190
I have important things to talk.

873
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,420
Just leave. Hurry.

874
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,670
Feng, say something for me.

875
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,420
Didn't you promise to vouch for me?

876
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,150
Don't you see boss is busy?

877
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,270
Just take the amount he gives you.

878
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,090
How can you be like this?

879
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,590
I won't cover for you next time.

880
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,070
What's wrong with you two?

881
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,470
Covering for what?

882
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,320
Feng, I'm not blaming you.

883
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,750
Can you be serious?

884
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,790
Your family is a mess.

885
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,990
Your factory would've gone bankrupt without your wife.

886
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,990
Mr. Wu, I'm leaving.

887
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,310
You guys continue.

888
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,750
Mr. Zhao.

889
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,720
-Mr. Zhao. -I mean...

890
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,350
Mr. Zhao.

891
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,030
Mr. Wu.

892
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,070
You two...

893
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,470
My important matter gets screwed up because of you!

894
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Mr. Wu, you...

895
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,240
What's wrong with you?

896
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,310
How can you be like this?

897
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,510
Wait, I was helping you with your matters...

898
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,230
W-W-Why would you mention my...

899
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,430
Tell me, what should I do with the money?

900
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,310
W-W-Why would you mention my affair...

901
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,990
You stepped on me...

902
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,230
Damn Qiu.

903
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,180
So ruthless!

904
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,230
Paper.

905
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:48,610
How about

906
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,690
going to the hospital?

907
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:51,910
It's okay.

908
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,490
Isn't that Qiu Bizheng's car?

909
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,830
Go see it.

910
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,780
Be polite.

911
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,260
Go.

912
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,330
Where is Mr. Guo?

913
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,070
He's resting in his room.

914
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,030
He fell down

915
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,420
and broke his nose.

916
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:33,910
Brother.

917
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,070
What is this?

918
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,750
The dishes Mr. Qiu brought.

919
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,230
Is this a place for putting dishes?

920
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:38,940
Take them down.

921
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,830
Don't think that I appreciate it

922
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,670
that you hide the fact

923
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,310
that I beat you from your families.

924
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,110
Why are you standing here?

925
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,550
Get out.

926
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,360
You traitor!

927
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,890
You ungrateful bastard!

928
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,870
You haven't made it clear yet.

929
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,110
You just leave

930
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,390
and quit?

931
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,650
What do you want?

932
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,020
What do you want to eat?

[Banxia Steel Co., LTD.]

935
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:35,910
Hello.

936
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,300
Who are you looking for?

937
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,140
This is my dad.

938
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,950
Is he your employee?

939
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,480
You're so busy.

940
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,800
Even a junk store owner can own a company.

941
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,590
What do you mean?

942
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,270
Write...

943
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,430
Write what?

944
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,660
IOU.

945
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,250
Write as I say.

946
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,400
IOU.

947
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,640
I hereby acknowledge myself to be indebted to Xu Youren

948
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,750
in the sum of RMB300,000.

949
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,290
The debt must be paid back within half a year

950
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,650
with the interest of RMB30,000,

951
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,680
coming to a grand total of RMB330,000.

952
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,560
If I can't pay it back before the due date,

953
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,710
I shall be at the creditor's disposal.

954
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,550
Name, Xu Banxia.

955
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,470
Yes, date, date.

956
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:44,470
And this...

957
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,560
Are you really my father?

958
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,990
Yes, of course.

959
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,500
This is the due procedure.

960
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,820
Get some water.

961
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,070
Money.

962
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,690
Do you have money here?

963
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,650
The Real Estate Ownership Certificate.

964
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,870
The Real Estate Ownership Certificate?

965
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,670
Yes.

966
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,850
Why are you looking at me like this?

967
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,980
Qian's mother gave me the money.

968
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,020
I have to get the certificate back as she requires it,

969
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,620
right?

970
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,060
Otherwise, I can't explain where the money is.

971
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,760
You're making things difficult for me!

972
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,330
How would I?

973
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,720
We've been living in the house...

974
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,590
But you came to make a scene...

975
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,390
Look, who's making things difficult?

976
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,790
Yes, you've been living happily there.

977
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,590
But I didn't really do anything to you either.

978
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,490
We've indeed been in the house,

979
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,970
but your messing around

980
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,550
can affect my family's happiness.

981
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,900
Do you know what this is called?

982
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,480
Selfish.

983
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,150
You only think about yourself.

984
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,000
You never thought about others' feelings.

985
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,100
Have you ever thought for me?

986
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,140
Of course I have.

987
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,260
You're a boss

988
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,120
and have an office.

989
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,220
And our family needs to count on you.

990
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,320
This is your ability.

991
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,000
So I must do anything for you just because I'm capable?

992
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,380
Is this what you think?

993
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,440
Buy whatever you want.

994
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,610
I've even been giving you money each month.

995
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,720
I owe you?

996
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,270
Child, you can't say that.

997
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,020
Every family is like this.

998
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,070
Or why do parents raise children?

999
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,370
-You... -Tong.

1000
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,280
Go buy a pack of cigarettes.

1001
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:01,770
Thank you.

1002
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,540
He doesn't smoke this.

1003
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,650
Go buy it.

1004
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,290
That's enough.

1005
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,750
Look at the guys you hire!

1006
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,740
They are all good people.

1007
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,770
Much better than you.

1008
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,480
Fine, good people.

1009
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,670
Let's not talk about this.

1010
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,190
What about the Real Estate Ownership Certificate?

1011
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,930
Don't think about it.

1012
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,170
That was the last thing

1013
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,220
that my mom left to me.

1014
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,270
I won't give it to you.

1015
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:29,740
Look at you.

1016
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,380
How can you be so stubborn?

1017
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,710
I'm your father.

1018
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,470
How about this?

1019
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,180
I can take a step back

1020
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,960
and act like a parent.

1021
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,950
It doesn't matter if you won't give me the Real Estate Ownership Certificate,

1022
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:46,950
but,

1023
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,260
write another piece of paper.

1024
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,490
Like this.

1025
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,220
You can write like this.

1026
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,030
If I can't pay the debt in time,

1027
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,260
the property right of the house

1028
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,650
in which Xu Youren has been living

1029
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,380
shall be mortgaged to him.

1030
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Is this okay?

1031
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,910
You also need to mortgage

1032
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,490
for loans from banks.

1033
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,750
If you don't do so, I really can't go back.

1034
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,940
Then I have to stay here tonight.

1035
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,950
Are you determined to take this house?

1036
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:10,630
Yes.

1037
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,000
OK.

1038
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,430
I have a compromise plan too.

1039
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,040
Go ahead.

1040
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,430
I'll mortgage the house to you.

1041
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,480
But I don't want 0.3 million.

1042
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,570
Then how much do you want?

1043
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,650
0.5 million.

1044
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,830
Are you forcing me to sell my kidney?

1045
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,250
I've been asking for 0.5 million.

1046
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,400
The interest can be calculated as you required.

1047
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,950
I'll pay you back 0.55 million.

1048
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,320
And I won't accept other plans.

1049
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,500
Chief, it's hard to do business nowadays.

1050
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,160
We sincerely want

1051
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,820
to build the storage yard.

1052
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,960
Besides, we'll also need workers

1053
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,270
for future constructions.

1054
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,760
We'll certainly hire the villagers

1055
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,070
in this village first.

1056
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,350
For this mudflat,

1057
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,220
it can't be used for farming

1058
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,040
or anything else.

1059
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,490
Why don't you rent it to me?

1060
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,520
If I can work well for 10 or 20 years here in the future,

1061
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,060
then both of us will make a fortune.

1062
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,070
At that time, everyone will praise you wherever you go.

1063
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,350
As for this land,

1064
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,630
I've told Mr. Chen,

1065
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,400
it's a collective land.

1066
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,950
Anyway,

1067
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,260
I can rent it.

1068
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,870
We're encouraged to reform. And it should be open and flexible.

1069
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,730
It's just that we are not very satisfied

1070
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,260
with the price.

1071
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,840
Chief, if you don't rent it to us,

1072
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,860
it will just be a wasteland.

1073
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,350
I'm not blaming you.

1074
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,560
You're not sincere at all.

1075
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,480
Your boss is her.

1076
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,590
Why are you talking to me?

1077
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,250
Just tell us how much you want.

1078
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,650
At least 0.5 million.

1079
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,530
Otherwise, we won't rent it.

1080
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,940
Yes, at least 0.5 million.

1081
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,950
Otherwise, we won't rent it.

1082
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,490
Otherwise, we won't rent it.

1083
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,050
Really want to break his teeth!

1084
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,250
Sly old devil!

1085
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,350
From tomorrow on, I'll keep watch at the village entrance.

1086
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,440
Anyone else wanting to rent it

1087
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,130
don't even think about entering the village.

1088
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,910
If the mudflat gets polluted,

1089
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,350
no one else would want to rent it.

1090
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,230
How to do it?
