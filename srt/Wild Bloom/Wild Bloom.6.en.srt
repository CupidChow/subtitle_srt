Mr. Zhao,

Do you know why Ms. Xu

174
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,340
made such a big,

175
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,260
grand scene today?

176
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,140
It is because she wants to thank you.

177
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,450
Mr. Qiu, don't talk like that.

178
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,770
That's a different matter.

179
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,130
This storage yard

180
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,030
was built by Ms. Xu on her own.

181
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,420
I didn't pay a penny

182
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
nor did I do anything.

183
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,230
Besides,

184
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,500
all your goods need to be put here

185
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,260
in the future.

186
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,820
Exactly.

187
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,540
So, if you want to express gratitude,

188
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,960
thank Ms. Xu instead.

189
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,690
Let's go. You're all seniors in the industry,

190
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,400
I'll go after you.

191
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,260
You go first please.

192
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,780
Please come inside.

193
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
After you.

194
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,020
Please come inside.

195
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,420
You know what?

196
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,740
We're gaining advantages because of you.

197
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,340
Don't say that.

198
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,940
Everyone, please come up on stage.

199
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,370
Let me take a photo for you.

200
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,110
After you.

201
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,060
How can I...

202
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,260
Your red envelope is the thickest.

203
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,770
It's time. Let's go. Let's go together.

204
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,820
Let's go.

205
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,680
Stand here please.

206
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,420
No, I can't.

207
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,340
You are the owner.

208
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,540
Come on. Stop being humble.

209
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,900
Look at me.

210
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,980
Three, two, one.

211
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,680
[Happy Opening of Binhai Banxia Storage Yard]

212
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,580
Why are you still here?

213
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm going to the bank. I'll be right back.

214
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,180
See you at the office.

215
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,870
Take care.

216
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,940
Mr. Zhao, don't you want to stay for dinner?

217
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,260
No, thank you.

218
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,340
You've got your hands full here.

219
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,820
This is not the time to celebrate.

220
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,530
Maybe next time.

221
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,820
Well...

222
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Okay.

223
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,900
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

224
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,730
I won't let you down.

225
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,680
Looking forward to our pleasant cooperation.

226
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,580
Me too! Thank you!

227
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,310
Goodbye.

228
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,160
Take care, Mr. Zhao.

229
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,440
Let's go.

230
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,180
Ms. Xu.

231
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,660
Mr. Guo, you're still here.

232
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,590
Well...

233
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,340
I just looked around.

234
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,600
Your storage yard is in such a big scale.

235
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,230
Do you have problems with the funds?

236
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,020
As you know,

237
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,240
storage yard operation always needs money.

238
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,820
I see.

239
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,820
I have 500,000 yuan.

240
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,520
I wonder whether you need it.

241
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,580
We are friends,

242
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,810
so I'm always willing to help.

243
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,070
You mean...

244
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,490
I just want to earn some interest on that money.

245
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,010
But 500,000 yuan is not enough now.

246
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,160
We need...

247
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,640
at least one million yuan.

248
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,900
One million...

249
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,070
If you don't have enough money,

250
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,700
don't force yourself.

251
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,590
Don't worry, Ms. Xu,

252
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,480
I'll try my best.

253
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,990
But there's one thing, Ms. Xu.

254
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,160
My interest cannot be under-calculated.

255
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,940
No problem. If you can give me one million yuan,

256
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,740
I'll pay you back with interest

257
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,740
after purchasing more scrap iron.

258
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,020
Deal.

259
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,780
Deal.

260
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,840
Let's go and write a load receipt in the office.

261
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,790
Okay. After you.

262
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,300
Let's go.

263
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,850
After you.

264
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,260
Can't believe it,

265
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,510
Guo Qidong the bastard,

266
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,550
could take out one million yuan at will.

267
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,400
How much on earth did he cheat Qiu Bizheng?

268
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,270
Have you calculated it?

269
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,290
How much money need to be paid tomorrow?

270
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,160
Right away.

271
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,000
Fatty,

272
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,570
what should we eat for dinner?

273
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,840
Instant noodles. We have instant noodles.

274
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,060
Today is our opening day. We should eat something nice to celebrate.

275
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,840
Just the two of us, no need to bother.

276
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,220
Fatty,

277
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,260
I...

278
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,720
have something serious to talk with you.

279
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,750
Look.

280
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,080
At the moment,

281
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,470
you're going to purchase scrap iron,

282
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,600
and we need to build the storage yard as soon as possible.

283
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,740
I'm afraid I can't handle it on my own.

284
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,510
Why don't we ask Xiaoqi to come back?

285
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,560
Just for a few days, okay?

286
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,860
I'll treat him just as an employee.

287
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,240
I'll pay him every day.

288
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,850
I don't understand.

289
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,210
Why don't you agree?

290
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,790
Do you know who the drivers are

291
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,210
that help out in the storage yard every day?

292
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
They are here because of Xiaoqi.

293
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,790
They are his brothers.

294
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,540
They work here for free every day.

295
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,720
Otherwise, how can I afford to hire them?

296
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,730
Fatty, don't be so heartless.

297
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,700
When a man makes a mistake,

298
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,460
there is always a time limit to his sentence, right?

299
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,550
It is because you didn't ask him to come back,

300
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,300
We can't even take a photo together at the opening today.

301
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,780
What's the point

302
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,020
to just be with those bastards?

303
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,140
I'm tired of those fake smiles.

304
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
It should be the three of us

305
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,110
to cut the ribbon and announce the opening of our storage yard today.

306
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,090
Fatty,

307
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,940
Fatty, listen.

308
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,020
Fatty, where are you going?

309
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,470
Fatty.

310
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,080
Fatty.

311
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,140
What are they doing?

312
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,340
Why are you looking at me?

313
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,250
I have no idea.

314
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,990
But obviously they're here to congratulate us.

315
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,300
We open the door for business.

316
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,820
Whoever comes is our guest. You have to take it.

317
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,160
Crazy.

318
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,910
Bring the plaque here.

319
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,710
Stand still.

320
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,030
Say something.

321
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,850
Good evening, boss.

322
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,520
What else?

323
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,380
Congratulations, boss.

324
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,250
Wish your business boom and bring your prosperity.

325
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,680
Wonderful!

326
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,150
Tong Xiaoqi, you're such an idiot.

327
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,940
Stop doing this nonsense,

328
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,980
and get down to business.

329
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,390
This is exactly my business.

330
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:07,840
Boss,

331
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,310
Here is the money we've made after our fleet is open for business.

332
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,000
You must accept it,

333
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,010
no matter for celebration or appreciation.

334
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,260
Xiaoqi makes his own money.

335
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,500
This is the first time he gives us red envelopes, isn't it?

336
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
We have to take it.

337
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Come on.

338
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,780
Today is a meaningful day.

339
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,590
We must have a meal together to celebrate, right?

340
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,730
Yes.

341
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,700
Alright, go back to work.

342
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay.

343
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,440
Let's go.

344
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,620
What are you thinking about? Why must we have a meal?

345
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,240
It's common practice to have a meal after moving,

346
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,620
not to mention opening of new business.

347
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,390
Boss, the storage yard

348
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,980
is officially in business now.

349
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,670
I believe it will be more and more booming.

350
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,400
Yes, more and more booming.

351
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,780
You just said you wanted to save money.

352
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,400
With him...

353
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,660
I won't spend a penny for this meal.

354
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,880
I'm going to help.

355
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,430
Wildcat, come with me.

356
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,050
What?

357
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,660
Come and help.

358
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,950
Come with me.

359
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,650
Go and help.

360
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,140
Boss, where should I put it?

361
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,820
Just put it on the floor.

362
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,480
It looks quite festive.

363
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,120
Boss,

364
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,510
I know I was wrong.

365
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,030
You've hit me and scolded me.

366
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,120
Please forgive me.

367
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,310
Don't be mad at me anymore.

368
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,960
I know you spent a lot of money dealing with it,

369
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,780
and kept comforting those people.

370
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,880
I was too impulsive.

371
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,780
I was immature. I was a jerk.

372
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,960
I apologize.

373
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,550
The society has changed now.

374
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,640
Everyone has to follow the rules.

375
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,640
You can't always

376
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,390
do whatever you want,

377
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,860
and I can't always protect you.

378
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,810
It's not about whether I forgive you or not.

379
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,790
I just can't get over it.

380
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,260
You are not mad at me anymore, aren't you?

381
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,670
If not, just hit me again.

382
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,650
You idiot.

383
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,180
How is your fleet business?

384
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,580
Great. We have a lot of work to do every day.

385
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,630
Who is that girl?

386
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,940
This way.

387
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,070
Just a friend.

388
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,020
What's her name?

389
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,480
Wildcat.

390
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,980
Wildcat?

391
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,390
I'm asking her name.

392
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,370
Gao Xinyi.

393
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,220
Is she the girl

394
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,420
who always called you?

395
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,640
Why does she always follow you around?

396
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,100
She said she often quarreled with her mother,

397
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,440
and then she ran out.

398
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,660
With nowhere to go,

399
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,830
She came to me.

400
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,940
I just want to do something good.

401
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,140
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

402
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,900
It is not easy for a girl

403
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,280
to follow you around in the fleet every day.

404
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,720
Be nice to her.

405
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,700
Okay, I will.

406
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,580
Let's go for dinner. Everything is ready.

407
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,100
Let's go.

408
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,950
Ask someone to hang it up later.

409
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,620
Be careful.

410
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,660
Okay, I got it.

411
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,710
Boss, say something.

412
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,730
It's your big day today.

413
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,060
Yes. Say something.

414
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,870
Guys, stop eating.

415
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,780
Let our boss say something.

416
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,210
Okay.

417
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,940
Guys,

418
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,930
the storage yard is finally built.

419
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,070
I know

420
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,560
you all made great contributions.

421
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,600
In the past,

422
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,250
If I did something wrong,

423
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,260
I am here to apologize.

424
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,440
Please forgive me.

425
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,160
Hope we can understand each other.

426
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,300
In the future,

427
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,530
with our company getting more developed,

428
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,340
and our scale getting bigger.

429
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,620
I promise, in the company,

430
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,350
we will share opportunities together,

431
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,660
and make money together.

432
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,270
Let's make a fortune together.

433
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,940
Great! Wonderful!

434
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,660
Thank you, boss.

435
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,540
Cheers.

436
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,630
Cheers.

Okay.

442
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,380
Next, Zhao Zongxian.

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,200
How much?

444
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,100

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,140
120 yuan.

446
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,920
How much did you get?

447
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,490
A lot. My treat tonight.

448

Cool, let's drink tonight.

449
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:54,770

Li Guangqing.

451
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,780
Li Guangqing.

452
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,170
125 yuan. Please count it.

453
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,680
Next.

454
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,900
Next.

455
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,550
Gao Jinxi.

456
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,790
Here you are.

457
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,460
100 yuan.

458
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,580
100 yuan.

459
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,330
Please sign here.

460
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,500
President Gao.

461
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,150
What brings you here?

462
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,790
Are you Xu Banxia?

463
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,500
Yes.

464
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,570
I have investigated you.

465
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,540
You run a small company,

466
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,040
buying and selling scrap medal.

467
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,900
Where is Tong Xiaoqi?

468
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,950
You are looking for Tong Xiaoqi?

469
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,820
Where is Tong Xiaoqi,

470
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,490
a released prisoner and also your employee?

471
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,910
He's not here today.

472
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,740
You can talk to me.

473
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,570
I'm his leader.

474
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,660
You are his leader, right?

475
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,180
Where did he go?

476
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,780
He is in the fleet most of the time.

477
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,360
The fleet is not here either.

478
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,460
Then go and find the fleet.

479
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,410
This is outrageous.

480
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,870
Your employee doesn't do proper business.

481
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,500
What kind of leader are you?

482
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,720
If something really happens,

483
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,530
can you take the responsibility?

484
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm telling you, you can't.

485
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,070
You...

486
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,720
President Gao.

487
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,100
President Gao.

488
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,270
Did he offend you?

489
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,580
Or did he make trouble again?

490
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,230
Are you coming or not?

491
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,370
Come on. Come on.

492
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,610
Take it easy.

493
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,530
Hurry up.

494
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,610
Play your card.

495
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,030
Can you afford it?

496
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,690
Can you?

497
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,670
Of course.

498
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,140
Blow you up!

499
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,270
How about that?

500
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:39,950
Come on.

501
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,980
Thriple Kings.

502
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,180
Can anyone afford it?

503
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,650
Anyone?

504
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,810
Two Jokers.

505
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,130
Put it on his face.

506
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,430
Put it on.

507
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,070
Come on.

508
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,170
Come on.

509
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,590
Why you got all those good cards.

510
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,140
Put it on. Hurry up.

511
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
You are so bad at this.

512
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,690
Tong Xiaoqi.

513
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,090
Boss.

514
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,260
Mother.

515
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,260
Why are you here?

516
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,660
Come here.

517
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,570
I've told you,

518
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,460
don't make trouble.

519
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,330
I'm going on a business trip.

520
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,390
Don't make trouble.

521
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,100
What are you doing

522
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,020
instead of working hard?

523
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,900
Nothing. Just playing cards.

524
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,670
If I didn't stop her,

525
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,140
she would call the police, do you know?

526
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,550
Her mother is so mean.

527
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,360
Why don't you go to work?

528
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,350
Let me explain to her mother.

529
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:36,930
Come here.

530
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,620
Your manager

531
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,620
called me several times.

532
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,110
Why don't you go to work?

533
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,490
Do you know who her mother is?

534
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,020
Who?

535
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,550
Vice President of Provincial Heavy Industrial Development Committee.

536
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,090
What does she do?

537
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,340
I rely on her to make a living.

538
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,540
If she's unhappy,

539
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,020
she would crush me to death.

540
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,040
You can never offend her mother.

541
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,360
Neither can I.

542
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,040
I just don't want to go, okay?

543
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
I finished a whole week's work

544
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,470
in one morning.

545
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,950
For the rest of my time I just sat there with nothing to do.

546
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,630
You want me to muddle along till death?

547
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,230
It's not fun at all.

548
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,860
What kind of fun do you want?

549
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,900
You can mess with anyone but her daughter.

550
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,520
I have no idea about who she is.

551
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,670
She didn't tell me what her mother does,

552
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,850
nor where she lives.

553
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,310
Besides, I didn't hire her.

554
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,840
She ran away from home and came to me.

555
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,500
I can't leave her behind without loyalty.

556
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,500
Alright.

557
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,850
Everyone has to work, to make a living.

558
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,170
Do you know how hard it is to get this job?

559
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,640
Do you know how many people

560
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,030
would compete at any cost just for this job?

561
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,490
Why don't you cherish it?

562
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,230
You silly girl.

563
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,740
Perfect. Whoever wants it can take it.

564
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:34,850
I don't want this job.

565
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,090
Then what do you want?

566
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,130
I don't want to do anything.

567
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,630
I just don't want to live like that.

568
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,570
My life will be ruined.

569
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,980
Playing cards won't ruin your life?

570
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,410
Her mother is so mean.

571
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,750
As mean as you.

572
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm sorry.

573
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,600
Are you trying to piss me off?

574
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,390
You're a girl.

575
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,310
How dare you to stay out all night.

576
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,900
Where did you go at night?

577
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,560
Your grandparents couldn't fall asleep.

578
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,190
They asked me if you had money,

579
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,150
what did you eat,

580
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,540
and if you were cold?

581
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,920
They called me and asked

582
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,630
where Gao Xinyi is.

583
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
How am I supposed to answer?

584
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:27,990
Mother...

585
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,580
Thank you.

586
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,740
They're dancing.

587
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,430
It looks Interesting. I'm going to have a look.

588
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,580
Let... let me pass through first.

589
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,800
Xu, let's get out of the train and do some exercises.

590
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,920
It's quite crowded.

591
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
Hurry up.

592
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,150
Let's buy some food.

593
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,190
Let me make a call first.

594
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,720
[Erenhot Station]

595
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,500
This is Erenhot.

596
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,590
Yes.

597
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,610
Thank you.

598
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,350
It's full of people.

599
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
Come on. Watch your step.

600
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,280
What are they doing?

601
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,790
It's said that they're doing radio gymnastics.

602
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,740
I have no idea. They...

603
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,690
They even exercise when the train stops.

604
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,430
That's to make passengers...

605
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,580
Can you jump?

606
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,700
Yes.

607
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,420
Well, we...

608
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,470
It's finished.

609
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,140
Boss.

610
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,750
We're going abroad soon.

611
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,480
Let's take a photo together.

612
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,510
Yes, let's take a photo.

613
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,450
Where's Feng Yu?

614
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,320
We need someone to take photos for us.

615
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,140
Feng.

616
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,720
Feng.

617
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,900
Stop calling. Let's take a photo together.

618
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,370
Hurry up.

619
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,580
Come on, take a photo.

620
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
You can speak Chinese?

621
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,690
What are you doing?

622
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,040
How could you compete with a girl like me?

623
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,890
Ready?

624
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,590
I'll shout "one, two, three", and you'll shout "Cheese".

625
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,830
Okay.

626
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,970
One, two, three.

627
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
Cheese.

628
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:35,950
Perfect.

629
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,650
Thank you.

630
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,120
You speak really good Chinese.

631
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,500
Because I live near Northeast China.

632
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,420
Your Chinese is very good.

633
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,150
Bye.

634
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,590
Bye.

635
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,850
You guys get on the train first.

636
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,660
Come here, Xu, I have something to tell you.

637
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,420
What's wrong?

638
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,860
There are too many people in the train.

639
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,100
It is not the right place to talk.

640
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,100
Well, we've...

641
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,440
discussed it again.

642
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,420
Your share is still 5,000 tons.

643
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,900
Why?

644
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,340
Mr. Wu, you promised me before.

645
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,860
I've prepared a bank draft

646
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,930
for 15,000 yuan.

647
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,360
You can't buy that much.

648
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,690
5,000 tons is all you can have.

649
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,640
If you want more, you're occupying other people's shares.

650
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,970
You don't have to tell me.

651
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,890
I knew the Westerner must lend you the money.

652
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,700
Who lends me the money...

653
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,930
Does it matter?

654
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,060
Of course it does.

655
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,050
Why don't you understand?

656
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,740
In this way,

657
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,730
you're actually running errands for the Westerner.

658
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,910
They'll have the right to decide the price.

659
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,460
Even if I give you 800,000 tons,

660
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,190
are you sure you can make money?

661
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,550
I am kind enough

662
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,260
not to say that

663
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,090
you betrayed us.

664
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,790
Alright, no more discussion.

665
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,620
Just 5,000 tons.

666
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,110
Mr. Wu, I've always viewed you as my boss.

667
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,700
You've been taking care of me

668
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,080
since I entered this industry.

669
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,710
I've been working with you

670
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,820
for so many years.

671
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,070
Please help me out,

672
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,580
for once.

673
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,320
You've already brought me here, right?

674
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,410
I believe what you said

675
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,640
is definitely not what you think.

676
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,490
It must be Qiu Bizheng's idea.

677
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,620
Do you really believe in them?

678
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,260
They simply don't want to lose faces.

679
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,660
They're afraid I'll buy more than they do.

680
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
You can't listen to them.

681
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,220
I know you are the fairest.

682
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,720
I'm sure you don't think like that.

683
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,460
Please tell me what you think. I'll listen to you.

684
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,400
Boss, please...

685
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,460
To be honest,

686
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,790
I agree with

687
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,300
their opinions.

688
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,270
Xu, don't be too naive.

689
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,900
Think about it. In this industry,

690
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,350
we've been working

691
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,180
longer than you, right?

692
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,270
Why didn't the Westerner

693
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,700
give me a penny,

694
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,900
but gave you that much instead?

695
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,140
Because they think you're stupid.

696
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,980
Don't simply believe that

697
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,970
whoever gives you the money is a good person.

698
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,320
Listen to me.

699
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,930
We're not afraid of those apparent bad people,

700
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,610
but those hypocritical people

701
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,750
who do ill in secret.

702
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,650
Take my advice.

703
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,050
We're on the same side.

704
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,420
Mr. Wu.

705
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,220

Cheers.

708

Wish you good luck for your new business.

709
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,460
Okay, thank you.

710
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,060
Excuse me.

711
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,700
No problem.

712
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,520
I haven't heard from you for days.

713
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,950
I thought I'd be leaving the country soon.

714
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,670
I'm in Erenhot.

715
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,640
The train will leave at 2 a.m.

716
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,870
With so much money on you,

717
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,880
you must be careful.

718
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,430
Don't worry. Even if I die outside,

719
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,050
I will give you the money back.

720
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,970
Don't say that.

721
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,350
Listen to me.

722
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,070
No matter it's about money or share,

723
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,330
just call me

724
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,230
if you have any problem.

725
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,290
They don't...

726
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,540
don't allow me to buy that much.

727
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,860
They don't allow you to buy more?

728
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,660
How about this?

729
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,540
Tell them

730
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,420
you represent me.

731
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,730
If they mess with you, they are messing with me.

732
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,300
Tell them exactly what I said.

733
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,030
Okay, I got it.

734
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,740
Please take the medicine first.

735
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Okay?

736
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,020
No, it's too hot.

737
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,020
Wait a minute.

738
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:54,530
Let's keep playing.

739
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,890
Xu is there alone in a daze.

740
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,680
In my opinion,

741
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,940
we might have gone too far.

742
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,260
After all, she's a girl.

743
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,780
Can she handle it?

744
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Maybe at the very beginning,

745
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,830
we shouldn't have brought her here.

746
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,350
Otherwise,

747
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,790
everyone won't be so embarrassed now.

748
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,200
This is not your fault, okay?

749
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,110
We are not in Binhai,

750
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,310
but in another country.

751
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,790
We should be united.

752
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,690
Don't be so sarcastic.

753
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,170
I think Mr. Wu is right.

754
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:27,820
One Jack.

755
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:28,820
Blow it up.

756
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,600
I didn't say who's right.

757
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,630
I didn't say anything about Mr. Wu either.

758
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,650
I was wondering

759
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,740
whether we could solve this problem in a more suitable way.

760
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,770
What do you mean by 'suitable'?

761
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,460
Why don't you come up with a 'suitable' way?

762
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,260
I don't want to be the villain either.

763
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,700
How many times have I persuaded her?

764
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,780
Let me show you a trick.

765
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,620
It is actually very easy

766
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,510
if you want to play the role of a good man,

767
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,450
just give your shares to her.

768
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,080
That's it.

769
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,380
Why can't you just shut up?

770
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,700
What?

771
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,830
Three pairs.

772
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,860
Can't afford it.

Xu.

775

Come and play for me for a while.

776
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,620
I need to go to the toilet.

777
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,780
Come, Xu.

778
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,650
Let me take a look.

779
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,230
What's wrong?

780
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,870
Do you feel wronged?

781
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,910
I heard what you said.

782
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,980
We were just chatting.

783
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,330
Don't take it to heart.

784
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,700
After all, we need to count on Mr. Wu

785
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,490
for our business.

786
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,970
So, we should listen to him anyhow.

787
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,540
It's not easy for us to come here.

788
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,730
Don't make everyone feel unhappy.

789
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,310
Okay?

790
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,380
Let's forget about the share.

791
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,350
It's over. Don't mention it again.

792
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,230
Why don't you give me some of your shares?

793
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,220
If you talk like this,

794
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,510
I won't help you anymore.

795
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,570
It's over, okay?

796
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,220
Just saying 'it's over' doesn't mean it's really over.

797
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,949
What do you know about it?

798
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,610
Let's talk about it when we arrive.

00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,370
Didn't you take her back?

804
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,190
I'm asking you.

805
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,790
No, she isn't.

806
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Then where would she go?

807

your mother is looking for you.

Alright.

854
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,830
You two can go back.

855
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,660
Tell them we've found her.

856
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:03,540
Let's go.

857
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:03,880
Okay.

858
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,860
♫Your gentle sweetness♫

00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,810
What a coincidence

879
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,790
What a coincidence?

880
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,980
I've been looking for you all day.

881
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,250
Do you know

882
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,500
your mother came to my place for you again?

883
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,680
Your mother came to me for you.

884
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,920
I have no idea what happened.

885
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,990
You're so ungrateful.

886
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,770
What do you mean?

887
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,180
You should at least tell me about it.

888
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,600
I was like a fool.

889
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,270
♫Your gentle sweetness♫

890
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,420
I got scolded for no reason.

891
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,880
♫Is like a bird flying in the sky♫

892
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,120
To be honest

893
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,530
♫Only because♫

894
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,870
I've been looking for you,

895
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,040
♫I'm in love with you and you're in love with me♫

896
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,420
and I've searched everywhere.

897
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,490
If I can't find you,

898
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,800
♫Your eyes♫

899
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,250
I may instead feel relieved.

900
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,560
♫My tears♫

901
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,610
Enough.

902
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,000
♫It's precious even if it's painful♫

903
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,780
I wanted to go to your place.

904
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,260
But I thought

905
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,630
♫Only because♫

906
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,540
my mother would definitely go there for me,

907
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,580
then I didn't want to go,

908
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:18,710
♫You're by my side♫

909
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,700
and I didn't call you.

910
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,930
Besides,

911
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,520
it's just a few words of scolding.

912
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,600
So what?

913
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,410
Are you angry?

914
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,700
I don't understand.

915
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,470
Why you always run away from home?

916
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,830
What's wrong again?

917
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:37,780
I resigned.

918
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,780
It's true this time.

919
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,460
Let me tell you in advance.

920
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,700
The conditions are a bit simple here.

921
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,850
Just make do with it for one night.

922
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
Look at you.

923
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,150
Running away from home

924
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,700
without bringing your ID card.

925
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,710
It's common sense to bring your ID card when you go out. How can you forget it?

926
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,730
What would you do without me today?

927
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:00,900
Enough.

928
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,100
You've been nagging all the way.

929
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,670
I know. I'll bring it next time.

930
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,310
Where should I sleep?

931
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,540
How about you sleep in my room and I sleep on the sofa?

932
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,120
It's inappropriate for me

933
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,860
to sleep in your room, on your bed.

934
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,100
I'll sleep on the sofa. Just make do with it.

935
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,500
Fine, you can sleep wherever you want.

936
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,030
Can you chat with me for a while?

937
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,390
I can't fall asleep.

938
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,270
If you wanted to resign, then just resign.

939
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,380
Why did you run away from home?

940
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,400
My mother arranged that job for me, you understand?

941
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,300
So what?

942
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,070
What kind of job is it?

943
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,250
It's about international trade.

944
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,580
Sounds good.

945
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,630
Is it because you can't do that?

946
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,830
How dare you to look down on me?

947
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,000
That was my major back in college.

948
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,190
It's totally different between 'you can't do' and 'you don't want to do'.

949
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,520
Why don't you want to do it?

950
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,860
Every day when I go to work

951
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,260
and see those faces in the office,

952
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,630
I feel like my mother is behind me.

953
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,080
How am I supposed to work in that kind of situation?

954
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,620
Besides,

955
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,900
that's as far as her generation could go.

956
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,120
If I do the job she arranged for me,

957
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,330
that's probably the furthest I could go.

958
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,140
I don't mean their lives are not good enough.

959
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,430
I just feel like

960
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,420
I can see

961
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,690
what I'll be like in 20 years.

962
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,860
Do you think it's still worth to work hard?

963
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Would you do it if you were me?

964
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:14,590
Of course yes.

965
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,000
Isn't it good to have a job?

966
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,240
Not to mention a stable one.

967
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,080
And...international, right?

968
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,060
Go and get me a quilt.

969
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:31,070
Go.
