It's a good idea to invest the money in Xu Banxia.

It's reliable.

Did she agree to take your money?

She didn't at first.

The company is busy with shipments at the end of the year.

I and Xinyi

83
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,130
should have gone back together to tell you.

84
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,860
Have you thought

85
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,510
that Gao Xinyi rushes to get married

86
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,340
only because she wants to make you relived

87
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,930
before she goes abroad?

88
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,610
If that's the case,

89
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,580
are you still willing to do so?

90
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,950
You know that I will go abroad with her.

91
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,110
So it doesn't matter if it's the case.

92
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,860
I just think

93
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,760
we should get married.

94
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
That's why I made the decision.

95
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,800
So...

96
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,870
A marriage

97
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360
is not the same as a date.

98
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,250
It's about living a life together.

99
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,840
Food, oil and salt, three meals a day.

100
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,050
There are bound to be bumps and bruises.

101
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,100
You must tolerate and understand each other.

102
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,540
I'll remember that.

103
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,690
Do it.

104
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,510
I was the one who took care of Gao Xinyi

105
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,270
in her first 20 years.

106
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,970
After this,

107
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,920
I'll leave her to you.

108
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,039
Take care of her.

109
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,179
Can I trust you?

110
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,230
I'll leave you to your work.

111

Don't worry about the fees.

119
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,200
Dong has already told me.

120
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,520
It will only increase, not decrease.

121

There are few people in the factory.

124

Waste no time and shoot it.

125
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,900

It's been a long time since we stopped production.

136
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,760
If we don't start work,

137
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,030
I'll go bankrupt.

138
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,380
I mean.

139
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,330
The investigation takes time.

140
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,440
Can we do this?

141
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,740
Let the investigation team investigate our factory first.

142
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,180
After the investigation, we will start working.

143
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm not...

144
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm not mad.

145
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,430
This is how it is.

146
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,780
You…

147
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,670
I did take over it.

148
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,870
But in the end,

149
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,140
the factory belongs to the province too.

150
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,830
You are its original owner.

151
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,690
You can't just marry off your daughter

152
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,970
and don't care about it if something happens.

153
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:58,720
Besides...

154
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,450
Hello? Hello?

155
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,240
Are you here to pay off?

156
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,020
You can report me for misappropriation of public funds.

157
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,710
But you should also check your accounts.

158
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,650
What are you doing?

159
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
20 million yuan. Let me go.

160

I... I don't have

162
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,090
any money now.

163
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,250
You know the situation of the factory.

164
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,330
Ten days, 20 million yuan.

165
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,230
If I can't get the money,

166
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,160
don't blame me for being ruthless.

167
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,510
I have no money.

168
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,010
Mom! Mom!

169
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,130
This one has burnt off.

170
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,950
Okay, let me get you another one.

171
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,260
Hello?

172
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,370
Hello?

173
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,140
Daughter.

174
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,480
Happy New Year.

175
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,580
Dad.

176
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,340
Happy New Year.

177
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,100
Happy New Year.

178
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,840
Wildcat?

179
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,390
That's a very special name.

180
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,810
So are you a secretary, a driver?

181
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,220
Or vice president?

182
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,850
I'm unemployed.

183
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,810
I came here for the free dinner.

184
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,690
Why are you so grumpy?

185
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,110
I'm just grumpy, so what?

186
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,850
Who dares to marry you

187
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,370
in the future?

188
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,740
You're not going to marry me?

189
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,570
Why do you stay with me?

190
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,720
It's hard and tiring.

191
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,050
I'm happy to. Why do you care?

192
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,940
Do you like me or not?

193
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,400
I like you.

194
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,700
You're looking for a boyfriend, not a father.

195
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,770
So I won't put up with everything in the future.

196
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,930
When are you going to marry me?

197
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,730
Do you plan to marry me?

198
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,500
When will you propose to me?

199
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,600
Marry Wildcat.

200
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,310
Treat her well.

201
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,280
have a baby with Wildcat

202
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,510
When he grows up

203
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,970
Wildcat will tutor him in required courses,

204
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,550
and I'll teach him the football.

205
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,070
Don't cry.

206
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,830
Or your makeup will be ruined.

207
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,810
Bravo!

208
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,310
Bravo!

209
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,650
We'll get one ring if it's for a proposal.

210
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,220
Couple rings for a wedding.

211
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,360
I thought about it.

212
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,400
Let's just go with couple rings.

213
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,840
All those who are not married come up.

214
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,640
Sister.

215
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,310
Come on up.

216
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,700
You're not married, are you? Come on up.

217
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,490
Miss Xu, come on up.

218
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,370
You can't be missing from this kind of occasion.

219
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,100
Go, go, go.

220
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,800
You're the one who's missing. Hurry.

221
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,750
You're the one who's missing.

222
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,340
Stand still.

223
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,020
Right here.

224
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,540
Don't move.

225
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,220
-Stand still. -Don't move.

226
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,650
All right.

227
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,900
I'm going to throw it.

228
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,170
Ready?

229
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,140
Okay. Okay.

230
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,680
One, two, three.

231
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,860
You're so lucky.

232
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,930
Five, four, three, two, one.

233
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,460
Happy New Year!

234
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,960
Happy New Year!

235
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,450
Boss.

236
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,650
Here's a toast to you.

237
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,590
If you hadn't helped with it,

238
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,060
we wouldn't have had such a perfect wedding.

239
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,270
Thank you, Boss.

240
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,080
Cheers.

241
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,640
Sis.

242
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,690
Why didn't you take the flowers just now?

243
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,770
That's right, that's right.

244
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,600
Why didn't you take it?

245
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,190
Mr. Zhao.

246
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,030
When are you going to propose to my sis?

247
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,660
Yes, propose now.

248
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,410
Propose. Propose. Propose.

249
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,400
Propose now.

250
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,470
Propose. Propose.

251
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:46,970
Stop it.

252
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,060
I'm in charge of our family.

253
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,050
It's no use convincing him.

254
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,460
He's got an early flight tomorrow.

255
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,990
We'd like to be alone for a while.

256
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,490
-Don't. -We're leaving now.

257
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,240
The world of you two only, okay.

258
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,190
-We'll go first. -The world of you two only.

259
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,150
Happy New Year.

260
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:00,830
We have to go.

261
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,150
Hold this for us.

262
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,730
Bye-bye.

263
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,400
The world of you two only.

264
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,490
What are you thinking about?

265
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,280
Who would have thought that I'd turn the mud flat

266
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,670
into what it is today

267
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,610
in three years?

268
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,820
So you're thinking about what it'll be like

269
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,390
in another three years, right?

270
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,260
I dare not to.

271
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,790
Come on, for us in three years

272
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,610
and in 30 years.

273
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,180
Make a wish.

274
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,880
They say, make a wish

275
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,840
when the first sunlight of the new century shines on you,

276
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,630
it will surely come true.

277
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,300
No.

278
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,020
I don't make wishes.

279
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,010
Because things don't work out.

280
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,600
Not everything can come true

281
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,580
by making a wish.

282
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,050
Make one.

283
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,250
If I can make it happen for you,

284
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,210
I will do it.

285
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,090
You can't do it.

286
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,450
Zhao Lei.

287
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,730
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a long time.

288
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,690
♫I'm sorry I didn't touch you♫

289
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,730
We both know each other's personalities very well.

290
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,690
♫There are many things♫

291
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,500
We know our own personalities even better.

292
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,660
♫That won't be easy even though you try hard♫

293
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,160
Neither of us can

294
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,040
compromise or change for each other.

295
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:48,140
♫Take a deep breath, try to let go of yourself♫

296
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,430
Don't you think so?

297
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,510
♫Don't let your obsession hurt♫

♫You and me♫

Even if I love you

300

and you love me,

301
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,780
we can't go forward, holding hands.

302
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,350
♫Yes I know I could be♫

303
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,430

♫As everything stands for me♫

305
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,190
the first rays of sunshine of the new century.

♫I know I could rewrite faith rhymes then and now♫

307
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,820
I'll remember this moment.

308

♫But it's not true, it's fully♫

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,730
Old centuries pass.

♫When you watch me♫

313
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,310
We're ready for a new century.

♫Then close the door♫

315
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,020

♫I'm sorry there's always a little distance♫

317

♫There's better luck waiting for them♫

We'll still be friends.

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,530
Eat on time.

324
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,870
You're just getting better.

325
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,520
Don't forget your health even when you get busy.

326
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,730
And if something goes wrong in the company,

327
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,980
have Jia Chang'an and Wildcat

328
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,120
call me anytime.

329
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,120
I will.

330
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,300
I checked the recent weather in Beijing.

331
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,020
Now is the coldest time.

332
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,500
Keep yourself warm when you arrive.

333
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,670
Don't get cold.

334
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,670
I've brought it.

335
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,080
I'll get changed as soon as I get off the plane.

00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,350
Follow us.

501
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,020
Let's go and find Wu Jianshe, folks.

502
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,260
Let's go.

503
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,139
Come on.

504
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:48,820
Hurry up.

505
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,370
Come on, let's find Wu.

506
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,380
Where's Wu Jianshe? Come out!

507
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,150
Come out!

508
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,760
Where is Wu Jianshe? Come out!

509
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,830
How should we live?

510
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,310
Please give way.

511
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,730
Everyone!

512
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,110
People!

513
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,420
I am the vice president

514
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,100
of the Provincial Heavy Industry Development Committee.

515
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,290
My name is Gao Yuejin.

516
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm here from the province to help you solve your problems.

517
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,540
You can talk to me about your problems.

518
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,860
I will help you solve them.

519
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,370
Leader... Leader...

520
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,030
Look.

521
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,280
This factory manager has ruined our lives.

522
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,110
You have to do justice for us!

523
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,760
Leader.

524
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,580
The owner is heartless.

525
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,790
My son is still lying in the hospital.

526
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,150
That's right.

527
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,800
Folks, folks.

528
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,910
I have understood the situation in general.

529
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,360
I understand how you feel.

530
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,800
But there is one thing,

531
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,330
calm down, first.

532
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,200
My son is still in the hospital.

533
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,100
Folks.

534
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,150
Don't do anything to hurt others

535
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,670
and yourselves.

536
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,980
We've already been hurt.

537
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,120
We can't even get clean water.

538
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,400
I understand.

539
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,470
Vice Mayor Zhang of the city is on his way here.

540
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,360
We will punish them severely

541
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,840
for this kind of thing

542
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,130
and give you a satisfactory answer.

543
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,360
Okay, everyone?

544
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,160
I'm sorry.

545
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,140
I'm sorry.

546
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,290
You dug a well and drained the sewage into it.

547
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,730
How could you think of it and do it too?

548
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,820
I was being impulsive.

549
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,930
When you hinted to me,

550
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,810
I... I realized it right away

551
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,180
and managed to remedy the situation

552
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,680
You don't have to pretend.

553
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,510
Wu Jianshe, like I don't know you?

554
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,140
If you wanted to rectify it,

555
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,590
you would have done it already.

556
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,620
Would there still be this mess today?

557
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Don't be angry.

558
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,700
Sit down, President Gao.

559
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,450
Sit down.

560
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,520
I realized that I was completely wrong.

561
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,970
I... I accept the punishment.

562
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,910
Please give me one more chance.

563
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,770
How can I give you another chance?

564
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,390
You are committing a crime.

565
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,500
You're going to jail.

566
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,240
Don't worry, I admit to it.

567
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,620
Just give me a little more time, please.

568
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,470
I promise not to start work secretly again.

569
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,940
I will follow the rules and regulations.

570
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,720
Now you understand?

571
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,040
It's too late.

572
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,350
Wu Jianshe.

573
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,270
I've given you all the due chances.

574
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,660
Now you just have to wait to be sentenced to jail.

575
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,900
President Gao. President Gao.

576
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,760
♫Life is too short. Sorrow, joy, and separation♫

577
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,540
♫In a blink of an eye, the boat has left the shore♫

578
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:24,490
♫Who knows the happiness is real and fake♫

579
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:31,200
♫I have neither regrets nor hate. Life consists of half joy and half sorrow♫

580
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,070
♫No matter how deep the love is♫

581
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,680
♫It's only half of the life♫

582
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,420
♫The other half is the temporary moment in front♫

583
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,940
♫And the eternity behind♫

584
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,020
♫From brightness to darkness♫

585
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,070
♫It is only a part of time♫

586
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,180
♫The rest of the life has limited starts♫

587
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,480
♫Infinite loop♫

588
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,000
♫The rest of the life has limited starts♫

589
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,520
♫Infinite loop♫

590
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,610
This is the structure of our line now.

591
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,730
It's almost fully equipped.

592
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,840
The big hook of the crane can lift 60 tons.

593
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,310
And the small hook can lift about 10 tons.

594
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,530
Mr. Wu.

595
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,370
Why are you here?

596
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,290
To take a look.

597
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,460
Xu.

598
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,700
Your project is progressing fast.

599
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,570
Yes, it is.

600
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
The first phase is almost finished.

601
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,930
What do you want from me?

602
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,020
Xu.

603
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,970
We've known each other for so many years.

604
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,450
How do you think I treat you?

605
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,260
You're the senior.

606
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,790
You have your reasons

607
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,820
no matter how you've treated me.

608
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,130
You've always taken care of me.

609
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,800
It's only right for me to do that.

610
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,910
I knew

611
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,680
you would make a difference.

612
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,950
But we are in business.

613
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,060
I had to do certain things

614
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,330
for the steel plant bidding.

615
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,890
Although we haven't seen each other for more than a year,

616
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:52,740
I...

617
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,040
I've never stood in your way.

618
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,130
And I never wanted to harm you.

619
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,080
What do you want to say?

620
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,500
Xu.

621
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,560
Take over my factory.
