[Episode 09]

4
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,490
Xu Banxia, I'm telling you.

5
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,690
I don't trust anyone,

6
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,990
especially you.

7
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,490
You've already screwed up once.

8
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,090
If you screw up again,

9
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,590
you don't have to come back.

10
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,490
You won't be able to pay off even anyway.

11
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,870
If you don't,

12
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm the one who'll be screwed up.

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,560
So I hope you'll calm down

14
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,810
and think about it.

15
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,509
Do you want to come back

16
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,490
or do you want the money?

17
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:12,950
I want the money.

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,070
Okay.

19
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,530
Then promise me.

20
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,310
Never pay for it

21
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,990
unless you see the goods.

22
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,829
We're in the same boat.

23
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:29,990
Mr. Zhao.

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,120
You and I don't know each other well.

25
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,140
But we both know money well.

26
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,350
Fine.

27
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,990
Open an account in the Black Sea.

28
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,540
I'll use an international wire transfer.

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,190
You'll receive it in a second.

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,870
Foreign companies have the privilege.

31
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,840
I'll wait to hear from you.

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,550
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

33
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,150
They're late.

34
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,380
It's okay.

35
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,230
I'm sure they'll be here before the sun goes down.

36
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,790
I'll stay with you.

37
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,070
Yan.

38
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,230
What?

39
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,860
A small gift for you.

40
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,560
Thank you, Ms. Banxia.

41
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,510
Thank you for your help along the way.

42
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,790
You can give it to me

43
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,390
when we leave.

44
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,440
I'm afraid I'll forget it

45
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,230
when we leave.

46
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,990
Thank you.

47
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,350
I mean it.

48
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,460
They're here, Banxia. They're here.

49
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,670
They're really here.

[General manager, Zhao Lei]

51
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,170
Smith, what are you doing?

52
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,780
Vacation.

53
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,940
If you don't pay me,

54
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,659
I'm afraid I'll break it.

55
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,030
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

56
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,550
Can you speak one by one?

57
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,110
I really can't hear you.

58
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,680
You always postpone it.

59
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,830
When will we truly get paid?

60
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,230
Do you have fun

61
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,990
making empty promises?

62
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,670
Then what should I do? You tell me.

63
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,830
What do you think should I do?

64
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,900
Can you call the police to arrest me?

65
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,870
I can at least spend the New Year in peace there.

66
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,350
All right?

67
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,070
Let go! Let go!

68
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,520
What?

69
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,510
Don't do it!

70
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,710
Get out of the way!

71
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,520
Get out of the way!

72
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,390
Why are you here?

73
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,590
-Who is it? -I'm here to solve the problem.

74
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,870
Don't go! Don't go!

75
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,430
Nobody move!

76
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,810
Quiet!

77
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,110
Your problems will be solved one by one.

78
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,909
Don't you think it's strange?

79
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,250
It's easy to get into this kind of trouble at the end of the year.

80
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,580
But they can't come together like this.

81
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,270
How come they all came all of a sudden?

82
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,910
These people have been construction workers for so many years.

83
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,200
It's normal to have some delayed payment.

84
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,610
Don't they know that?

85
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,700
We should indeed pay them.

86
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,150
It has nothing to do with that.

87
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,430
Listen to me.

88
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,150
Go home, take a good shower, and grab some food.

89
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,270
Get a good night's sleep.

90
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,460
I'll take care of it.

91
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,850
I promise not to hit back, not to curse back.

92
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,870
Don't do anything.

93
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,070
Hu.

94
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,620
Send Mr. Chen back.

95
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,190
Okay.

96
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,020
Where are you going?

97
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,270
What? Back up!

98
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,550
How can you justify not paying us?

99
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,980
Get out of the way.

100
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,550
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

101
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,190
Cut it out.

102
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,710
Shut up!

103
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,240
Everyone.

104
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,510
Mr. Chen really can't stand it anymore.

105
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,150
It's 10 degrees below zero at night on this site.

106
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,100
He's not in a good shape.

107
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,510
Why are you giving him a hard time?

108
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,790
You can come to me if there is anything.

109
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm in charge of it too.

110
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,760
I'll take care of it for you.

111
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,750
I have more than 50 men under me.

112
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,790
There are two people whose mothers

113
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,790
are lying on the hospital bed.

114
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,310
If you don't pay us…

115
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,460
You'll bring them here, right?

116
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,350
Let me ask.

117
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,480
Which two people?

118
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,110
Find them. Which ones?

119
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,150
Which hospital are their mothers in?

120
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,170
What's wrong with them? How much do they need?

121
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,430
I can even sell my blood and kidney tomorrow

122
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,520
to give them the money.

123
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,410
I'll be damned if I owe them a penny.

124
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,670
Which two?

125
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,670
Say it. I'm waiting.

126
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,480
I... I have to go ask.

127
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,020
You don't have to ask. I'll ask you.

128
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,310
Who made you come?

129
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,430
No one.

130
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:21,950
No one?

131
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,350
We agreed to give you the money after the New Year.

132
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,670
It's not even time yet.

133
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,190
Our boss has gone abroad to buy steel.

134
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,510
When she comes back, we'll be rich.

135
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,670
How can we not pay you then?

136
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,950
The steel bar is mine.

137
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,310
I have to take it away today.

138
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,720
You owe us money for two months.

139
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,910
You don't have any integrity.

140
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,710
What nonsense!

141
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,190
It's ours if we take it here.

142
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,860
I won't give it to you.

143
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,100
I'll pay you after the year.

144
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,640
Is your mother also in the hospital?

145
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,990
I...

146
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,150
Nobody move.

147
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,630
Quiet!

148
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:51,950
Put it down. Put it down.

149
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,350
You...

150
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,670
Don't go.

151
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,080
Don't pick up a fight.

152
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,070
Come on, let's talk alone.

153
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,640
What do you mean?

154
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,410
Your men beat me up.

155
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,390
This is getting big.

156
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm telling you.

157
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,910
You've made a mob scene.

158
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,260
You can be locked up for ten days or a half month.

159
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,380
It's almost New Year. There's no need for that.

160
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,910
Your family is waiting for you at home.

161
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,470
Right?

162
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,110
Take this as pocket money for the kids.

163
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,550
What do you mean?

164
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,070
I know

165
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,900
someone must have instigated you.

166
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,990
Tell me who it was.

167
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,950
No one asked me to come.

168
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,700
You can either tell me today

169
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,350
or I'll see you at the police station.

170
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,700
I see. I see what you mean.

171
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,270
I see.

172
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,550
Did a man named Zhao Lei

173
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,800
beat up Mr. Qiu?

174
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,890
I know they all listen to you.

175
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,100
Dismiss them.

176
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,980
I'll give you your money after the New Year.

177
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,380
All right, buddies, let's go.

178
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,090
Wait, the money…

179
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,740
They'll settle it after the New Year.

180
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,590
Listen to me.

181
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,040
We're leaving like this?

182
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,030
Listen to me, listen to me.

183
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,750
Let me tell you something.

184
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,550
Don't be angry.

185
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,990
I had your mother called.

186
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,830
She'll be here in a minute.

187
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,810
What's wrong with you?

188
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,180
Tong Xiaoqi, why did you ask her to come?

189
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,680
It's New Year soon.

190
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,830
You have to go home for it.

191
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,470
No, we're on the same team.

192
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,630
How am I interfering with you here?

193
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,870
What do you bother?

194
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,840
You're a college student.

195
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,190
You're the hope of the country.

196
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,910
We'll drag you down

197
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,790
if you stay with us every day.

198
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,830
You can't leave.

199
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,470
If you leave,

200
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,310
I won't be able to explain myself

201
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,070
if your mother comes later.

202
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,470
I treat you as a friend.

203
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,430
And you betrayed me.

204
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,230
Gao Xinyi!

205
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,190
Go home.

206
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,420
Gao Xinyi.

207
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,030
I'll leave her to you.

208
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,850
It's not my business anymore.

209
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,400
Go home for New Year. Hurry up.

210
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,640
Go home for the New Year.

211
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,260
What do you want?

212
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,980
Tong Xiaoqi.

213
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,270
You're a villain.

214
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,310
Did you get hurt?

215
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
♫We all have a home♫

216
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,170
♫Its name is China♫

217
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,190
♫There are many brothers and sisters there♫

218
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,690
♫The view is nice too♫

219
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,300
♫There are two dragons in the land♫

220
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,100
♫It's the Yangtze and the Yellow River♫

221
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,900
♫And Mount Everest♫

222
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,680
♫Is the highest mountain slope♫

223

♫Winding in the clouds♫

Be careful.

231
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,480
♫Look at the Tibetan Plateau♫

232
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,870
It's so heavy.

233
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,400
♫Broader than the sky♫

234
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,190
Fatty.

235
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,670
Is the scrap of steel

236
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,890
packed in the suitcase?

237
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,790
Be careful.

238
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,470
It's so heavy.

239
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,670
I have all the good stuff here.

240
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,510
I'm lucky to come back alive.

241
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,040
Do you know how cold it is up north?

242
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,110
Hurry up.

243
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:37,690
Hurry up.

244
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,340
Come on.

245
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,470
Get in.

246
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,120
Turn on the light.

247
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,260
Did you clean this room for me?

248
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,850
I cleaned it for you.

249
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,950
Good for you.

250
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,070
You don't look like you went on a business trip.

251
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,950
You look like you were on vacation.

252
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,750
That's right.

253
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,950
How much stuff did you buy?

254
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,380
I've got presents for you.

255
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,930
Really? Where?

256
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,140
I forget which box I put it in.

257
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,850
Go through it yourself.

258
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,250
Is there anything for me?

259
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,350
Yes, I got something for each one of you.

260
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,910
This is all your luggage.

261
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,940
I think this is it.

262
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,750
Be careful, don't break it.

263
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,910
I have something for someone else.

264
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,560
Leather jacket.

265
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,790
Is this mine?

266
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,110
It's for Tong.

267
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,990
Let's see, where's mine?

268
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,480
This is for me, right?

269
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,880
Yes, this is.

270
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,580
Try it on.

271
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,140
It looks good.

272
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,400
Wait, it's...

273
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
It seems too big for me.

274
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,600
Men from the north

275
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,930
are kind of sturdy.

276
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,950
This one looks good.

277
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,080
This is for me, right?

278
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,870
It looks good on him.

279
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,180
-It's warm and woolly. -This is nice.

280
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,510
That's right.

281
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,180
The color looks nice too, Tong.

282
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,670
This... this is nice.

283
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,470
That's not for you.

284
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:49,990
This is for me.

285
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,710
The leather jacket is for you.

286
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,550
Take it off.

287
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:51,870
Do you hear me?

288
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,590
I want this. I want this.

289
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:52,990
It's not yours.

290
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,860
-This is. -I don't like the black one.

291
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,190
-The leather jacket is for you. -I'll take this one.

292
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,710
Take it off.

293
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,370
I don't want the black one.

294
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,130
-I don't want the black one. -Don't tear it.

295
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,910
Take it off.

296
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,330
I don't want it. I want this one. I just...

297
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,660
I'll show you a good thing.

298
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,590
-This is a good lighter. -Here…

299
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,440
Take it off.

300
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,600
Come on, take it off.

301
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,070
Don't tear it.

302
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,870
I'm giving it away.

303
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,470
Be careful.

304
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,460
Here, here.

305
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,910
Give me the leather jacket too.

306
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,150
Here, this is for you.

307
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,670
Okay, this is nice too.

308
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,270
This is a good lighter, right?

309
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,230
It is.

310
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,810
Wait a second.

311
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,920
Then who did you buy this for?

312
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,430
Yeah, who did you buy it for?

313
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,310
Who did you buy it for?

314
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,290
Tell us.

315
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,710
Cheers.

316
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,590
Fatty, you've bought 50,000 tons of steel

317
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,390
at one time.

318
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
Where did you get so much money?

319
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,800
I borrowed it.

320
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,730
How could I have so much money?

321
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,710
It's all borrowed.

322
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,550
You borrowed it?

323
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,840
But don't worry.

324
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,610
This batch of scrap is all fine steel.

325
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,720
We don't get this kind of steel in China.

326
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,310
You can take a good look

327
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,560
when it arrives on the 15th of January.

328
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,390
You can see for yourselves.

329
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,349
What did I tell you last time?

330
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,270
This is going to be our big break.

331
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,780
Boss, let me ask you this.

332
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,170
Are we really going to be rich this time?

333
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,369
Are you stupid?

334
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,150
With so much being said, you still asked this?

335
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,310
We are getting rich.

336
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,270
Then we're really rich.

337
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,150
We're rich!

338
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,550
We're rich!

339
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,630
We're rich!

340
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,230
Cheers!

341
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,040
Cheers!

342
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,280
Boss, I'm telling you.

343
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,710
If you get back any later,

344
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,550
Chen Yuzhou will be so tormented

345
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,110
by the debt collectors.

346
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,870
Look how old he is now.

347
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,290
Nonsense!

348
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm not old. You are.

349
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,910
Thank you for your hard work.

350
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,630
Really.

351
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,750
It's really hard for you guys.

352
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,950
When the scrap steel arrives,

353
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,380
we'll pay them back

354
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,150
with interest and extra money.

355
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,870
We have money now.

356
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,310
I'll build my yard right away.

357
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,310
We'll have our own dock.

358
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,190
My 10,000-ton ship

359
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,870
will dock at our own wharf.

360
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,030
Chen,

361
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,430
we won't have to

362
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,870
live like that anymore.

363
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,470
We don't have to kiss the ground

364
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,960
and please them anymore.

365
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,750
We've had enough.

366
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,430
From now on, we'll stand up for ourselves.

367
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,260
You can't.

368
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:36,940
I…

369
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,630
Let's be tough.

370
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,990
Why can't I?

371
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,490
You can't be tougher.

372
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,500
Are we really going to be rich this time?

373
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,170
Yes, we are.

374
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,350
Thank you, Fatty.

375
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,380
Why are you being so polite to me?

376
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,400
What's wrong with you? Why are you crying?

377
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,390
It's a good thing.

378
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,830
Don't cry.

379
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,820
Don't cry, Chen.

380
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,400
Don't cry. You look so ugly when you cry.

381
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,680
Come on, cheers.

382
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,260
Cheers.

383
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:00,550
Come on.

384
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,790
To celebrate Fatty's returning

385
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,500
from the north in triumph,

386
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,020
to celebrate the end of our suffering,

387
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,270
let's take a picture.

388
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,590
I thought you were going to do something big.

389
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,190
Let's take a picture.

390
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,280
Come on.

391
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,310
You sit here.

392
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,100
Sit here.

393
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,610
I'll get it set.

394
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,460
Hurry up.

395
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,220
Take this. Hurry up.

396
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,990
Quick.

397
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,950
Three seconds.

398
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,750
Three, two, one.

399
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:33,750
Okay.

400
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,360
Let me see.

401
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,190
All right.

402
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,540
Hello?

403
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,790
This is Liu from the local tax bureau.

404
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,550
Is your boss back or not?

405
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,900
Well.

406
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,270
Yes, she's back.

407
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,030
She just came back.

408
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,580
Mr. Liu,

409
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,700
tomorrow is New Year's Eve, right?

410
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,360
Can this wait until after the New Year?

411
00:19:59,390 --> 00:19:59,910
Help me out.

412
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:00,990
That's not possible.

413
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,590
I'm officially informing you.

414
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,630
Your boss must go to the yard tomorrow

415
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,410
for the investigation.

416
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,670
Hello?

417
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,340
I'm back alive.

418
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,870
Good to be back.

419
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,470
I'm quite busy these days.

420
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,230
See you after the New Year.

421
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,950
I got the steel with me too.

422
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,990
We have several people here to celebrate the New Year.

423
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,740
Do you want to come over to my house too?

424
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,140
Let's have a good time together.

425
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,830
Forget it.

426
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,950
I'm used to being alone.

427
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,030
It's uncomfortable for me to be around people.

428
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,630
Well.

429
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:39,810
Well.

430
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,390
Happy New Year.

431
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,430
Thank you.

432
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,430
I'll have to go then.

433
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,590
Happy New Year.

434
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,590
Okay.

435
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,510
Mr. Zhao,

436
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,590
take a look at this first.

437
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,500
No way.

438
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,910
It's falling so much.

439
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
If it lasts,

440
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,000
we'll be so done.

441
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,630
I'd like you to come to Shanghai with me.

442
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,790
Now?

443
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay, I'll get the car ready.

444
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,460
[Binhai City Public Security Bureau Summon]

445
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,430
What the fuss is about?

446
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,550
We've got the summons.

447
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,270
Didn't I explain to you?

448
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,110
After the New Year, when the goods arrive,

449
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,670
I'll make it up right away.

450
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,230
I mean.

451
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,630
Why are you making it such a big deal today?

452
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,030
You even called the police.

453
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,470
If you can't make it up today,

454
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,860
we'll have to detain her for a few days.

455
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,450
It's a rule.

456
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,590
Look, it's New Year's Eve.

457
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,030
We don't want to take you with us.

458
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,420
But work is work.

459
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,190
You must understand.

460
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,190
Please cooperate with us.

461
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:54,990
Where is she?

462
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,110
This has nothing to do with

463
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,510
our boss.

464
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,870
She doesn't even know about it.

465
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,950
I'm the one who did all this.

466
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,870
Take me away.

467
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,980
Can I go with you?

468
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,110
Chen, you're not the legal person.

469
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,020
Think about it.

470
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,380
It's carried forward in such a hurry.

471
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,630
Who did you offend?

472
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,750
What's wrong?

473
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,510
What are you doing here?

474
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,060
Get out of here.

475
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,270
Mr. Xu,

476
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,190
you finally show up.

477
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,670
What is it?

478
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,430
Mr. Xu,

479
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,350
your company had a 150,000-yuan business tax underpayment

480
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,130
last year.

481
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,800
It's still delinquent after repeated reminders.

482
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,190
It is now suspected of tax evasion.

483
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,750
Tax evasion?

484
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,550
It's so serious.

485
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,180
You can either pay the tax you owe today

486
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,130
or come with us for the investigation.

487
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,080
It's the New Year.

488
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,680
Where are we going to find 150,000 yuan?

489
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,070
Ask me about the finance.

490
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,760
She doesn't know about it.

491
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,720
Besides, she's been out of the country for the past two months.

492
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,470
Come to me.

493
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,730
I'll go with you.

494
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,070
I'll cooperate with your investigation, okay?

495
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,270
What's the use of taking you with us?

496
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,030
You're not the legal person.

497
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,990
Fang, take her away.

498
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,310
Don't.

499
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:48,830
Don't!

500
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,550
What are you doing?

501
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,240
Cooperate with us.

502
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,030
It's the New Year after all.

503
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,030
Can we talk about it?

504
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,580
Chen, take it easy.

505
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,240
It's okay.

506
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,670
I'll go with them.

507
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,010
Once the goods arrive, we can make up the money

508
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,810
and I'll be able to get out.

509
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,180
I'll go with you. I'll cooperate with the investigation.

510
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,120
You have no health problems, right?

511
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,950
If you have any illness, tell us in advance,

512
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,830
so that our colleagues on duty in the Spring Festival

513
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,820
will be prepared.

514
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,430
Answer me, say yes.

515
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,990
Yes, sir.

516
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,350
Don't talk too much after you go in.

517
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,020
Twice toileting time a day.

518
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,790
And don't get into fights or brawls.

519
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,380
Ask the staff if you have anything you don't know.

520
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,990
When is the mealtime?

521
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,790
Prison room number five, take one.

522
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,560
Get in.

523
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,990
Memorize the rules and regulations

524
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,870
on the wall.

525
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,080
Strictly abide by the rules of the security detention center.

526
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,150
Thank you, Wang.

527
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,280
I'll buy you a drink someday.

528
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,910
What happened?

529
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,010
They said she had to be detained for a few days.

530
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,120
Pay all the money and she will be released.

531
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,990
It's the New Year.

532
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,220
Where can I get 150,000 yuan?

533
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,810
Someone must have told on us.

534
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,590
Why would they rush about it anyway?

535
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,030
They just had to take her away in New Year.

536
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,670
Probably those bastards.

537
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,180
Do you mean Wu Jianshe?

538
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,870
No matter who did it,

539
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,560
we have to get the money first.

540
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,470
We can't let Fatty

541
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,630
stay in jail like this.

542
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,670
That's right.

543
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,470
If those bastards really did it,

544
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,350
let's go get them.

545
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,480
Make them pay it up.

546
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,450
We're having dumplings here.

547
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,510
But all your boss has is cornbread there.

548
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,690
Tell us, what should we do?

549
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,100
Boss, say something.

550
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,070
Big brother, what do you want to do?

551
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,550
Don't worry about our boss.

552
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,900
It's New Year, don't go anywhere.

553
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,230
I'm going out with Mr. Chen.

554
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,470
We'll figure it out.

555
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,890
Do you have a plan?

556
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,950
No.

557
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,670
Then where are you taking me?

558
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,230
Let's drive there first.

559
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:41,990
We'll talk when we get there.

560
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm telling you.

561
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,140
It's too late for you to even sell yourself.

562
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,140
Don't talk nonsense.

563
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,400
Drive.

564
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:13,890
[1997]

565
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,550
Can this work? Did you get through?

566
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,550
No one's answering?

567
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,020
Has she been watching TV all night

568
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,170
and hasn't been up yet?

569
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,530
Have you ever been here before?

570
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,080
Do I look like I've been here before?

571
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,110
I looked it up in the Yellow Pages.

572
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,360
How should we find it then?

573
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:51,980
I mean.

574
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,090
The number you dialed…

575
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,070
Even if we find her,

576
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,930
does she have that much money?

577
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,440
Even if she does, would she lend it to you?

578
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
Don't be a nag.

579
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,300
You have to try it.

580
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,430
Or else the boss

581
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,510
will have to stay there.

582
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,120
I mean.

583
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,040
You don't even know where she lives

584
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,350
for so long.

585
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,760
You didn't even ask which building she's in.

586
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,980
It's such a big area.

587
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,630
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

588
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,200
I really can't count on you.

589
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,190
Yellow Pages.

590
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,060
What's wrong?

591
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,430
Have you heard it?

592
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,990
What?

593
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,270
Listen carefully.

594
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,750
What are we listening to?

595
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,910
A piano song.

596
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,640
It's Wildcat's favorite song.

597
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,740
Hurry up.

598
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,300
It must be her. Hurry up.

599
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,360
Here, here. Come on.

600
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,520
Is it here?

601
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,280
I think so.

602
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,260
What floor?

603
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,320
Wildcat.

604
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,660
Gao Xinyi.

605
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,070
Wildcat.

606
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,240
Gao Xinyi.

607
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,030
Wildcat.

608
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,890
Gao Xinyi.

609
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,470
Stop shouting.

610
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,440
How did you find this place?

611
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,470
Well, we're here to pay our respects to you.

612
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,110
I thought you hated me.

613
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:22,700
No, no, no.

614
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,070
Come down. Come down and let's talk.

615
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,290
Right, come down, come down.

616
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,910
Will she... will she come down?

617
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,330
I think so.

618
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,220
Go, go, go!

619
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,670
There she is.

620
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,110
What do you want from me?

621
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,400
Happy New Year.

622
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,990
Here's some pocket money.

623
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,470
I wish you a happy and healthy New Year.

624
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,350
All the best.

625
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,360
Say something nice.

626
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,870
Well... Happy New Year.

627
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,830
May you be happy and prosperous.

628
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:12,830
Okay.

629
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,770
I appreciate it. Go home.

630
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,240
Don't go.

631
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,070
I need to talk to you.

632
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,790
I knew it wasn't good.

633
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,910
Tell me.

634
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,310
I need to borrow some money from you.

635
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,510
I need to borrow some money from you.

636
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,910
It's not like the time when I was kicked out.

637
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,910
You think of me

638
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,910
when you need to borrow money, don't you?

639
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,200
I don't think I was wrong about that.

640
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,990
I made you go home for New Year for your sake.

641
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,310
Please. Please.

642
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:45,700
Well.

643
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,400
It's urgent for me and Xiaoqi.

644
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,690
We have no choice.

645
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,630
We can only come to you.

646
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:56,790
Beg me.

647
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,230
Forget it.

648
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,530
Wait. Wait.

649
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:13,870
Fine.

650
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,180
Please, do us a favor.

651
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,290
Okay.

652
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,910
Tell me, how much do you want?

653
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,540
¥150, 000.

654
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,370
¥150, 000?

655
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,320
You give me ¥200

656
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,160
and want ¥150,000?

657
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,530
Where can I get you the money?

658
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,040
I think we should forget it.

659
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,080
There is no way she has it. ¥150,000 is too much.

660
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,470
Let's think of another way.

661
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,390
So,

662
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,480
we're leaving.

663
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,070
Let's go.

664
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,340
Why do you need so much money?

665
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,530
-To get someone out of the jail. -To get someone out of the jail.

666
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,230
Abide by the laws and regulations of the country.

667
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,960
Establish a correct outlook on life, moral values

668
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,390
and the right attitude to reform.

669
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,900
Article 2…

670
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,710
-Xu Banxia. -Strictly abide by the relevant regulations of the public security detention center,

671
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,510
-obey the management… -Xu Banxia.

672
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,490
And educate

673
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,630
our own problems…

674
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,230
You're something.

675
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,380
All you do is eat and sleep.

676
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,630
Good, I think you can do something big.

677
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,990
I heard

678
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,310
you didn't even finish reading

679
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:21,990
the first rule of behavior management.

680
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,370
If you were locked up for a few more days,

681
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,870
I'd have to give you a new number.

682
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,180
You snore too loudly.

683
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,030
Boss.

684
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,270
Happy New Year.

685
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,180
You...

686
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,350
Why is she here?

687
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,080
Get in first.

688
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,950
Get in the car first. Hurry up.

689
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,720
It's New Year, don't stay here.

690
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,120
Get out of here.

691
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,510
How did you get together with her again?

692
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,200
Tell me first.

693
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,300
Tell you what?

694
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,000
If it weren't for me,

695
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,680
you'd still be in there.

696
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,610
Don't say anything.

697
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,890
What does she mean?

698
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,630
Where did you get the money?

699
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,670
It's mine.

700
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,330
Yours?

701
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,500
It's hers.

702
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,590
Did you borrow money from her mother?

703
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,660
Did you?

704
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,310
Yes, I did.

705
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,770
Are you out of your mind?

706
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,080
Why did you hit him?

707
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,670
Are you his mother?

708
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,790
Send her home now.

709
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,650
I'm not going home.

710
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,260
-Do you think you can send me anywhere you want? -Send her home.

711
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,960
Let's not go to her house in New Year.

712
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,710
Let's go back to our own home.

713
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,350
I mean, Xu Banxia.

714
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,670
What do you care so much?

715
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,890
You have to bother about where I go?

716
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,920
Take her home, you hear me?

717
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,560
I won't bother.

718
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,860
I'll let your mother do it.

719
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,730
I have to make it clear to your mother.

720
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,410
Otherwise, how can I run a business in the future?

721
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,870
Send her home.

722
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,350
Okay, let's go to her house.

723
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,510
Tong Xiaoqi.

724
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,410
What were you thinking?

725
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,930
How could you think of borrowing money from her mother?

726
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,110
Didn't I tell you?

727
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,020
Who is her mother?

728
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Can we afford to mess with her?

729
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,710
I told you not to mess with her.

730
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,470
Not to mess with her.

731
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,680
But you still come together.

732
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,900
Boss, I couldn't help it.

733
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,070
It's the New Year.

734
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,700
I can't let you stay in there.

735
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,110
I'd rather stay inside.

736
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,030
Don't say that.

737
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,890
Don't say that.

738
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:26,900
By the way,

739
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,520
I have something important to tell you.

740
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,600
It was Qiu Bizheng

741
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,830
and Guo Qidong

742
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,030
who reported you and made you go in there.

743
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,770
And the time when we were hounded by the suppliers,

744
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,110
these two bastards did it too.

745
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,010
How do you know?

746
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,800
I've asked.

747
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,430
The suppliers told me.

748
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,740
The chain of evidence is complete, and it all fits together.

749
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,810
They did it.

750
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,380
Wait at the door.

751
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,969
I'll talk to my mother.

752
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,540
Mom.

753
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,100
Mom.

754
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:04,830
You

755
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,870
haven't eaten yet.

756
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,840
I...

757
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,910
I want to talk to you about something.

758
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,200
¥150,000?

759
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,350
Are you kidding?

760
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,790
Mom, take it easy.

761
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,150
I'll explain it to you now.

762
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,370
Xu Banxia.

763
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,140
Come here, come here.

764
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,460
Didn't you just say you'd explain?

765
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,780
Say it, explain it to my mother.

766
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,490
Tell her.

767
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,700
President Gao.

768
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,710
It's really not Wildcat's fault.

769
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,420
She used the money to save me.

770
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,410
Look.

771
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,420
Don't be so angry.

772
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,140
Listen to what she has to tell you.

773
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:55,560
You guys talk first.

774
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,790
I'll come up afterward.

775
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,670
You guys talk first.

776
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,550
Gao Xinyi,

777
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,930
where are you going?

778
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:16,800
Have a seat.

779
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,600
President Gao.

780
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,580
I'm so sorry.

781
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,330
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused.

782
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,900
I'll pay you back with interest

783
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,680
when the goods

784
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,090
is sold.

785
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,390
Please give me some more time.

786
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,670
What do you mean?

787
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,790
Tong Xiaoqi.

788
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,560
When will you pay me back?

789
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,530
Ten days.

790
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,940
Fifteen days at the most.

791
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,630
The steel is on its way.

792
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,430
Don't rush.

793
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,670
I'm sure I can pay it back.

794
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,580
I will give it to you the minute it's sold.

795
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,490
Look.

796
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,460
This is my shipping list.

797
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,400
I found a batch of high-quality steel scrap

798
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,340
when I went to the Black Sea this time.

799
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,410
There is almost no domestic scrap of this quality.

800
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,160
So, I took the risk of

801
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,630
bringing in 35,000 tons more.

802
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,190
As you know,

803
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,750
domestic scrap is always that much

804
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,990
every year.

805
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,430
And a lot of people come after it.

806
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,420
A small company like mine doesn't have a say.

807
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,180
So I have to spend big money

808
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,690
on this.

809
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,260
You did it all by yourself?

810
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,190
Yes, I did it all by myself.

811
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,580
Have you been to the north before?

812
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,830
This is my first time abroad.

813
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,110
I told you not to come.

814
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,710
You had to come.

815
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,830
Why do you want to mess with her?

816
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,210
Bummer.

817
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

818
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,510
I don't want to come either, my boss…

819
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,270
Let me ask you.

820
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,950
What your boss is to you?

821
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,280
Why are you working so hard for her?

822
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,810
I should.

823
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,640
Do you like her?

824
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,690
Don't talk nonsense.

825
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,940
She is my boss, do you understand?

826
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,310
What about me?

827
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:35,690
What?

828
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,800
Do you like me or not?

829
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,070
Well...

830
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,710
I'll tell you first.

831
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,550
I like you.

832
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,690
Otherwise

833
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,760
I wouldn't have lent you money.

834
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,450
You can tell me

835
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,890
when we meet next time.

836
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,710
What's the name of your company?

837
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,930
Banxia, my name.

838
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,500
Banxia Steel Co.

839
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,590
Besides buying in and selling steel scrap,

840
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,820
what are your plans for the future?

841
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,970
I'm building a yard now.

842
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,830
If the time is right,

843
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,960
I'll build a wharf in the future.

844
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,510
I'll need your support then, President Gao.

845
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,310
You're done talking?

846
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,590
Did it go well?

847
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,860
Xu Banxia.

848
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,620
I should tell you.

849
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,680
I lend you the money

850
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,470
because of Tong Xiaoqi.

851
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,950
Wait a minute.

852
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,750
You...

853
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,430
Do you know that she and

854
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,660
that boy named Qi

855
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,590
had been together all day long

856
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,850
during the time you were abroad?

857
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,310
She even quit her job

858
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,710
for this boy.

859
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,510
I didn't quit my job for him.

860
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,790
I've told you a million times.

861
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,270
It's me. I wanted to quit.

862
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,340
I'm so tired of it. Here it comes again.

863
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,360
Do you think you can quit anytime you want?

864
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,780
Are you kidding me?

865
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,350
What's the attitude?

866
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,270
Come out here!

867
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,390
President Gao, please calm down.

868
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,810
I understand your feelings very well.

869
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,170
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

870
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,490
-If they dare to do it again... -Again?

871
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,190
What again?

872
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,890
I have my freedom.

873
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,160
I've seen countless businesses

874
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,710
and bosses

875
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,670
and heard a lot of nice words.

876
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,280
Any guarantee won't work.

877
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,110
You have to listen to someone's words

878
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,830
and observe his actions.

879
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,580
I will pay you back

880
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,930
in 20 days.

881
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,270
I don't mean this.

882
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,620
Xu, you're amazing

883
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,690
to buy this.

884
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,480
Be careful.

885
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,860
You are not collecting scrap steel.

886
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,180
Rise.

887
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,560
You are

888
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,670
taking the whole gold mountain back.

889
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,480
This is all fine steel.

890
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,150
Good for you.

891
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,860
The future

892
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,610
belongs to the younger generation.

893
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,350
We're really counting on you.

894
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,130
It's just good luck.

895
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,030
Mr. Wu, if you must say so,

896
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,870
I have to thank you sincerely.

897
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,230
Xu, don't say that.

898
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:29,790
You've made me

899
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,220
embarrassed.

900
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,350
You've paid so much effort.

901
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,630
You must have suffered a lot.

902
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,830
It's a big deal.

903
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,350
I'm sure it's

904
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,910
highly profitable.

905
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,570
I hate to ask.

906
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,450
How did Zhao Ji lend you the money?

907
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,040
I was thinking that you paid so much effort.

908
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,310
They must have

909
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,620
taken all the profit.

910
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,540
Right?

911
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,380
But as I see it,

912
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:49,980
I think

913
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,190
it'll be good if we get together.

914
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,420
At least I won't make you suffer a loss.

915
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,330
Did you?

916
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,560
Mr. Wu, you see right through it.

917
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,470
Yes, you'r right.

918
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,880
He did make all the money.

919
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,120
You see what I'm talking about?

920
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,070
So, as I said,

921
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,460
we should get together.

922
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,700
Xu, I really have to thank you.

923
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,180
I've taken the jacket.

924
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,220
Thanks for thinking of me.

925
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,950
I gave it to Bao'er.

926
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,740
She loves it.

927
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,240
-That's for your wife. -Fatty.

928
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:19,830
Fatty.

929
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:32,530
Mr. Zhao,

930
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,940
How's it?

931
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,150
I got 50,000 tons back with me.

932
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,690
Do you know about the current steel price?

933
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:41,660
Check it out.
