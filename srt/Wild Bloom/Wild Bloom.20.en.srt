[Episode 20]

4
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,320
If you really want to make this truck team better,

5
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,340
that's the only way.

6
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,289
There's no other way.

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,620
But if you only do it for the sake of your friendship,

8
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,140
then I'll force you to quit today.

9
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,550
Quit your truck team right now!

10
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,669
When is it your turn to talk

11
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,410
about my staying in the truck team or not?

12
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,660
Boss kept his hands off on us at that time,

13
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
so why should you mind my own business?

14
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,430
You're right. How dare I?

15
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,340
Tong Xiaoqi.

16
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,110
You're on your own now.

17
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,370
We're over.

18
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,540
Fine.

19
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,720
You'd better not regret it.

20
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,390
Get lost.

21
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,710
Miss Xu.

22
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,940
This electric furnace equipment

23
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,829
has been here since the factory was established.

24
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,710
Although it looks antique,

25
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:56,660
its functions of temperature control,

26
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,480
oxygen blowing and the control program

27
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,160
were all imported from Germany.

28
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,880
They were the most state-of-art back then.

29
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,230
This furnace could be said

30
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,580
to have advanced in technology for nearly 30 years

31
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,900
among similar products in the country then.

32
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,019
I don't know how your electric furnace was like,

33
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,220
but I suggest that you retrieve this back

34
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,610
because Shougang group and Baosteel group

35
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,990
are still using devices of the same period as it.

36
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
And Feng and I went to the Soviet Union personally

37
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
to monitor the shipment of this continuous casting machine.

38
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,150
We watched it boxed up and loaded onto the ship.

39
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,630
It was such an emotional moment.

40
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,100
Everything was still vivid in my mind.

41
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,500
You still like to talk about the old days.

42
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,220
Miss Xu, let me tell you,

43
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,100
this person never favors to be on a boat.

44
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,990
But he wanted to go so bad that he strived to get on the boat.

45
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,520
On the way there,

46
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,560
Feng really found your behavior unpleasant.

47
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,300
Did you even know how may times you threw up?

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,950
Back the, these equipment were the very first one

49
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,760
to be imported in our country.

50
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,830
And these babies were acquired by our factory.

51
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,150
It was truly an honor!

52
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,660
This machine is especially special.

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,190
When it first came in to our factory,

54
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
it was me who took over the whole process.

55
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,090
It's the same age as Si.

56
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,710
I know this machine and every single part of it,

57
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,920
like the back of my hand.

58
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,490
Now that I look back,

59
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,180
everything seems to have just happened yesterday.

60
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,700
I always say

61
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,170
that this machine was like a child of his own.

62
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
When Si was still little and got sick,

63
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,220
he showed no care for Si

64
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,680
as if there was no such thing.

65
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,790
He payed no attention to anything else.

66
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,900
But when it comes to issues with the machine,

67
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,700
he would get too worried to eat or sleep.

68
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,100
This really bugged me then.

69
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,820
Si spent his childhood in this factory

70
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,850
and grew up here.

71
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,080
Si often led a bunch of kids

72
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,420
to play in the factory.

73
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,480
Time really flies.

74
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,940
In a blink of an eye,

75
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,140
the children have all grown up.

76
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,520
Si has even become an engineer now.

77
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,430
But the factory shut down all of a sudden.

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,790
Although the government has arranged a career change,

79
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,570
the skills that Si and his folks have picked up--

80
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,480
Mr. Jia. Ms. Sun.

81
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,860
Jia.

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,010
Here we come.

83
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,470
We've brought everything back.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,870
Dad. Mom.

85
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,030
-Ms. Sun, look at my bags. -Mom.

86
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,240
Look, here they are.

87
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,120
-Jia. Ms. Sun. - Ms. Sun.

88
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,370
Mr. Jia. Mr. Sun.

89
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,940
Mr. Jia. Mr. Sun.

90
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,780
Mr. Jia.

91
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:37,700
Jia Gong.

92
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,100
We're here, Jia.

93
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,220
Jia.

94
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,590
Ms. Sun.

95
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,300
Mr. Jia.

96
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,409
Miss Xu, let me introduce you

97
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,480
to Shen

98
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,000
who used to be the chief of our hot rolling shop.

99
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,670
And this one here is Feng.

100
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,930
He's in charge of maintaining the blast furnace.

101
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,940
Liang is in charge of technical indicator monitoring.

102
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,220
His son, Liang,

103
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,630
was classmates with Si,

104
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,920
who also went to Germany to learn technology.

105
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,820
These people here

106
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
are all outstanding experts in our factory.

107
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,020
Have you found the manual?

108
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,860
No.

109
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,960
Here is the rest.

110
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,690
It's okay.

111
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,170
This is my work log.

112
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,020
Inside are some recorded problems

113
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,980
that all the equipment may have.

114
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,740
Please take it back and have a look.

115
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,420
And also,

116
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,380
when I was learning in the Soviet Union,

117
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,450
I bought these two books

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,300
which are no where to get in the country now.

119
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,620
I had highlighted some parts

120
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,460
and translated them into Chinese.

121
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,730
You may find my handwriting sloppy.

122
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,800
Please bear with me.

123
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,300
This is also for you.

124
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,440
This is what you've learned throughout your whole life.

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,990
You shouldn't have. This is too much.

126
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,400
Please take it.

127
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,180
I also told everyone

128
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,640
to bring all their blueprints and information

129
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,840
with them for you.

130
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,730
Give them to your engineers.

131
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,920
They'll get it right away at a glance.

132
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,390
Dad,

133
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
You act like you're marrying off a daughter.

134
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,150
Miss Xu,

135
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,480
these equipment can still take on for a long time with proper maintenance.

136
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,340
If you ask me,

137
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,760
I'd say it is us old fogeys should be eliminated,

138
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,120
not these equipment.

139
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,410
These babies are lucky

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,580
to have met you.

141
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,670
I recommend you live on Paradise Island.

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,050
Paradise island

143
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,740
is the most beautiful island of Maldives.

144
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,010
You can experience lots of water activities there.

145
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,100
It really lives up to its name,

146
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,390
It's like heaven.

147
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,770
Can you give us these photos?

148
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:39,890
No problem.

149
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,350
Feel free to take the ones you like.

150
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,400
It's so beautiful.

151
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,250
Let's go on a self-guided tour

152
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,450
of around 20 days or even longer.

153
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,010
Don't you want to see anywhere else?

154
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,290
I like this place.

155
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,750
Let's go see the white crabs together.

156
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,680
At night, we'll be on the roof

157
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,260
and watch fishes swimming in the sea.

158
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,500
It's a deal.

159
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,600
You have a really good taste.

160
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,440
Just a second,

161
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm going to get you some documents.

162
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,630
How I wish I could go there tomorrow!

163
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,270
It feels surreal.

164
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,900
It's Fatty.

165
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,990
If she knows we're wandering around,

166
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,100
she'll fly into a rage.

167
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,470
Okay, you go get the call.

168
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,190
Hello Fatty?

169
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,570
What are you doing?

170
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,600
What else can I do?

171
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,400
You all keep me from being busy.

172
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,510
I'm busy between the hospital and home

173
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,010
taking injections and medicine for my treatment.

174
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,490
What about Tong? What is he up to?

175
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,180
I don't know what happened between him and Wildcat.

176
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
He seems to hang out with the truck team a lot recently.

177
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,980
Seems like they're having a fight.

178
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,100
If they still have the mood to quarrel,

179
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,670
they must be doing just fine then.

180
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,760
How are you doing over there?

181
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,420
Why did you suddenly call me?

182
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,600
Did anything happen over there?

183
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,690
Can't I just call you for no reason?

184
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,980
Come on.

185
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,990
I know you well.

186
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Whenever you have something on your mind,

187
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,770
you would start waffling on with me.

188
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,080
So tell me, what happened?

189
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,300
I do have something to tell you,

190
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,900
but I haven't figured it out yet.

191
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,080
I'm still struggling.

192
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,610
Since you haven't called me in a while,

193
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll tell you

194
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,660
about what I've been doing recently.

195
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,920
What are you doing?

196
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,480
In fact, Zhou Qian is a shill of wedding.

197
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,950
We both know it.

198
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,000
But it's okay,

199
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,310
as long as I like it.

200
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,350
I took her to take some photos.

201
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,680
Wedding photos.

202
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,840
It turned out pretty good.

203
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,810
I really like it.

204
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,710
My days are numbered.

205
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,060
I know that you already knew it too.

206
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,170
This is my fate.

207
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,030
Since it's my fate,

208
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,790
I can do whatever I want

209
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,510
as long as I'm happy.

210
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,690
Now I finally realize

211
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,460
that nothing is more important

212
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,750
than being happy.

213
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,790
I've got to go.

214
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,880
I'm back.

215
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:58,970
I bought the flight ticket.

216
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,080
You don't have to pack so early.

217
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,400
We still have time tomorrow.

218
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,580
It is your luggage that I packed.

219
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,030
Zhao Lei,

220
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,600
I thought about it.

221
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,810
You should go back first.

222
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,750
Why?

223
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,240
Didn't we solve everything?

224
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,810
I have a bold idea now

225
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,140
about the technical workers in the northeast

226
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:24,990
and the engineers

227
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,950
as you can see.

228
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,700
I'm going to build a new steel mill in the future.

229
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,940
I'm sure I'll need some talents like them.

230
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,010
So,

231
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,060
I want to take them all back.

232
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,570
By that, we can truly solve their problems.

233
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,920
But it will need to take some time to do so.

234
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,500
So I'll stay for a few more days.

235
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,750
Okay, then how about I stay here with you too?

236
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,060
What do you say?

237
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,950
I don't know how long the stay will take.

238
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,490
Chen is getting more ill day by day.

239
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,540
And Tong has been busy

240
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,150
running his truck team.

241
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,920
I'm worried about them.

242
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,410
I think if you go back

243
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,490
you can help the company and call the shots.

244
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,210
And it'll also make me feel much relieved.

245
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,620
The time to bid for the steel mill

246
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,570
is getting closer and closer.

247
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,930
Wu Jianshe and others keep themselves busy as well.

248
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,960
I know what they are doing.

249
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,210
Let's not both stay here.

250
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,020
One of us has to go back first.

251
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,140
I'm just worried--

252
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,540
I know what you're worried about.

253
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,730
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

254
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,150
If they really don't want to leave their hometown,

255
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,040
I won't force them.

256
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,930
And then I'll go back.

257
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,380
You...

258
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,100
Why do I feel

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,860
the rules I set are now reversed?

260
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,450
What rules?

261
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,420
Miss Xu.

262
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,610
Mr. Wang,

263
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,820
what did you invite me here for?

264
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,400
Hunting.

265
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,320
Here, take it.

266
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,780
Take it.

267
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,560
Hold this part.

268
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,170
Don't point your gun at anyone.

269
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,880
I don't know how to do this.

270
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,630
I can't do this.

271
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,500
You haven't shot a gun before, right? Don't be nervous.

272
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,970
This here is the safety.

273
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,020
It's switched on with just a flip.

274
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,910
Here is the bullet. Put it in.

275
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,040
Now, you are good to go.

276
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,280
Come on.

277
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,420
I can't do this.

278
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,840
Don't worry. You'll know how to do this after one shot.

279
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,230
So, tell me.

280
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,720
Why did you decide to stay?

281
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,560
Do you want to go against me?

282
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,530
Or is it because you are not satisfied with my previous offers?.

283
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,220
What do you expect me to say?

284
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,690
I'm not going against you.

285
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,270
Instead, I want to help you solve the problems.

286
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,040
You know what?

287
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,640
Before that, they had no time

288
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,420
to cause any trouble.

289
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,260
I did what you said.

290
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,849
I fixed the water and electricity.

291
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,980
But what now?

292
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,630
Some of them gathered

293
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,280
and sued me again.

294
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,360
Hold it.

295
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,820
Don't move.

296
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,400
Let go slowly. Slowly.

297
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,230
Oh my god.

298
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,280
Here, just hold it like this.

299
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,420
Miss Xu,

300
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,140
I did everything as you said.

301
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,050
Everything.

302
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,240
But what about you?

303
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,530
You went back on your word and stayed.

304
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,670
You even asked your attorney to see me.

305
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,820
That's not really nice of you.

306
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,380
Do your kind of people

307
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,650
always go back on your words when doing business?

308
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,110
This is not about business.

309
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,600
It's a matter of conscience.

310
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,510
I just want to solve the problems

311
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,580
and let them live a good life.

312
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,070
I know there are many ways to do so,

313
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,630
but I don't want to choose the worst one.

314
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,470
I'm all ears.

315
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,070
I think

316
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,790
you should give them more compensation

317
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,520
and come up with a better compensation plan.

318
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,480
Think about it. They won't sue you anymore

319
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,970
once they have a better life.

320
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,540
Miss Xu.

321
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,780
Have you heard the stories of the farmer and the snake

322
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,210
as well as Master Dong Guo and the wolf?

323
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,630
I'm not a fool.

324
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,560
Seems like you haven't thought this through.

325
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,650
Stay here and think this through.

326
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,790
We will talk

327
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,620
when you figure it all out.

328
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,900
Let's go.

329
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,130
What do you mean?

330
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,020
Mr. Wang.

331
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,530
Where are you going?

332
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,690
Don't you dare leave me here alone.

333
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,460
Mr. Wang.

334
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,640
Don't leave me here alone.

335
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,230
When will you be back?

336
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,860
Mr. Wang.

337
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,480
Mr. Zhao.

338
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,260
this is the financial statement

339
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,130
and every contract of the company.

340
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,600
Please take a look and see if there's any problem.

341
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,960
OK.

342
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,290
Hello, Banxia?

343
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,170
Hello?

344
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,860
I regret it.

345
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,180
I shouldn't have let you go.

346
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,320
Hello?

347
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,810
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

348
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,900
I said I would be responsible for you.

349
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,600
Now I change my mind.

350
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,750
It's you who should be responsible.

351
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,260
You should be responsible for me.

352
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,060
Hello? You are breaking up.

353
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
I can't hardly hear you.

354
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,750
Find a place with better signal.

355
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,220
I'm lost.

356
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,980
That bastard.

357
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,720
Mr. Wang brought me

358
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,910
to this unknown remote forest

359
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,560
just for hunting.

360
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,680
What? Hunting?

361
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,910
Hunting for what?

362
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,720
Where are you?

363
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,150
He left me here alone.

364
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,390
I shouldn't have fallen for his tricks.

365
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,880
I shouldn't have come.

366
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,060
Hello, Banxia?

367
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,000
Hello?

368
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,660
Hello?

369
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,620
Hello? Tell me why.

370
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,380
Why did I meet you at this time?

371
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,790
I thought I would never

372
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,610
fall for anyone again in my life.

373
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,340
Zhao Lei,

374
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,540
I love you.

375
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,260
Banxia, speak up a little.

376
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,890
I love you.

377
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,770
Hello?

378
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,480
If I die here,

379
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,520
you have to avenge me.

380
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,500
Hello?

381
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,100
Did you hear that?

382
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,390
Hello?

383
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,060
Oh great, my phone is dead.

384
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,460
Four shots.

385
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,240
We shot four times in total,

386
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,990
but it still ran away.

387
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,330
The wild boar got good luck.

388
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,630
Here, Miss Xu.

389
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,010
Take this drink and warm yourself up.

390
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,170
It seems that whether humans or animals,

391
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,510
all have the desire to survive that we can't underestimate.

392
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,550
However,

393
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,190
at least this wild boar had learned the lesson

394
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,090
not to wander around at the place

395
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,990
where it shouldn't be.

396
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,070
Otherwise, things may end up badly.

397
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,620
Am I right, Miss Xu?

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,620
Chen.

413
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,830
Well,

414
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,590
It’s time to eat. Let’s go get something.

415
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,810
-What do you want to eat? -What do you want to eat?

416
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,790
I'll pass this time.

417
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,700
I-I am still onto some documental works.

418
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,860
Don't you also think she's totally unreasonable?

419
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,830
She broke up with me

420
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,140
just for such a trivial thing.

421
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,540
And now she thinks she's right.

422
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,040
This time, I think

423
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,570
Wildcat has got a point.

424
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,150
What do you mean?

425
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,310
Which side are you on?

426
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,120
Grow up, man.

427
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,220
It's not about taking sides.

428
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,430
I'm just judging the thing on its own merits.

429
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,210
Xiaoqi,

430
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,170
In the past, fish had its way to swim,

431
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,910
and shrimps had their ways to swim too.

432
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,830
Whatever ways of swimming they use, it's the right way,

433
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,700
as long as they're able to make it way out through the same path.

434
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,750
But it’s different now.

435
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,020
The path is flat and steady

436
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,990
where everyone all occupies a place.

437
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,920
And sorry,  there's no chance for you

438
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,350
to make a detour from it

439
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,410
because you'd violated the rules.

440
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,380
Besides,

441
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,500
no one can always get to do whatever they want.

442
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,090
Am I right?

443
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,760
No matter how long a bird has flied,

444
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,060
there's always a day when it wants to land, right?

445
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,730
I think Wildcat might be tired

446
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,010
and want to land.

447
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,760
Stop talking nonsense.

448
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,540
Now, go apologize to her.

449
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,990
Your breakup is the nonsense.

450
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,490
And don't do anything stupid.

451
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,840
Listen,

452
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,580
when you were hospitalized,

453
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,270
Wildcat helped you out with all your works

454
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,630
and stayed up every single night.

455
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,760
You didn't know

456
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,120
this pretty girl had got herself into such a mess

457
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,890
of dirt and dusts,

458
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,990
and put up with a bunch of hicks

459
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,320
that you couldn't even recognize her.

460
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,530
Upon seeing this, I thought

461
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,770
that you brat got lucky to be with such a nice girl.

462
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,310
I'm the first one against you,

463
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,600
if you treat her badly.

464
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,070
Besides,

465
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,260
it's great that you still have time to quarrel.

466
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,770
Where are you going?

467
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,970
I've got a date. I'm going to the movies.

468
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,700
It's none of your business.

469
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,490
I'm taking off.

470
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,900
Dates before mates, as always.

471
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,500
Don't go anywhere else.

472
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,340
Don't worry.

473
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,310
Miss Xu, you haven't left?

474
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,200
No.

475
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,660
Go check who is still at home now

476
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,590
and ask them to go to Uncle Jia's.

477
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,820
I have something to tell everyone.

478
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,420
Okay, I'll do it now.

479
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,590
Team leader?

480
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,850
Team leader and everyone come out right now.

481
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,450
Uncle Jia?

482
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,990
Let's all go to Jia's. Miss Xu has something to say.

483
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,770
Aunt Sun? Xu?

484
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,420
You're still here?

485
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,300
Yes.

486
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,700
Hurry up.

487
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,380
Jia.

488
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,820
Xu is here.

489
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,500
Miss Xu is here.

490
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
-Miss Xu. -Miss Xu.

491
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,020
Uncle Jia.

492
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,180
T-T-Thank you so much.

493
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,420
The tap water is running now,

494
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,900
pouring and splashing.

495
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,020
Okay.

496
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,500
Miss Xu.

497
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,050
Please dine at my place tonight.

498
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,980
Okay, everyone, have a seat.

499
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,940
Yes, let's sit and talk.

500
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,420
Come and sit.

501
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,210
Have a seat.

502
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,870
Take a seat.

503
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,900
Mr. Wang told me

504
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,430
that some of you had sued him again.

505
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,200
Please listen to me.

506
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,390
This madness shouldn't go on any further.

507
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,640
It's useless to make such chaos.

508
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,860
The government won't support you

509
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,890
and the steel mill isn't never coming back.

510
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,170
You have to accept the truth now.

511
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,570
As you all know,

512
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,940
the reason why I'm here

513
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,570
is to see the equipment.

514
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,500
In the meanwhile,

515
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,270
I'm also establishing a new steel mill in Binhai.

516
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,160
We really need technical talents like you.

517
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,930
Not until Uncle Jia accompanied me to the steel mill that day

518
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,060
did I realize

519
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,880
that you are the heart of the steel mill .

520
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
So I'm here today

521
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,820
to ask you

522
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,550
if anyone of you

523
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,850
would like to go to Binhai with me?

524
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,260
To the south?

525
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,790
Yes.

526
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,880
So we're leave our hometown?

527
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,080
I know it's hard for you,

528
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,430
but changes can make chances.

529
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,520
We need to stop retrospecting and start prospecting.

530
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,000
I really do hope

531
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,330
that you can go to Binhai with me

532
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,550
and start a new life together.

533
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,480
As long as you are willing to do so,

534
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,560
I'm always welcome.

535
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,090
Let's discuss it, guys.

536
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,010
Mr. Liu and I is staying for these couple days.

537
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,810
We will respect your choices.

538
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,880
Steelmaking is all I can do.

539
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,310
I think this plan might work.

540
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,720
Two.

541
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,100
You bet two.

542
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,540
No, no, no.

543
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,180
You didn't?

544
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,540
No. so you want to make or break?

545
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,940
You've already lost.

546
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,250
Make or Break?

547
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,400
Break it.

548
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,470
Can't you see it on the wall?

549
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,760
No cards in the dorm.

550
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,280
Can't you see?

551
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,750
-Put it away. -Quick, put it away.

552
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,700
Still on a fight?

553
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,920
Chen was here.

554
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,820
He said he's paying us on behalf on Wildcat.

555
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
She gave me the right amount of money.

556
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,320
How about an apology to her?

557
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,300
Give me the money.

558
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,800
That's already my money.

559
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,660
Memorize every details

560
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,670
that's written on the wall.

561
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,370
I'll check it next time.

562
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,000
We'll follow this rule form now on.

563
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:21,830
Understand?

564
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,380
-Don't worry. -R-R-Roger that.

565
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,370
I'll keep an eye on them.

566
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,640
Clean up the mess.

567
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,220
You make it look like a pigsty.

568
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,210
What a mess!

569
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:30,990
Don't forget the m-money.

570
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,020
Uncle Jia, as you know,

571
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,280
it's not easy to build a steel mill now.

572
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,450
To build a good steel mill,

573
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,710
we need better technology

574
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,980
and more technical talents.

575
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,910
I don't know much

576
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,530
about technology.

577
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,260
So I really need you guys.

578
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,260
Miss Xu,

579
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,850
The government has arranged the resettlment housing for us.

580
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,170
And we are now trying

581
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,010
to cope with the working problems for the young.

582
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,440
We don't know

583
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,370
if your mill can be established.

584
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,750
If we go there,

585
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,739
and you say there's no way to make it,

586
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,880
sending us all back

587
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,969
to a place with nowhere to live,

588
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,739
then what should we do?

589
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,820
I'm not sure

590
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,980
if my steel mill can make it or not,

591
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,330
but I have to give it a try.

592
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,810
At least you then will have works to do.

593
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,110
It's better than staying at home and whining, right?

594
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,730
Once you arrive Binhai,

595
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,550
we'll sign the contracts with you immediately.

596
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,020
Don't worry about your life there.

597
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,350
I'll take care of everything for you.

598
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,870
Anyway, you need a job

599
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,440
and I need your talents.

600
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,260
But it's still up to you

601
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,100
Nothing big deal.

602
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,750
[Employment Contract]

603
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,880
Work is still work wherever it takes place.

604
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:46,900
Am I right?

605
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:47,850
Yes.

606
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,719
What about the kids?

607
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,820
There are schools everywhere in the Republic of China.

608
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,870
They can go to any school wherever they are.

609
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:54,639
Well,

610
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,469
We'll figure out

611
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,950
what to do with children's schooling.

612
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,150
It must not be delayed.

613
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,570
In terms of the bidding for the steel mill,

614
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,570
it is supported by the provincial committee government.

615
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,940
We also reported to the provincial steel company

616
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,410
and the industry office or the provincial committee government as well.

617
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,520
Such technical talent like you

618
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,590
are always welcome and approved.

619
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,960
So don't worry.

620
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,310
We'll take care of everything.

621
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,280
Then write it down in the contract.

622
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,190
It's already in the contract sample.

623
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,330
You must not read it thoroughly.

624
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,330
Take a look.

625
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,640
One is about the pensions and nursing of the elderly.,

626
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,160
The other one is about children's schooling issue.

627
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,300
Everything is all covered in the contract.

628
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,410
But the public health care insurance isn't included.

629
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,300
What do you need that for?

630
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,940
When you hurt your head couple days ago,

631
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:37,930
who was the one report it for you with the medical document?

632
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,690
Go prepare the meal.

633
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,290
You're holding us up.

634
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,930
Here are the dumplings.

635
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,560
-Have some dumplings. -Miss Xu.

636
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,840
I have a question.

637
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,060
The technicians you're recruiting

638
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,770
are all young people like them.

639
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,060
Don't you consider any senior workers like us?

640
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,530
Of course not.

641
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,760
Whatever age you are, as long as you have skills,

642
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,210
you are always welcome.

643
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,660
Of course,

644
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,660
it is exactly what we desire and need,

645
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,840
if technical experts like you can also come.

646
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,570
Really?

647
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,130
Sure thing.

648
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:10,710
Okay.

649
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,190
Actually, in the steel mill,

650
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,360
whether it was the maintenance of blast furnace

651
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,230
or the technical indicator monitoring,

652
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,360
they are all under my supervision.

653
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,980
You can put it this way

654
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,070
that if you randomly pick anyone

655
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,490
from our building

656
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,000
and place them in any steel mill,

657
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,450
these experts can all excel at their works.

658
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,800
I don't know about others.

659
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,720
But now I'm making an official announcement

660
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,860
on behalf of my family,

661
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,030
we'll go with you.

662
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,020
Really?

663
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,740
Yes.

664
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,650
That's great, Uncle Jia!

665
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,380
Do you have a cup?

666
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,380
I'll drink with you.

667
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,140
Sure.

668
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,700
Here you go.

669
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,080
Here.

670
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,250
Here.

671
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,180
Uncle Jia, Aunt Sun.

672
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,950
Jia.

673
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,950
Welcome to my steel mill.

674
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,660
OK.

675
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,130
OK.

676
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
-Thank you, Miss Xu. -Cheers.

677
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,170
That's good.

678
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,020
It's better than staying at home,

679
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,410
moaning and groaning all day long, right?

680
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,200
Right.

681
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,860
Lift higher.

682
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,580
Higher and higher.

683
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,890
Higher. Let's go.

684
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,380
Hurry up. Don't block the road.

685
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,740
Hurry up.

686
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,780
Make a turn here.

687
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,380
Turn it over there.

688
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,220
Over there.

689
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,820
No, no, no.

690
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,380
We need to take a break.

691
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,340
Yes.

692
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,740
Wu, turn right.

693
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,860
Head to the room inside.

694
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,980
Hurry up.

695
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:24,650
Be careful.

696
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,300
Don't twist your wrist.

697
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,750
Why don't you care about me?

698
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,610
I'm sick.

699
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,220
You alright?

700
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,070
or you alright?

701
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,960
-Let’s go. -Come on.

702
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,820
-Come on. -Let's move.

703
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,180
One, two, up.

704
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
Let's go.

705
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,060
Turn. Turn. Slow down, bro.

706
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,040
Come on. Lift higher.

707
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,360
Slow it down. Watch your step.

708
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,240
Okay.

709
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,320
I thought Miss Xu was gone for the equipment purchase.

710
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,230
Why is she  back with so many people?

711
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,980
In the European and American regions,

712
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,620
many things can be done and solved

713
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,780
by the technology and Internet.

714
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,850
Cut the crap.

715
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,290
Why don't you ask the computers to move all these things?

716
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:01,900
No.

717
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,350
Stop talking nonsense.

718
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,520
Just listen to Boss.

719
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,210
Blind followers.

720
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,700
If there's no change made in this era of technology,

721
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,570
you'll lose it all sooner or later.

722
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,370
What do you mean?

723
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,160
You have no faith in Boss now?

724
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,770
It's not that I don't believe him,

725
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,130
I just don't like some people

726
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,650
who are too stubborn to change.

727
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,130
You--

728
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,430
Enough.

729
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,660
There is still lots of stuff downstairs.

730
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,210
Carry on.

731
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,060
No.

732
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,880
Take a rest. We'll do it.

733
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,510
Yes, it's fine.

734
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,670
Stop it and get some rests.

735
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,060
None of your business.

736
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,150
Listen, no one can stop me now.

737
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,750
Whoever stops me today,

738
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,380
I'll tell Fatty when she's back

739
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,110
that you made me do this heavy work here.

740
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,090
Hurry up and move. Cut the crap.

741
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,850
Stubborn donkey.

742
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,630
Paint it evenly.

743
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,950
Do you even know how to do it? Look at you.

744
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,720
Right, you can paint the wall evenly by this.

745
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,830
Come on.

746
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,770
Slow down.

747
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,140
What room will be arranged for us?

748
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,790
Take things as they come.

749
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,610
What if there's no heater there?

750
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,070
It's not that cold in the south.

751
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,980
Okay, take your time.

752
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,380
Slow down. Here's the chair.

753
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,890
Is there any heater there?

754
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,500
Place the cabinet against the wall.

755
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,040
Right.

756
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,020
Don't exhaust yourself.

757
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,140
I'm fine. Go back to work.

758
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,250
Easy there.

759
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,380
Don't worry. I'm fine.

760
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,020
One by one.

761
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,000
Hurry up. Let's go.

762
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,980
Talk to you in a bit.

763
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,860
Slow down.

764
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,790
It's a little cold over there.

765
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,660
Easy. Easy.

766
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,780
Give me a hand.

767
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,500
Give me a hand. Hurry.

768
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,650
Be careful.

769
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,490
Everyone with tickets, listen to me.

770
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,310
The young ones--

771
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,590
It's Mr. Wang's car.

772
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,170
Come here, guys.

773
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:56,990
Why are they here again?

774
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,140
Why do they come again?

775
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,800
Miss Xu,

776
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,420
It's been days. What does he want?

777
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,780
Is he done yet?

778
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,640
Things never end.

779
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,210
What is this?

780
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,660
Dear folks,

781
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,830
don't panic,

782
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,410
Mr. Wang is at absence today.

783
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,980
But he wrote a letter

784
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,970
and he asked me to read it to you.

785
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,460
Dear folks,

786
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,410
Hello.

787
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,910
I know you're leaving today,

788
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,890
and I feel bad not able to see you off in person.

789
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,060
As the old saying goes, "Dumplings are for departing and noodles are for greeting. "

790
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,140
I specially hunted a wild boar

791
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,890
for you to make dumplings

792
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,210
before getting on board.

793
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,430
You won't be able to have dumplings in the south.

794
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,110
It's my fault for the past grudges.

795
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,840
I apologize to you all.

796
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,620
Bow.

797
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,480
No matter what happens

798
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,610
in our hometown,

799
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,040
if you need me.

800
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,020
just make a call

801
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,740
or write me a letter.

802
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,680
I'll do my best to solve the problems for you.

803
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,020
I hope you won't hate me.

804
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,780
Please come back often for visiting.

805
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,010
Sincerely, Wang Dasheng.

806
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,180
Coming.
