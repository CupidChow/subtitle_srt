[Episode 24]

4
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,160
His waking hours are less and less.

5
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,070
Sometimes we can barely talk to him.

6
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,720
I also told Tong

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,750
to put the truck team aside

8
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,180
and spend more time with Chen.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,280
Let me help you.

10
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,760
Tong is quite good now.

11
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,990
I'm not sure.

12
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong?

13
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,220
He accompanies me to the night school recently.

14
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,140
He takes the lessons regularly.

15
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,740
He asked the most questions.

16
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,290
He's almost a role model in our class.

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,520
Isn't that good?

18
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,480
This is not what he wants.

19
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,570
I know he did it for me.

20
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,660
I always forced him to change.

21
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,020
But when he really changed his personality,

22
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,130
I feel bad too.

23
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,930
Am I being pretentious?

24
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,020
It's not your fault.

25
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,520
He's not stupid.

26
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,640
He's willing to change not only because of you.

27
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,329
He must also think it's good.

28
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:44,890
Miss Xu,

29
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,760
do we still need to

30
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,600
pay Mr. Zhao next month?

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,560
Paying him?

32
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,690
Why?

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,930
He hasn't left for half a month.

34
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,710
Shouldn't have he gone to that foreign company long ago?

35
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:03,650
He didn't.

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,840
I heard that the foreign company

37
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,060
has set a provincial agent some time ago.

38
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,570
It's not him.

39
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,190
Is there any misunderstanding?

40
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,980
His transfusion will be finished in half an hour.

41
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,980
He needs a blood test later.

42
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,740
Call me if anything happens.

43
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,710
I'm leaving.

44
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,160
Go. Don't worry.

45
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,380
Hello, Mr. Wu.

46
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,670
Hello, Xu.

47
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,860
What's the matter?

48
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,190
I want to ask you

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,460
something about that American steel company.

50
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,570
What's going on there?

51
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,200
Don't pretend you don't know anything.

52
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,430
I knew the deal between you two.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I also knew your promise to him.

54
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,390
I want to ask you

55
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,290
why he didn't join the company.

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,090
Someone said you two were dating.

57
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,890
I didn't believe it.

58
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,940
It seems that it's true.

59
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,830
Mr. Wu, it's not the right time to joke with me.

60
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,839
I just want to figure this out today.

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,620
Xu,

62
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,550
to be honest,

63
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,640
we do have that deal.

64
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,460
But I'm curious too.

65
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,480
Mr. Hong came to me one day.

66
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,960
He said he went to Zhao Lei with the contract.

67
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,820
Not only did he not sign it, he also told him

68
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,900
not to meet again.

69
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,990
Well, you know,

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,570
to put it bluntly,

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,670
he didn't want to go.

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,300
I don't know if Zhao...

73
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,150

I'm already gone.

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,330
I've taken everything into my consideration.

88
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,640
Unfortunately, I didn't consider

89
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,850
how much this steel mill means to you.

90
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,770
♫There are many things♫

91

♫That won't be easy even though you try hard♫

92
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,320
I have to apologize to you

93
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,630
for the hurt this has caused.

94
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:54,190
♫Take a deep breath, try to let go of yourself♫

95
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,830
I admit that

96
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,050
I lost to Wu Jianjian on the bidding for State No.2 Steel

97
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,770
on purpose.

98
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,630
♫Don't let your obsession hurt♫

99
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,820
According to my prediction,

100
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,140
within three years,

101
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,110
this steel mill should definitely be devalued by more than half.

102
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,230
♫You and me♫

103
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,730
No matter how I count,

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,780
and how hard you work in the future,

105
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,100
it's not a good deal.

106
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,540
And you were just like that, resolutely.

107
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,610
I couldn't stop you no matter what I said.

108
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,430
So in the end,

109
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,310
I can only take this

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,890
unwise solution.

111
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,190
I accept all your anger and blame.

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,590
This is the price I should pay.

113
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,140
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,540
But I want to say,

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,810
leaving everything behind,

116
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,470
I really care about you and cherish you.

117
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,250
I wish things between us

118
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,080
could not be this complicated.

119
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,520
If we were not in the same industry,

120
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,630
and we were just an ordinary couple,

121
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,270
meeting each other by chance,

122
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,200
maybe we could have gain

123
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
the pure love.

124
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,040
And things wouldn't have ended like this.

125
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,220
At this point,

126
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,810
I can only apologize to you again.

127
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,570
I accept that I ruined our relationship.

128
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,040
Please take care of yourself in the future.

-Come here. -Okay.

What's wrong?

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,240
There's something you need to help me with.

146
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,190
Here's the thing.

147
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:48,140
The representatives of an American mechanical manufacturing company

148
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,020
came to China.

149
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,940
After knowing this,

150
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,580
I asked my friend

151
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,940
to contact them.

152
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,990
I didn't expect that I really got in touch with them.

153
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,020
Now they want to meet and talk to me.

154
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,940
The mechanical equipment they make

155
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,120
is definitely from the frontline of the world.

156
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,210
If Miss Xu needs it,

157
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,020
we can contact them directly.

158
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,290
That's great.

159
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,950
It's good.

160
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,600
But how can I talk to them

161
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,880
with my poor Enlglish?

162
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,160
Help me, Xinyi.

163
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,200
Okay, I'll try.

164
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,850
Let's find a place

165
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,920
where I can talk to you in detail.

166
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,780
Okay.

167
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,660
How much have you earned from me?

168
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,590
You don't want me to take the operational right?

169
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,020

336
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,860
our steel industry will also have a lot of chance.

337
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,760
Because there will be a lot of constructions.

338
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,670
So for us,

339
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,870
it's also the spring breeze.

340
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,730
Come on.

341
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,190
Cheers to the spring breeze.

342
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,490
Mr. Sun.

343
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,400
Call me Mr. Wang.

344
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,970
Mr. Wang.

345
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,580
You can't call him Mr. Sun

346
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,550
because I called him "Grandson".

347
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,060
I just saw there's no

348
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,910
your favorite kiwi here.

349
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,270
So I just brought some pineapple and dragon fruit.

350
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,860
Should I get something else?

351
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,740
No, thanks.

352
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,520
I like everything you brought for me.

353
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,630
Let's dig in.

354
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,880
Okay, you too.

355
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,570
I'll get you some fruits too.

356
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,430
You guys enjoy.

357
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:27,930
Have it.

358
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,430
You don't know what I like to eat, do you?

359
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,180
Yes.

360
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,210
What do you like to eat?

361
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,610
But I know what you like.

362
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,500
It's this one, right?

363
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,650
Actually, I want to tell you

364
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,270
I don't need a girlfriend like that.

365
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,630
Don't feel pressured.

366
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,370
Really?

367
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,430
Of course.

368
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,380
Do you really think so?

369
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,050
That's great.

370
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,200
I washed a shirt for you two days ago.

371
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,800
But there were two bumps

372
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,010
on the shoulder after I hung it.

373
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,260
You did it all by yourself later.

374
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,180
I thought

375
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,580
I was useless.

376
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,800
I can't do such a simple thing.

377
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,190
You don't need to know how to do it.

378
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,810
You are good at making money.

379
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,390
You're rich.

380
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,290
You know what?

381
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,660
When I first met you,

382
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,330
I knew what kind of person you were.

383
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,990
I don't need a girlfriend like that.

384
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,240
So you don't have to

385
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,740
change yourself for me.

386
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,300
We just need to relax and be ourselves.

387
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,570
Everyone has their own hobbies.

388
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,070
For me,

389
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,650
you are good enough.

390
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,150
So it's just a shirt.

391
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,620
It's not a big deal.

392
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,520
Nothing to worry about.

393
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,860
You're right.

394
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,430
I'll pay you ten more if I break one.

395
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,060
Right, let's buy a shirt factory.

396
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,980
That's right.

397
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,200
Then I'll get you what I like.

398
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,900
You can eat whatever I like later.

399
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,870
Yes, Boss.

400
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,660
Let's go over there later. There's more over there.

401
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,590
You like this one?

402
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,690
No way. It's so old-fashioned.

403
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,460
This is for your dad.

404
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,260
I'll take this one.

405
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,300
-Okay. -Thank you.

406
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,860
This is nice.

407
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,330
It's almost right.

408
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,540
Yes.

409
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,740
Take these two out from the middle.

410
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,410
Just like you did before.

411
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,710
I'll buy another watch.

412
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,390
For whom?

413
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,940
For Chen.

414
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,700
Chen is quite gentle.

415
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,020
Yes, this one suits him.

416
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,510
Let's exchange.

417
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,410
What's wrong?

418
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:39,880
Why are you grinning.

419
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,950
I've been doing business for so long.

420
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,930
I've always bought gifts for others.

421
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,050
No one has ever bought it for me.

422
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,450
So I'm touched.

423
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,680
I'll be the one who gives gifts to you in the future.

424
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,520
I thought you didn't know how to give others gifts.

425
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,430
You gave me a paper cutter before.

426
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,990
You didn't know that you made me furious that time.

427
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,900
Tell me the truth.

428
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,310
Did you fall in love with me at that time?

429
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,140
Actually, I already had feelings for you

430
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,920
at Luzhou Fair.

431
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,990
But I hid my feelings for you.

432
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,030
So early?

433
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,940
You're quite a profiteer.

434
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,890
You too.

435
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,200
Hello, are you Mr. Su?

436
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,370
Yes.

437
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,420
We are representatives of Will Machinery Manufacturing Company.

438
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,550
Hello. Nice to see you.

439
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,380
We are the representatives of

440
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,380
the Banxia Steel International Trading Company.

441
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,700
Welcome to Binhai.

442
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,700
These are the most advanced

443
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,360
rolling process equipment available.

444
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,030
With these information,

445
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,760
we've met Mr. Qiu and Mr. Wu of State No.2 Steel.

446
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,510
They were not interested.

447
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,220
They were scared when they heard the price.

448
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,370
Their production line is very old.

449
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,500
It's created in the 1960s-1970s.

450
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,860
It will be eliminated in a few years.

451
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,800
And they're not interested in upgrading it.

452
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,720
Gentlemen,

453
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,750
we're very interested in your equipment

454
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,220
and production ideas.

455
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,310
We hope to partner with you as soon as possible.

456
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,900
Communicating with young people is so refreshing.

457
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,530
Here are company information and address.

458
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,070
So if you can come to America one day,

459
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,500
you have to contact us.

460
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,340
Okay?

461
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,600
Thank you. Good.

462
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,090
Thank you very much.

463
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,360
Not bad, Xinyi.

464
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,170
Does Tong Xiaoqi know you can speak English?

465
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,760
What a pity.

466
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,460
What are you talking about?

467
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,760
We don't talk with each other in English.

468
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,120
I mean you are so good at English.

469
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,920
We have no chance to let you play here.

470
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,800
What a pity.

471
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,100
You majored in international trade.

472
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,370
Why don't you study abroad?

473
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,950
I think it's a pity

474
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,770
if you don't go abroad.

475
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,760
[Jiangdong Province Steel Factory]

476
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,580
How's your interview going?

477
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,740
I met the representatives of the head office today.

478
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,950
They gave me the title of

479
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,950
the general manager of the Greater China Region.

480
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,410
I am mainly responsible for

481
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,620
their project plans

482
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,570
in the Greater China Region.

483
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,850
Hello, Banxia?

484
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,470
General Manager of the Greater China Region.

485
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,430
It's good. A big company.

486
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,690
It's better than what our company can offer you.

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,170
Don't just talk about me. How's it going over there?

488
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,620
I rented all the lands near the pier.

489
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,370
Why? What are you going to do?

490
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,600
I want to build my own steel mill.

491
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,730
Your dish.

492
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,010
Let me introduce him to you.

493
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,420
This is Jia Chang'an.

494
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,100
I invited him from Northeast China.

495
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,020
He will be the chief manager

496
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,910
of our new steel mill.

497
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,970
Here, I also want to declare that

498
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,290
our new steel mill in the future

499
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,430
will be called the Universe Steel Mill.

500
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,200
OK.

501
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,170

00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,700
Why didn't you call me

672
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,660
in advance?

673
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,110
Have a seat, please.

674
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,800
Feng.

675
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,140
Make some tea for us.

676
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,670
-Okay. -Miss Xu.

677
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,380
I'm not blaming you.

678
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,300
We had a celebration party

679
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,000
after the bidding session was done.

680
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,840
You didn't even come.

681
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,930
How have you been?

682
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,170
Still the same.

683
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,380
As always.

684
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,820
Storage yard. Steel scrap.

685
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,020
You all know that.

686
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,190
Look.

687
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,750
She's still angry.

688
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,480
But it's good you can be here.

689
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,940
It means that we are still friends.

690
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,320
I, Qiu Bizheng,

691
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,430
only focus on the matters, not on a specific person.

692
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
Don't mention it.

693
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,440
The bidding is over.

694
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,460
Frankly speaking, I'm not good enough.

695
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,380
I'm not capable enough.

696
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,460
Please take care of me in the future.

697
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,440
OK. You two can talk another day.

698
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:54,820
Okay.

699
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,590
Please leave us alone now.

700
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,800
I need to talk to Xu.

701
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,730
You guys continue.

702
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,500
Let's go.

703
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,300
-Please close the door. -See you.

704
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,450
What's up, Mr. Wu?

705
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,670
Nothing important.

706
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,220
I just want to take this opportunity

707
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,510
to talk to you alone.

708
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,080
Your ability and courage

709
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,210
really impressed me.

710
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,790
I'm flattered.

711
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,400
Really?

712
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,580
If what I did before

713
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,320
did anything wrong to you,

714
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,250
don't take it too seriously.

715
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,130
I won't.

716
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,860
Don't say that.

717
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,150
Business is business.

718
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,890
I don't want to hurt our relationship.

719
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,780
So I feel a little bit guilty.

720
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,960
So I have an idea.

721
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,000
Xu,

722
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,520
can you join and invest us?

723
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,860
Let's work together as a team again.

724
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,160
To be honest,

725
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,970
among these people,

726
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,780
I'm partial to you.

727
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,770
Do you believe me?

728
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,160
I do.

729
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,880
But it's inappropriate for me to become a shareholder.

730
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,680
Look.

731
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,990
You and Mr. Qiu and Mr. Feng

732
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,020
have just divided the shares.

733
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,220
Besides,

734
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,530
I really have no money now.

735
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,450
You're poor-mouthing to me, aren't you?

736
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,770
How could you have no money?

737
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,630
Why not?

738
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,150
I'm not lying.

739
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,720
I really don't have money now.

740
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,540
Have some tea.

741
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,180
Do you have other business?

742
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,150
Otherwise, how can there be no money.

743
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,460
The bidding just ended.

744
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,890
I haven't decided yet.

745
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,910
But I'm grateful to you

746
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,270
for helping me with the scrap steel business .

747
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,580
I understand that

748
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,190
it's not easy for you

749
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,260
to run such a big factory.

750
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,820
So I gave you the technicians

751
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,490
I brought from Northeast.

752
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,310
I really hope you can be better.

753
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,180
Don't mention those technicians from the Northeast.

754
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,710
They criticized everything.

755
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,280
There's nothing they are satisfied with in this factory.

756
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,740
They even dislike me.

757
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,620
They said I was rude.

758
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,510
These northeasterners

759
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,380
are hard to deal with.

760
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,240
I personally selected them

761
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,550
from Shenyang Steel Factory.

762
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,550
All of them are skilled.

763
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,080
Their skills are good.

764
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,580
So their words may not sound sweet.

765
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,130
But I think

766
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,900
you should listen to them sometimes.

767
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,090
What if it works?

768
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,100
They must do it for the sake of the factory.

769
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,400
They should first figure out that

770
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,720
this is Binhai, not Northeast China.

771
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,650
Alright, let's not talk about them.

772
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,600
Are you really not coming?

773
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,090
Yes, I'm not coming.

774
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,150
Mr. Wu,

775
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,370
I appreciate your kindness.

776
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:51,860
Thank you.

777
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:04,720
Jia,

778
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,410
as the person in charge

779
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,670
the overseas expedition team,

780
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,290
you will represent the image of the company,

781
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,600
as well as express the company's attitude.

782
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,710
We must learn advanced technology and experience.

783
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,300
If you have a chance to buy machine tools

784
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,580
and invite the senior technicians back,

785
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,540
that will be great.

786
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,840
Do your best.

787
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,740
-Try your best. -I see.

788
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,020
We should strive to cooperate with international first-class

789
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,030
enterprises and factories.

790
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,360
Don't worry, Miss Xu.

791
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,360
I'll complete the task successfully.

792
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:27,410
Do you envy them?

793
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,410
What's there to envy about going to America?

794
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,570
I'll take you to the outer space next time.

795
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,490
-Let's leave the earth. -We're leaving.

796
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,950
You know nothing.

797
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,990
You...

798
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,910
Bye.

799
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,670
Don't worry, Miss Xu.

800
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,350
Good luck.

801
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,560
Tong.

802
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,900
You don't understand how she feels.

803
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,110
Some things can only be experienced

804
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,620
in order to gain that feeling

805
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,480
and experience the shock.

806
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,840
You know nothing.
