00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,660
Miss Xu,

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
I said a bunch of shit

6
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,300
that day outside the detention center.

7
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,900
Don't take it personally.

8
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,860
I just got out.

9
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,539
I was a bit mental.

10
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,010
Well.

11
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,680
You're right.

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,900
Businessmen

13
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,620
have to communicate, right?

14
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,030
We have to talk, right?

15
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,579
What did you say that day?

16
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,970
I... it doesn't matter what I said.

17
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:29,980
Mr. Qiu,

18
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,420
do you know how this fish died?

19
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,290
They must regret

20
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,590
swimming blindly and messing around

21
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,980
that resulted in their death.

22
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,990
They have to be made into dried salted fish even after death.

23
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,420
Is this karma that you said?

24
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,220
Is it?

25
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,260
I mean.

26
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,030
Xu.

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,380
Even if it's karma,

28
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,780
it has to end, right?

29
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,260
Besides,

30
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,330
he's paid enough.

31
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:00,980
It's time you let it go.

32
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,810
Miss Xu, please be generous.

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,060
Can we let this go?

34
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,830
Mr. Qiu,

35
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,250
I didn't expect you to be so ruthless

36
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,540
that you let Guo Qidong

37
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,980
cover it for you.

38
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,370
I really didn't expect it.

39
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,130
I came to pick you up from the prison

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,780
because I wanted to talk to you

41
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,170
and give you a chance

42
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,420
so that we could still do business together.

43
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,970
You had to take the opportunity to insult me.

44
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,540
Now you want to talk business with me?

45
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,900
It's too late.

46
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,820
That's enough.

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,340
Xu, I heard you.

48
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,900
What you just said is right.

49
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,660
Look.

50
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,579
The reason why things have come to this point

51
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,500
is all because of State No.2 Steel.

52
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,810
Right? You see?

53
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,710
It's not good for anyone if we hurt each other.

54
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,780
We have to find a solution, right?

55
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,540
We came over here, we…

56
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,490
We are sincere.

57
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,820
Right?

58
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,100
We've been in business together for so many years.

59
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,300
We know

60
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,140
each other well.

61
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,900
What can't be solved?

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,820
I get it.

63
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,260
What Mr. Wu means

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,220
is that you had already discussed it

65
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,459
and had a plan

66
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,990
before you came here, right?

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,260
That's right.

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,820
Twenty-five percent

69
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,820
for each of us.

70
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,590
It's reasonable, isn't it?

71
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,030
There is one thing that needs to be addressed.

72
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,659
Feng

73
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,409
can't get that much money.

74
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,970
He can only contribute ten percent.

75
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,540
As for the remaining 15 percent,

76
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,490
you, me, and Qiu

77
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,780
will get five percent for each of us.

78
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,500
Is that okay?

79
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,870
Actually, I want all of the 15 percent.

80
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,500
But I can go with

81
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,460
the way you want it.

82
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,300
I should be the chairman

83
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,820
and legal owner too

84
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,380
of this future steel plant.

85
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,280
Xu.

86
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,420
As the big brother,

87
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,700
I have to say whether it's favorable or not.

88
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,940
Have you thought about it?

89
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,500
Can you take on

90
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,620
the future of this steel mill?

91
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,890
It's not like selling steel scrap that you used to do.

92
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,180
The last minute you bought it,

93
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,260
the next you sold it.

94
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,300
This is a business.

95
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,190
A steel mill is a business.

96
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,420
You have to run a business.

97
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,540
Do you know how to run a business?

98
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,650
Do you... have you ever run a business?

99
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,600
Xu.

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,460
You can't

101
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,700
bite off too much to start.

102
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,170
You're in charge, you run the business.

103
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,780
But have you ever thought about

104
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,340
if we, the contributors, feel safe?

105
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,620
Ask Qiu and Feng

106
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,580
if they feel safe.

107
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,800
What's to worry about?

108
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,260
You are the senior.

109
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,800
You can teach me if there is anything I'm not good at.

110
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,820
I promise

111
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,220
we'll do it together.

112
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,620
I will respect very much

113
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,820
every one of my partners.

114
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,510
But this steel mill

115
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,860
must be in the charge of me.

116
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,130
You...

117
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,980
You really don't want to think about it?

118
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,430
You don't want to think about it?

119
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,620
Feng.

120
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,900
Come to my office for a cup of tea.

121
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,500
Boss.

122
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,970
We can't turn it around.

123
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,260
Give up.

124
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,020
Xu Banxia is determined.

125
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,530
There's no way out.

126
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,780
I just made it. It's a bit hot.

127
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,540
Tell me, what happened to you?

128
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,620
There was a fight before the divorce.

129
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,580
Divorce?

130
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,490
You and your Bao'er?

131
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,820
Bao'er did this to you?

132
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,680
She's so feisty.

133
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,740
Why did you get divorced again?

134
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,030
It hasn't been long.

135
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,180
Feng.

136
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,659
Why don't you work with me?

137
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,300
I don't need your money.

138
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,020
It's not that

139
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,500
I don't want to work with you.

140
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,180
Look at the group of us.

141
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,540
We've known each other for so long.

142
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
Xu, do you know why

143
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,740
the businessmen from Binhai

144
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,960
can bloom in the world?

145
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,740
It's because

146
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,460
we're

147
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,650
united.

148
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,940
I'm not trying to persuade you.

149
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,230
I... I...

150
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,390
You make your own decision.

151
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,500
But can you just

152
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,380
reconsider it?

153
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,770
I really just want to help you.

154
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,220
Okay.

155
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,419
If you don't mind and want to help me,

156
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,059
you can

157
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,940
take over my factory.

158
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,470
If I take over your factory,

159
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,260
what should you do?

160
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm just tired.

161
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,380
I want to go back to the village

162
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,970
and enjoy my retirement ahead of time.

163
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,300
Whenever you get tired,

164
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,290
you can come to me.

165
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,520
I'll treat you to green shoots and roast pork.

166
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:02,830
I have to go.

167
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,980
Stay for a longer chat.

168
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,620
No, I have to go.

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,020
Feng.

170
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,140
Do you still believe in love?

171
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,380
How is Chen doing?

172
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,300
Very well.

173
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,680
Zhou Qian has been always with him.

174
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,260
He's very happy.

175
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,010
They even went to a barbecue.

176
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,540
Boss.

177
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,340
I think I should go with you.

178
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,170
I don't feel assured for you to go alone.

179
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,640
I'll take care of the equipment

180
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,300
after this trip to the Northeast.

181
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,000
I will definitely take over the steel mill.

182
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,580
I want Chen to witness that day.

183
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,950
Time is running out.

184
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,030
♫Shenyang, Shenyang, my hometown♫

185
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,230
♫The roads are brightly lit♫

186
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,780
♫The streets and alleys are full of people♫

187
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,170
♫It's dressed up for the holidays♫

188
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,690
♫Socialist skyscrapers♫

189
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,600
♫Stand in old Shenyang♫

190
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,390
♫That's where I've lived all my life♫

191
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,990
♫Rebuilding my hometown from the ground up♫

192
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,180
What are they glued with?

193
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,030
Why is it so hard to pick?

194
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,580
My shovel is flattened from picking.

195
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,140
How much is left?

196
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,700
Quite a lot. Over there.

197
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,740
That wall is full of them?

198
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,860
Full of them.

199
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,220
They glue these every day,

200
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,460
nonstop.

201
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,530
The glue

202
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,120
really holds.

203
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,810
I can't get it off.

204
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,700
They just glue these every day.

205
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,060
They're frozen from the cold day.

206
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,360
How can we pick them all up?

207
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,090
It's so firmly glued.

208
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,270
And I'm told to clean them.

209
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,100
Is this the only side?

210
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,220
There are more over there?

211
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,380
There are plenty on that street.

212
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,050
Which side?

213
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,220
The whole wall?

214
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,980
Yes, that street.

215
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,620
Is there more? Over there?

216
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,800
There's plenty on that street.

217
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,180
Let's get it done and go home for dinner.

218
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,100
-It's so tedious. -I'm sick of it.

219
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,460
Excuse me.

220
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,860
Should I go that way to

221
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,380
the family community of the steel mill?

222
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,530
What are you doing?

223
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,310
I want to see the director or secretary of the plant

224
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,260
and ask him about the factory.

225
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,300
Where are you from?

226
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,390
I'm from out of town.

227
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
Are you a journalist?

228
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,600
Get out of here.

229
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,470
Do you think you can get in with someone else?

230
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,660
What? I don't know what you're talking about.

231
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,290
Who is a journalist?

232
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,060
I'll tell you!

233
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,900
You go back and tell those old men and women.

234
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,570
Make it clear.

235
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,500
It's useless

236
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,140
for them to find a reporter or someone else.

237
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,660
This has to be dismantled. Do you understand?

238
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,140
What's in your purse?

239
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,720
Open it and let me take a look.

240
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,260
What are you doing?

241
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,380
I'll take a look at what's in it.

242
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,180
-Don't touch my purse. -Let me take a look.

243
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,000
Open it. Open it.

244
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,960
Open the purse.

245
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,660
I'm calling the police.

246
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,220
Let me take a look.

247
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,160
Don't you touch me!

248
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,380
-What are you doing? -Open the purse.

249
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,300
-What are you doing? -Bring the purse over.

250
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,060
I'm calling the police.

251
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,090
It's useless to call the police.

252
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,800
What's going on?

253
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,860
What are you doing?

254
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,160
Put the purse down.

255
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,900
Get out of here!

256
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,870
Who told you to tear them?

257
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,830
Who told you to tear them?

258
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,200
Who told you to tear them?

259
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,340
Who told you to tear them?

260
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,700
Who told you to glue them?

261
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,820
Since you can glue them, why can't we take them off?

262
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,460
This is my house, my house.

263
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,060
Who told you to tear it?

264
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,110
So what

265
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,860
that it's your house?

266
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,390
Get out of here!

267
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,060
I'm taking them off

268
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,420
today, what can you do to me?

269
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,500
Stop fighting!

270
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,660
I'll call the police.

271
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,260
This is for you gluing them.

272
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,170
Stop fighting!

273
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,460
I'm calling the police.

274
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,980
Stop it!

275
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,780
I'm calling the police! Stop it!

276
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm calling the police.

277
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,940
Stop fighting!

278
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,420
Okay.

279
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,340
I called the police.

280
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,140
Stop fighting!

281
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:55,980
Stop it!

282
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,460
Stop it!

283
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,740
Get out of my way!

284
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,380
Stop it!

285
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,850
Stand still!

286
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,580
Stand still!

287
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,220
Stand still!

288
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,860
Move!

289
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,740
Shut up.

290
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,180
Move!

291
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,700
Move!

292
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,620
Move!

293
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,100
The woman over there.

294
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,140
Take a message for me.

295
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,050
Building 56, 201.

296
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,370
Take a message for me.

297
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:24,860
Move!

298
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,830
Do me a favor.

299
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,340
Shut up.

300
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,140
You're not supposed to speak.

301
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,420
-Move! -Take a message for me.

302
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,620
Save it for the police station.

303
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,540
Hurry up. Stop fighting.

304
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,180
Stop fighting.

305
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:33,780
Move.

306
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,630
Building 56, 201.

307
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:25,990
Hello.

308
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,860
Who are you looking for?

309
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,580
Auntie.

310
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,780
There was a fight between two groups of people at the intersection.

311
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,140
The police have arrested them.

312
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,560
I think your child is among them.

313
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,359
He asked me to tell you.

314
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,740
Jia, Si has been arrested again.

315
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,420
Hurry.

316
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
-Who said that? -Come in.

317
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,819
Come in.

318
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,859
Come in and tell us.

319
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,109
I... I've finished.

320
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,980
Tell us what's going on.

321
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,579
He... they were...

322
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,530
Come on, girl, sit down.

323
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,660
How many of them were taken?

324
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,420
About five or six.

325
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:29,980
Five or six?

326
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,230
Oh my god.

327
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,780
The police said last time

328
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,060
if they made trouble again,

329
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,580
they'd be detained for 15 days.

330
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,220
15 days?

331
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,990
It looks like they won't get out.

332
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,300
I mean, these kids.

333
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,070
Why did they have to fight for it?

334
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,190
What's wrong with the kids?

335
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,010
It's the fault of these bastards.

336
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,020
It's cold in the station.

337
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,540
What do you think these kids should do?

338
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,180
All right.

339
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,020
Later,

340
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,180
let's go to the police station together.

341
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,900
Let's go get the kids.

342
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,740
Right.

343
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,660
All right.

344
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,900
Go get the kids?

345
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,660
You're looking at it too easily.

346
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,940
Do they have to give you what you ask for?

347
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,020
What else can they do?

348
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,630
Arrest me too?

349
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,310
Come off it.

350
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,740
They can't.

351
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,820
How old are you?

352
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,340
Don't make trouble.

353
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,990
Then what should we do?

354
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,780
We can't

355
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,090
confront the police station.

356
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,300
Let's just sit in front of the police station

357
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,740
all night.

358
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,300
That's right.

359
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,220
All right, all right.

360
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,420
Won't you freeze if you sit there overnight?

361
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,020
Jia, are you coming with us?

362
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,630
If you're not, we'll go.

363
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,060
You see?

364
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,140
Who is it?

365
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,460
Don't think about it.

366
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,740
I told you to move.

367
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,620
Come upstairs.

368
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,300
I'll beat you to death!

369
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,510
All right, all right.

370
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,250
Don't be so impulsive, okay?

371
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,850
Can you solve the problem with that?

372
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,580
That's right.

373
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,380
Even if you go,

374
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,620
they won't let them go either.

375
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,780
I was there.

376
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,020
They did have a fight.

377
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,070
That's a fact.

378
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,960
They don't have any reason to let them go.

379
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,740
Who are you? Which side are you on?

380
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,820
I think she's a relative of his.

381
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,220
She's not.

382
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,660
By the way, kid, who are you?

383
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,580
I'm a businessman from Binhai.

384
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,250
I heard that the factory here is going to be demolished.

385
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,720
So I came to check out the equipment.

386
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,700
It's going to be demolished.

387
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,980
From an outsider's point of view,

388
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,860
you need to find a lawyer

389
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,850
about the demolition.

390
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,370
You need to go through

391
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,310
the legal way.

392
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,780
The factory is going to be demolished.

393
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,740
We can't even make a living.

394
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,310
How can we afford to hire a lawyer?

395
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,660
Besides, it's nothing but a scam.

396
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,020
They're powerful.

397
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,120
It won't change the situation even if you sue.

398
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,490
Water, electricity, and heating have been cut off.

399
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,190
We can't even get paid.

400
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,390
We can't even survive.

401
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,010
How can we afford to hire a lawyer?

402
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,620
It's not that

403
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,620
we haven't thought about getting a lawyer.

404
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,140
But no one is willing to take it.

405
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,700
If you trust me,

406
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,580
I will help you with it.

407
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,700
Why have you been involved in

408
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,160
this kind of thing?

409
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,660
Xu Banxia, I'm telling you.

410
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,540
Don't do anything nonsensical.

411
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,300
You've only been in Shenyang for a few hours.

412
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,380
You don't understand

413
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,780
what's right and wrong there.

414
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,260
I'm telling you. The country is experiencing reform.

415
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,100
The old steel mills are going to be broken up and reorganized.

416
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,800
Then the workers will be laid off.

417
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,740
Those who have been living off the factory

418
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,860
all their lives

419
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,330
will not accept it.

420
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,500
They're going to make trouble

421
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,570
and surround the police station.

422
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,250
Why are you following the ruckus?

423
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,340
I mean, Mr. Zhao.

424
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,700
How can you call this a ruckus?

425
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,780
You weren't there.

426
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,260
Do you know how poor they are?

427
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,260
No water, no electricity, no heating in winter.

428
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,460
Do you know how cold it is here?

429
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,810
I've only been here for a few hours

430
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,860
and I'm freezing to death.

431
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,140
No way.

432
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,190
I can't stand this.

433
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,060
Xu Banxia.

434
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,420
Is your brain damaged

435
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,540
from the coldness?

436
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,220
Do you know

437
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,980
it takes time to file a lawsuit?

438
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,580
Do you have that much time?

439
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,780
Have you forgotten

440
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,660
what you're doing there?

441
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,700
Are you buying the equipment or not?

442
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,460
If you're not, just come back.

443
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,740
Don't get involved.

444
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,910
I want the equipment. And I want to help too.

445
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,820
Tell your lawyer friend

446
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,230
to come to see me at the hotel.

447
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,690
It's okay to carry out the demolition.

448
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,060
But they can't force people like this.

449
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,090
I...

450
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,140
Hello?

451
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,700
Hello? Lawyer Liu?

452
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,580
Yeah, it's me.

453
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,250
I may

454
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,760
need your help.

455
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,940
We are now

456
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,660
connected to the world.

457
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
Welcome to the Internet.

458
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,340
Everything is available on the Internet.

459
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,600
What do you want to see?

460
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,610
I can search for it.

461
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,450
I heard about an island

462
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,700
called

463
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,380
Maldives. It's very beautiful.

464
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,530
Do you have it on the Internet?

465
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,140
Here it is.

466
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:35,560
This…

467
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,730
That's the Maldives?

468
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,160
Yes, it is.

469
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Zhou Qian, come here.

470
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,340
Look.

471
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,550
Oh, my God.

472
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,700
There is indeed

473
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,060
such a beautiful place.

474
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,290
Look at the sea.

475
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,580
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

476
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,130
If I may say so,

477
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,380
it's like

478
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,670
going to heaven, isn't it?

479
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,330
Then you can't go.

480
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,680
I have to go there first.

481
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
It's so beautiful.

482
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,390
We have to go together.

483
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,610
I mean, you just started your job.

484
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,730
You have no annual leave. You can't go.

485
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,570
Su, you can't go either.

486
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,190
You have to

487
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,380
at least

488
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,820
wait for us to get back.

489
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:26,900
That's right.

490
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,320
We'll wait until you get back.

491
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,100
Do you want to go see the sea?

492
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
At the pier?

493
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,410
I'm tired of the mud bank.

494
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,430
I mean the sea in the Maldives.

495
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,670
The sea that's as blue as the sky.

496
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,000
Do you want to go? I can take you there.

497
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,930
I'll do as you say.

498
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,810
Do you have a brother?

499
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,060
Your parents are biased

500
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,660
and

501
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,400
want you to send more money home,

502
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,890
so that he can get a wife?

503
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,390
Don't worry.

504
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,590
You'll have money.

505
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,770
What else do you want to eat?

506
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,260
Let's have some dessert.

507
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,800
Then let's buy some cake.

508
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,700
Okay, sure.

509
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,250
Let's take a picture.

510
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,890
I have to leave something behind.

511
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,180
Why have you been

512
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,090
so strange today?

513
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,420
Strange?

514
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,270
Not at all.

515
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,340
Take your pick.

516
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,730
Let me pick it for you.

517
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,030
I think this is good.

518
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,520
Well…

519
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,520
You don't like it?

520
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:41,930
This is good.

521
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,730
You see?

522
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,570
It perfectly matches you.

523
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,980
Chen.

524
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,490
It's for the wedding photos.

525
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,540
I'll raise money.

526
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,860
What are you talking about, Chen?

527
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,600
I said

528
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:10,730
I'd raise money.

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,940
No, no, I'm not.

539
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,060

00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,300

Let's go straight to shooting.

576
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,620
It's so cold.

577
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,930
Miss Xu is so young.

578
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,660
-Can she do it? -You don't say.

579
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,220
Why hasn't she shown up?

580
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,080
Why hasn't she been back yet?

581
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,240
Is there something wrong?

582
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,380
That's right.

583
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,700
So cold.

584
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,980
Can Miss Xu come back?

585
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,400
How far did she go?

586
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,310
I'm worried.

587
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:06,980
The car is coming. The car is coming.

588
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,740
It's coming! It's coming!

589
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,390
It's coming! It's coming!

590
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,000
Are the children back yet?

591
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,900
Yes, yes.

592
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:18,970
Come out.

593
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,440
Miss Xu, you're back?

594
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,700
Thank you.

595
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,340
Don't thank me.

596
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,980
Thanks to Lawyer Liu.

597
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,990
-Thank you. -It's nothing.

598
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:29,890
Thank you. Thank you.

599
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,060
You're welcome.

600
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,860
Let's get inside.

601
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,930
It's too cold outside.

602
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,730
Thank you for your hard work.

603
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,940
I've made dumplings.

604
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,340
I was waiting for you.

605
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,530
Thank you.

606
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,780
I really appreciate it this time.

607
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,380
We have to thank Mr. Liu.

608
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,430
-That's right. -He helped us.

609
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,140
I understand the situation in general.

610
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,580
The water, electricity, and heating are cut off.

611
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,550
It's a clear violation.

612
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,740
It's a threat.

613
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,150
We can sue them in court.

614
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,850
I was entrusted by Miss Xu.

615
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,380
Of course, if you agree,

616
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,580
I'm happy

617
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,610
to be your lawyer

618
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,370
and help you with the lawsuit.

619
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,460
Before coming here,

620
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,050
I prepared an indictment.

621
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,010
I'll now read it to you.

622
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
If you have no doubt about it,

623
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,790
you can sign it.

624
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,980
No, no.

625
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,220
The water and electricity are not a big deal.

626
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,820
The point is that the factory can't be torn down.

627
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,980
The factory can't be torn down.

628
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,760
What should we do if the factory is demolished?

629
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,560
That's right.

630
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,940
We've contributed to the factory.

631
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,860
It's too immoral.

632
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,700
Isn't it?

633
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,710
It's so immoral.

634
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,180
How can we live if the factory is demolished?

635
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,340
We have to defend the factory with our lives.

636
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,980
We have had feelings for it for generations.

637
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,540
You know that?

638
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,340
We've been doing this all our lives.

639
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,100
Haven't we?

640
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,230
You can't just tear it down.

641
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,700
Am I right?

642
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,300
I'm telling you.

643
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,420
We can't agree to this.

644
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,140
Okay, okay.

645
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,540
Don't make a mess.

646
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
Let's speak one by one, okay?

647
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,580
Miss Xu, Lawyer Liu.

648
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,060
The factory must not be sold.

649
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,870
Not to mention that we, who have been in this factory

650
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,490
for more than half of our lives,

651
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,570
even my son and the young people

652
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,170
have learned the advanced technology

653
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,000
for this steel plant.

654
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,400
Now the learning suddenly halts

655
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,130
before they even have the chance to use it.

656
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,810
The factory is gone too.

657
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,170
What do you want them to do?

658
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,380
Lawyer Liu.

659
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,550
We agree with you

660
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,860
helping us with this lawsuit.

661
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,570
We only have one request.

662
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,820
The factory can't be sold or demolished

663
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,820
That's right.

664
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,590
No, we won't sell it. We won't demolish it.

665
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,530
We are the first generation of steelworkers.

666
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,050
We've lived here all our lives.

667
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,120
It's been a lifetime.

668
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,940
How can we bear it?

669
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,080
-The factory is our life. -That's immoral.

670
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:34,630
After it's torn down,

671
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,180
how should

672
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,460
we live?

673
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,450
Should we live on air?

674
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,260
We'll all be laid off.

675
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,300
Should we live on air?

676
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,140
It can't be demolished.

677
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,540
Did you see that?

678
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,060
What they want is not electricity and water,

679
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,930
but to save the steel mill

680
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,180
through the lawsuit.

681
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
What are the chances of winning?

682
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,460
No chance.

683
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,100
The steel mill is approved and built

684
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:54,880
based on the policy of land buying and selling.

685
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,260
All its procedures

686
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,150
are legal.

687
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,060
Besides,

688
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,890
there is only one last process left,

689
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,690
that is, the demolition.

690
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,360
It's impossible to overturn what's already set in stone.

691
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,210
Can we manage to

692
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,350
get some compensation for them?

693
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,260
The point is…

694
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,980
The point is that this is not what they are asking for.

695
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,710
Then we can increase the compensation.

696
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,420
How high is enough?

697
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,130
How much money can ensure

698
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,380
the future of two generations in a family?

699
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,550
Can you make an appointment

700
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,820
with their real estate agent…

701
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
Bye-bye.

702
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,260
Let's go.

703
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,120
Make an appointment

704
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,340
with the real estate company owner.

705
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,490
I want to talk to them.

706
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,430
It has to be solved.

707
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,540
Miss Xu.

708
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,190
As a friend of Zhao's,

709
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,110
I would like to advise you.

710
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,570
You should leave this alone.

711
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,220
Xu Banxia, have you lost your mind?

712
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,810
Aren't you there to buy equipment?

713
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,020
How come you go all the way

714
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,460
for a lawsuit now?

715
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,830
Get out of this mess right now.

716
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,460
I've already promised them.

717
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,780
I can't get out.

718
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,930
What's the use of your sympathy?

719
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,370
The real estate agent is supported by policy

720
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,140
and contract.

721
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,140
All the procedures are reasonable and legal.

722
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,760
You can't win

723
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,660
the lawsuit.

724
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,670
Reasonable and legal?

725
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,490
Then is it understandable?

726
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,300
Explain to me

727
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,100
what you mean by understandable.

728
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,540
The times are changing.

729
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,860
Can't you see?

730
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,940
Don't you understand?

731
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,620
Think about it.

732
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,460
When you went abroad to import the steel,

733
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,580
after you came back,

734
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,210
you almost went broke by the steel price.

735
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,730
Why could you suddenly turn around?

736
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,180
It's because of the policy change, isn't it?

737
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,900
It's always the same.

738
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,010
Some people gain.

739
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,810
Some are eliminated.

740
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,540
Banxia,

741
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
don't forget about the bidding

742
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,410
now that you're in the Northeast.

743
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,750
Wu Jianshe has been taking action.

744
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,930
We're also working on the bids.

745
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,050
We're waiting for you to come back to discuss

746
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,219
so many details.

747
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,060
Come back, okay?

748
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,219
Are you done?

749
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,699
Are you insane, Xu Banxia?

750
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,500
Do you understand the situation?

751
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,610
You don't even know who you're fighting against

752
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,130
and you just…

753
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,469
I'm not trying to scare you.

754
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,820
You're going to get into trouble sooner or later

755
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,090
if you insist.

756
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,020
Xu Banxia,

757
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,900
when I first joined the company,

758
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,790
we made a deal.

759
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,630
I'm in charge of the company.

760
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,710
Now I'm telling you.

761
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,960
Come back now.

762
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,650
This is not about the company.

763
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,850
This is about me.

764
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,960
Stay out of it.

765
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,020
Okay, if you say so,

766
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,980
I don't care about the bidding either.

767
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,580
I'll quit now.

768
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,639
Let's call it quits.

769
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,510
How dare you?

770
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:49,690
Zhao Lei.

771
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,070
These are two different things.

772
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,620
This is one thing, okay?

773
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:53,730
Xu Banxia, let me ask you.

774
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,659
Who is the bidder for this steel mill?

775
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:56,719
It's you, isn't it?

776
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,000
If something happens to you now,

777
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,620
even if we get the steel mill,

778
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,000
who will be in charge after the bid is awarded?

779
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,830
Me?

780
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I can tell you.

781
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,270
I won't be in charge.

782
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,330
Whoever cares takes it.

783
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,870
Zhao Lei, listen to me.

784
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,310
Leave my business alone.

785
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,160
But you have to take care of

786
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,380
the steel plant bid.

787
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,160
Anyway, you're not going anywhere.

so many tickets.

They've been quite diligent in the past few months.

It's no problem to pay some fines.

00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,140
Gas and maintenance costs.

842
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,300
This costs a month of profit.

843
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,320
Give them a lesson.

844
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,290
How?

845
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,540
They overload because they want the team to earn more money.

846
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,390
Why can't we pay some fine for them?

847
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,380
If you say so,

848
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,950
we should go bankrupt from paying the fine?

849
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,990
Don't say that.

850
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,080
That's how a bunch of old men work.

851
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,350
Besides,

852
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,000
that's how we've been doing it all these years.

853
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,770
Am I broke or am I finished?

854
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,470
Are you going or not?

855
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,260
No.

856
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,250
Fine.

857
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,750
I am.

858
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,540
Why do you go?

859
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,910
So grumpy.

860
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,140
Yours.

861
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:40,820
Yours.

862
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,140
It's all yours.

863
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,110
What's this?

864
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:43,670
Yours.

865
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,380
Yours.

866
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,110
What the hell?

867
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,580
Listen to me!

868
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,860
From now on,

869
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,580
whoever gets the ticket will pay for it.

870
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,320
Boss.

871
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,440
What does that mean?

872
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,180
You don't understand?

873
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,050
I'll say it again then.

874
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,860
From now on, you pay for the tickets yourself.

875
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,120
If not,

876
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,420
I'll deduct it from your salary

877
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,250
and pay it for you.

878
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,210
Do you understand?

879
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,080
Wildcat.

880
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,290
We've been carrying sand a lot lately.

881
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,990
It's normal to have a lot of tickets.

882
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,540
That's right.

883
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,380
Besides,

884
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,740
it's for the sake of the team to earn more money.

885
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,940
So are you justified in that?

886
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,140
So you can

887
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,400
disobey traffic rules?

888
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,560
I think it's because you don't feel bad

889
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,510
with someone cleaning the mess for you.

890
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,660
I don't believe

891
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,650
I can't get rid of your peeve.

892
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,340
Boss.

893
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,160
We didn't mean to do it.

894
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,660
Do you call the shots or her?

895
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,740
Wildcat.

896
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,810
What?

897
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,060
Let's go outside.

898
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,800
Say it here.

899
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,960
Like I can do nothing to you, right?

900
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,430
Tong Xiaoqi. Tong Xiaoqi.

901
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,750
[Top Squad]

902
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,600
Tong Xiaoqi.

903
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,940
Can't you talk properly?

904
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,540
Put me down!

905
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,010
Can you save me some dignity?

906
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,370
Can you continue to work like this?

907
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,580
Why can't I?

908
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,710
What happened to my team?

909
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,610
Did I lose money?

910
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,360
If you spoil your buddies like this,

911
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,750
it's only a matter of time before you lose money.

912
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,940
The team needs to be reformed.

913
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,690
Reform what?

914
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,690
This is the style of my team.

915
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,270
Even if it's hard, we've survived.

916
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,390
It's good for everyone to have fun.

917
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,370
That's all you've got?

918
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,940
Yes, that's all I've got.

919
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,680
So what?

920
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,460
That's fine.

921
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,180
I think

922
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,430
sooner or later, your buddies will have to go to jail.

923
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:11,970
Fuck off.

924
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,310
Don't jinx it.

925
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,310
Good.

926
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,570
Wildcat.

927
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,440
Mr. Zhao,

928
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,490
did Miss Xu call you?

929
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,060
No.

930
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,620
What about Tong Xiaoqi? Did she call him?

931
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,290
I don't know. You'll have to ask him.

932
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,740
Mr. Zhao.

933
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,620
Mr. Zhao.

934
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,180
Can you stop following me around?

935
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,650
Hello, Mr. Zhao?

936
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,250
Hello?

937
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,660
Did Miss Xu call you?

938
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,940
No, I haven't heard from her for a few days.

939
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:18,610
What's wrong?

940
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:19,810
Nothing.

941
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,330
You know what?

942
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,680
Call her now.

943
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,140
Tell her I need to talk to her.

944
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,300
Tell her to call me back as soon as possible.

945
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,350
Okay.

946
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,430
What's going on?

947
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,470
I can't get through to her.

948
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,500
I need to talk to her.

949
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:29,680
Just call her.

950
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:31,840
Mr. Zhao.

951
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,700
I wrote

952
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,900
the rules and regulations of the team.

953
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,420
You're an expert, check it for me.

954
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,020
The team of Tong Xiaoqi

955
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,000
needs to be regulated.

956
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,960
Okay, I'll check it for you.

957
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,290
Hello?

958
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,180
Hello, Mr. Zhao?

959
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,630
Did you get through?

960
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,340
Yes.

961
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,790
Di you tell her I needed to talk to her

962
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,100
and let her call me back?

963
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,260
Yes.

964
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,200
What is it?

965
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,350
Call Miss Xu now.

966
00:41:59,420 --> 00:41:59,780
I…

967
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,730
Call her now.

968
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:09,730
Sister.

969
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,060
Hello, Banxia.

970
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,170
I did…

971
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,230
What's wrong?

972
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,430
Well, leave this here.

973
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:26,940
I'll check it.

974
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,610
I'll tell you when I'm done. You can go back.

975
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,750
Mr. Zhao, um…

976
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:34,850
My cell phone.

977
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,790
I'm sorry.

978
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,030
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

979
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,910
Where is your boss?

980
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:06,870
I need to talk to him.
