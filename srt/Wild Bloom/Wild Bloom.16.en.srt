[Episode 16]

4
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,009
Mom, I just got divorced.

5
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,780
This is also a second marriage for both of us.

6
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,009
Moreover,

7
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,640
I told you not to do it,

8
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,340
but you insisted on doing it.

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,600
Now, this is the result.

10
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,430
Feng Yu.

11
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,700
What do you mean by that?

12
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,020
It is not a good omen.

13
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,290
A wedding.

14
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,910
Don't take it to heart.

15
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,660
Right?

16
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,820
It's just a wedding.

17
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,420
But no matter how much you drink,

18
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,210
I have to be honest with you.

19
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,579
Look at you.

20
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,780
Bao'er and your mother-in-law

21
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,660
are not easygoing.

22
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,140
You start to live together after you get married.

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,180
But you have to take the initiative

24
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,660
into your own hands.

25
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,970
You used to have a backbone.

26
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,230
Now the backbone...

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,329
You know what I mean, right?

28
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,100
It's up to you.

29
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,340
Only the housekeeper knows how high the living cost can be.

30
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,540
So young.

31
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,950
Do you think she can handle it well?

32
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,970
Can she be counted on?

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,770
Don't lose both people and your wealth.

34
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,970
If you lose the factory,

35
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,110
your family will be gone too.

36
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,030
That's not a nice thing to say.

37
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,660
But you have to take it to heart.

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,460
For your own sake, do you know that?

39
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,220
Feng.

40
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,300
Mr. Wu is talking about the problem of

41
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,050
who is truly in charge of the household

42
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,130
in the future.

43
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,810
Look, you married before.

44
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,260
She has never been married.

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,660
You know how life is after marriage.

46
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,650
Does she know?

47
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,470
Mr. Wu just said

48
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,950
she's still a child. What does she know?

49
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,720
So...

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,350
Enough.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
It's his family business.

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,600
Why are you guys meddling with it?

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,340
As for who is in charge of their family,

54
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,270
let Feng discuss it with his family members.

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,220
I like listening to Miss Xu.

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,160
Every word makes sense.

57
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,280
This reminds me of our steel mill.

58
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,980
From a small home

59
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,210
to a big factory,

60
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,770
we all need a backbone, right?

61
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,390
We all need a head of the house.

62
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,140
I still remember

63
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,740
what Miss Xu said that night.

64
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,260
I was very touched.

65
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,350
She said the merchants in Binhai

66
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,100
should not only follow the rules

67
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,220
but also value friendship.

68
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,180
Miss Xu,

69
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,520
it's time for you to show your loyalty.

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,959
Where is friendship?

71
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,820
Stop talking.

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,600
Take a rest.

73
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,300
All right, let's not talk about other things.

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,060
Today, in front of everyone,

75
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,860
in front of so many people.

76
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,409
Miss Xu, let me ask you something.

77
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,550
Can we continue to work together?

78
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,480
Just like what Dong did that night.

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,440
Tell me honestly.

80
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,900
Don't hold back.

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,000
You can say anything, good or bad.

82
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,220
At least let us know

83
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,070
whether you are willing to

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,409
cooperate with us or not.

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,420
OK.

86
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,740
Since you want me to be honest,

87
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,220
I'll say it.

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,890
Okay.

89
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,260
Yes, it's good to work together.

90
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,850
But if we work together,

91
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,180
we should respect each other.

92
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,990
Is the ratio you gave

93
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,350
appropriate?

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,970
Yes, I've come this far as a waste collector.

95
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,540
All of you

96
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,850
must be upset.

97
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,020
I understand.

98
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,090
But I also

99
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,700
work through my own efforts.

100
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,550
I travelled the route to purchase the steel myself.

101
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,020
Even the source from the Heihai

102
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,770
I strive to make it accessible too.

103
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,300
Ask yourself.

104
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,420
Have I ever made any money without you?

105
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,409
Have I ever kept all the profits to myself? Have I ever been selfish?

106
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,500
How much did you earn from me?

107
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,350
Now you don't want me to take the management rights.

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,350
Look down on me.

109
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,260
Mr. Qiu, your factory,

110
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,540
in the past year,

111
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,500
would have been gone long ago without me.

112
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,930
Right?

113
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,590
I don't ask for your gratitude.

114
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,620
But I hope for

115
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,010
a little respect.

116
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,700
She has never kept all the profits to herself.

117
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,010
She has never been selfish.

118
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,560
I can guarantee that.

119
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,200
I told you not to talk.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,380
Take a break.

121
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,420
Xu,

122
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,110
we're not ungrateful.

123
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,970
Judging from what you said just now,

124
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,820
we should thank

125
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,940
for your kindness.

126
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,000
When you went abroad to import steel scrap,

127
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,070
did we

128
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,080
lend you a hand?

129
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,870
We knew you had no money,

130
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,110
but still took you there.

131
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,990
And you should remember

132
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,590
when you couldn't pay the deposit.

133
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,950
Did I say that?

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,460
I said I'm your big brother.

135
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,360
I'll pay the deposit for you.

136
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,520
The truth, right?

137
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,090
If we're talking about gratitude

138
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,890
we should start from the beginning.

139
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,500
It's not necessary to start from the beginning.

140
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,480
You are just being dominant with your words.

141
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,700
You stand on the moral high ground

142
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,160
and you earn all the profit.

143
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,570
In the end, I'm the guilty party.

144
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,930
You all despise me from the bottom of your hearts.

145
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,670
Now you're telling me about friendship.

146
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,730
Don't you feel embarrassed?

147
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,900
You need to earn the respect yourself.

148
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,580
Yes, you have to get face yourself.

149
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,820
Xu Banxia, who do you think you are?

150
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,260
Didn't we show you dignity?

151
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,580
Didn't we show you respect?

152
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,620
You came to the dinner.

153
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,180
I even picked you up personally at the door.

154
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,420
What else do you want me to do?

155
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,380
I really want to hold a mirror

156
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,430
and show you

157
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,900
how arrogant you are.

158
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,409
Who do you think we are?

159
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,980
Your followers, your boys.

160
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,080
Your minions.

161
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,630
You're so funny.

162
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,070
Well, since we've come to this point,

163
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,710
I'll make a decision today.

164
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,990
I won't cooperate with you

165
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,590
on the sources of imported steel scrap.

166
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,540
If you need my storage yard in the future,

167
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,260
you're always welcome.

168
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,260
The price is still the same as that of friends and family.

169
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,840
I wish you all a prosperous business

170
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,850
and prosperous fortune in the days ahead.

171
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,660
Did you see that?

172
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,260
You all don't understand me.

173
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,480
You all don't understand me.

174
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,930
No one understands me.

175
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,480
Do you think I've gone too far today?

176
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,050
Yes.

177
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,340
Did you see how those old guys

178
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,300
reprimanded me

179
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,300
at the dinner table?

180
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,620
They just look down on me.

181
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,140
Today, I want them to know

182
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,060
who is in charge and who is the boss.

183
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,900
Without the sources of imported steel scrap,

184
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,970
they are nothing.

185
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,340
So have you vented your anger?

186
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,140
They should know today

187
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,970
who the boss is.

188
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,010
And then?

189
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,220
Did you ever wonder if they would have looked down on you

190
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,640
two years ago?

191
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,740
They couldn't see you.

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,620
Yes.

193
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,630
They scolded you

194
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,470
at the dinner table today

195
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,740
because they were afraid of you.

196
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,180
'Cause you make them

197
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,100
feel threatened.

198
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
'Cause you are strong enough.

199
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,690
I think at this moment

200
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,020
we should sit down and talk.

201
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,600
Talk nicely.

202
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,580
Only then,

203
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,000
the steel mill can be more secure.

204
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,040
As the saying goes,

205
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,370
there are only permanent interests in business,

206
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,150
There are no permanent enemies.

207
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,890
Of course,

208
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,190
we don't have friends forever.

209
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,140
Are you going to be that kind of person?

210
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,570
What kind of person?

211
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,740
Well,

212
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,220
a scary person.

213
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,470
Are you afraid of me?

214
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,460
I...

215
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,190
It depends.

216
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,380
When?

217
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,020
Do you want to ask

218
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,670
is it this moment?

219
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,670
Yes.

220
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm asking you

221
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,420
are you afraid of me now?

222
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,290
Who is so ignorant?

223
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,580
Hello, boss.

224
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:18,980
What's up?

225
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,810
Something happened.

226
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,420
Chen was taken away by the police.

227
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,190
Find someone to ask what happened.

228
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,010
Yes.

229
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,600
Yes, it's ours.

230
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,140
Okay, I got it.

231
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,950
Thank you and sorry for the trouble.

232
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,500
Okay.

233
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:35,980
Okay.

234
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,020
Okay, bye.

235
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,620
There are reports of weapons possession and arms smuggling

236
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,380
in your storage yard.

237
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,820
The provincial inspector came down for a raid.

238
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,460
Arms smuggling.

239
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,850
Are you kidding?

240
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,340
I've got all the paperwork here.

241
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,210
Who reported it?

242
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,120
Anonymous.

243
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
It is true that in the past few years,

244
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,960
some foreign dealers did

245
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,320
pass away the sham as the genuine.

246
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,530
The country is quite strict about this.

247
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,000
Most importantly, these foreigners

248
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,670
are too lazy to turn these large pieces of steel

249
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,600
into scrap.

250
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,660
You didn't go to the warehouse

251
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,140
during the recent purchase of goods, did you?

252
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes, Chen was in charge of it.

253
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,310
When I went to the storage yard,

254
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,540
I found

255
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,540
some well-preserved grenades.

256
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,800
I was wondering

257
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,460
if these things can function well

258
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,300
after replacing some parts.

259
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,780
And those tanks.

260
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,900
Parking there in a row.

261
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,110
It's quite impressive.

262
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,690
The boundary is also vague.

263
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,500
Look.

264
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,520
We are legal.

265
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,780
Yes, it's legal.

266
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,100
On the customs clearance documents,

267
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
it states steel scrap.

268
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,130
Then as for the weapons in the warehouse

269
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,190
How should we define them?

270
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,270
Should we define it as steel scrap

271
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,550
or arms?

272
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,810
It's a toss-up.

273
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,420
What about Chen? What did they say?

274
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,180
Chen, they said he isn't under detention.

275
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,300
Just to assist in the investigation.

276
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,480
The key is you.

277
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,540
They need you to go

278
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,940
to the police station tomorrow.

279
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,100
OK.

280
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,250
I'll go with you.

281
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,350
No need.

282
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,540
This is...

283
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,600
a tank. A main battle tank in the past.

284
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,150
It weighs 32 tons normally.

285
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,980
They sold as 26 tons.

286
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
'Cause there are many belts and instruments

287
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
made of alloy.

288
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,690
They are useless even when they are melted.

289
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,980
You don't need to talk about the business with me.

290
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,140
Yes, sir.

291
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,380
Why are these all weapons?

292
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,430
I imported them as steel scrap in Heihai.

293
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,250
I follow the national guide.

294
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,220
Not all of them are weapons.

295
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,710
The other day I also imported some

296
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,970
large-sized agricultural harvesters.

297
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,020
Don't you need to write clearly

298
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,450
in your customs declaration documents?

299
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,510
Can I take a look at the letter of accusation?

300
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,020
Do you think you can read it just because you want to?

301
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,440
Answer me properly.

302
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,260
OK.

303
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,050
I've always been in the junk business.

304
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,340
For example, that waste paper.

305
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,000
It may be a book,

306
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,690
or newspaper.

307
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,240
Whatever it is,

308
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
it will eventually be thrown into the pool of paper making

309
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,970
and turn into paper pulps.

310
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,220
It's the same with steel scrap.

311
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,620
My previous sales records are here.

312
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,100
Why don't you check if

313
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,480
somebody bought it

314
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,280
for steel making

315
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,870
or to start a war?

316
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,740
For instance, someone hurts others with a kitchen knife.

317
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,450
The kitchen knife seller is not guilty.

318
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,100
It's just a kitchen utensil.

319
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,430
Fine.

320
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,790
You don't have to teach us the law.

321
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,270
We'll give you an answer whether you're guilty or not.

322
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,700
Then what are these?

323
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
K-Katyusha.

324
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,780
What? I didn't hear it.

325
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,740
Katyusha.

326
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,900
It's a multiple rocket launcher.

327
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,440
Isn't there a song?

328
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,940
[When pear blossoms across the cliff]

329
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,540
[A gauze floats on the river]

330
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,650
[Katyusha]

331
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,220
Your company's account books and purchase orders

332
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,960
are now investigated and collected as evidence.

333
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,540
During the investigation,

334
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,180
your company's headquarters

335
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,740
and other subsidiaries

336
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,900
are not allowed to operate normally.

337
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,310
The funds in your company's account

338
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,310
will also be temporarily frozen.

339
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,250
But it is not yet determined.

340
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,900
Why don't we discuss it again?

341
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,660
Give us some time.

342
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,040
It is up to the doer to undo the knot.

343
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,080
You should know

344
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,570
better than us, right?

345
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,740
Mr. Wu.

346
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,740
Mr. Zhao.

347
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,700
Have a seat.

348
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,310
What happened between us is behind us.

349
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,980
Why can't we talk over the phone?

350
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,250
-Sit. -You make it so formal.

351
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,700
Have a seat.

352
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,560
I'll sit.

353
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,980
This is a big deal after all.

354
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,720
It concerns everyone's interests.

355
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,570
So,

356
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,430
I'd better tell you in person.

357
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,940
Do you know that the storage yard is closed?

358
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,900
Everyone knows.

359
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,950
I have goods in there too.

360
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,770
Our company was reported

361
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,680
that we smuggled arms.

362
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,250
Customs and police

363
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,930
Even the army was alarmed.

364
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,100
What a big deal.

365
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,630
Now we're waiting for the evaluation.

366
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,950
Seriously?

367
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,210
Didn't you import the remaining steel scrap in World War II?

368
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,340
Besides, you didn't import

369
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,120
guns and bullets.

370
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,670
I think it's fine.

371
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,850
The country will find out soon.

372
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,890
Yes.

373
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,540
I believe

374
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,010
the government will find out soon.

375
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,370
But if the company's credit is questioned,

376
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,900
the account will be blocked.

377
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,140
If we continue to delay,

378
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,330
we won't be able to participate in the bidding of No.2 Steel.

379
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,630
I just think the timing

380
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,300
is too coincidental.

381
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,740
Mr. Wu,

382
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,370
What do you mean?

383
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,910
Are you suspecting me?

384
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,590
Foreigner, you suspect me?

385
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,310
Mr. Wu, take it easy.

386
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,140
Since it's such a big deal,

387
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,910
it is reasonable

388
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,800
if I think further a bit, right?

389
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,740
Mr. Zhao, let me put it this way.

390
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
I transferred from the army.

391
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,050
I got two sets of clothes and one blanket.

392
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,500
I was assigned to be a captain in a transportation company.

393
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,020
I worked day and night. Not much money I earned by then.

394
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,849
But I received a bunch of letters of complaints.

395
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,020
I hate people who stab me in the back.

396
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,620
That's why I quit.

397
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,090
I'm a bad-tempered person,

398
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,430
but I have a good character.

399
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,140
I earn money with fair and square.

400
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,060
I don't need to play dirty

401
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,840
for my business.

402
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,650
Mr. Wu,

403
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,220
since you've said so,

404
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,980
I know

405
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,540
who did this.

406
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,460
There's one more thing.

407
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,860
I think only Mr. Wu can

408
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,460
handle it.

409
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,570
Do you think

410
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,200
Miss Xu and Mr. Qiu...

411
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,700
Mr. Wu. You need to attend to the matter personally.

412
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,690
Talk to Mr. Qiu.

413
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,680
We can't keep the storage yard closed forever.

414
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,900
Mr. Zhao, I'll be honest with you.

415
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,020
You heard it.

416
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,670
Xu Banxia means that

417
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,890
she won't let me take part in

418
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,020
the steel scrap business anymore.

419
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,810
Now the storage yard is closed.

420
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,140
What do you want me to do?

421
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,170
By the way,

422
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,420
the conflict between Xu Banxia and Qiu Bizheng

423
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,980
is not something in a short period.

424
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,980
I don't want to get involved in such things.

425
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,930
Mr. Wu, I'm here today with sincerity.

426
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,240
Let me make a statement.

427
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,090
In Binhai,

428
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,910
the most prosperous company

429
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,350
is Banxia Steel International Trading Co., Ltd.

430
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,220
I'm sure

431
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,080
no matter which company we join

432
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,380
to bid for the No.2 Steel,

433
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,900
the company will have no worries

434
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,970
about their finance.

435
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
So with the strength of our company,

436
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,610
didn't you give us too little before?

437
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,700
How about you give it a reconsideration?

438
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,500
You're really rich.

439
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,040
Your friendship for so many years

440
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,880
was gone just because of the No.2 Steel.

441
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,240
It's a pity.

442
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,340
If you must

443
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,370
contract the State No.2 Steel,

444
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,950
I hope you can guide her a little.

445
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,040
Foreigner,

446
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,490
you don't look like an employee.

447
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,230
Xu Banxia is really lucky.

448
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,320
Do you like her?

449
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,030
Mr. Wu, when you take money from someone, you should be loyal to them.

450
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,790
I understand that.

451
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,540
I'm with you on this.

452
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,610
Are you okay?

453
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,060
I'm fine. I didn't sleep well in there.

454
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,980
You haven't coughed blood these two days, have you?

455
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,180
Fatty is here. Don't talk nonsense.

456
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,900
How should we deal with this?

457
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,500
Boss will handle it. Leave it.

458
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,090
-What’s wrong? Why are you coughing? -I’ll drive.

459
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,660
I'm fine.

460
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,350
I guess it's just winter.

461
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
I got cold in the storage yard.

462
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,300
Bronchitis.

463
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,060
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

464
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,300
I'm fine. I took some medicine there.

465
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,050
I guess I'm just underdressed.

466
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,180
The air is leaping upward a bit.

467
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:31,820
Well...

468
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,470
What's wrong?

469
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,100
Chen.

470
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,370
What's wrong?

471
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,340
Thank you for coming.

472
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,340
I'm here to pay you back.

473
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,180
And the phone.

474
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,070
The money... is all I have now.

475
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,210
My brother took them all.

476
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,300
The balance

477
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,340
I'll pay you back later.

478
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,820
I've never used the phone.

479
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,530
I only received a text message from you today.

480
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,220
These are all from me.

481
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,660
I was very happy when I gave them to you.

482
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,220
I don't want to take back this happiness now.

483
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,260
Chen,

484
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,390
you know that I'm actually a...

485
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,160
I know.

486
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,120
As long as you don't tell me,

487
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,180
you aren't.

488
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,670
Sit down for a while.

489
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,760
Do you like me?

490
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,120
Don't you like me?

491
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,390
I like you.

492
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,870
[There is a moment]

493
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,420
[I think there's no more merriness]

494
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,640
[In the world]

495
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,650
[Apart from love and loneliness]

496
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,660
[There is a moment]

497
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,210
Chen, how are you doing?

498
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,240
[I know that the heart can't hold on to anything anymore]

499
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,580
Why are you hospitalized?

500
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,690
I've been in poor health since I was a child.

501
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,770
[Nobody is beside me]

502
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,090
I've been having some trouble lately, and that's it.

503
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,160
[Apart from grievance and helplessness]

504
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,740
I just need some rest.

505
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:07,580
I'm fine.

506
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:08,940

then supplement it with chemotherapy.

601

[Infinite loop]

676
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,020
Boss.

677
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,900
Why are you looking for me?

678
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,450
Chen's girlfriend.

679
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,340
What's her name?

680
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,790
Don't mention it.

681
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,810
She's a marriage scammer.

682
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,880
What happened?

683
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,690
She's a liar.

684
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,570
Chen didn't want you to worry,

685
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,040
so he didn't let me tell you.

686
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,610
And that's why I didn't tell you.

687
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,160
Chen is stupid and stubborn.

688
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,270
He knew it was a marriage scam,

689
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,470
but still

690
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,820
spent so much money and treated her so well.

691
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,910
Do you know where she is?

692
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,160
Can we find her?

693
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,850
Why?

694
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,580
I'm just asking if you still know her whereabouts.

695
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,310
I hit her two days ago.

696
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,880
I guess she went somewhere else.

697
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,000
Where did she go?

698
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,870
We must find her today.

699
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,409
No, she's just a liar.

700
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,469
Why are you looking for her?

701
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,550
Chen likes her.

702
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,030
Do you understand?

703
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,650
Here.

704
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,570
Two men and five women.

705
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,020
They moved here a few nights ago.

706
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,080
Knock.

707
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,050
Who is it?

708
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,070
Me, Mr. Five.

709
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,180
Mr. Five, what do you mean?

710
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,620
You again?

711
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:26,870
You've hit me.

712
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,180
We are all gangsters.

713
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,520
We've been hiding out here.

714
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,210
Don't bully us too much.

715
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,870
Where is she?

716
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,900
Who?

717
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:35,710
Zhou Qian.

718
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,390
That’s my sister. What do you want?

719
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,520
Call her out.

720
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,080
Hurry up.

721
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,430
Who let you out?

722
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,670
I’m here.

723
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,600
Are you Zhou Qian?

724
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,450
Yes.

725
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,340
I need to talk to you.

726
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,810
Come with me.

727
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,010
Be good. I won't do anything to you.

728
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,170
-Mr. Five, you... -Stay out of it.

729
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,010
He's crazy.

730
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,670
I didn't dare to mess with him, but you did.

731
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,340
Don't blame me for not persuading you.

732
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,970
I want to talk to you about Chen.

733
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,370
I've returned

734
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,460
all his things.

735
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,450
To be honest,

736
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,280
I've exchanged them for money.

737
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,890
But I didn't ask

738
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,150
from him.

739
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,750
He forced me to take them.

740
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,520
I already handed in the money.

741
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,510
I paid him back my part.

742
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,710
I told him that

743
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,440
we all work for others.

744
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,340
I won't contact him anymore.

745
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,410
I won't contact him again.

746
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,740
I definitely won't contact him again.

747
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,170
It's not about money.

748
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,550
It's not illegal, is it?

749
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,440
What do you think?

750
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,360
No, I really didn't break the law.

751
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,720
The matchmaking agency

752
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,770
asked us to provide information and meet the customers.

753
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,780
How much do you get for each customer?

754
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,400
Some customers

755
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,630
are handsy.

756
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,530
You have to...

757
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,080
You have to find someone to stop him.

758
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,790
How much?

759
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,220
About 2,000.

760
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,710
Two thousand.

761
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,510
You live in Lizhou City, Xixia Town, Rui Tan Street,

762
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,240
Unit No.2, Street No.3, No.52.

763
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,560
You have a younger brother.

764
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,730
Your father works outside.

765
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,730
Your mother brought you up.

766
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,370
Right?

767
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,250
W-What do you mean?

768
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,960
I won't make things difficult for you.

769
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,620
What do you think of Chen?

770
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,610
I think he's nice.

771
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,060
I really think he is.

772
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,400
He never fools around with me.

773
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,310
He doesn't even talk nonsense when he's drunk.

774
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,310
Even our sisters

775
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,520
like him very much.

776
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,010
Do you like him?

777
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,240
I...

778
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,740
People like him

779
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,260
is just playing with us.

780
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,880
He's from the city.

781
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,730
He has a car and he's rich.

782
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,740
Why did he come to a matchmaking agency to meet a girl?

783
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,370
How would he know you if he didn't go to the agency?

784
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,670
We grew up together.

785
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,570
He has a blood disease.

786
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,880
He can't get married with that disease.

787
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,870
So he has never

788
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,960
been in a relationship.

789
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,530
You were the first one.

790
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,260
But you lied to him.

791
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,720
Right?

792
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,690
Let's get down to business.

793
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,600
You earn 2,000 yuan a month.

794
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,110
I'll give you 10,000 yuan a month.

795
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,350
You just date Chen.

796
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,410
What do you think?

797
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,420
I date him. You give me money.

798
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:39,920
Yes.

799
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,010
I pay you to date him.

800
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,360
Go shopping, watch movies and have meals with him.

801
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,760
Entertain him.

802
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,450
You're good at

803
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,200
these lovey-dovey things.

804
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,100
Don't think you need me to teach you.

805
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,430
You must also dress

806
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,980
according to Chen's preference.

807
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,330
I'll pay for all expenses incurred.

808
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,920
If you think it's okay,

809
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,680
I'll prepare a contract.

810
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,220
Just sign it.

811
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,580
It's settled then.

812
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,900
Chen is a good man.

813
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,420
He won't bully you either.

814
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,770
You don't have to worry

815
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,820
what he will do to you.

816
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,290
If you agree,

817
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,750
I can pay you some money first.

818
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,250
What if I don't agree?

819
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,670
Do you know what you do for a living?

820
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,730
-You’re a liar. -Are you threatening me?

821
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,420
I want 20,000.

822
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,440
20,000?

823
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:41,840
Yes.

824
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,200
OK.

825
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,350
That's a deal.

826
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,190
Will he agree?

827
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,760
Chen still likes you.

828
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,180
Otherwise, how could you

829
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,280
scam money from him before?

830
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,160
You can rest assured about that.

831
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,820
Any other requirements from your side?

832
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,270
Don't let him know that I hire you.

833
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,050
Be nice to him.

834
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,760
I want him to be happy.

835
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,410
Let me introduce her formally to you.

836
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,440
My girlfriend, Zhou Qian.

837
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,380
Zhou Qian.

838
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,430
This is the boss of our company

839
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,340
who I always mention to you.

840
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,690
