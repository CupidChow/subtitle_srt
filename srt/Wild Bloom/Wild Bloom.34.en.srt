[Episode 34]

4
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,650
We are the China Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau in Luzhou.

5
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,530
My name is Li Zhuo.

6
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,430
They're my colleagues from

7
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,800
the Economic Investigation Bureau of Jiangdong Provincial Department.

8
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,229
According to the newly revised customs law

9
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,870
and the Fourth Amendment to Criminal Law,

10
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,150
you're suspected of smuggling

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,620
with the fact that you've applied for false quotas,

12
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,230
by registering several shell companies,

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,039
importing steel scrap from overseas

14
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,280
since 1996 until now.

15
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,260
We'll have to investigate and question you according to the law.

16
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,860
The procedure will be recorded on audio and video.

17
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,410
We hope you can cooperate.

18
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,930
First of all, we need you

19
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,450
to provide all the information on the entry and exit customs since 1996

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,880
in as much detail as possible.

21
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,000
We went to the north in 1996.

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,340
As soon as we got on the train, it started snowing heavily.

23
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,110
It was snowy.

24
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,820
Mr. Wu,

25
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,510
you have always been my boss.

26
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,260
You've been taking care of me since I started my career.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,870
I've been in business with you for so many years.

28
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,090
Mr. Wu, it's a deal.

29
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,060
Take me on board.

30
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,810
I can take 15,000 tons.

31
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,470
When the sun came out,

32
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,720
the snow was dazzling.

33
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,620
But what I saw

34
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,740
was all gold.

35
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,480
I kind of felt like

36
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,080
a great man of the time.

37
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,930
The journey there

38
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,720
lasted for two weeks.

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,900
It was just after the New Year

40
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,050
in the north,

41
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,460
and in time for

42
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,010
a festival called “Chris" or something.

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,810
This is the way they treat the guests here.

44
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,530
One bite of bread, one bite of salt.

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,300
But I know

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,860
this should be the highest courtesy

47
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,460
of hospitality.

48
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,850
You have to break it up and eat it.

49
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,260
I've prepared all the rooms upstairs too.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,570
I'll prepare the food and wine for you downstairs.

51
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,360
When you're done unpacking, come downstairs and let's eat.

52
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,470
I thought people there in the north were kind and warm.

53
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,450
I didn't expect

54
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,040
we could be fooled by them.

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,990
It cost less than 90 US dollars

56
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,910
altogether,

57
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,480
which is equivalent to

58
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,270
750 yuan,

59
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,600
to ship the steel scrap from the north to China.

60
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,030
While the price of imported steel scrap in China

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,800
was 1,300 yuan.

62
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,950
That's a big price difference.

63
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,570
Except for the difficulty to get the import quota,

64
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,770
it was a steady profit

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,140
as long as we got the goods.

66
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,170
These are not steel scrap.

67
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,020
These are quality steel coils.

68
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,660
It's chaotic here in the North.

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,610
They mix these with scrap steel

70
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,380
and sell them together.

71
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,140
After you've checked out the contract,

72
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,990
sign it,

73
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,480
and the goods can be shipped out tomorrow.

74
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,100
50,000 tons it is.

75
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,730
When we arrived at the steel mill,

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,230
we were shocked.

77
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,960
That wasn't scrapped steel.

78
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,940
It was all good steel coils.

79
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,310
It was a heavy-industrial country.

80
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,480
They were developed in that way.

81
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,070
From a distance,

82
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,420
it was a mountain of steel.

83
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,870
Spectacular.

84
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,150
After being cheated,

85
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,060
me, Wu Jianshe, Qiu Bizheng, Feng Yu,

86
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,670
the four of us

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,490
all wanted to go back to China

88
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,040
for the New Year.

89
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,500
But Xu Banxia didn't want to.

90
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,360
She had a lot of debts at that time.

91
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,760
She couldn't solve the problem even if she came back.

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,000
So she was ready to risk everything.

93
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,590
Mr. Guo,

94
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,170
forget about the investment.

95
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,140
I don't accept it.

96
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,470
It'll still be my loan from you.

97
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,600
Interest will be paid as usual.

98
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,930
I can take it.

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,350
And then the four of us

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,790
went back to China first,

101
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,650
while Xu Banxia

102
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,270
stayed there alone.

103
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,020
You know we won't agree upon

104
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,100
the conditions you proposed.

105
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,950
As for the 50,000 tons you ask for,

106
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,340
that's off the table.

107
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,700
She was really lucky.

108
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,310
She met Nina again.

109
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,310
Nina took her

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,770
to a port on the Black Sea.

111
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,580
In the mist and smoke,

112
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,350
some big trucks came up to her.

113
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,480
What was on them

114
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,030
were scrap tanks.

115
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,830
What I mean is

116
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,659
let's make money together.

117
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,510
I've placed an order for the second shipment.

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,530
It's 100,000 tons.

119
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,090
I hope we can

120
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,220
chip in

121
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,440
and try to consume the shipment.

122
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,480
In those years, there were large quantities of scrap

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
coming in and out of her yard every month.

124
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,240
And the price of steel was going up all the time.

125
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,780
She made a complete fortune

126
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,820
by this

127
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,490
among us.

128
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,090
Xu Banxia led us to do this.

129
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,330
Miss Xu, Mr. Wu.

130
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,280
It seems that our last explanation

131
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,560
haven't been accepted.

132
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,800
The prosecutor's office has officially filed a complaint.

133
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,210
It's such a big

134
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,080
and crowded world.

135
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,520
Tell me.

136
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,420
I just want to retire to the countryside.

137
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,830
How do I get into such big trouble?

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,610
I was hoping that this would pass,

139
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,570
so the company could still come into the market.

140
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,350
Now it's good.

141
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,580
Instead of coming into the market,

142
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,590
we have to go to court.

143
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,330
We have carefully studied the relevant laws and regulations.

144
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,620
As long as all of you,

145
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,820
including Guo Qidong,

146
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,540
can unify your voices

147
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,070
and resolutely not admit guilt.

148
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,840
You can't be found guilty of intentional smuggling.

149
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,750
The court will likely find you not guilty.

150
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,370
But if all four of you plead not guilty

151
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,200
while Guo Qidong does,

152
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,470
and the court finds us guilty of smuggling,

153
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,010
then we will face a heavier punishment and sentence

154
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,920
because of the plea of not guilty.

155
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,130
I have extremely bad luck.

156
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,620
Some time ago,

157
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,990
I was accidentally involved in

158
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,360
the tax evasion.

159
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,220
And now,

160
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,910
smuggling too.

161
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,940
I've been careful

162
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,080
most of my life.

163
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,130
Why should I end up like this?

164
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,950
Who do you blame for this?

165
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,660
You have to thank

166
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,570
the trusted subordinate you've promoted.

167
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,700
From the time he embezzled money from you,

168
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,220
I told you he had a problem with his character.

169

He has ideals, he has ambitions.

He even read books and newspapers

and watched news broadcasts in prison.

181

He also made a plan for the steel mill.

You just wouldn't believe me.

You refused to take him on board.

184

we have two options.

312

One is to open the skull,

and remove the blood clot.

314

The other option is conservative treatment.

The clot may be absorbed.

Mr. Qiu currently

can't make it to the court.

He used to teach us about Buddhism, the Heart Sutra, and the Vajra.

There was a saying that impressed me a lot,

were put together by many small companies.

377

Later, Xu Banxia also registered many subsidiaries

Is it true what the public prosecutor said?

387
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,680
True.

388
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,370
True.

True.

Therefore,

392
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,770
we believe that

393
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,190
the fact that the defendants, Xu Banxia, Wu Jianshe, Qiu Bizheng,

Feng Yu and Guo Qidong

395

have used national quota

396
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,800
imported steel scrap on a large scale,

397
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,820
and resold it,

398
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,770
taking the advantage of the steel price difference

between domestic and overseas

400
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,070

complying with the elements of smuggling under criminal law.

403
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,450
My client has not imported a single kilogram of steel

404
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,310
not under the national quota.

405
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,360
This cannot be considered smuggling.

406

As for reselling,

407
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,260
there were no legal provisions at that time,

408
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,250
ruling that resale was not allowed.

409
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,930
Although the Customs Law of the People's Republic of China

this can't be considered smuggling.

415

00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,240
import quota standards.

417

under the name of Xu Banxia's Company,

419
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,530
there are still a lot of subsidiaries registered.

420
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,710
She's still claiming more national quotas

421

After the new customs law and

425
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,120
Criminal Law Amendment IV came into effect,

426
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,550
the quantity of steel imported by the party concerned, Xu Banxia,

427
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,590

the quantity and extent of suspected smuggling.

429
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,630
Therefore, there is no such thing as dumping

Your Honor.

438
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,710
The prosecutor used the word “fraudulently".

439
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,200
This is a bait-and-switch way of asking.

According to the statement of the Customs Smuggling Investigation Bureau to you,

445
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,570
we've found

446
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,710
that after the newly revised Customs Law and

447
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,550
Amendment IV to the Criminal Law came into force,

448
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,620
your company has been still importing scrap steel overseas.

449
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,200
Therefore,

450
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,270
you and your company

451
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,850
are intentionally engaged in smuggling activities,

452
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,500
is that right?

453

Your Honor.

455
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,320
The prosecutor has used self-affirmation

456
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,750
by the word “intentionally”.

457
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,000
It's an inducing way of asking.

458
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,800
The defendant may not answer

459
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,500
the prosecutor's question.

460
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,360
I can answer the prosecutor's question.

461
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,840
We never knowingly

462
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,210
smuggled a kilogram of steel.

463
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,520
Your Honor.

464
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,600
Your Honorable Judges.

465
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,520
I plead guilty.

466
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,660
I also admit a basic fact.

467
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,530
We did engage in smuggling.

468
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,880
We did intend to take advantage of the national quota

469
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,810
and the huge price difference

470
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,320
between the domestic and overseas

471
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,220
and import steel on a large scale and resell it.

472
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,720
I believe that the law

473
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,070
will make a fair decision.

474
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,400
According to the statements and arguments

475
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,030
of the prosecution and the defense,

476
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,940
there are still many facts that need to be clearly identified

477
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,310
for the first trial.

478
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,920
The court is now closed.

479
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,640
The trial will continue at a later date.

480
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,980
This is the end of the first trial of

481
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,260
the smuggling case

482
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,740
involving Yuzhou Steel Plant

483
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,520
that we've all been concerned about.

484
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,780
At the trial scene,

485
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,320
the prosecutor and the defender

486
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,670
started a heated discussion…

487
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,210
Things in this world are unpredictable.

488
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,980
How did I go

489
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,430
from being a leisurely countryman

490
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,800
into the main culprit of a case overnight?

491
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,360
The situation is not good.

492
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,120
In my opinion,

493
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,050
there is at least a half chance

494
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,950
we can lose in the case.

495
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,680
Gentlemen.

496
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,020
Why?

497
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,160
Do you really think

498
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,210
you haven't committed a crime?

499
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,870
At least I don't think so.

00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,860
Stop crying.

508
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,500
Look, who is this?

509
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,930
Mom and Dad, right?

510
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,180
Stop crying.

511
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,940
Stop crying!

512
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,060
It's so annoying.

513
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,480
I can't even fix you.

514
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,890
Xinyi.

515
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,720
Any news yet?

516
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,550
I've asked around. No one knows.

517
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,110
What about Sister and Zhao Lei?

518
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,290
They're also asking about it.

519
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,660
No news yet either.

520
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,350
Don't cry, don't cry.

521
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,390
Be good.

522
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,580
Don't be anxious.

523
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,870
Mom must be fine.

524
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,260
I can't help but be anxious.

525
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,170
My mom has been taken away.

526
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,580
Okay.

527
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,230
I will call Boss tomorrow and ask again.

528
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,320
Good girl.

529
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,460
Don't cry, don't cry.

530
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,350
Don't cry.

531
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,550
Good girl.

532
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,560
[Binhai Prosecutor]

533
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,410
Xu Banxia.

534
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,390
We asked you here today

535
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,980
because when the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing

536
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,630
your company's listing information,

537
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,170
someone reported your misappropriation of state assets.

538
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,330
We've initially found

539
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,280
that your company's assets used for the listing

540
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,340
includes part of the State No.2 Steel assets

541
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,640
that you purchased from Wu Jianshe.

542
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,170
At the same time, when operating the State No.2 Steel,

543
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,460
you and Wu Jianshe failed to fulfill your responsibilities

544
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,630
with a lack of management.

545
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,390
You also improperly disposed

546
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,460
the production equipment

547
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,060
by reselling, dismantling and abandoning it, etc.

548
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,760
This is suspected of illegal disposal of state-owned assets.

549
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,630
The province is going on a reform

550
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,440
to contract out the State No.2 Steel.

551
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,900
50 million yuan.

552
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,460
It's a deal.

553
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,010
Take over my factory.

554
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,030
I'll merge the new mill,

555
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,570
Yuzhou Steel Plant and your Jian She Steel Mill.

556
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,960
Some of the equipment in your steel plant should be demolished,

557
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,910
sold or kept.

558
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,290
No, Xu Banxia.

559
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,960
This is the State No.2 Steel.

560
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,410
Even if its name is changed,

561
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,050
it was a state-run factory.

562
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,270
No one can afford to take responsibility for

563
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,680
your disposal like this.

564
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,680
What's the situation?

565
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,590
I now know

566
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,320
why Gao Yuejin was taken away.

567
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,670
I've told you everything I need to

568
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,960
about Wu Jianshe contracting the provincial steel plant

569
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,020
which was later subcontracted to Xu Banxia.

570
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,920
I will not conceal anything from the Party.

571
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
I will not evade the responsibility that I should bear.

572
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,170
This is the government's open tender to the whole society.

573
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,370
This is the first time since the founding of our country

574
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,220
to contract a steel mill.

575
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,140
But I also have to

576
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,680
express my thoughts and demands to the Party.

577
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,000
I will not admit responsibility that is not mine to bear.

578
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,710
I believe

579
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
the truth will be found out.

580
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,110
Contracting out the steel mill

581
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,250
was an experimental reform program of the government.

582
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,460
It didn't clearly indicate the ownership of property rights.

583
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,840
It was the newly revised law

584
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,440
that stated the property rights still belonged to the state.

585
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,150
You didn't know that at that time, did you?

586
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,220
Of course.

587
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,790
I didn't mean to embezzle the state's property.

588
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,940
Who would dare to get involved in such big trouble?

589
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,420
If

590
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,340
you convert the cost of Wu Jianshe's contract

591
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,470
to today,

592
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,230
it'd be a huge sum of money.

593
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,850
Then if the charge of embezzlement of state assets

594
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,450
is proved…

595
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,170
The consequences will be dire.

596
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,030
In fact, I'm more worried about

597
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,050
President Gao Yuejin.

598
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
She's been suspended.

599
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,890
She has to be interviewed and investigated at any time.

600
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,150
The authorities said whether she'd stay or go

601
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,060
should be decided after it's all settled.

602
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,180
The reform of state-owned enterprises was so vigorous,

603
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,130
some people did exploit an advantage,

604
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,170
putting the public property into their own pockets

605
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,340
and becoming fattened

606
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,320
by the people's hard-earned money.

607
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,400
But not everyone did that.

608
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,180
There are still good leaders and cadres

609
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,410
like President Gao

610
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,360
who doesn't play favorites,

611
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,620
use power for personal gain,

612
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,530
and accepts no corruption and bribery.

613
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,240
Whether it's when she contracted the steel mill to you

614
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,420
or when she came up with the idea of

615
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,560
subcontracting it to me,

616
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,220
as far as I know,

617
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,510
she never received any money from you.

618
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,659
I never gave her any money either.

619
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,260
She meant to

620
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,540
revitalize the steel mill

621
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,909
completely according to the reform policy at that time,

622
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,550
for the sake of

623
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,380
those who had devoted most of their lives to the steel mill

624
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,190
could make a living.

625
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,580
President Gao

626
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,070
is a good person.

627
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,820
Then who is the bad guy?

628
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,540
Me?

629
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,710
Of course I don't mean that.

630
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,070
Xu.

631
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,230
I've lived half my life.

632
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,500
There are not many women that I admire.

633
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,400
You're one of them.

634
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,530
So is President Gao.

635
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,580
I want to go back to the beginning.

636
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,990
If I could go back in time,

637
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,250
I wouldn't have sold the equipment to save myself

638
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,630
at the worst time

639
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,210
of my steel mill,

640
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,520
nor would I have subcontracted it to you.

641
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,720
Now it's good.

642
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,150
It may become

643
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,070
the evidence of my embezzlement of state assets.

644
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,670
Since I've incorporated Jian She Steel Mill

645
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,420
into your Yuzhou Steel Plant,

646
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,400
We have been in the same boat.

647
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,370
No one can escape.

648
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:40,910
Mr. Wu.

649
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,210
When you contracted for the State No.2 Steel,

650
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,690
did you own the property rights?

651
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,140
When your steel mill was merged into mine,

652
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,340
did the property rights change?

653
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,680
We need to find out

654
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,810
the definition of property rights.

655
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,550
Gao Yuejin.

656
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,560
Did you, Xu Banxia, and Wu Jianshe

657
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,720
intentionally embezzle the state assets?

658
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,450
I believe you've read the interview record

659
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,590
between Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and me.

660
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,780
I still want to reiterate my point.

661
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,690
I, Xu Banxia, and Wu Jianshe

662
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,620
never intended to embezzle state-owned assets.

663
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,180
When the state tried to get rid of the burden

664
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,390
and contract the heavy industry factory,

665
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,100
it was at an experimental stage.

666
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,850
There were no clear legal provisions.

667
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,070
What represented

668
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,740
the property rights of the provincial steel plant

669
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,560
is a question to be determined.

670
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,100
The property right is first reflected in

671
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,850
the ownership of equipment of the steel mill.

672
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:48,800
If so,

673
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,850
Xu Banxia and Wu Jianshe's

674
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,660
modification of the machine

675
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,080
could be considered embezzlement.

676
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,590
But the fact that they had been paying the contract fee

677
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,360
gave them the right to dispose of their machines.

678
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,590
If the property rights of the state

679
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,570
is reflected in the reputation of the steel mill

680
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,510
and the allocation of resources of state enterprises,

681
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,540
then Xu Banxia

682
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,580
meant to make

683
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,980
her Yuzhou Steel Co. to come into the market,

684
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,260
[Stop]

685
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,310
not the provincial steel plant.

686
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,860
So why would that be embezzlement?

687
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,510
That's another very controversial issue.

688
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,040
[Outpatient]

689
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,860
The first trial for embezzlement of state assets is over.

690
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,500
The second trial of the smuggling case is about to start.

691
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,440
The smuggling case still has a chance

692
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,610
for mild treatment.

693
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,650
But once the embezzlement of state assets case

694
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
is affirmed,

695
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,410
it's very likely

696
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,500
we don't even have the opportunity to fight for mild treatment

697
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,520
due to the huge amount.

698
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,260
So we should be prepared for the worst.

699
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:10,250
Guo…

700
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:11,750
Okay.

701
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,860
Got it, got it.

702
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,540
You don't have to think about it.

703
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,420
It's no use.

704
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,040
We don't have the chance to convince Guo Qidong.

705
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,710
I didn't expect you to come.

706
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,460
Why did you confess?

707
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,180
I didn't confess for revenge

708
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,070
any one of you.

709
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,550
I just

710
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,600
want to sleep peacefully.

711
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,300
Can you sleep peacefully?

712
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,680
I should say,

713
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,070
since Qiu Bizheng asked me

714
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,420
to check his books,

715
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,110
I've never had any good intentions toward you.

716
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,090
But after all these years,

717
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,920
I don't know how our grudge

718
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,060
can be resolved.

719
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,610
But I'll do my best.

720
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,850
We didn't break any rules.

721
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,700
We've been working for most of our lives.

722
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,430
Are we finally going to admit

723
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,370
that we're sinners?

724
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,010
That's not true.

725
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,100
Leave it to the court to decide

726
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,170
whether we're guilty or not.

727
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,460
Guo Qidong.

728
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,630
Is this how you want to destroy us?

729
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,670
What's in it for you

730
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,320
to destroy us?

731
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,190
Isn't it the same as destroying yourself?

732
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,790
What else do I have to be destroyed?

733
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,780
Conscience.

734
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,020
Conscience can also be destroyed.

735
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,290
Qiu Bizheng is now lying in the hospital.

736
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,670
Have you visited him once?

737
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,040
Do you want to

738
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,340
remain powerless to face him?

739
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,930
I miss Shuang.

740
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,910
Mom.

741
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,230
I've forgotten

742
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,470
what it's like to hold you.

743
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,690
Mom is fine.

744
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,330
Don't worry.

745
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,640
Where's Shuang?

746
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,170
Mom, take your time.

747
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,790
Shuang.

748
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,660
Tong Xiaoqi.

749
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,920
Shuang.

750
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,780
Are you hungry?

751
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,360
Be good.

752
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,040
Mom, you're back.

753
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,100
Come on, let Grandma hold you.

754
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,070
My baby.

755
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,060
Is she hungry?

756
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,250
Come on, let mom sit down and take a break.

757
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,460
-You go do it. -I'll make something to eat.

758
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,060
Okay.

759
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,700
Why are you crying, baby?

760
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:19,970
Mom, sit down.

761
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,700
Mom, sit down.

762
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Mom, how are you?

763
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,720
What's with

764
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,550
Shengli Steel Mill's indictment against us?

765
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,080
We've always helped import

766
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,790
the raw materials for their company.

767
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,280
Now they can't get the raw materials.

768
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,250
So they are pissed.

769
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,400
Lawyer Hua.

770
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,770
What's with

771
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:49,590
Qianlang company's lawsuit against us

772
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,280
with other companies again?

773
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,060
We've cut off the supply to their company

774
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,080
for a long time.

775
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,800
We've received several reminders.

776
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,460
Mr. Jia.

777
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,770
These are the faxed documents of demand for payment

778
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,520
from suppliers around the world

779
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,560
and that of the bank demanding interest

780
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,780
and repayment.

781
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,710
I need you to sign them.

782
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,540
President Gao.
