I came to see you.

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,230
There's an anti-corruption operation in the province.

This workshop was built

32

when Mr. Wu was here.

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,170
It's still the workshop

34
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,840
that has the most stable production of steel.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,270
And that corner.

36
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,060
You told me to make use of it.

37
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,760
Do you remember?

38

Look at you.

39

Well,

42
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,150
it feels kind of similar

43
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,160
when you talk about the workshop

44
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,700
with when I talk about Gao Xinyi in front of others.

45
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,230
Look, this girl is wilful

46
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,420
and makes me angry.

47
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,260
I'm her mother.

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,520
I have to tolerate her, right?

49
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,950
Running a business

50
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,100
is like raising a child,

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,770
but not exactly the same.

52
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,750
President Gao,

53
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,570
since you want me to call you Aunt Gao,

54
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,170
I'll say something wilful.

55
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,530
I've been thinking

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,290
if the company really goes public,

57
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,710
I won't be in charge of the company anymore, right?

58
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,530
I feel sad

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,230
when I realise

60
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,730
the company might not belong to me in the future.

61
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,910

62
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,100
now you're telling me this.

63
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,980
It means you've grown up.

64
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,159
The higher-ups have read

65
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,370

66

They are satisfied.

67
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,540
But let me remind you.

68
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,670
All the data for the IPO

69
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,300
must be accurate.

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,760
Don't worry.

71
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,890
I'm not only keeping up appearances.

72
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,800
Look.

73
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,270
Normally,

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,100
no child will abandon his mother,

75
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,740
but an enterprise will.

76
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,090
There are many cases like this overseas.

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,580
After the IPO,

78
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,100
founders are kicked out

79

by the Board legally.

80
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,900
So what you just told me

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,860
is your worries about the future?

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,440
How should I put it?

83
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,550
Of course,

84
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,550
I hope my company will get better.

85
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,130
But I'm also worried

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,490
that it'll become too good.

87
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,870
I told you before.

88
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,060
IPO is a necessity

89
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,430
for a company to develop rapidly.

90
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,820
Metaphorically,

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,940

to a more mature

94

all the financial reports of the truck team

are here.

104
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,750
I thought you asked me here today

105
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,570
because you had prepared all the money to invest.

106

As for the money,

I don't have that much,

110
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,000
but I do want to enter the logistics industry.

111
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,130
So, can I invest my truck team?

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,560
Everyone has a truck team.

113
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,060
If it's just the truck team,

114
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,220
let's just stay in a contractual relationship.

115
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,690
It's not realistic

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,520
for you to invest only dozens of trucks.

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,060
If it's not money,

118

there's no discussion.

119

120
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,500
Have a seat.

121
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,030
Mr. Zheng,

122
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,690
we can invest money.

123
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,940
We have no problem with the amount you said before.

124
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,100
At the same time, the truck team can also be invested.

125
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,620
But we may need to

126
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,690
discuss the shares again.

127
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,420
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

128

We do have money.

133

Where did you get the money?

134
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,190
My sister gave it to me.

135
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,500
I wanted her to invest money from the steel factory

136
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,080
in our logistics company,

137
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,440
but she had invested in Su.

138

Of course,

139
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,660
I have no objections to my sister's decision.

140
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,500
Then she gave me her own money.

141
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,260
I was hesitating.

142
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,580
So I didn't tell you.

143
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,950
I want to roll the dice.

144
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,100
If Zheng agrees us to invest the truck team,

145
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,620
we can save the money.

146

No buts.

148
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,520
Give her back the money.

149
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,500
We can't take the money.

150
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,650

156
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,150
She lent it to us.

157

It's not the company's money.

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,660
No notice in advance?

174
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,010
No.

175
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,600
Okay, I got it.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,630
What about Customs?

177
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,470
Why did they seal our port?

178
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,260
Surprise inspection.

179
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,340
It's said to be part of the anti-corruption operation.

180
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,410
They asked us to cooperate with the investigation.

181
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,460
Do some self-checks now.

182
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,820
Mr. Jia.

183
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,270
Mr. Gao.

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,740
Please.

185
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,880
Did you make the call?

186
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,510
Yes.

187
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,380
They should be on the way.

188
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:07,850
Miss Xu.

189
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,380
Miss Xu.

190
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,910
What did the Tax Authority say?

191
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,470
They suspect the steel mill conducted a tax evasion,

192
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,340
so they have frozen our account.

193
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,220
They're still investigating.

194
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,740
It's just a suspicion and they have frozen our account?

195
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,620
Not only Tax,

196
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,220
Customs has also

197
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,980
sealed our port.

198
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,250
They said it was a joint law enforcement.

199
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,980
Did they say when everything will go back to normal?

200
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,050
They have to investigate first.

201
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,890
Hey, President Gao.

202
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
Let me ask you.

203
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,040
Have you done anything illegal

204
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,450
since the new steel mill opened?

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,350
No.

206
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,250
You didn't,

207
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,030
but what about your men?

208
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,500
Please give me some time.

209
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,160
I'll investigate it.

210
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,050
Investigate carefully.

211
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,140
I'm warning you.

212
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,500
Don't have any evil thoughts.

213
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,630
Let alone the accounts

214
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,810
or the import and export list,

215
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,830
even our finance head

216
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,270
has been taken away by Tax officers

217
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,270
to cooperate with the investigation.

218
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,510
So we can't figure out

219
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,360
which department

220
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,070
or which process goes wrong.

221
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,520
Our port has been sealed by Customs.

222
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,780
The raw materials can't get in.

223
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:32,930
But

224
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,700
our steel mill must keep running.

225
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,530
It can't stop.

226
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,920
Otherwise,

227
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,000
we can't fulfil following orders.

228
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:39,820
Besides,

229
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,980
our warehouse has been sealed too.

230
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,380
The finished steel is now in the warehouse,

231
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,120
so all of our orders

232
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,420
can't be delivered on time.

233
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,620
If this keeps going,

234
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,780
we'll run out of money soon.

235
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,320
We also need to consider the compensation for the breach of contracts.

236
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,420
This is the current situation

237
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,980
and the problem we are about to face.

238
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,110
Our top priority

239
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,980
is to find another factory

240
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,970
to help us deliver some goods

241
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,880
to deal with the current situation.

242
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,230
Even if we have to buy it at a high price,

243
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,540
at least we won't breach the contracts.

244
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,550
I think we should speed up the internal investigation

245
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,230
and see where the loophole is

246
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,990
and which process goes wrong.

247
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,770
We need to be prepared.

248
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,230
We're investigating internally.

249
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,190
We haven't found anything wrong

250
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,460
through the production process,

251
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,900
whether it's raw materials, equipment maintenance,

252
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,340
or equipment replacement.

253
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,160
There's only one word difference between avoidance and evasion.

254
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,310
Qin Fangping, I trust you.

255
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,520
You can't set me up.

256
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,560
Don't worry.

257
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,850
We've been doing this for so many years.

258
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,860
The same goes for Zhao Lei’s company.

259
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,220
This is a legal tax evasion

260
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,350
to save cost.

261
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,610
I earned the money.

262
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,950
I saved it for you.

263
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,100
I don't want it.

264
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,930
And we are facing

265
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,320
the whole IPO process,

266
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,040
so the company has been very strict

267
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,330
about the account review.

268
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,720
I'm assured that

269
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,980
our financial transparency and clearance

270
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,480
is way ahead of other companies.

271
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,860
We have no problems in sales as well.

272
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,400
All the trades

273
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,680
between us and all the other steel mills

274
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,870
as well as steel trade companies

275
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,140
are very clear.

276
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,750
As for the export,

277
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,540
Qin Fangping's company

278
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,580
has been our agency.

279
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,330
It's a descent company.

280
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,460
Anyway,

281
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,490
if anything happens,

282
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,230
they will be responsible for it.

283
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,850
It has nothing to do with us.

284
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,030
We are also victims.

285
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,460
That's weird.

286
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,520
Based on our previous experience,

287
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,490
if the investigation team doesn't have evidence,

288
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,080
they won't act hastily.

289
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,180
Have you contacted President Gao

290
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,640
and found out something from her?

291
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,920
What happened?

292
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,900
President Gao called me.

293
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,800
She didn't tell me the details,

294
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,530
but I promised her

295
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,900
I would figure it out.

296
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,300
Starting from tomorrow,

297
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,670
all departments continue to conduct the self-investigation.

298
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,070
We must

299
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,570
check every employee of the company.

300
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,040
Qin Fangping.

301
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,410
Listen to me.

302
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,030
Tell me the truth.

303
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,100
Did anything go wrong

304
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,460
when you applied for an import tax refund

305
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,240
for the joining steel beam?

306
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,940
No. What's wrong, Mr. Qiu?

307
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,650
I'm telling you.

308
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,670
The tax officials are checking the accounts next door.

309
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,980
They've frozen all of my accounts.

310
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,620
You promised me.

311
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,940
We can't do anything illegal.

312
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,540
Are you trying to frame me?

313
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,650
Mr. Qiu, what are you talking about?

314
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,240
Don't scare yourself.

315
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,870
There are so many departments in your company.

316
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,510
Everyone could be in trouble.

317
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,440
Why do you always curse yourself?

318
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,300
Besides, Mr. Qiu,

319
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,280
everyone in our industry does this.

320
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,260
Otherwise, where does the profit come from?

321
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,420
Don't worry.

322
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,540
This is not my first time doing this.

323
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,690
If they found out so easily,

324
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,270
I would have been in jail.

325
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,310
Mr. Qin, Tax officers want to see you.

326
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,880
Mr. Qiu.

327
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,180
Something has come up.

328
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,950
I'm hanging up.

329
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,340
Qin Fang...

330
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,870
Twelve yuan.

331
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,620
Tax officers came.

332
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,970
They are investigating in my company.

333
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,610
Did you blow the whistle

334
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,840
on Qin Fangping's tax avoidance in the name of declaration?

335
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,280
Do you believe me if I say it wasn't me?

336
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,320
I know you.

337
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,790
Do you think

338
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,930
I would make an issue of such a small thing?

339
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,580
But I only told you about this.

340
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,970
No one else knows.

341
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,150
How do you explain that?

342
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,490
Qiu Bizheng.

343
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,810
How come you suspect me?

344
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,400
You lied about the product name and tried to avoid taxes.

345
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,880
Didn't you break the law?

346
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,760
That's what everyone does.

347
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,990
Before,

348
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,650
but not now.

349
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,530
Don't believe whatever Qin Fangping says.

350
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,660
I suggest you

351
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,500
return the money to him

352
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,200
before they find out.

353
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,430
Since I came out,

354
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,320
you've been telling me

355
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,810
that the future is good.

356
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,960
I don't know what the future will be.

357
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,460
But there's one thing

358
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,290
I learned from inside.

359
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,130
Do you want to know what it is?

360
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,300
Be a person who obeys the law.

361
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,290
Ding.

362
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,860
The price you offered

363
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,280
is two percentage points higher.

364
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,070
You're too cruel.

365
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,650
I can't deliver the goods now.

366
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,070
Give me some steel

367
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,510
for the time being.

368
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,690
Please help.

369
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,960
My inventory is limited.

370
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,340
I'm telling you, if it isn't for you,

371
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,700
I won't be willing to share.

372
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:04,810
At this critical time,

373
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,380
who knows if they will trace to me

374
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,839
or seal my warehouse?

375
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,700
By the way,

376
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,910
how did you screw up?

377
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,170
We didn't.

378
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,310
Don't trust rumours.

379
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,980
We're just cooperating with the investigation.

380
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,359
Fine.

381
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,000
I believe with the production of your steel mill,

382
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,099
you can share some with me.

383
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,720
Thank you.

384
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,580
I'll ask Jia Chang'an to contact you about the details.

385
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,730
Okay, bye.

386
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:35,740
Hello.

387
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,690
Hello, Banxia.

388
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,490
I just arrived at the airport.

389
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,700
Something happened to my company.

390
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,250
I need to go back and check.

391
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,390
The situation is the same as yours.

392
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,260
This time,

393
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,600
the first step of this anti-corruption operation on the steel industry

394
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,950
is tax inspection.

395
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,030
What we found this time

396
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,650
is a company that works with us

397
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,410
exported goods in the name of another product

398
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,390
that has a higher tax refund

399
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,610
when they made the customs declaration.

400
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,460
We didn't get to the bottom of this before,

401
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,910
so we are also responsible.

402
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,580
You should go back and check.

403
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,050
See if there is any similar situation in your company.

404
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,230
International trade?

405
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,860
Yes.

406
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,280
Times have changed.

407
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,850
The rules are becoming clearer.

408
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,880
Although our company is a foreign company,

409
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,610
we've also hired

410
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,300
domestic professional legal consultants

411
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,030
to interpret

412
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,170
the latest laws for us

413
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,080
in case we unintentionally

414
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,550
break the law.

415
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,780
What are you going to do?

416
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,210
Just follow the rules.

417
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:34,930
We have to correct our mistakes.

418
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,340
We'll pay the fines or accept punishments.

419
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,620
I accept everything.

421
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,750
You also need to be prepared.

422

The development of the industry can't continue without close management.

423
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,990
I understand.

424
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,100
But there must be a difference between

425
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,660
intentional and unintentional breach of law.

426
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,430

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,810
you must be Qin Fangping's client, right?

450
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,140
To be honest,

451
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,790
Qin Fangping has been working

452
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,890
in our company for many years.

453
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,050
I can't believe he took advantage of his position

454
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,020
to declare fake product names

455
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,660
to help some companies avoid taxes.

456

Currently, due to the large amount of money involved,

457

he has been detained by the Shanghai police.

Don't you have business with him?

Is it a large amount?

Mr. Qiu and Qin Fangping

468

in the last two quarters,

472
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,500
Mr. Qiu made a false export declaration

473
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,500
about high-strength steel section,

474
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,430
joining steel beam and so on.

475

He hid the truth

to avoid taxes.

477
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,500
Everyone used to do that.

478
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,480
But after the WTO,

479
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,820
the review of the customs declaration

480
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,060
and the scrutiny of international trade tax

481
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,080
has become stricter.

I've called Qin Fangping's company.

They said he had been arrested.

484
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,980
Therefore,

485
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,680
this is

486
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,910
their personal behaviour.

487
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,380
There's no possibility that they were instigated.

488
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,060
As long as we cooperate with the investigation,

489

we won't be greatly affected.

Listen, honey.

512
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,150
I've deposited the cash in the bank account.

513
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,280
I applied for a new card

514
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,100
and took it with me.

515
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,870
There's a bankbook

516
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,790
in the drawer on the second floor.

517
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,340
The bedroom on the second floor.

518
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,400
The second floor.

519
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,670
It is for you.

520
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,570
Qiu Bizheng.

521
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,340
I've been sitting at your house for a while.

522
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,680
I've been waiting for your call.

523
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,420
Do you really want to run away?

524
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,210
Mr. Wu.

525
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,670
Why are you...

526
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,100
Let me tell you.

527
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,600
Mr. Wu,

528
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,970
I'm really sorry this time.

529
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,470
I don't want to see this either.

530
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,750
But I'm committing corruption this time.

531
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,980
I might go to jail.

532
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,150
I'm going to jail.

533
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,480
Do you think you can escape from it

534
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,530
if you run away like this?

535
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,930
If you do this, the consequences will be even worse.

536
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,780
Come back and turn yourself in.

537
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,030
How can I turn myself in now?

538
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,580
Now you want me to...

539
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,490
I have to go.

540
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,060
Can I go out for a while?

541
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,380
Put my wife on the phone.

542
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,730
Can you let me say goodbye?

543
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,720
Qiu, don't be silly.

544
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,670
Listen to me.

545
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,270
Come back quickly.

546
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,290
What do you know?

547
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,640
You...

548
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,110
Listen.

549
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,720
You know nothing.

550
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,830
You'll be fine.

551
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,890
After I settle down outside,

552
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,620
I'll bring you here.

553
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,600
If anyone asks anything about me,

554
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,440
just tell them you don't know, you hear me?

555
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,950
I'm hanging up.

556
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,700
I have to go.

557
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,980
Qiu Bizheng.

558
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,620
I've figured out everything.

559
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,260
It's not your own problem.

560
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,610
If you still trust me,

561
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,820
please come back.

562
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,570
I promise I'll face it with you.

563
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,870
Running away is not the solution.

564
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,460
See you at the port tomorrow morning.

565
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,660
Just the two of us.

566
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,080
I'm glad you came here.

567
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,210
You didn't run away overnight.

568
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,160
That means there's still hope for you.

569
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,810
There was a moment

570
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,880
I really wanted to run away last night.

571
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,870
I felt like if I had run out,

572
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,470
everything would be over

573
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,390
and I would be safe.

574
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,330
Now that I think about it,

575
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,560
luckily, I didn't run away.

576
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,840
If I had run away,

577
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,380
I would be doomed for the rest of my life.

578
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,580
So why did you do that?

579
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,960
Why did you take that money?

580
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,710
The money is for Guo Qidong.

581
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,750
I always felt that I owed him.

582
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,480
I wanted to make it up to him.

583
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,500
I didn't take a penny.

584
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,110
Believe it or not.

585
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,730
Does he have the money?

586
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,990
Dong didn't take it.

587
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,700
He thought

588
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,510
I was pitying him.

589
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,420
Where is the money now?

590
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,100
I rushed to Shanghai.

591
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,080
I wanted to give the money to Qin Fangping in person.

592
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,070
But when I arrived,

593
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,520
he had already been arrested.

594
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,710
I made a scene at the reception desk

595
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,350
and left the money there.

596
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,720
But who would believe that now?

597
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,360
I can't prove my innocence now.

598
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,020
But I reaffirm that

599
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,840
I didn't take the money.

600
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:00,960
By the way,

601
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,590
I really wanted to

602
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,960
increase profit for the company

603
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,640
through the customs declaration.

604
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,530
Qin Fangpng told me

605
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,610
that he used to do this.

606
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,360
There would be no problem.

607
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,630
I believed what he said,

608
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,330
but I didn't do it on purpose.

609
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,580
Mr. Qiu,

610
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,830
you lied about product names to gain a large tax refund.

611
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,220
This is the truth.

612
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,370
Like you said,

613
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,470
if you really had run away,

614
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,760
you would be doomed for the rest of your life.

615
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,550
So I advise you to turn yourself in.

616
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,500
Admit what you have done.

617
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,610
No one will wrong you.

618
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,980
I thought

619
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,310
it would be fine like before.

620
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,210
Everything would be fine when it was over.

621
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,360
Now it seems that I was wrong.

622
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,360
It's really different now.

623
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,050
We can't take advantage of

624
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,690
the loopholes of the policies anymore.

625
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,480
You don't spend decades tap dancing on hornets' nests

626
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,650
and not expect to be stung.

627
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,280
Not only I got stung this time,

628
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,770
but almost lost my life.

629
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,190
The old pattern

630
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,570
doesn't work anymore.

631
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,010
It's gone.

632
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,070
Sister.

633
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,150
The price of the goods you and Mr. Wu bought

634
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,330
are 3 percentage points higher than the cost price.

635
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,000
Besides, the company is running out of cash to pay for it now.

636
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,310
Every businessman is smart.

637
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,620
They're afraid that we'll go bankrupt,

638
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,050
so they won't give us credit.

639
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,910
They insist on cash on delivery.

640
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,880
We won't hold on long if this keeps going.

641
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,310
Besides,

642
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,450
the production line hasn't stopped.

643
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,300
There's no place to put the products.

644
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,350
They can't go into the warehouse as well.

645
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,410
Moreover, the emotions among workers...

646
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,730
-Now everyone thinks... -Mr. Jia.

647
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,730
Come in.

648
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,750
Miss Xu, Mr. Su is here.

649
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,320
Miss Xu.

650
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,650
Mr. Jia.

651
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,190
Wildcat.

652
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,550
You’re back.

653
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,150
I'm back.

654
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,840
How's the jet lag treating you?

655
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,870
I'm good.

656
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,780
You even have dark circles under your eyes.

657
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:42,800
It's okay.

658
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,630
Have a seat.

659
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,430
Sister.

660
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,940
We're gonna head out.

661
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:47,690
You guys talk.

662
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,640
Okay.

663
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,080
You guys figure something out.

664
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,580
Okay.

665
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,500
Bye.

666
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,450
Bye.

667
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,410
Tell me about your progress.

668
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,740
I feel relieved

669
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,250
when I see you.

670
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,240
Why? Are you worried about me?

671
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,710
Did you hear any bad news?

672
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,810
Our company is going public.

673
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,760
Some companies

674
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,350
will spread rumours about us

675
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,700
during this time.

676
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,990
Don't take it seriously.

677
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,340
We are fine.

678
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,470
Don't lie to me.

679
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,600
I just came back from the factory.

680
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,310
Many people are talking about it.

681
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:21,960
Enjoy.

682
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,020
Thank you.

683
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,080
Every business

684
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,660
has ups-and-downs.

685
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:26,820
It's normal.

686
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,790
Look at this.

687
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,270
This is the contract I signed with a German medical company.

688
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,790
They'll transfer the money

689
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,400
within a week.

690
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,270
I'll bring all the money here then.

691
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,940
I've discussed with Jack.

692
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,640
Our Internet project

693
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,840
can be suspended temporarily.

694
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,110
I will bring back all the money

695
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,990
that you've invested in.

696
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,800
When the problem of the steel factory is solved,

697
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,010
we can resume then.

698
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,920
It won't be too late.

699
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,560
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a long time.

700
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,840
I was wondering who would be the first one to send me money.

701
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,450
I thought about many people,

702
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,240
but I didn't expect that it would be you.

703
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm a science student.

704
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,930
You know I'm straightforward.

705
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,790
I only know

706
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,430
you trusted me

707
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,990
in the most difficult time for me.

708
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,550
So no matter how difficult the situation

709
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,910
you are facing now,

710
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,700
I will do my best to help you.

711
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,980
Even if it's not enough,

712
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,730
it must be all I have.

713
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,690
Don't worry.

714
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,760
I won't let you down.

715
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,650
In sleep?

716
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,310
Yes.

717
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,380
What are you looking at?

718
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,660
The contract with Zheng.

719
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,810
I've reviewed almost all the terms.

720
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,900
We just need to sign it.

721
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,500
Do you want to sign it?

722
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,280
Boss is having a hard time now.

723
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,300
Let's pay her back

724
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,270
no matter it's the company's or her own money.

725
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,930
President Gao,

726
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,840
it's my fault not managing it well.

727
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,650
Qiu Bizheng will turn himself in

728
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,470
for the mistake he made.

729
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,860
I'll try my best

730
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,030
to compensate the nation for the loss as much as I can.

731
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,370
Theoretically,

732
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,010
I shouldn't have called you according to the rules.

733
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,650
The special team will talk to you tomorrow.

734
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,700
How did you get the raw materials for your steel mill?

735
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,910
Is there any problem?

736
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,260
Raw materials?

737
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,070
What raw materials?

738
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,090
The accounting review is the first step of this anti-corruption operation.

739
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,070
Next, it will be a thorough investigation

740
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,080
about the smuggling of raw materials and imported steel scrap.

741
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,340
I'll be responsible for whatever problem you have.

742
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,740
Do you have the quota?

743
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,670
Yes.

744
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,050
Doesn't every company have this?

745
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,450
Do you know how much

746
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,490
a company can apply for?

747
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,280
15,000 tons of steel.

748
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,600
How many companies do you want to register?

749
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,790
15.

750
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,900
You can handle it?

751
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
Why can't I?

752
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,190
If Mr. Wu dares to give it to me,

753
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,320
I'll open as much as I want.

754
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,090
You and Tong

755
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,050
find more people

756
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,700
to register more companies.

757
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,330
I need more quotas.

758
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,420
I plan to get 50,000 tons back.

759
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,190
What do you think?

760
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,390
I've brought back 50,000 tons.

761
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,699
Hello.

762
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,960
Hello, Banxia.

763
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,630
How's the investigation of tax evasion going?

764
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,790
I persuaded Qiu Bizheng to turn himself in.

765
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,880
We'll pay the fine

766
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,330
and see if the punishment can be reduced.

767
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,230
President Gao told me that

768
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,219
this is the first step of the anti-corruption operation.

769
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,389
Next, they'll investigate the smuggling of raw materials

770
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,550
and imported steel scrap thoroughly.

771
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,880
I wonder if it's coming out of

772
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,840
this tax evasion investigation.

773
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,949
Do you remember what you said to me

774
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,659
when the company started preparing for the IPO?

775
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,350
Let me ask you.

776
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,800
Are you ready to be fully transparent?

777
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,370
Is that it?

778
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,350
Zhao Lei,

779
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,130
I’m scared now.

780
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,590
Hello?

781
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:05,440
Hello.

782
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,550
Banxia.

783
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,710
Banxia.

784
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,410
What happened?

785
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,760
Hello, Banxia.

786
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,280
Can you hear me?

787
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,680
Boss!

788
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,020
Tong.

789
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,270
Get Mr. Feng to the company.

790
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,980
Do whatever you can.

791
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,530
Okay.

792
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,710
Miss Xu.

793
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,550
Miss Xu.

794
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,040
Miss Xu.

795
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,380
According to your order,

796
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,010
I’ve asked procurement colleagues

797
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,770
to extract all the transaction records

798
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,930
for the import of steel scrap all these years

799
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,140
and have given them to the lawyer and the legal department.

800
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,320
They are checking.

801
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,790
This is the Customs Law you asked for.

802
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,190
Remember to inform me when Mr. Qiu and Mr. Wu come.

803
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,260
Got it, Miss Xu.

804
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,310
[Customs Law of the People's Republic of China]

805
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,310
Boss.

806
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,340
I've discussed it with Miss Xu.

807
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,050
I'll pay the taxes.

808
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,810
I accept the fine.

809
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,660
But

810
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,210
I may go to jail and stay inside

811
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,240
for some time because of corruption.

812
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,920
You didn't

813
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,660
take the money.

814
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,830
Instead, you returned it voluntarily.

815
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,820
I can explain it

816
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,130
and testify for you.

817
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,230
You didn't corrupt.

818
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,290
But the top priority now

819
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,110
is to solve this as soon as possible

820
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,020
and unseal the warehouse and the port.

821
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,910
That way, the steel mill and the company

822
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,400
can go back to normal.

823
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,020
I'm sorry.

824
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,410
I made a mistake.

825
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,850
I'm sorry.

826
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,140
Stop it.

827
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,660
It'll be better

828
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,970
if this can be over soon.

829
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,580
Xu,

830
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,470
what time is it?

831
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,040
If you need anything,

832
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,520
Qiu and I are here. Go ahead.

833
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,680
Don't wait.

834
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,490
Mr. Wu.

835
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,440
Let's wait for Feng.

836
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,390
Feng is always slow.

837
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,190
It will take...

838
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,380
You're finally here. Hurry up.

839
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,560
I knew it.

840
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,510
You are the only ones

841
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,040
who will ask me to come at this hour.

842
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,170
What's the rush?

843
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,210
Are we going to discuss

844
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,870
the division of the shares?

845
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,310
I didn't ask you to come here

846
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,550
to talk about the division of shares

847
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,600
for the IPO.

848
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,690
Lawyer Hua,

849
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,850
everyone is here.

850
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,350
Tell us about it.

851
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,040
You calculated it wrong.

852
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,760
[Multi-media Conference Room]

853
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,180
Recalculate it.

854
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,760
Mr. Jia.

855
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,040
Why are you here so late?

856
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,060
Suspend the IPO.

857
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,100
Let me tell you.

858
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,900
I took a lot of effort

859
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,080
on your annual financial statement

860
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,120
and financial analysis report.

861
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,950
What did you say?

862
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,200
I said

863
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,280
let's suspend the IPO.

864
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,370
Mr. Jia,

865
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,280
we can't joke about this.

866
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,420
I'm not kidding.

867
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,100
On January 1 2001,

868
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,780
the Customs Law was announced.

869
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,830
The country set up a smuggling criminal investigation bureau

870
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,100
to fight against smuggling activities.

871
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,980
In 2002,

872
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,940
the Amendment to Criminal Law was published.

873
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,830
The Offence of Smuggling was added.

874
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,910
My team has reviewed

875
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,290
all the trade records of the company.

876
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,120
We found a problem.

877
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,470
We are suspected of smuggling.

878
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,270
We are suspected of smuggling?

879
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,040
When did we ever smuggle?

880
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:52,910
Right.

881
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,020
Have you forgotten

882
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,950
that we imported steel scrap from the North and the Black Sea back then?

883
00:39:59,420 --> 00:39:59,780
Well.

884
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
What we did was allowed

885
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,880
by the national rules

886
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,680
and legal regulations.

887
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,560
The quotas of you and Mr. Wu

888
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,300
were gathered from many small companies.

889
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,080
I got the quota

890
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,010
for importing raw materials from overseas

891
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,240
because I set up a lot of subsidiaries.

892
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,820
I even paid

893
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,720
other companies for their quota.

894
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,200
From the perspective of Customs,

895
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,060
depending on the scale of an enterprise like ours,

896
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,830
we may use the loopholes of the country's support policies

897
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,280
to trade raw materials

898
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,520
through fake companies

899
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,830
and disturb the market.

900
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,780
According to the new Customs Law

901
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,530
and the Amendment to Criminal Law,

902
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,920
this is illegal.

903
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,160
Lawyer Hua, I see.

904
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,220
Here is the thing.

905
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,530
According to the new Customs Law

906
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,480
and the Amendment to Criminal Law,

907
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,600
it is illegal.

908
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,880
In other words,

909
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,120
we did that in the past,

910
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,020
so it was not illegal.

911
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:47,800
Right?

912
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:48,640
No.

913
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,140
But our company

914
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,620
has been doing international business

915
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,910
in the original way.

916
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,870
It never stopped.

917
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,710
I see.

918
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,030
So our behaviour

919
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,950
is smuggling now.

920
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,670
The special team has talked to me.

921
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,700
It's only a matter of time before they talk to you.

922
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,030
Xu,

923
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
since you called us out this late,

924
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,630
have you made up your mind?

925
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,960
Tell me what you think.

926
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,480
Of course I need to

927
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,010
explain everything

928
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,160
to the special team

929
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,260
about how we imported steel scrap

930
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,070
from the North and the Black Sea.

931
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,290
Besides,

932
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,180
I hope you can explain it as well.

933
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,410
No way.

934
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,100
You're turning ourselves in.

935
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,640
Right.

936
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,120
Xu.

937
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,870
You...

938
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,120
You should think it over.

939
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,670
It's like if anyone admits, they're turning themselves in.

940
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,520
We tell the truth

941
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,380
is only to make it clear

942
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,340
that we didn't know it was illegal at that time.

943
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,670
If we deliberately hide it,

944
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,200
it'll be hard to explain then.

945
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,510
We can't volunteer to admit we unintentionally smuggled

946
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,600
even if we won't be able to explain it later.

947
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,950
Besides, our business in the past years

948
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,200
was totally legitimate.

949
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,390
There was no smuggling either.

950
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,850
We must admit and explain

951
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,160
that we did it unintentionally.

952
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,690
It was our negligence.

953
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,220
We didn't do it on purpose.

954
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,030
So,

955
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,910
to be safe,

956
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,750
I've decided not to go public for now.

957
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:26,970
Miss Xu.

958
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,050
Mr. Wu.

959
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,480
Here's the thing.

960
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,350
Lou Zheng handed our documents for IPO

961
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,240
to CSRC.

962
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,570
We've already passed the preliminary review by the CSRC.

963
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,100
Now the CSRC has handed the documents and preliminary review report

964
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,850
to the Issuance Examination Committee of CSRC.

965
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,370
The Issuance Examination Committee is reviewing it.

966
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,990
It can't be withdrawn,

967
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,360
so we can't admit the smuggling.
