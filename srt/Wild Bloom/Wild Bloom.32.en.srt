[Episode 32]

4
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,060
Mr. Qiu, a toast to...

5
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,990
Miss Xu agreed to meet you

6
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,590
doesn't mean it'll work.

7
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,940
This is the first.

8
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,820
Second,

9
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,610
I've never seen the thing

10
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,500
on your phone.

11
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:06,990
I understand.

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,270
Mr. Qiu.

13
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,590
As long as

14
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,700
you help us,

15
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,660
we can make it.

16
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,810
Also, Mr. Qiu,

17
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,690
whether it works or not,

18
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,770
this amount

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,750
is all yours.

20
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,480
Okay, Mr. Qiu.

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,190
When it's done,

22
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,110
we can talk about it in details.

23
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,790
Let's see

24
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,170
in what form to apply for a pass

25
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,079
for this batch of steel

26
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,160
and how to avoid tax

27
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,250
and give you the reward.

28
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,720
We still want to discuss with Miss Xu

29
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,980
about the Internet project.

30
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,860
It's the same if you tell me.

31
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,150
I think we should talk to Miss Xu...

32
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,690
Miss Xu.

33
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,350
What is it?

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,579
Why must you tell me in person?

35
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,490
Miss Xu, this is Jack.

36
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,320
My classmate.

37
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,260
You met him before.

38
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,390
We're working on a

39
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,440
new Internet technology.

40
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,100
It's just that there's a bottleneck now.

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,590
We need your help.

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,690
This is the final form of online sales.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,470
Of course, the database will continue to expand.

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,400
In terms of vertical categories,

45
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,480
the industry will also be limited

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,560
and more refined.

47
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,380
Just tell me.

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,520
According to your calculations, how much

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,510
does it cost to implement all of them?

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,500
A conservative estimate is that

51
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,270
we need $10 million at the beginning.

52
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,870
Absolutely not.

53
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,220
About the Internet thing,

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,460
I've understood.

55
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,940
Let's not talk about the future development.

56
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,860
Only the 10 million at the beginning

57
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,579
is already

58
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,010
more than we can afford.

59
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,260
The company now has more than 10 million in its accounts.

60
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,220
It is a mandatory set-aside guarantee.

61
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,540
If we put all the money

62
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,920
into the Internet,

63
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,180
if something goes wrong,

64
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,320
how can we save the factory?

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,210
I agree with Miss Gao.

66
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,230
I also think

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,329
Internet is a promising industry.

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,870
But Miss Xu, you know,

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,450
our steel plant is about to be completed.

70
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,579
No one knows

71
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,840
what would happen unexpectedly.

72
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,340
If we invest

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,340
in an unknown field at this moment,

74
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,440
I don't think it's a good thing.

75
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,660
We can wait until everything is running smoothly

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,580
and the money is back,

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,440
then it's not too late to invest.

78
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,280
Okay, I got it.

79
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,330
You may leave now.

80
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,080
Let me think about it.

81
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,200
What's wrong?

82
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,880
I know what I'm going to say

83
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,980
will have suspicion of interception.

84
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,380
It may make things difficult for you

85
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,290
and make me seem a little selfish.

86
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,450
What is it? Just tell me.

87
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,490
Here's the thing.

88
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,750
I've been investigating with Tong for a long time.

89
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,850
We want to invest in a logistics company.

90
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,210
But we don't have enough capital.

91
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,620
So we want to borrow some money from you.

92
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,730
Don't worry.

93
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,950
We won't take it for free.

94
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,220
You'll be the shareholder.

95
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,340
You spend money, and we spend effort.

96
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,640
I know

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,400
it's inappropriate to bring this up now.

98
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,540
But you know,

99
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,650
for investment,

100
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,450
opportunities and time are very important.

101
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,050
So,

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
we really need your help.

103
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,110
Whatever you and Tong would like to do,

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,150
I'll definitely support you.

105
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,490
But

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
they are all good projects.

107
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,980
Why do I feel that the bigger the business is getting,

108
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,960
the less enough money we have?

109
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,300
You know what? I've noticed great changes

110
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,100
when I went to Beijing this time.

111
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,100
We won bid of Olympics

112
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,300
and joined the WTO.

113
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,440
To be honest,

114
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,140
people have different mental features.

115
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,440
It's been years since I felt this way.

116
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:51,670
Guess

117
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,810
when was the last time?

118
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,830
Reform and opening-up.

119
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,560
I feel so lucky that

120
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,940
in my lifetime,

121
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,070
I can see

122
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,030
two big changes of our country.

123
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,390
This year will be recorded in history.

124
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,220
Do you believe it?

125
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,450
President Gao.

126
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,260
Hearing what you said,

127
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,400
I feel quite excited.

128
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,330
But I still have a very tacky question

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,910
to ask you.

130
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,410
Do you think

131
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,090
as long as the steel factory is listed,

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,640
I can become very rich

133
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,020
and solve all my urgent problems?

134
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,540
I know what you're talking about.

135
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,970
The launch of the steel factory

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,280
is a necessity for a company's development.

137
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,140
But whether it can you solve

138
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,340
your current problem,

139
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,320
I can't guarantee.

140
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,750
Listing will make the market value of a company

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,130
increase instantly.

142
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,880
That amount might be something you can't imagine.

143
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,030
The quality change

144
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,010
can only rely on the opportunity to go public.

145
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,450
Nothing else can do.

146
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,010
Even if it's possible,

147
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,020
it requires at least a few decades of accumulation.

148
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,810
That means

149
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,830
I was competing with everyone on the same runway,

150
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,310
but I suddenly became something big

151
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,390
and crushed them easily.

152
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,350
I've never visited you before.

153
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,030
You won't even slow down

154
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
the work on precision components

155
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,360
because of bad mood, right?

156
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,020
You can rest assured.

157
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,230
Please

158
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
tell Miss Xu.

159
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
I have professional ethics.

160
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,480
I will not let down every bit of Miss Xu's investment.

161
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,740
The components

162
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,150
development and sales

163
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,530
will go on as scheduled.

164
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,170
When I go to Germany,

165
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,230
I well attend some expos about medical instrument.

166
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,670
I believe I can exceed the target.

167
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,730
What a coincidence.

168
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,940
Miss Xu also wants me to tell you something.

169
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,340
I hope you won't let Miss Xu's intuition fail.

170
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,720
This...

171
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh no.

172
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,020
Where are you going?

173
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,670
Jack's flight is this afternoon.

174
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,380
He's going to Shenzhen.

175
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,140
I have to stop him.

176
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,180
No.

177
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,980
Miss Xu.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,030
Thank you, Miss Xu.

179
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,600
Thank you for not letting me down.

180
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,880
No, no.

181
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,500
It's me. I won't let you down.

182
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,330
Enough.

183
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,919
We won't let each other down, okay?

184
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,000
My ears are going to be deafened by you.

185
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,980
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

186
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,180
When she comes,

187
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,730
you have to be careful what you say.

188
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,560
Remember,

189
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,930
don't mention Zhao Lei.

190
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,270
If she agrees,

191
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,370
it's better.

192
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,980
If she doesn't agree,

193
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,280
you can't blame me.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,300
Because I did my best.

195
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,810
We both know

196
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,780
what kind of person Xu Banxia is.

197
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,100
Business is business.

198
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,450
Don't mention

199
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,500
any sidetracking things.

200
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,310
Miss Xu is here.

201
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:14,990
Hello, Miss Xu.

202
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,500
Hello, Miss Xu.

203
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,030
Long time no see, Miss Xu.

204
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,780
Miss Xu.

205
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
-Mr. Qin. -Mr. Qin.

206
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,090
Mr. Zhao.

207
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,760
No.

208
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,150
You are a chairman.

209
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,170
I'm just a business representative.

210
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,040
Have a seat.

211
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,800
But don't get me wrong.

212
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,420
I'm just accompanying

213
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,090
my wife today as a family member.

214
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,140
I have no choice.

215
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,720
When she's not home, I have nothing to eat.

216
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,280
Have a seat.

217
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,640
Come in, please.

218
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,020
Sit down first.

219
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,660
Mr. Qiu.

220
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,410
What does this mean?

221
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,490
Are you kidding me?

222
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,960
Mr. Zhao is here today.

223
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,290
How can we talk about our business?

224
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,180
Mr. Zhao and I are doing the same business.

225
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,150
If I tell you all my bottom price,

226
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,430
how can I live on

227
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,020
in the industry?

228
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,870
Mr. Qiu, if you don't want to cooperate,

229
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,690
just say it.

230
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,110
There's no need to pretend you're nice

231
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,830
and be a two-faced person.

232
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,150
Mr. Qin, sit down.

233
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,610
Sit down.

234
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,780
Sit down.

235
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,040
Have a seat.

236
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:35,960
Mr. Qin.

237
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,970
It's not Mr. Qiu's fault.

238
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,900
Calm down.

239
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,240
What Zhao Lei said is true.

240
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,710
He did come here as my family.

241
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,480
I brought him here

242
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,820
to tell you that

243
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,700
you're in charge of

244
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,180
sales and export in the factory.

245
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,380
When you make a decision,

246
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,220
the company's interests go first,

247
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,780
not my feelings.

248
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,380
No matter which company Mr. Qiu chose,

249
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,970
I won't cooperate with Zhao Lei's company.

250
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:02,850
Understand?

251
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,650
Yes.

252
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,330
Did you see Qiu Bizheng's face?

253
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,490
I really want to take a picture and show it to Wu Jianshe.

254
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,890
Are you angry?

255
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,630
I am.

256
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,360
But what's the use of being angry?

257
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,580
It's useless to be angry.

258
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,460
But I didn't expect

259
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,190
you abandoned me

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,870
in front of so many people.

261
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,070
Boss.

262
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,570
Shouldn't you give me some compensation?

263
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,770
I'll make it up to you for the rest of my life.

264
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,750
OK?

265
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,320
That's more like it.

266
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,990
Let's agree

267
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,270
to separate work and life.

268
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,500
Home is home.

269
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,640
Don't make home

270
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,650
another working place.

271
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,600
I agree.

272
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,050
But I want to say one more thing.

273
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,510
I've never seen anyone

274
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,780
held the opening ceremony and wedding together.

275
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,720
Only Xu Banxia could do such a thing.

When we make money,

277

we can set here

278

10,000 tons of ships

280

281

and go straight to the storage yard.

Are we still going north?

283

Bravo.

342
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,570
Bravo.

343
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,490
Bravo.

344
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,490
Bravo.

345
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,140
Bravo.

346
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,579
Bravo.

347
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,099
Bravo.

348
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,089
You don't want

349
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,810
to be responsible for me so soon?

350
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,650
I said I would be responsible for you.

351
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,520
Now I change my mind.

352
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,360
You should be responsible for me.

353
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,000
The more I get,

354
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
the more you earn.

355
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,810
But I'm not a person who takes advantage of others.

356
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,470
Think about it.

357
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,400
Do you want to come back

358
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,590
or the money?

359
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,100
I want the money.

360
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,780
A profiteer!

361
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,170
A profiteer.

362
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,990
I still can't believe

363
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,270
it's true.

364
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,950
But now you're mature,

365
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,020
you're no longer a poison,

366
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,490
but a medicine.

367
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm afraid my ambition

368
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,800
will get you involved again.

369
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,490
What's the difference

370
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,390
between getting married and not getting married?

371
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,540
If I hadn't met you,

372
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,840
I would never get married again.

373
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,570
Business is rational.

374
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,780
But I believe you,

375
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,080
which is not rational.

376
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,730
No matter for you or this steel factory,

377
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,010
I have a clear conscience.

378
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,280
It's not too late for you to regret.

379
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,680
Why would I?

380
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,760
I can't wait

381
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,390
to marry you.

382
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,130
Xu Banxia.

383
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,980
Will you marry me?

384
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,310
Zhao Lei,

385
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,220
I love you.

386
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,000
Today,

387
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,440
as a big brother of the bride, Miss Xu Banxia,

388
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,160
and

389
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,310
an old friend of the groom, Mr. Zhao Lei.

390
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,800
as a witness,

391
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm very...

392
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,020
I don't want to read it, all right?

393
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,850
No matter how good the script is,

394
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,790
it's not as good as my impromptu feelings.

395
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,270
When I came here,

396
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,820
I remembered a lot of things in the past.

397
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,800
This factory

398
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,700
used to be the one

399
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,520
I couldn't manage anymore.

400
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,190
No one dared to take it.

401
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,390
Only Xu Banxia.

402
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,350
Not only did she dare to take it,

403
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,270
but

404
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,490
she took over this factory sincerely

405
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,090
from me.

406
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,600
It was her who saved me.

407
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,080
Here,

408
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,620
I sincerely thank Xu Banxia.

409
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,320
Enough, Mr. Wu.

410
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,860
We're a family.

411
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,320
Let's build the factory well

412
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,230
in the future.

413
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,660
OK.

414
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,420
Zhao Lei and I

415
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,340
chose to hold a wedding here

416
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,380
because we hope our steel factory

417
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,410
and everyone

418
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,130
and me

419
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:45,740
can become

420
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,720
real family, okay?

421
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,310
Bravo.

422
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,530
Banxia.

423
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,120
Feng

424
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,010
prepared a gift for you.

425
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,510
Feng.

426
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,400
Qiu.

427
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
Show it.

428
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,710
Bravo.

429
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,720
You're a little girl.

430
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,700
Don't always think about making money.

431
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,130
Your priority now

432
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,690
is to find a good man and get married.

433
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,230
All good men are married.

434
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,890
I just want to make money.

435
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,380
Mr. Qiu,

436
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,050
if without me,

437
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,040
your factory would vanish

438
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,530
in a year, right?

439
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,570
In your eyes,

440
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,460
are there any more rules?

441
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,290
Do you have any respect?

442
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,110
How can you talk to me like that?

443
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,720
Do you know why

444
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,660
the merchants in Binhai

445
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,790
are all over the world?

446
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,600
Because we are united.

447
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,060
The steel factory is a corporation. A corporation needs to be run.

448
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,220
Do you know business?

449
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,640
Have you ever run a company?

450
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,080
You're a senior.

451
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,710
If I don't understand, you can teach me.

452
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,940
That's all I have left.

453
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,140
You can have them all.

454
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,580
If you can't solve the problem,

455
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,100
you should come back soon.

456
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,970
Business is business.

457
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,850
I don't want to hurt our feelings.

458
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,460
Among these people,

459
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,150
I'm still

460
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,410
leaning towards you.

461
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,400
Sis.

462
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,160
This

463
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,340
is mine.

464
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,290
This is from my mom.

465
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,330
Such a big red envelope.

466
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,730
Look.

467
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
I have something to tell you.

468
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,930
You can

469
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,260
take it back.

470
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,260
Zhao Lei and I have discussed

471
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,050
all the money we received for our wedding

472
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,840
plus some of my own savings

473
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,070
will be my personal investment to you.

474
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,750
I think you are right.

475
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,670
Logistics will be

476
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,340
a promising industry

477
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,980
in the future.

478
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,050
Work hard.

479
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,550
Don't embarrass me.

480
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,900
No, Sis.

481
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,490
What do you mean?

482
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,140
I just wanted to

483
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,180
get the investment from the company,

484
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,720
not for personal money.

485
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,520
No.

486
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm counting on you to make me rich.

487
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,910
If you feel embarrassed,

488
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,120
when you go out,

489
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,020
take some wine for me.

490
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,890
Brothers,

491
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,630
after this cup,

492
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,580
I'm leaving.

493
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,830
You two

494
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,750
must stay till the end.

495
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,250
I'm leaving.

496
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,270
Later,

497
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,790
Xu is here.

498
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,930
Tell her for me.

499
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,760
Why are you leaving?

500
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,530
She went to change her clothes.

501
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,340
When she comes back,

502
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,620
she'll have to make a toast to each table.

503
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,320
When she comes back,

504
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,620
you're not here.

505
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,220
You must give her face.

506
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,940
Guys,

507
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,550
when I got married,

508
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
did you give me face?

509
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,360
Just kidding.

510
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,530
I finally understand

511
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,940
love.

512
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,260
I don't want to disappoint you.

513
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,030
Speaking of business,

514
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm definitely not as good as you two.

515
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,520
Speaking of marriage,

516
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,900
you don't have

517
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,150
the right to speak as I do.

518
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,260
This matter

519
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,200
is quite romantic.

520
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,210
But actually,

521
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,340
it's more realistic than anything.

522
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,190
If you want to go far,

523
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,010
you can't just rely on love.

524
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,870
I'm leaving.

525
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,110
A toast to you.

526
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:15,900
You must drink.

527
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,330
Drink.

528
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,430
You promised me

529
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,660
to treat her well.

530
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,130
Sure.

531
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,340
Congratulations.

532
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,690
-Guys. -Feng.

533
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm leaving.

534
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,550
No.

535
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,020
No, no, no.

536
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,520
Anything?

537
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,210
No.

538
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,430
I won't say many

539
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,440
polite words.

540
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,590
I'll talk to Mr. Zhao alone.

541
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,630
Okay.

542
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,210
You guys continue.

543
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:43,880
Here, Mr. Zhao.

544
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,740
If you have anything to say,

545
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,070
just say it.

546
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,220
As to Xu,

547
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,350
you know her better than I do.

548
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,760
She

549
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,610
always tells the truth.

550
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,690
But the truth

551
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,360
is not pleasant to hear.

552
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,230
You should give in to her in the future.

553
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,860
It's a kind of advice from an experienced person.

554
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,930
Don't worry.

555
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,980
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

556
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,390
I've expressed my wish.

557
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,450
I'm leaving.

558
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,330
I won't see you off.

scale, production, sales

Please unveil it.

to leave it to you.

593
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,680
If you have any requests,

594
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,600
just tell me.

595
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,860
As for the details,

596
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,300
I will communicate with you

on certain procedure.

598
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,100
I'll have to trouble you.

599

Through my contact with you,

600
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,360
I have no doubts

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,360
about the chacracter

and business integrity of yours.

603
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,660
But I have to remind you.

604
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,340
Next,

605
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,600
every step we take

will be under CSRC's supervision.

607
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,610
I'll share three words with you.

608
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,940
It's logical, reasonable and legal.

609
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,570
Please remember.

610
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,280
Especially all sorts of data

611
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,740
can't be wrong

612
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,330
or falsely reported.

613
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:04,910
Got it.

614
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,260
Being legal is the bottom line.

615
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,470
We're on the same boat now.

616
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,600
315.

617
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,070
Here.

618
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,220
315, sit down.

619
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:36,840
Yes.

620
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,040
Have a seat.

621
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,280
Why haven't you visited me for so long?

622
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,820
You can't wrong me.

623
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,370
When I heard you wanted to see me,

624
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,380
I came all the way from Shanghai

625
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,380
and brought you some steamed buns in Shanghai.

626
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,960
Ask them to heat them up for you.

627
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,010
Eat it while it's hot. It's delicious.

628
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,090
They've reduced my sentence.

629
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:56,930
That's good.

630
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,130
Qiu.

631
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,100
Look.

632
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,430
Look.

633
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,960
Here.

634
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:03,770
I wrote all these.

635
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,580
This company in England

636
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,060
is the first

637
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,380
standardization certification body in the world.

638
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,650
If we can get

639
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,860
their certification,

640
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,140
it will help a lot for

641
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,390
our steel materials

642
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,440
to flow in the international market.

643
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,740
And about the construction of the steel factory...

644
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,550
Let me see.

645
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,350
Not bad.

646
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,160
You've worked hard.

647
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,840
In the past two years,

648
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,210
the world outside has changed so fast.

649
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,710
I have to work hard.

650
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,030
Otherwise,

651
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,670
how can I get on the bus of yours?

652
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,530
You can take every bus.

653
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,050
You don't have to take this bus.

654
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,960
Dong, listen.

655
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,920
While you were in there,

656
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,120
I've been busy.

657
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,860
The company made a lot of money.

658
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,350
You're part of my business.

659
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,890
I saved it for you.

660
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,090
Once you come out,

661
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,070
I'll give it all to you.

662
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,010
Brother Qiu,

663
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,690
all these years,

664
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,100
I've been riding

665
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,730
your bus.

666
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:13,890
Besides,

667
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,020
you promised me

668
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,620
to work it with me when I get out.

669
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:22,730
Dong.

670
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,660
Listen to me.

671
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,380
You know very well

672
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,350
how your relationship with Xu Banxia is.

673
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,110
You know

674
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,410
what kind of person Xu Banxia is.

675
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,630
With what you did before,

676
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,730
she doesn't trust you anymore.

677
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,060
If this steel factory is mine,

678
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,200
I'll make you the vice president immediately.

679
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,060
I'm also a part-timer.

680
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,740
She has the final say in everything.

681
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,110
Brother Qiu,

682
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,080
I understand.

683
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,700
I know Xu Banxia has prejudice against me.

684
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,400
I understand.

685
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,190
But now,

686
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,660
I don't have my brother-in-law's decoiling plant anymore,

687
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,440
right?

688
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,540
I have no other thoughts.

689
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,190
I just want to do something

690
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,990
with you together.

691
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,980
Do you know how hard I work

692
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,720
to get the time to study?

693
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,420
You know that's what I studied in college.

694
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,690
I've been with you since graduation.

695
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,890
I don't know anything else.

696
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,370
You know I have a dream.

697
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,350
I'm capable.

698
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,630
I'm talented.

699
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,550
I can't retire

700
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,880
after I get out of prison.

701
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,820
315, lower your voice.

702
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,350
Calm down.

703
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,900
Listen to me.

704
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,190
Listen to me for the last time.

705
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,860
Can you give me a way to live?

706
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,730
Dong.

707
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,470
You can do any business

708
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,090
outside with the money I give you.

709
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,380
Why do you have to put all your eggs in one basket?

710
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,230
Dong,

711
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,560
I beg you.

712
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,550
Let's do something else.

713
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,490
Got it.

714
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,550
Got it.

715
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,600
What are you doing?

716
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,510
What are you doing?

717
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,050
What are you doing?

718
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,210
What's the use of this?

719
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,550
What's the use of these things?

720
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,810
What's the use of these things?

721
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,130
The visiting is over. 315.

722
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,090
That day,

723
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,290
when Lou Zheng discussed with me about the listing.

724
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,370
I saw their valuation to our company.

725
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,390
Do you know how hard I tried to hold back my laughter?

726
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,840
Gao Yuejin is right.

727
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,390
After the company is listed,

728
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,330
the value of the company

729
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,320
will expand in an instant.

730
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,390
If you told me

731
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,910
three years ago the company is going public,

732
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,440
I would think you're crazy.

733
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,870
But now,

734
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,270
I'm so excited that I'm going crazy.

735
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,680
Just one thing.

736
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,530
I just want to know

737
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,230
how you hold your laughter.

738
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,570
Come on.

739
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,310
That's it?

740
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,330
You didn't use any strength at all.

741
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,500
Come on.

742
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,990
Let me think.

743
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,080
Miss Xu,

744
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,240
you broke the rules.

745
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,640
What?

746
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:58,490
Who said

747
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,850
we can't talk business at home?

748
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,840
Drink as a punishment.

749
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,680
No.

750
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,990
You...

751
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,390
Am I talking about business?

752
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:05,970
I came back

753
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,780
to share my joy with you immediately.

754
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,639
You're cunning.

755
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,840
Sharing is good.

756
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:12,909
I'm cunning?

757
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,040
Fine.

758
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,690
Well.

759
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,250
Congratulations, Miss Xu.

760
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,409
You've made a great leap for your career.

761
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:20,389
Cheers.

762
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,530
From what I know about you,

763
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,770
you should be

764
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,500
pouring cold water on me.

765
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,179
And you are congratulating me.

766
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,989
Is it from the bottom of your heart?

767
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,550
Absolutely.

768
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,900
There's only boiling water today, no cold water.

769
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,210
And the boiling water is used for making instant noodles.

770
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,100
I really feel very happy

771
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,239
your company is going public.

772
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,630
I'm happy for both business and private life.

773
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,679
For business,

774
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:49,690
right?

775
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,900
The business layout

776
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,219
will take a big step forward.

777
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,139
I'm happy.

778
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,310
In private,

779
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,260
once the company is listed,

780
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,390
you don't have to do everything yourself.

781
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,420
I'm happy too.

782
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,330
In this way,

783
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,610
we have a lot of time

784
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,470
to be together.

785
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,570
What do you want to say?

786
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,650
What kind of person did I marry?

787
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:23,760
Here.

788
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,000
You married

789
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,080
someone worth marrying.

790
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,410
The Northerners

791
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,250
would like to have a rubdown.

792
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,230
Why did you, a Southerner,

793
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,110
ask me here?

794
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,980
I learned these from Koreans.

795
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,750
For businesses we talk with them,

796
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,070
80 percent happened

797
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,200
at the sauna.

798
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,350
They told me

799
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,760
this is called honesty.

800
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,030
They can also bury words spoken

801
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:53,980
in the water.

802
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,270
No one can take them out.

803
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,060
You're right.

804
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,200
Look.

805
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,430
They are all the same as us.

806
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,390
We're so bare.

807
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,680
There's no place to put a recording device.

808
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,580
So,

809
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,010
I think it's good.

810
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,300
Everyone

811
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,220
will rest assured.

812
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,000
Okay.

813
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,980
I'm learning another trick from you today.

814
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,000
It broadened my horizons.

815
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,250
Mr. Qiu,

816
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,140
don't open the wrong cabinet

817
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,590
when you change your clothes later.

818
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,160
Are you sure it's really okay to use steel contact beams

819
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,660
to declare exports

820
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,840
to avoid taxes?

821
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,240
Is it legal?

822
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,870
If it isn't,

823
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,870
can I still sit here with you today?

824
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,610
Don't worry.

825
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,260
All these years,

826
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,680
this is how we operate.

827
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,610
Zhao Lei's company did the same.

828
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,180
But

829
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,250
his relationship with you

830
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,270
is not as close as ours.

831
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,090
So he won't be honest with you.

832
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,690
Right?

833
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,900
There are

834
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,050
many tricks in here.

835
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,080
You

836
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,710
don't need to worry.

837
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,370
Mr. Qiu,

838
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,950
the next batch of steel

839
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,570
will be reported

840
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,680
as high-intensity steel,

841
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,020
and you'll get more personal repays.

842
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,860
What are you talking about?

843
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,240
I did that for the company's benefit.

844
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,440
That's right.

845
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,340
Actually,

846
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,390
we are conducting

847
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,300
reasonable tax evasion

848
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,450
to save cost.

849
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,230
There's only a slight difference

850
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,860
between evasion and avoidance.

851
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,920
Qin Fangping.

852
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,330
I trust you.

853
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,050
You can't harm me.

854
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,530
How can I harm you?

855
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,540
Mr. Qiu, think about it.

856
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,140
Even if the sky falls,

857
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,380
it will be me and our company who will be destroyed, right?

858
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,200
Right?

859
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:42,850
[Prison of Yong'an District, Binhai]

860
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:42,850
[Forbidden Area]

861
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,520
Let's go.

862
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:03,910
Let's go.

863
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,820
Alright.

864
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,070
Don't be so gloomy.

865
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,280
Today is your good day.

866
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,750
After dinner,

867
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,420
I'll take you to the old place.

868
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,700
Relax

869
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,450
and get rid of bad luck.

870
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,760
I don't care about high blood pressure today.

871
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,080
I'll drink with you.

872
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,580
This toast is

873
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,130
to the future.

874
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,760
I hope we can

875
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,880
be together forever.

876
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,460
We'll always be brothers

877
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,710
and live a good life forever.

878
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:35,820
Here.

879
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,540
Dong.

880
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,190
Can you stop thinking nonsense?

881
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,650
Let me be honest with you today.

882
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,720
As long as I have something to eat,

883
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,140
you won't starve.

884
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,400
Thank you for the food, Mr. Qiu.

885
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,830
What are you talking about?

886
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,390
Why are you so narrow-minded?

887
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,130
You didn't tell Xu Banxia

888
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,820
anything about me, right?

889
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,650
I did,

890
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,010
but she didn't listen.

891
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,810
I told you

892
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,080
then in the prison.

893
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,680
I said I have been busy

894
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,970
for these two years.

895
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,060
I saved a lot of money for you.

896
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,300
Look.

897
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,970
Here's another bag.

898
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
What can't you do

899
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,400
with these money?

900
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,460
Why do you have to

901
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,930
put all your eggs in one basket?

902
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,040
You should learn from Feng Yu.

903
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:49,910
Look at him.

904
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,980
He retired and is now an idle man.

905
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,830
Every year, he did nothing

906
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,140
but to wait for dividends.

907
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,890
When the steel factory goes public...

908
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,470
What?

909
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,070
What?

910
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,720
Your steel factory is going public?

911
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,430
Come on.

912
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,430
Cheers.

913
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,110
Congratulations.

914
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,980
So, Xu Banxia gave me the money, right?

915
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,430
Well,

916
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,780
are you afraid that

917
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,850
I'll cause you trouble?

918
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,220
Dong.

919
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,160
The money

920
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,740
was earned by me.

921
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,270
I saved it for you.

922
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,850
Qiu Bizheng.

923
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,350
Do you think I believe you?

924
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,200
Based on my understanding of you for so many years,

925
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,010
would you give so much money

926
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,200
to Guo Qidong, who is useless

927
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,860
now?

928
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,650
Please tell Xu Banxia

929
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,730
don't try to

930
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,940
use so little money to send me away.

931
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,420
Okay.

932
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,480
Fine.

933
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,080
I said I earned the money.

934
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,870
You don't believe me.

935
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,230
Then treat it as Xu Banxia's.

936
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,850
I don't mean anything else.

937
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,310
I just want you to live a good life.

938
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,840
Take it.

939
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,580
Let's eat.

940
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,640
That's right.

941
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,020
Eat.
