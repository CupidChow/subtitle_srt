Miss Xu, don't take it to heart.

5
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,479
These people are all angry.

6
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,970
They couldn't vent their anger

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,070
so they came to you.

8
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,610
It's fine.

9
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,500
They made such a scene

10
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,870
because they can't let it go.

11
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,140
But I know

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,380
no matter how hard they try,

13
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,729
it won't end well.

14
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,310

to stop being angry.

18
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,640
On a cold day like this,

if the water, electricity and heater stops working

20

no one can stand it.

21
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,360
We cannot, just because of the steel mill,

22
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,300
not even try to

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,220
fight for our basic life insurance.

24
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,500
Right.

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,060
This lawsuit is still possible.

26
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,850
I was the deputy chief engineer for this mill.

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,380
My wife was a senior worker

28
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,060
and our son is also an engineer.

29
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,960
I have no problem talking about this steel mill

30
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,390
but I've never filed a lawsuit before.

[Mind your own business.]

35

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,470
Neither have I.

37
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,430
I told you before,

38
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,050
this is my first relationship

39
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,460
it is also my last.

You...

42

Let's talk about something.

43
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,630
It's awkward.

44
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,040
I'll take responsibility for you.

45
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,980
I'll be honest,

46
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,510
so don't get upset,

47
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,720
this lawsuit can't be prosecuted.

48
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,950
They purchased the land legally

49
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,390
and provided compensation according to the government's standard.

50
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
The government has also

51
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,720
arranged training for the mill workers

52
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,020
so we should stop.

53
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,400
Didn't you come all the way here

54
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,910
just for the things in the factory?

55
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,880
Then just quickly buy the stuff and go back home.

56
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,010
You've heard their demands.

57
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,590
You can't save them with sympathy.

58
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,990
Also, the land of the steel mill is for commercial development purposes.

59
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,930

so there's nothing we can do.

63

Let me tell you guys something.

64
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,010
A real thing.

65
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,370
We have a fishing village over there.

66
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,860
The villagers there rely on the sea to survive.

67
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,200
Later because the village wanted to develop,

68
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,270
wanted to rent out a piece of land,

69
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:30,850
one of my friends

70
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,710
rented their land.

71
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,140
But because they couldn't settle on a good deal,

72
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,510
my friend used some extreme ways

73
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,710
and finally rented the land in the end.

74
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,230
Later on the village developed well.

75
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,510
My friend was proud for a few years.

76
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,460
But to the villagers, that land

77
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,550
is their root.

78
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,400
No matter how well the village has developed,

79
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,690
the children no longer have a place to play.

80
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,660
They did lose

81
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,430
the happy life they once had.

82
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,370
During these years,

83
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,810
my friend always felt guilty.

84
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,430
He's always thinking about how to make up things,

85
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,300
how to compensate,

86
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,040
but he still hasn't figured it out.

87
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,300
Do you understand what I mean?

88
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,120
Yes.

89
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,580
You just want to make up for it

90
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,240
while you still can

91
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,100
right?

92
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,300
Yes.

93
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,460
Indeed, with the development of the times

94
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,790
some are happy and some are worried.

95
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,720
We can't change anything.

96
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,030
But for me,

97
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,210
I still want to help them fight for something.

98
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,140
Even if it's just using my voice,

99
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,930
I want to do as much as I can.

100
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,920
Okay, I'll think of a way.

101
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,350
We should at least help them fight for some

102
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,590
basic life insurance.

103
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,420
Boss.

104
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,360
Coming.

Check, please.

106
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
It's already been paid.

107
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,450
Paid by who?

108
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,340
The men at that table paid for you.

109
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,910
Attorney Liu,

110
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,800
come to the family building with me later.

111

Mr. Zhao.

113
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,890
How do they know your surname is Zhao?

114
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,010
They even know your name is Xu Banxia.

115
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,810
Of course they know my surname is Zhao.

116
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,560
It's okay. You two stay here.

117
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,550
What's up?

118
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,460
Our boss wants to talk to you.

119
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,490
I'll wait for you

120
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,230
tonight at 2 A.M. in front of your hotel.

121
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,110
Just you.

122
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,430
Your boss is finally willing to talk.

123
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,630
Okay.

124
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,020
What do they want from you?

125
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,260
Nothing.

126
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,530
It's just the usual

127
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,500
intimidating people.

128
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,780
Everything's okay?

129
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,590
Don't worry.

130
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,810
It's cold. Let's go back.

131
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:06,620
Let's go.

132
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,880
Why are you here?

133
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm here to stay for a while.

134
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,220
It's quiet here.

135
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,270
Here,

136
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,090
some imported biscuits.

137
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,550
Don't worry about me.

138
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,520
I'll read some books.

139
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,810
You can go on with your work.

140
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,180
Tell me, what happened?

141
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,870
Mom,

142
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,880
tell me,

143
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,530
why is it so hard to change someone.

144
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,030
Who do you want to change?

145
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,400
Tong Xiaoqi?

146
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,340
Why do you think you can change him

147
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,860
just because you are dating him?

148
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,920
Love needs mutual adjustment.

149
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,160
That's right.

150
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,880
Then why can't he adapt to me?

151
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,530
Why should I be the one to adapt to him?

152
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:26,970
Yeah.

153
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,010
Why isn't he the one adapting to my daughter?

154
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
He doesn't want to adapt to you,

155
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,670
nor do you want to adapt to him...

156
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,600
Break up!

157
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,450
It's better to break up earlier than later.

158
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,790
Let's not waste time

159
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,180
and break up with him earlier, okay?

160
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,460
You don't want to?

161
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,600
Then you just have to get used to it.

162
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,350
I will change him for sure.

163
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,320
You're so funny.

164
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,700
What makes you think

165
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,750
you can change others?

166
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,300
Let's think about this another way,

167
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,220
do you think Tong Xiaoqi can change you?

168
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,980
You, Tong Xiaoqi, and your father

169
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,530
are actually the same kind of people.

170
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,500
The kind that is hard to be changed by others.

171
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,530
Back then,

172
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,050
I didn't approve of a lot of the decisions your dad made.

173
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,520
But what could I do?

174
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,920
I could only respect and adapt to him.

175
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,210
Then, something happened.

176
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,090
He went inside.

177
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,080
I'm willing to wait for him.

178
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,960
That's my choice.

179
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,750
I'll adapt to the person I love.

180
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,270
What about you?

181
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,100
Are you ready to adapt to the person you love?

182
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,970
Yes.

183
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,930
If he loves me,

184
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,650
he must get used to me.

185
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,690
Why are you staring at me like that?

186
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
Are you afraid I'll run away?

187
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,210
Go ahead.

188
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,980
I wouldn't dare.

189
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,330
I still can't believe this is real.

190
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,650
Which part do you not believe?

191
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,950
Is it you or me?

192
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,120
It's not too late for you to regret.

193
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:48,930
What's wrong?

194
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,620
You don't want to take responsibility for me already?

195
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,250
I'm just afraid you didn't think it through.

196
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,920
Tell me,

197
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,710
did you not think it through?

198
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,180
Since I came here,

199
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,840
I haven't slept properly at all.

200
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,740
Let's go to sleep.

201
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,840
Have a good sleep.

202
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,870
Mr. Zhao, please.

203
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:36,790
He's here.

204
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,080
What's your name?

205
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,050
I'm Wang Dasheng.

206
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,300
Hello, Mr. Wang.

207
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,250
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

208
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,050
It's the middle of the night

209
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,840
and so cold

210
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,260
you called me to go fishing?

211
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,900
That's right.

212
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,690
You South people don't understand.

213
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,870
This is called ice fishing.

214
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,920
Normally, we need to dig a few more holes.

215
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,800
The fish needs to breathe

216
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,310
so it will swim into the net on its own.

217
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,770
But today,

218
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,100
one hole is enough.

219
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,990
Looking at your body...

220
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,360
Hey! That is big enough!

221
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,990
You've learned a lot.

222
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,320
I've asked around

223
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,610
and heard you're here to see the equipment?

224
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,710
I don't understand.

225
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,450
Why don't you guys just stay at home

226
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,350
instead of coming here?

227
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,220
By the way,

228
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,320
Xu Banxia is your woman, right?

229
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,930
You have to go back and discipline your woman.

230
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,020
Tell her to mind her own business and leave now.

231
00:22:59,330 --> 00:22:59,830
Mr. Wang,

232
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,010
I'll be honest with you.

233
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,280
If I could manage her,

234
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,940
she wouldn't have come to the Northeast.

235
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,900
Then this isn't good.

236
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,080
The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.

237
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,320
Mr. Wang, look.

238
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,740
I tried to meet you, but you would never meet me

239
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,880
right?

240
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,480
Miss Xu is a businesswoman

241
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,520
and I can tell that

242
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,770
you are also a businessman.

243
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,290
Could we maybe sit down

244
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,570
and talk in the way of a businessman

245
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,050
to solve the problem?

246
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,380
You always ask me to come fishing in the middle of the night

247
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,880
but if this doesn't work for you,

248
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,780
the problem can't be solved.

249
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,380
What do you think?

250
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,250
There's a net down there,

251
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,030
it can handle you.

252
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,150
Got it.

253
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,430
Don't forget

254
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
you came here voluntarily.

255
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:41,840
Mr. Wang,

256
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,590
how about this,

257
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,060
I did jump down voluntarily

258
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,640
but after I climb up,

259
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,760
can we sit down and talk properly?

260
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,630
No, wait,

261
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,960
I didn't hear what you said.

262
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,000
What are you going to do willingly?

263
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,790
Just tell me, can we sit down and talk?

264
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,810
The water is cold at this temperature.

265
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,480
Do you have a time limit?

266
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,600
Let me tell you,

267
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,780
in there

268
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,280
I can only stay for three minutes maximum.

269
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,980
If it goes over three minutes,

270
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,000
please take me to the hospital.

271
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,980
Okay?

272
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,260
He's really jumping?

273
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,740
Hurry! Get him!

274
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,580
Zhao Lei!

275
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,170
Zhao Lei!

276
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,570
Don’t... don't hug me.

277
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,390
I'm... I'm too cold.

278
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,880
Mr.... Mr. Wang has made a deal.

279
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:56,940
To...

280
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,630
tomorrow we will meet and talk.

281
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,310
President Gao.

282
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,780
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

283
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,500
Hello.

284
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,010
Let's go, its been a long time since I was here.

285
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,400
You must be tired.

286
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,690
This is our company's rules and management system.

287
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,530
President Gao, please come in.

288
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,050
Okay.

289
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,680
This is our coordination room.

290
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,080
Please have a seat.

291
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:58,910
Okay.

292
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,940
How do you feel after the tour?

293
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,280
Nothing.

294
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,420
Feeling nothing is also a feeling.

295
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,720
After seeing them,

296
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,310
can you tell that your truck team

297
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,170
is different from theirs?

298
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
This can't be compared.

299
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,410
Your Top Squad truck team

300
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,370
depends on friendship and loyalty.

301
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,610
Driving is alright,

302
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,210
but starting a company is not.

303
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,090
Let's not even talk about business management.

304
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,550
No matter how hard you study,

305
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,420
you're just protecting a small truck team

306
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,380
doing small jobs and earning small money.

307
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,450
It's alright.

308
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,740
It's pretty good.

309
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,840
If you really can't handle

310
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,320
Tong Xiaoqi's men,

311
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,640
just disband them.

312
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,430
You and Tong Xiaoqi can drive your car

313
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,640
and go to the transportation company we went to today.

314
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,360
You can go become a director or manager.

315
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,130
Think about it.

316
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,660
I've already thought about it.

317
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,910
We're going to do it ourselves.

318
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,160
Just wait and see.

319
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,620
Who is it?

320
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,190
What?

321
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,390
Wildcat,

322
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:34,870
what are you doing?

323
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,640
Working.

324
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,950
Come on, get up. -Are you going to let us live

325
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,820
-Last night, all of us worked till midnight.

326
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,150
We've finished our work.

327
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,930
Come, Wei.

328
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,430
Get up.

329
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,580
Go to the trunk

330
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,100
and help me bring the two boards here.

331
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:46,840
Eelhead.

332
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,900
Help me.

333
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,340
No.

334
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,540
No.

335
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,110
Wildcat, what are you trying to do?

336
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,210
I need to tidy up.

337
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,210
Tidy up what?

338
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,440
-You guys clean up there. -Here.

339
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,230

Fold the blankets.

Throw away all the stinky socks under the bed.

Don't leave any blind spots

I'll check later.

346
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,210
Whose stinky socks is this? Do you still want it?

347

No, no.

It feels like I'm back inside.

Mr. Wang said he will only meet one person.

395
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,340
He wants to meet someone who can talk.

Just follow me.

Okay.

399
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,010
I'll go.

400
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,400

Your man is a man, a real man.

404
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,199
I like it.

405
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,560
What is this?

406
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,050
A sales contract.

407
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,650
I bought the steel mill's contract.

If you want to buy anything, spend how much money,

409
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,460
you'll have to talk to me about it.

410

In this factory,

411

Those junk can take whatever they like.

413
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,820
I don't care if they pay or not.

414
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:56,489
But...

415
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,490
remember,

416
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,370
don't worry about things you shouldn't worry about.

417
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,600
Leave right after you finish your business.

418
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,130
Will they stop messing with you if I leave?

419
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,770
I'm not the one you should take care of.

420
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,130
Xu Banxia,

421
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,450
you know nothing.

422
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,960
I auctioned that land.

423
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,710
I've given them retirement pensions and compensation fees.

424
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,260
I've given it all.

425
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,980
I did everything I need to do.

426
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,080
I've spent all the money I need to spend.

427
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,900
But none of my men can get in.

428
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,780
They refused to leave.

429
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,790
Is it my fault?

430
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,070
Then why didn't you just talk to them?

431
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,840
All you did was cut off their water and electricity

432
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,810
and find some strong, scary looking men to watch them every day.

433
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,710
Do you think this will solve the problem?

434
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,500
Are you stupid?

435
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,090
I'm talking about business

436
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,810
they are talking about feelings.

437
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,710
Feelings for this damn steel mill.

438
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,930
These are two different things.

439
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,740
They want this factory to reoperate.

440
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,050
Do you think it's possible?

441
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,020
These people

442
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,030
have lived in this steel mill for generations.

443
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,940
This is the foundation for their living.

444
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,820
But now,

445
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,880
they don't even have a basic life insurance.

446
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,830
This is because you cut off their water and electricity.

447
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,750
It's undeniable.

448
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,510
Have you ever seen

449
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,830
their current living environment?

450
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,620
Have you ever listened to their thoughts?

451
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,060
You can spend hundreds of millions to buy a land.

452
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,420
Then why can't you be considerate about

453
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:13,930
their futures?

454
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,300
Why should I be considerate about them?

455
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,820
Who will consider my loss?

456
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,690
Will you?

457
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,830
Listen, Xu Banxia

458
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,750
before this,

459
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,360
they didn't plan to sue me.

460
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,410
But after you came,

461
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,180
you stirred up this mess

462
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,010
you know?

463
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,150
Mr. Wang, you're right

464
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,690
I'm here to buy equipment.

465
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,760
If you can sell it to me at a low price,

466
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,760
I will be extremely grateful.

467
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,620
But you have to solve the problem of the families

468
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,850
restore their water and electricity

469
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,650
give them their basic life insurance

470
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,710
or else I'll stand by their side till the end.

471
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,660
Then if I give them back their water and electricity,

472
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,540
can you guarantee that they won't cause any more trouble?

473
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,750
I can't guarantee that.

474
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,700
See?

475
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
But at least I can guarantee

476
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,760
this conflict won't be aggravated.

477
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,080
Think about it,

478
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,340
you're also having a hard time making progress right now right?

479
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,870
Fine, I'll do as you said,

480
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,650
I'll give them back their water and electricity.

481
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,470
Miss Xu, please help me say something

482
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,090
tell them

483
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,790
there's nothing in it for them even if they drag me down.

484
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,850
I didn't decide on the compensation

485
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,470
it was, it was decided by the country.

486
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,690
We'll talk about the compensation later

487
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,130
when can I check the equipment?

488
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,280
That's easy

489
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,520
I'll get my secretary

490
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,630
to go to the factory with you immediately.

491
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,990
Take away whatever equipment you like.

492
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:05,970
Then it's a deal

493
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,340
I'll go with the local engineers

494
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,890
don't make it difficult for us.

495
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,620
Don't worry

496
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,540
it's a deal.

497
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,420
I wish Miss Xu a good trip

498
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,650
and striving business.

499
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,420
Boss! Boss!

500
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,050
What are you doing?

501
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,380
Boss, look at this

502
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,640
look here

503
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,610
tofu cubes

504
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,100
and this

505
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,130
isn't this familiar?

506
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,110
It's the same as when we were inside.

507
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,670
What is this?

508
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,390
Look at what she did

509
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,110
you spoil her.

510
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,950
Yeah.

511
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,340
It's okay for us to work hard

512
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,830
as long as we can make money,

513
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,980
but it's not okay for her to do this.

514
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,520
Get out.

515
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,850
What do you want?

516
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,400
I've written it down

517
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,850
can't you read?

518
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,230
Let's not make so many restrictions, okay?

519
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,650
We've been looking at these things for years inside

520
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,390
we've been restricted enough

521
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,560
we don't want to see it anymore, okay?

522
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,490
This is different

523
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm setting rules for the truck team.

524
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,170
Why are there so many rules?

525
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,360
What do you want?

526
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,410
I want you to be good.

527
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,300
I want the truck team to be good, is that not okay?

528
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,870
What does "good" mean?

529
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,130
Tell me, what does it mean.

530
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,300
Top Squad truck team

531
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,310
becoming Top Squad transportation company is "good".

532
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,060
Not constantly pulling sand around is called "good"!

533
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,350
That's what you think is good!

534
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,850
If you want to make it better, you can

535
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,890
but why are you doing this?

536
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,590
How did this truck team rise from the bottom?

537
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,380
Do you not remember?

538
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,330
You were here when the truck team just started.

539
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,370
We took all the dirty jobs

540
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,550
athletes run in a relay race.

541
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,830
while we sleep in relay.

542
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,140
When we pull sand,

543
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,460
loader, driver,

544
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
all of them carried it by themselves.

545
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,900
When the car broke down and we had no money to fix it

546
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,810
Plunger and the others put behind their dignity

547
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,370
and picked up unwanted parts at the auto repair shop.

548
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,860
They overload the junk car

549
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,370
because they need to make money.

550
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,910
They are all risking their lives, you know?

551
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,590
Back then,

552
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,010
you never thought we were unproper.

553
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,380
Now that we've made money,

554
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,150
you've become picky, you set rules,

555
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,320
you say we are unproper.

556
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,360
In your eyes,

557
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,050
I'm someone who abandons others

558
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,800
and is ungrateful, right?

559
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,690
Isn't that how you see me?

560
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,010
I don’t care what you think

561
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,100
what you're doing is making them leave.

562
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,140
Are you trying to

563
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,980
force me to leave?

564
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,270
I don't care what you think

565
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
what you're doing isn't going to work.

566
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,960
Listen,

567
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,890
if you force them to leave, you're forcing me to leave.

568
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,250
Remember this.

569
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:54,820
Tong Xiaoqi,

570
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,970
I went to another transportation company

571
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,420
and copied down their rules and regulations.

572
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:02,860
If they kick me out,

573
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,560
I'll treat everyone in the office to dinner.

574
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,630
In order to get close to

575
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,340
that finance girl,

576
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,300
I wore high heels

577
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,860
and went shopping with her all day

578
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,940
because I want to know

579
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,030
how they control their cost.

580
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,420
But howcome in your eyes

581
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,660
I'm just here to pick on you guys

582
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,890
and force you guys to leave?

583
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,300
If you really want this truck team to become better,

584
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,130
this is the only way,

585
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,920
there's no other way.

586
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,270
If you're doing this for your brotherhood,

587
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,780
I'll force you today

588
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,240
to stop your truck team.

589
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,270
Whether or not I continue my truck team

590
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,060
is none of your business.

591
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,270
Even our boss never said anything

592
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,800
so why are you?
