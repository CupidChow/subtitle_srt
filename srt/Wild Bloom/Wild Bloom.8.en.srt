If you have no objections,

5
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,940
I'll contact the embassy

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,120
to book tickets for us.

7
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,170
Xu, what do you think?

8
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,680
You can go. I'm not leaving.

9
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,170
No.

10
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,410
What are you going to do?

11
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,850
I can't leave. I have to get the money back.

12
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,979
Don't worry. I...

13
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,180
Didn't I tell you just now?

14
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,060
I'll be responsible for your loss.

15
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,650
Besides, you lost nothing.

16
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,820
It's not safe for you

17
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,590
to stay here alone.

18
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,860
I've lost a lot.

19
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:18,590
No.

20
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,900
I don't believe

21
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,160
this is the only steel mill here.

22
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,650
-Xu. -I need to give it a try.

23
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,829
Why are you trying?

24
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,440
You can't even speak the local language.

25
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,820
Besides,

26
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,980
it's about tens of thousands of tons of steel.

27
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,860
You're just a girl.

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,060
How can you expect it to happen as you wish?

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,740
Don't be so stubborn. Listen to me.

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,260
Go back with us.

31
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,340
I'll bring you here again

32

when it's all sorted.

33
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,420
Ms. Xu, it’s not the time.

34
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,090
-Don’t always rebel against us. -Listen to us.

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,820
Right.

36
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,900
Just go back with us.

37
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,070
Well,

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,140
go back to your work.

39
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,870
Leave me alone.

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,820
-No. -Let me think about it.

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,780
Think about what?

42
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,140
Why can't you listen to us?

43
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,540

44
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,410

45

46

Xu.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,380
Leave her alone.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,260
I shouldn't have brought her here.

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,370
What a bad temper.

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,820
Don't be mad, boss.

51
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,900
Calm down.

52
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,170
Please forgive her.

53
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,300
Maybe she is thinking of a way.

54
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,330
How about this?

55
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,380
How about

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,420
we sit down

57
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,940
and discuss this again?

58
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,890
Discuss what?

59
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,250
Let's go back to China!

62

What's wrong, Feng?

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,880
I thought you were asleep.

64
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,980
There's a Chinese restaurant

65
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,180
downstairs around the corner.

66
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:48,700
I thought you hadn't eaten,

67
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,460
so I ordered takeaway for you.

68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,140
Thank you.

69
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,390
Come in.

70
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,610
Have you eaten?

71
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,250
Yes.

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,900
It's salty. Mix it.

73
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,010
Look at you.

74
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,330
Why did you go against Mr. Wu?

75
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,610
He asked you to go back for your own good.

76
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,060
Fine, I know what you think.

77
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,710
Of course you want to make money,

78
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,170
but life is also important.

79
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,780
Didn't you hear what the embassy guy said?

80
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,710
This place is a mess.

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,340
Even the police can't solve it.

82
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,659
How can you solve it even if you stay?

83
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,080
You're a girl.

84
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,860
Look.

85
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,610
Mr. Wu bought a return ticket

86
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,580
for you.

87
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,740
Although he always gets angry with you,

88
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,960
he actually cares about you.

89
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,220
Didn't we agree when we came here?

90

We're in the same boat.

91
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,240
Be good. Don't be stubborn.

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
Come back with us tomorrow.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,330

I understand what you mean.

96

But

97
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,950
my situation is different from yours.

98
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,790
I came here

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,620
with a bunch of debts

100
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,340
for building a storage yard.

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,150
How can I go back?

102
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,940
Those can crush me to death.

103
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,909
I also owe you guys money.

104
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,770
Right.

105
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,510
That's the truth.

106
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,580
But you can't work this hard.

107
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,780
I know you care about me.

108
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,700
But there are

109
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,340
a lot of people at the storage yard

110
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,380
counting on me.

111
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,870
I'm too ashamed to go back.

112
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,540
If you were me,

113
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,020
would you just go back like this?

114
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,950
Are you really not going back?

115
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:10,770
No.

116
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,350
That's all I have.

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,500
I'll leave them to you.

119

The embassy's phone number is on the back.

120
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,710
Call him if anything happens.

121
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,560
I can't stop you.

122
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,340
If you can't solve the problem,

123
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,890
just stay for a few days and come back.

124

Okay?

125
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,560
Hello.

126
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,570
Hello.

127
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,240
Liar.

128
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,620
We haven't found the scammer.

129
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,300
You can ask them if you have any questions.

130
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,210
We've informed the embassy

131
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,050
of the situation.

132
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,000
how much money have we earned

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,270
after collecting steel scrap for all these years?

134
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,980
If we make a good deal this time,

135
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,340
we'll make a fortune.

136
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,740
Then we can make a comeback.

137
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,020
I think

138
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,580
we need to build a big parking lot here.

139
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,810
I'll get dozens of trucks then

140
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,830
and put them there.

141
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,700
Isn't it magnificent?

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:26,850
Here.

143
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,730
We can build a three-storey building.

144
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,410
A reception on the first floor

145
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,120
to welcome clients.

146
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,900
The second floor

147
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,750
is the office, only for business.

148
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,660
Of course. I'll pay you for what I borrow.

149
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,030
I'll pay you interest.

150
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,570
One million

151
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,940
at an annualised interest rate of 20%.

152
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:58,610
Okay.

153
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,340
But there's one thing, Mr Xu.

154
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,490
You can't give me less interest.

155
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,350
If you can give me one million,

156
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,210
I'll return your capital and the interest

157
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,080
after I go back with the steel scrap.

158
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,820
Do you have a long-term plan

159
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,810
since you want to collaborate with me for a long time?

160
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,780
Yes.

161
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,950
I'm planning to buy the land

162
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,020
near the storage yard.

163
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,660
I also want to

164
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,420
build a port

165
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,780
that could service ships of tens of thousands of tons.

166
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,190
Then the steel we import later

167
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,730
can be unloaded at our own dock.

168
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,740
In the future,

169
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,990
when our company becomes better,

170
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,830
I promise

171
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,420
we can eat together

172
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,740
and make money together.

173
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,340
Let's make a fortune together.

174
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,860
Okay, thank you, boss.

175
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,420
Thank you, boss.

176
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,460
Cheers.

177
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,710
Cheers.

178
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,130
I'm telling you.

179
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,710
Don't make mistakes

180
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,940
with the proportion of cement and sand.

181
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,990
Don't worry. I'm watching here.

182
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,510
Okay.

183
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,740
Don't worry.

184
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,530
I'll leave it to you.

185
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,540
Okay, no problem.

186
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,010
Mr. Chen.

187
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,500
Let's have dinner together tonight.

188
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,760
I've prepared some yellow wine.

189
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,490
Let's drink together.

190
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,580
Do you want to

191
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,340
talk about the salary?

192
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,020
It's almost New Year.

193
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,090
The workers kept pushing on me.

194
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,610
If you don't pay, it will affect the progress.

195
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,090
Well, ask them

196
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,210
to hold on for a few more days.

197
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,940
My boss has gone abroad.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,770
It's been over a month.

199
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,680
She'll be back soon.

200
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,820
My storage yard is here.

201
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,320
What are you worried about?

202
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,630
I can't run away, right?

203
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,980
Yes, you can't.

204
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,690
How about this?

205
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,350
You can pay the construction fee later.

206
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,700
As for the salary, you...

207
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,890
Fu, please.

208
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Hold on for a few more days.

209
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,100
We will build a port here

210
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,420
at the storage yard later on.

211
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,980
You know it's a big project.

212
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,280
I'll recommend you to my boss when she comes back.

213
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,860
Please.

214
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,860
Who are you?

215
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,460
You're awake.

216
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,390
Ms. Xu, Xu Banxia, right?

217
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,060
You fainted that day.

218
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,280
The staff at the hotel checked your passport

219
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,330
and called the embassy.

220
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,780
I brought the doctor here.

221
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,990
You're fine. Don't worry.

222
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,370
Who are you?

223
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,340
I'm Yan.

224
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,050
I'm studying at a music school here.

225
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,750
I work part-time.

226
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,180
It's Secretary Yang from the embassy

227
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,140
asked me to take care of you.

228
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,420
The embassy is so nice.

229
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
You even got me a doctor.

230
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,860
Hello, Mr. Yang, this is Yan.

231
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,420
Xu Banxia is awake.

232
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,930
Just for your information,

233
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,420
I think she's still quite weak.

234
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,620
Thank you.

235
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,100
Okay, no problem.

236
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,740
You must be hungry. What would you like to eat?

237
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,860
There's a Chinese restaurant on the first floor.

238
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,620
Do you have money?

239
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,720
I have money.

240
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,340
Fine.

241
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,680
Then I don't have to check on you everyday.

242
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,510
You can go downstairs and order food if you're hungry.

243
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,350
I have exams at school these days.

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
When are you going back?

245
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,950
Do you know

246
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,270
where I can buy steel scrap here?

247
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,820
Steel?

248
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,410
How should I know?

249
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,290
You can speak local language, right?

250
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes.

251
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,250
How about this?

252
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,170
Can you be my translator for a few days?

253
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,300
I'll pay you, okay?

254
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,400
Sure.

255
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,660
No problem. I'm available anytime.

256
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,680
Let me buy you something to eat.

257
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,450
Okay.

258
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,040
Okay.

259
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,940
I'll be back soon.

260
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,170
Did any Chinese ever come here?

261
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,200
No.

262
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,950
Thank you.

263
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,580
No.

264
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,660
They shook their heads when talking about Chinese. No.

265
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,980
Can we talk

266
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,530
back in the office?

267
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,210
No.

268
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,380
Let's talk here.

269
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,540
Tell me.

270
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,140
Where is the money?

271
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,930
Didn't I tell you?

272
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,440
I was scammed in the North.

273
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,630
Ask Wu Jianshe if you don't believe me.

274
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,700
Ask Qiu Bizheng.

275
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,460
Who should I ask?

276
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,220
You are all in cahoots.

277
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,680
You're not telling the truth.

278
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,260
Ask Xu.

279
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,340
Ask Xu Banxia, okay?

280
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:29,810
OK.

281
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,580
Ask Xu Banxia to come back.

282
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,210
I'll ask her.

283
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,350
She's not back from the North.

284
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,010
You're lying.

285
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,630
Why are you back when she's not?

286
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,220
The New Year is coming.

287
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,700
Where can I go if I don't come back?

288
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,210
How do you want to celebrate the New Year without money?

289
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,180
I'm trying to figure it out.

290
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,700
Stop talking nonsense.

291
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:49,970
Tell me.

292
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,650
Did you give the money to a mistress?

293
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,940
Don't think I don't know

294
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,060
what you did

295
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,220
outside.

296
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,970
Tell me the truth.

297
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,360
Alright, keep your voice down.

298
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,260
Can you not say this

299
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,900
in front of my colleagues?

300
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,140
Don't you feel ashamed? Save some face for me, okay?

301
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,100
Save face for you?

302
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,370
Why can't you admit it if you dare do it?

303
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,780
Let me tell you.

304
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,340
Where did you hear this bullshit from?

305
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,530
You think it's bullshit?

306
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,030
Every time when I talk about this, you just run away.

307
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,440
Look how much we lost

308
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,450
in the past six months.

309
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,020
How long do you think the factory can hold on

310
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,700
before going bankrupt?

311
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,900
Until the New Year!

312
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:22,930
I know

313
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,310
you don't want to live with me anymore.

314
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,220
Listen.

315
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,110
You're in debt now.

316
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,700
You can't divorce me.

317
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
If you want to live with that mistress,

318
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,190
pay off your debt first.

319
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,820
By then,

320
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,160
we can divide our property

321
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,710
and split up.

322
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,820
The rise of steel price this year

323
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,380
is much bigger than before.

324
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,890
Under such circumstances,

325
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,540
we need to be more united

326
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,500
among partners.

327
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,260
No problem.

328
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,050
We need to trust each other even more.

329
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,020
Today is a thank-you banquet.

330
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,300
Wish you all good luck next year.

331
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,060
Okay, thank you, Mr. Zhao.

332
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,740
Let's move forward together.

333
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,940
Mr. Sun.

334
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,220
A toast to you.

335
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,660
Hello, everyone.

336
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,660
I heard you're here.

337
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,570
Cheers.

338
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,440
Thank you for helping my factory.

339
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,380
I'll treat you next time.

340
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,240
You're welcome.

341
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,870
Let me introduce a friend to you.

342
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,100
Mr. Qiu.

343
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,980
Mr. Qiu, right?

344
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,160
Let me introduce someone to you.

345
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,880
This is Zhao Lei, Mr. Zhao.

346
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,130
You are both in the same industry. You must know each other, right?

347
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,750
Why are you here?

348
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,080
I know you.

349
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,940
Aren't you supposed to be abroad?

350
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,420
We're all back.

351
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:31,990
All back?

352
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,820
Xu Banxia was still on the phone with me this afternoon.

353
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,680
What happened?

354
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,970
Mr. Zhao,

355
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,300
I wanted to tell you this,

356
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,180
but after thinking about it,

357
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,410
it's Wu Jianshe's business after all.

358
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,800
So I didn't go there.

359
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,770
We were scammed in the North.

360
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,500
Wu Jianshe's contact

361
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,360
is a liar.

362
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,260
Everyone came back after losing money.

363
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,080
Luckily,

364
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
we only lost the deposit.

365
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,930
What about Xu Banxia?

366
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,620
She refused to come back.

367
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,890
She said she must wait there

368
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,819
until the police catch the liar.

369
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,530
Then she can come back.

370
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,540
It'll be a long time.

371
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,170
But Mr. Zhao,

372
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,079
you have to be

373
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,520
mentally prepared.

374
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,060
Xu Banxia's situation

375
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,160
is different from ours.

376
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,690
We only lost the deposit.

377
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,720
We bought it.

378
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,220
But I heard

379
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,020
you gave her all the money

380
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,930
for those 15,000 tons of goods

381
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,750
and the transport and tax fee.

382
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,760
It must be worth over 10 million in total.

383
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,500
She has been showing off this

384
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,970
in the North.

385
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,310
Actually, she didn't lose money.

386
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,710
Instead, she has the 10 million you gave her

387
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,420
and just doesn't want to come back.

388
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:51,860
Well,

389
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,140
you can't trust someone easily

390
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,460
in business.

391
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,760
What do you mean?

392
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,680
Didn't you talk on the phone?

393
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,260
She really didn't tell you anything?

394
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,080
When we left that place,

395
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,000
it was freezing. The Spring Festival was coming.

396
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,380
Xu Banxia is alone.

397
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,070
She doesn't have any contact either.

398
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,430
She can't even speak local language,

399
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,860
yet she refused to come back.

400
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,700
But Mr. Zhao, don't worry.

401
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,400
If she's trying to defraud you,

402
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,820
you have me as your friend.

403
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,090
As long as you beg me...

404
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,390
Qiu Bizheng.

405
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,350
Who do you think you are?

406
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,580
You left Xu Banxia

407
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,450
abroad.

408
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,410
What are you doing?

409
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,350
Don't you feel guilty?

410
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,150
Mr. Qiu.

411
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:45,850
Hello.

412
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:46,960
Hello.

413
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,580
How are things going over there?

414
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,690
Is everything going well?

415
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,660
Mr. Zhao.

416
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,050
Everything goes well.

417
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,570
Okay.

418
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,980
How did you know my room number?

419
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,180
I met Qiu Bizheng yesterday

420
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,900
and called Feng Yu today.

421
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:20,900
Then...

422
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,340
Why didn't you

423
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,230
tell me the truth?

424
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,300
They're all back. You were scammed.

425
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,700
You call this everything going smoothly?

426
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,660
How?

427
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,860
Why are you still there?

428
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,660
Why don't you come back?

429
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,970
Tell me. When will you come back?

430
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,340
Xu Banxia, let me tell you.

431
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,670
I'm very angry now.

432
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,070
How dare you tell me nothing

433
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,450
about what had happened?

434
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,260
Is this how you treat your partner?

435
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,210
You're making me very upset now.

436
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,050
Understand?

437
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,150
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

438
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,660
I won't run away with the money.

439
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,210
I'm not being nice to you.

440
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,950
I just want to tell you that

441
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,980
I made the contract.

442
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:10,780
I signed the contract.

443
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,740
But I'm not someone

444
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,910
who would take advantage of others.

445
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,850
Listen.

446
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,520
You have plenty of chance to make money,

447
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,140
but you only have one life.

448
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,030
Chinese New Year is coming.

449
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,300
Come back.

450
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,070
Okay?

451
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,700
What's your chest circumference?

452
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,260
Hello.

453
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,390
Su,

454
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,210
how's everything going?

455
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,270
It's been so long

456
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,260
since you called me last time.

457
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,740
I'm abroad.

458
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,460
It's not as convenient as it is in China.

459
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,020
I've got some trouble here.

460
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
Let's talk when I come back.

461
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,180
What size do you wear?

462
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,060
I'm going to buy a leather coat.

463
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,440
I'll bring you one.

464
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,100
Just tell me.

465
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,850
Fatty, you finally showed up.

466
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,300
What's going on over there?

467
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,410
Xiaoqi?

468
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,400
Xiaoqi went to the Highway Bureau.

469
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,740
He has to take exams every half year

470
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,160
for his transportation and operation license.

471
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,220
It's not easy. He has to take exams.

472
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,860
But I have to tell you something now.

473
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,730
We can't afford the third payment

474
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,860
for our project.

475
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,530
The Spring Festival is coming.

476
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,530
We'll be in trouble if we still can't pay.

477
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,940
The construction team just told me

478
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,960
they were going to take the materials back.

479
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,640
When are you coming back?

480
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,540
You didn't even give me a chance

481
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,250
to explain.

482
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,360
I'll be back soon.

483
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,950
Okay, don't worry.

484
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,860
I'm here. Don't worry.

485
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,780
What's your chest circumference?

486
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,700
Chest circumference?

487
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,120
She said it's fox fur.

488
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,950
These hats look similar.

489
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,620
Yes.

490
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,890
But the leather goods here are really cheap.

491
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,350
Many Chinese clothing merchants

492
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,460
import clothes from here.

493
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,680
Hello.

494
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,780
What do you have here?

495
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,350
This one.

496
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,410
How much is it?

497
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,140
Do you want it?

498
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,700
Forget it.

499
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,260
Nina?

500
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,720
Shall we buy it?

501
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,060
Nina!

502
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,180
Liar.

503
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,780
What?

504
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,370
You liar! Stop!

505
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,380
Banxia!

506
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,210
Stop!

507
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,370
Banxia.

508
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:27,700
Stop!

509
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,270
Stop, Nina!

510
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,250
Stop!

511
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,230
Where is the money?

512
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,120
Where is my money?

513
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,420
Where is the money?

514
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,740
Let me explain.

515
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,860
Liar! Liar!

516
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,810
Where is my money?

517
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,090
Where is my money?

518
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,190
I don't know.

519
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,860
She said she doesn't know where the money is.

520
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,740
Let me explain.

521
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,070
I'm telling the truth.

522
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,850
You'll believe me after hearing me out.

523
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,260
She will tell you at the cafe.

524
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,290
Let me explain.

525
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,410
I don't know those people at all.

526
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,130
An agent reached me.

527
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,980
They paid me cash

528
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,560
to play the daughter of the owner of a steel mill.

529
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,020
I didn't know what that was for.

530
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,510
Why didn't I agree?

531
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,940
Then we went to the steel factory together.

532
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,500
Everything went well.

533
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,830
I don't know what's going on.

534
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,860
What do you want me to do now?

535
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,660
To be honest,

536
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,330
I just went to the factory with you.

537
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,550
I only took the money for acting my part.

538
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,260
What do you want?

539
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,390
What is she talking about?

540
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,220
She said

541
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,100
she got this job

542
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,890
from someone else.

543
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,340
A Chinese

544
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,380
hired her

545
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,820
to play the daughter of the owner of a steel mill.

546
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,060
That Chinese gave her cash.

547
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,900
That's all she said.

548
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,390
Stop talking nonsense.

549
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,140
Where is my money?

550
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,580
You cheated us out of so much money.

551
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,100
Don't act like you don't know.

552
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,710
She doesn't believe me.

553
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,710
If you don't tell the truth,

554
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,860
I'll send you to the police station.

555
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,920
You'll be in jail.

556
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,480
She's going to call the police.

557
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,720
It's useless.

558
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,800
I didn't take the money.

559
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,890
You have no evidence.

560
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,760
She said it's useless to send her to the police station.

561
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,780
You have no evidence.

562
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,790
I won't spare her either.

563
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,310
-She won’t let you go. -I’ll send you to jail.

564
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,900
I have a plan.

565
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,920
I have an uncle in Black Sea.

566
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,380
I know you're here to buy steel.

567
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,600
You need a lot of steel.

568
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,470
My uncle has steel.

569
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,050
You can buy as much as you want.

570
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:10,920
Really?

571
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,030
Of course.

572
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,260
She said she had a plan.

573
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,450
She knew you came here to buy steel.

574
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,760
She has an uncle who has steel scrap

575
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,340
in Black Sea.

576
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,010
You can go there tonight if you want.

577
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,610
And he has

578
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,360
as much as you want.

579
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,890
She's just an actress.

580
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,470
How can I believe her?

581
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,260
She also said there's some on the moon.

582
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,670
How can I believe her?

583
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,060
She doesn't believe you because you lied to her.

584
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,350
How can you prove that?

585
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,570
You lied to her.

586
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,350
You don't have to pay the deposit.

587
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,180
Let's go to Black Sea together.

588
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,470
After you check the goods,

589
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,900
when the goods are loaded...

590
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,440
She said you don't have to pay the deposit.

591
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,010
You can pay

592
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,930
after you see the goods on your ship.

593
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,380
And if you are not satisfied,

594
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,120
you can go straightaway.

595
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,420
Boss.

596
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,700
Don't go, Boss!

597
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,300
Boss! Boss!

598
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,950
Why are you avoiding us?

599
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,250
Right.

600
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:35,930
Come in.

601
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,860
Why are you avoiding us?

602
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,250
Mind your manners.

603
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,840
You all have phones.

604
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,640
Why didn't you make an appointment first?

605
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,540
Well...

606
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,640
You came here out of the blue.

607
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,030
Are you here to borrow money from me?

608
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,630
No.

609
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,360
Didn't you forget the deposit

610
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,310
for the import of steel scrap?

611
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,570
Of course not.

612
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:57,940
Qiu,

613
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,710
we've been friends for so many years.

614
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,020
Have I ever owed you money?

615
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,860
I said I would take care of it,

616
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,890
then I'll take care of it.

617
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,930
But it's harder for me than you now.

618
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,790
Boss,

619
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,060
my wife

620
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,710
doesn't believe

621
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,480
I was scammed in the North.

622
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,890
She insisted on saying I have a mistress outside.

623
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,860
Now she's going to divorce me.

624
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,300
You deserve it.

625
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,220
You can't even live your life well.

626
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,100
What else can you do?

627
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,250
Why do you keep picking on me?

628
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,940
Hello.

629
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,010
Babe.

630
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,940
I'll call you later.

631
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,700
I'm coming out.

632
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,800
-I'll talk to you outside, babe. -See?

633
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,930
He'll be doomed sooner or later.

634
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,510
Forget about him.

635
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:37,840
Boss.

636
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,020
How about this?

637
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,390
As long as you can get us some steel,

638
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,750
let's overcome the difficulties first.

639
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,310
Do I look like steel?

640
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,180
You don't have money even if I have steel.

641
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,020
Did you get on the train?

642
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,450
No.

643
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,020
I need to go to Black Sea.

644
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,660
Are you crazy?

645
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,300
Listen to me.

646
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,080
Come back now!

647
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,120
No, I have to go there.

648

♫The song is like a bright spring♫

649

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,600
Chinese girl, sing a song.

657
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,980
Sing a song.

658
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,740
Sing a song.

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,570
Sing a song.

00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,320
Why are you here?

670
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,700
Come in.

671
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,240
Didn't I tell you?

672
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,240
Don't come here

673
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,220
if you have nothing serious.

674
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,920
You didn't answer my calls,

675
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,200
so I came to you.

676
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,900
Then find a hotel and wait for me there.

677
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,380
I'll be there soon.

678
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,540
Come here.

679
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,900
I bought you a pair of leather shoes

680
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,940
when I went shopped today. Try them on.

681
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,440
Why did you spend money for me?

682
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,570
Who else can I spend money for?

683
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,500
Your feet.

684
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,280
It's getting cold.

685
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,990
You go out everyday.

686
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,030
No one cares if your shoes are broken.

687
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,630
The salesperson said it's made of cowhide.

688
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,460
Come on, stand up.

689
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,280
Does it fit?

690
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,060
Are they comfortable?

691
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,970
Yes.

692
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,920
Your body can only get warm when your feet are warm.

693
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,190
If you don't take care of yourself,

694
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,540
who will take care of you?

695
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,430
Here, take it.

696
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,030
What are you doing?

697
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,230
Aren't you short of money lately?

698
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,060
I sold the golden necklace you gave me.

699
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,460
Plus what I have now,

700
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,510
here's 10,000 yuan.

701
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,070
Take it.

702
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,850
Babe, what are you doing?

703
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,180
I can't take your money.

704
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,700
Take it back.

705
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,570
What are you talking about?

706
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,960
Don't mention it.

707
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,820
I can't take it.

708
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,290
Take it back.

709
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,460
Take it when I tell you to.

710
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,600
Listen to me. Take the money back.

711
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,340
Take it.

712
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,670
Why are you so nice to me?

713
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,680
I don't know how to

714
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,290
live without you now.

715
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,860
Don't say that. Sit down.

716
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,340
You only need to take care of yourself.

717
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,930
Didn't I tell you

718
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,350
to dye your hair?

719
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,710
Look, you are growing out grey hair.

720
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,030
Babe, don't worry.

721
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,630
I'll figure it out for us.

722
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,410
How are you doing at home?

723
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,310
She discussed it with me.

724
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,720
She knows about us?

725
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,350
Did she give you a hard time?

726
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,730
After the scam,

727
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,610
she only wanted to get rid of me.

728
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,720
We barely talk

729
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,810
nowadays.

730
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,830
If I really have no money one day,

731
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,290
will you abandon me?

732
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,450
You don't have money now.

733
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:53,950
You can count on me.

734
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:55,770
I have to go.

735
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,920
Hello, Uncle.

736
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,600
How have you been?

737
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,590
I'm fine. What about you?

738
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,630
You've grown up a lot.

739
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,140
These two girls

740
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,450
are my Chinese friends.

741
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,880
Let me introduce them to you.

742
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,650
Xu Banxia and Yan.

743
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,520
Welcome to Black Sea.

744
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,940
Welcome to Black Sea.

745
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,219
Yan, tell him

746
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,260
we can sign the contract first,

747
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,389
but I can only pay

748
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,690
after the goods are loaded.

749
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,100
We can sign the contract first,

750
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,670
but we will only pay

751
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,960
after the goods are loaded.

752
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:32,940
Please remember,

753
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,409
if you don't pay...

754
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,830
But he has to remind you

755
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,550
if you don't pay in the end,

756
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,300
you won't get the customs pass

757
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,239
and you can't take the goods away.

758
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,179
What's the price?

759
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,400
What's the price?

760
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,790
45 dollars a ton.

761
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,980
45 dollars a ton.

762
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,860
Forty.

763
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,060
Forty.

764
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,860
No.

765
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,750
No.

766
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,480
I'm from China.

767
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,760
We need a great amount of steel.

768
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,580
China has a high demand for steel.

769
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,740
If everything goes well,

770
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,770
I'll come again next month.

771
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,590
We'll come again later.

772
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,270
I hope we can both show the greatest sincerity

773
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,790
in our first collaboration.

774
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,940
If we succeed this time,

775
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,620
I'll pay him at 45 dollars next time.

776
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,320
I promise I'll pay you at 45 next time.

777
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,600
Chinese women are smart.

778
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,690
Chinese women are great.

779
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,630
Well, 42 dollars.

780
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:48,780
Deal.

781
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
-Deal. -Deal.

782
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,210
Can I check the goods?

783
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,340
Can we check the goods?

784
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,990
Contact the freight first.

785
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,610
You have to contact the freight first.

786
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,400
Tell him the time.

787
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,700
He will deliver the goods then.

788
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,520
No way.

789
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,540
I need to check the quality of the steel first.

790
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,740
How can we make a deal without checking the steel first?

791
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,070
We represent the military.

792
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,020
He said he's on behalf of the military.

793
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,520
It's not as simple as you think.

794
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,580
But he promised you it's something with high quality.

795
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,030
Leave if you don't believe me.

796
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
You can leave if you don't believe him.

797
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,770
Then I need to sign the contract first,

798
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,440
without paying the deposit at the moment, okay?

799
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,850
Let's sign the contract first

800
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,500
and pay later.

801
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:42,750
Sure.

802
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,080
Sure.

803
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,560
Great.

804
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,670
Great!

805
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,710
Next time, I'll continue to be the host.

806
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,520
Qin, send him off for me.

807
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,130
Okay, Mr. Zhao.

808
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,910
Okay, bye.

809
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,460
Bye. Bye.

810
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,830
What took you so long?

811
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,310
I just arrived at Black Sea.

812
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,740
What's the rush?

813
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,420
Right.

814
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,990
Why should I get worried

815
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,400
since you're not?

816
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,710
I just met them.

817
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,830
I've talked to them.

818
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,440
42 dollars a ton.

819
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,620
I plan to take back 50,000 tons.

820
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,930
Please give me 24.5 million.

821
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,620
But I made a deal with them

822
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,110
that I only pay when the goods are loaded.

823
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,530
Listen.

824
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,140
I won't trust them

825
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,000
because of what you said.

826
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,460
Of course,

827
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,520
you must feel upset hearing what I said.

828
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,570
But that's the truth.

829
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,820
I'm not a gambler.

830
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,730
I believe you are not either.

831
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,490
Can we stop joking?

832
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,060
Well,

833
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,590
how is the quality of the steel?

834
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,490
I haven't seen the steel yet,

835
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,480
but I have a feeling that it must be good.

836
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,530
Are you crazy?

837
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,480
You asked me for money

838
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,430
without seeing anything?

839
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,840
Mr. Zhao, please trust me.

840
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,000
I don't believe it.

841
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,210
[General Manager Zhao Lei]

842
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:10,970
Mr. Zhao.

843
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,710
The more I get back,

844
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,020
the more you can earn, right?

845
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,980
I need a start.

846
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,600
You need a stable channel.

847
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,260
We can take what we need.

848
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,730
I borrowed money for building the storage yard.

849
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,750
My house and car

850
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,860
have been collateralised.

851
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,650
If I can't go to buy the steel scrap,

852
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,320
I'll be doomed.

853
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,200
Please help me.

854
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,300
Everyone starts from nothing, right?

855
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,680
If you're willing to collaborate with me,

856
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,230
I'll do my best to help you.

857
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,570
Qin Fangping.

858
00:39:59,230 --> 00:39:59,980
Qin Fangping.

859
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,830
Mr. Zhao.

860
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:02,950
Come here.

861
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,230
Tell the finance department

862
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,430
to prepare 24.5 million.

863
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,360
What's the purpose?

864
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,160
To buy steel.

865
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,580
Have we signed such a big contract

866
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,640
with any company?

867
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:15,300
No contract.

868
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,230
But Mr. Zhao,

869
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,780
if there is no contract,

870
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,410
it'll be hard for the finance department to approve it.

871
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:21,620
Just tell them I told them to.

872
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,400
They must transfer the money to Xu Banxia tomorrow morning.

873
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,590
I have the right.

874
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,780
Sorry for what I'm going to say,

875
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,170
but isn't it too risky

876
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,020
to pay without a contract?

877
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,370
I guarantee it.

878
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,010
I'll take the responsibility.

879
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,990
Okay, got it.

880
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,010
I'll do it now.

881
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,150
Hello?

882
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,300
Don't talk.

883
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,280
Let me finish.

884
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,820
And don't interrupt me.

885
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,670
I'm afraid I'll forget what to say.

886
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,770
From the moment

887
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,390
I decided to stay in the North alone,

888
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,780
I swore I wouldn't return empty-handed.

889
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,730
Never ever.

890
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,930
I'm already building my storage yard.

891
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,920
It costs a lot in every moment.

892
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,320
You know I've borrowed a lot of money.

893
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,450
I can't even afford the interest.

894
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,370
I've also collateralised my house.

895
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,020
If I went back like this,

896
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,870
we would

897
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,550
fail completely.

898
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,070
I have no choice.

899
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,710
I know you're under the same pressure as me,

900
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,500
but please trust me.

901
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,120
It's a good chance

902
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,080
to make a lot of money now.

903
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,430
If... I mean if...

904
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,560
If I was doomed,

905
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,440
and put you in trouble,

906
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,840
I would do everything

907
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,100
to make it up to you.

908
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,500
I've never been

909
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,090
so determined in my life

910
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,090
that we will definitely win.

911
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,880
Our world

912
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,440
will be different soon.

913
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,190
Mr. Zhao, please trust me

914
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,710
and support me.

915
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,720
What you said has nothing to do with me.

916
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,700
I can afford the current loss.

917
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,050
You don't have to

918
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,110
say these things to me.

919
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,040
Xu Banxia, let me tell you.

920
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,380
I don't trust anyone,

921
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,680
especially you.

922
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,190
You already messed up once.

923
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:49,770
If you mess it up again,

924
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,330
you really don't have to come back.
