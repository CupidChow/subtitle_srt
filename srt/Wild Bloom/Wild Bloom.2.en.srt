No, I got a job to do.

145

Are you afraid to go?

146

172
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,270
private enterprise.

173
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,540
He is the chairman,

174
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,800
the president, the vice president,

175
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,510
the treasurer, the clerk,

176
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,030
and the cleaner. What about you?

177
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,790
There are only two people in your company.

178
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,220
We have one more person.

179
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,340
I'm the driver, the deputy general manager,

180
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,500
and the porter.

181
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,620
What's your name?

182
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,590
What do you want?

183
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,420
Let's get to know each other a little.

184
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,790
Wildcat.

185
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,510
That's what people call me.

186
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,030
You can call me that, too.

187
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,030
Wildcat?

188
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,680
You have a very special name.

189
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,360
So you're the secretary,

190
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,159
the driver,

191
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,830
or the deputy general manager?

192
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,130
I don't have a job.

193
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,990
I'm here for a meal.

194
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,420
We're kind of the same.

195
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,540
Again,

196
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,290
let alone 50,000 tons of steel,

197
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,590
no matter how many tons,

198
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,270
I can buy them all.

199
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,540
But I just have one question.

200
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,700
Is it true?

201
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,770
Don't worry.

202
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,860
I've been in Binhai

203
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,970
for so many years.

204
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,790
I won't embarrass myself

205
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,990
by saying big things.

206
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,750
Mr. Wu, that's not what I meant.

207
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,970
Since you said so,

208
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,950
I trust you.

209
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,550
Here.

210
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,150
-Okay, okay, okay. -Here's to you.

211
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,310
Here, here, here.

212
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,630
Here.

213
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,870
Thank you.

214
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,910
Let's propose a toast

215
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,630
to Mr. Zhao.

216
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,150
Yes.

217
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,750
No, no, no.

218
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,710
It's our pleasure.

219
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,750
It's a must.

220
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,630
Let's have a toast to Mr. Zhao.

221
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,540
Here, here, here.

222
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,550
Business is not easy for everyone.

223
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,910
Let's have a drink together.

224
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:22,810
Xu.

225
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,790
Mr. Zhao is making a toast.

226
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,050
Miss Xu's glass was empty.

227
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,230
I'll fill it for her.

228
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,230
Yes, yes. My glass was empty.

229
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,790
Miss Xu, I heard

230
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,910
one has to be able to drink

231
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,590
while doing business up north.

232
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,320
They drink wine as if it were water.

233
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,280
If you can't go alone,

234
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,809
I can do it for you.

235
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,280
How can that work?

236
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,190
I have to go there.

237
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,350
I'll drink it with this.

238
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,490
-No, no. It's too big. -Mr. Zhao.

239
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,690
Mr. Zhao, it's our first meeting.

240
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,030
A small token of good faith.

241
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,030
Mr. Wu, we had a deal. We're in business together.

242
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,390
Xu... Xu.

243
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,750
Here, here, here.

244
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,410
Let's drink it up. Let's finish this one.

245
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,550
How long have you been doing this?

246
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,030
Today is the first day.

247
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,390
First day?

248
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,450
What did you do before?

249
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,350
I just came down from the mountain.

250
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,480
Prison?

251
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,270
You know that?

252
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,830
It's not a big deal.

253
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,990
You were wronged, too?

254
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,280
You're so funny.

255
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,270
There are people in prison who have been wronged?

256
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,020
Are you a bad person?

257
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,150
What do you think?

258
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,470
Yes.

259
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,900
You're too young to know anything.

260
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:41,900
Let's go back.

261
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,680
I don't know what's going on in there.

262
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,330
Hey, bad guy, slow down.

263
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:19,870
Boss.

264
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:21,820
Boss.

265
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,390
Wake up.

266
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,670
Who are you?

267
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,350
Tong Xiaoqi.

268
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,990
Give me your room card.

269
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,640
You...

270
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,750
Where have you been?

271
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,510
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

272
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,670
You... You bastard.

273
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,530
Don't move. Don't move.

274
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,100
Do you know how many drinks

275
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,250
I had with them?

276
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,030
I was wrong.

277
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,790
Hurry up. Hurry up.

278
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,870
I drank two bottles of white wine with them.

279
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,710
Just get in there.

280
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,940
You're trying to kill me, aren't you?

281
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,350
Tong Xiaoqi.

282
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,470
-You're trying to kill me. -I was wrong.

283
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,150
Didn't I go to talk to someone?

284
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,130
Didn't you tell me to meet people?

285
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,310
I even gave out business cards.

286
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,430
You... Liar.

287
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,510
-Liar. -Be careful.

288
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,310
I'll get you some water.

289
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,360
I'm not thirsty.

290
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,790
My phone is ringing.

291
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,630
Don't move.

292
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,360
-Don't move. Don't move. -My phone.

293
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,350
I'll get it for you.

294
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,110
It's burning.

295
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,070
Tong Xiaoqi, you're gonna burn me to death.

296
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,080
Tong Xiaoqi.

297
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,510
I told you not to move.

298
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,440
You... You're gonna burn me to death.

299
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,740
Phone. Phone.

300
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,150
Phone.

301
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,430
Here, your phone.

302
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,040
Who is it?

303
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,380
Speak. Who is it?

304
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,810
Is this Xu Banxia?

305
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,190
Mr. Zhao, right?

306
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,980
Yes, it's me.

307
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,010
I'm Xu.

308
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,030
Mr. Zhao.

309
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,390
Are you okay?

310
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,760
I'm fine.

311
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,750
This wine

312
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,630
is a piece of cake for me.

313
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,710
Thank you for calling and asking about me.

314
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,250
I'm really sorry.

315
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,430
I'm calling

316
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,540
to confirm with you

317
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,700
about buying steel in the north.

318
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,940
Is this true?

319
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,280
Yes.

320
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,750
Yes.

321
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,790
Mr. Wu has got it all set up.

322
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,990
He always keeps his word.

323
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,910
I've known Mr. Wu for years.

324
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,990
Otherwise, I wouldn't have asked him

325
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,710
15,000 tons of steel.

326
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,990
Wasn't that

327
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,150
putting myself in there, too?

328
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,120
Trust me.

329
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,390
I can assure you.

330
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,720
You?

331
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,930
I can assure you of my character.

332
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,330
If you didn't trust me,

333
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,170
you wouldn't have called me.

334
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,830
Right?

335
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,910
I'm calling because you're drunk.

336
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,350
You're more honest

337
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,150
than them.

338
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,060
All right. I'm glad you're fine.

339
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,270
Honest?

340
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,580
He said I'm honest?

341
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,080
Am I?

342
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,310
Have some water.

343
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,150
Tong Xiaoqi.

344
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,390
Thank you.

345
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,830
I got nothing all night,

346
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,910
but honesty.

347
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,160
Can you stop pulling such a long face?

348
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,950
I didn't owe you money.

349
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,910
We're in business now.

350
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,600
Business, understand?

351
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,230
We have to smile.

352
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,380
If you're like this, no one will like to talk to you.

353
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,960
Why did you throw it away?

354
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,090
What?

355
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,390
Oh. I threw it away. What's wrong?

356
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,740
Why didn't you come to see me?

357
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,990
I've been in there for five years,

358
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,400
and you haven't visited me once.

359
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,510
Every time Chen came to see me,

360
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,850
he said you were busy.

361
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,960
Is this true?

362
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,720
Yes.

363
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,510
I'm busy.

364
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,930
I know.

365
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,760
You're blaming me.

366
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,590
So you didn't come to see me.

367
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,100
Right?

368
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,160
Did you divorce that bastard?

369
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,080
You kicked his ass.

370
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,850
Can I not get divorced?

371
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,150
You just want to know

372
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,790
why I didn't visit you, right?

373
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,070
To be honest,

374
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,490
I don't know how to face you.

375
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,670
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

376
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,060
You've been in there for five years,

377
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,980
and I can't get you out for 50,000 yuan

378
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,760
or a million.

379
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,990
You're not a puppy or a cat.

380
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,150
I can't lie to you.

381
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,310
So what's the point of me

382
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:09,910
telling you this?

383
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
You wouldn't understand.

384
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
But I always thank you in my heart.

385
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,470
If it hadn't been for that kick,

386
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,470
I'd be stuck in the mud

387
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,950
all day

388
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,550
and I'd never get out.

389
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,260
I've never blamed you for anything.

390
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,070
Since then,

391
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,980
I've been busy doing business with Chen.

392
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,070
The junkyard was closed.

393
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,040
And we sold scrap steel instead.

394
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,770
No matter how big or small the company was,

395
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,750
there're always three shareholders,

396
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,160
Chen,

397
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:08,880
you,

398
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,630
and I.

399
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,829
Chen always told me

400
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,710
about you.

401
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,950
Got fat?

402
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,510
Lost weight?

403
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:26,770
Got tanned?

404
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Or the pecs were out of whack?

405
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,580
Chen's talking rubbish.

406
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,790
Who did you give your number to?

407
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,150
Hello.

408
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,110
Who is it?

409
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,440
Mr. Tong.

410
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,060
You're not being honest.

411
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,320
You didn't even say goodbye when you left.

412
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,310
You know what?

413
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,830
I've been looking for you by the lake.

414
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,580
I had something to do, so I left.

415
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,420
What's wrong?

416
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,190
Your master was in a hurry to get back.

417
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,680
So you went back

418
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,670
with your tail between your legs?

419
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,190
What are you talking about?

420
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,750
The wildcat has a tail.

421
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,710
I have no tail.

422
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,250
You're the one who have your tail between your legs.

423
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,550
Calm down.

424
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,270
What do you want? Say it.

425
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,310
The phone bill is quite expensive.

426
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,380
Nothing.

427
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,640
I just want to ask you,

428
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,490
can I play with you when I'm bored?

429
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,040
Whatever you want.

430
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:30,830
Fine.

431
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,710
It's okay. I got to go.

432
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,100
Bye.

433
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,100
Who called you?

434
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,760
Someone who was drinking

435
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,510
at the same table that day.

436
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,130
A woman, right?

437
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,670
No, no. Boss.

438
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,830
You just got out and you're hitting on girls?

439
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,990
You're very busy.

440
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,590
Stand there.

441
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,530
-No, she kept talking to me. -Stand there.

442
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,950
I can't help it.

443
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,550
Who!

444
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

445
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,190
You just left me there.

446
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,820
Do you know how drunk I was?

447
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,550
And you were flirting with a girl?

448
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,350
I was wrong. I... I'm sorry.

449
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,430
I drank myself into a stupor.

450
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,150
No, no, no. Boss.

451
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,830
I was very upset.

452
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,270
I didn't even know how I got back.

453
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,630
Chen Yuzhou!

454
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,860
Tong Xiaoqi!

455
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,230
What are you yelling about?

456
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,050
Why didn't you pick me up?

457
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,930
How am I supposed to pick you up when I'm running a business?

458
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,490
Business is more important than me?

459
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,510
Isn't it?

460
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,600
You're getting strong.

461
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,540
Go. Let me show you around.

462
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:46,990
Go, go, go.

463
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,510
The new company.

464
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,950
See? These.

465
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,570
It's all scrap steel back there.

466
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,870
There's no room

467
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,820
for that old yard.

468
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,670
Not bad.

469
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,710
We're running out of space here.

470
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,150
We're gonna have to move to a bigger place.

471
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,130
How's it going?

472
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,750
You must have seen a lot of things at the Luzhou Fair.

473
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,490
Don't mention it.

474
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,350
Nine out of ten of those guys were insincere.

475
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,270
The food tasted like garbage. It's all a lie.

476
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,230
Listen.

477
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,400
That's all you're gonna meet.

478
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:07,910
Here.

479
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:08,460
Here.

480
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,200
[Banxia Steel Company]

481
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,780
Banxia Steel Company.

482
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,680
How is it going?

483
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,500
You started a company.

484
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,540
You have a share, too.

485
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,900
Here. Look.

486
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,590
This is our dorm.

487
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,390
Fatty bought you

488
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,750
a new sheet, a new cover and a new pillow.

489
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,070
I use all the old ones.

490
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,870
What are you doing? It smells so good.

491
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,190
I've been cooking all afternoon.

492
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,990
Let's have dinner.

493
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,670
Go, go, go.

494
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,110
Come and carry the luggage.

495
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,630
Oh, I forgot. I forgot.

496
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,910
Here I come.

497
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,080
Hurry up. You.

498
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,150
Fatty.

499
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,040
Our company collects scrap steel.

500
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,470
Why go so far abroad

501
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,220
when we can

502
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,980
do business at home?

503
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,780
I've already done the math.

504
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,510
The scrap steel in the north

505
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,430
is 350 yuan a ton,

506
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,870
plus the shipping costs and tax fees,

507
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,230
the cost of a ton is about 700 yuan.

508
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,160
If the domestic market is good,

509
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,750
we can sell for nearly 1,400 yuan a ton.

510
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,030
1,400?

511
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,140
Think about it.

512
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,550
How much can we earn?

513
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,030
I want 15,000 tons.

514
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,990
Or,

515
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm gonna ask Wu Jianshe for 10,000 tons.

516
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,110
Where are we going to find

517
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,190
the scrap steel that can turn the cost price of 350 yuan a ton

518
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,070
to 1,400 yuan a ton in a short time?

519
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,110
That's not scrap steel.

520
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,310
That's gold.

521
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,730
How much is that?

522
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,150
10.5 million yuan.

523
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,860
No, Fatty.

524
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,790
We can't work it out at 350 yuan a ton.

525
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,350
We have to work it out by the ton.

526
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,710
Plus shipping and taxes,

527
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,990
it's 700 yuan a ton

528
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,110
according to your algorithm.

529
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,560
Do you know how much money we need?

530
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,580
-More than 10 million yuan. -We can talk about the freight later.

531
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,070
I can pay Wu Jianshe when I get back.

532
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,420
But the money for the steel,

533
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,550
we need to prepare in advance.

534
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,180
Okay.

535
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,190
Let's do it at the price we paid for it.

536
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,260
Now the company

537
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,430
only has about a million.

538
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,570
You want to buy 15,000 tons of steel.

539
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,030
Then we need 5.25 million.

540
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,430
We're over four million short.

541
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,110
Where are we going to find the money?

542
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,110
Chen.

543
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,670
We've been collecting scrap steel for years.

544
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,070
We've made some money.

545
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,540
If we get this deal right,

546
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,950
we'll be good.

547
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,230
Qiu Bizheng and Feng Yu scramble to get there.

548
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,810
They're not willing to give me a quota yet.

549
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,230
Calm down.

550
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,390
Anyway, that scrap yard is not enough.

551
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,300
We have to get a storage yard.

552
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,350
Wouldn't it be a waste of money

553
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,300
if the yard was done

554
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,830
and there was no cargo?

555
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,790
When I get back,

556
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,270
the 15,000 tons will be there.

557
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,670
The yard will be used

558
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,390
and our business will be expanded.

559
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,790
You said a dock could be built next to that yard.

560
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,350
Once the dock is built,

561
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,670
we'll never have to sell scrap steel again.

562
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,420
Yes.

563
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,790
I know what you're saying.

564
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,920
But we can't bite off more than we can chew.

565
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,710
I mean, we don't have

566
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,780
that kind of money right now.

567
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,790
We can't afford it.

568
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,230
We can borrow money.

569
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,510
Where are we going to borrow money?

570
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,590
Four million.

571
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,390
Miss.

572
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,750
Now you do the math.

573
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,120
How much would it be

574
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,860
if we sold everything we had?

575
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,950
I can borrow some money from my dad later.

576
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,270
Take care of Qiu Bizheng

577
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,740
with Tong.

578
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,110
When this is done,

579
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,750
I can get some money.

580
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,950
And Feng Yu.

581
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,870
I should be able to borrow some money from him.

582
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,230
The bank.

583
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,390
Do you know anyone at the bank?

584
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,990
No bank

585
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,440
would lend money to rag-pickers.

586
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,900
No, then.

587
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,490
Shut up.

588
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,070
Anyway, just two things.

589
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,760
First,

590
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,870
handle the mudflat

591
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,310
and get it as soon as possible.

592
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,350
Second,

593
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,390
you and Tong need to

594
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,270
find more people

595
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,910
and register more companies.

596
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,510
I need more quotas.

597
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,430
I'll figure out

598
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,800
the rest.

599
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,670
You have a stake in the company.

600
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,710
Take a stand.

601
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,470
Tell me.

602
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
We borrow all this money, four million yuan,

603
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,470
to go north and buy scrap steel.

604
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,120
Is it worth it?

605
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,440
How to do it?

606
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,480
I didn't ask you how to do it.

607
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,990
I was asking if we can do it.

608
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,980
I don't know.

609
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,670
I only asked how to do it.

610
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,630
Here.

611
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,030
Welcome me home.

612
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,310
When she left,

613
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,830
she was very peaceful.

614
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,270
She didn't suffer.

615
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,670
She just told us

616
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,120
she missed you.

617
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,590
Fatty and I

618
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,560
picked this place out.

619
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,300
This place is good.

620
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,030
No matter how busy Fatty and I are,

621
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,350
we must come here

622
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,440
once a month.

623
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:36,910
Auntie,

624
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,110
Tong is back.

625
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:39,950
Don't worry.

626
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,460
We will be fine in the future.

627
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,330
If you want to cry, cry.

628
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,590
You stole money, right?

629
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,910
You learned to steal money?

630
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,930
You're trying to piss me off?

631
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,750
[1991]

632
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,710
Mom,

633
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,010
I didn't steal the money.

634
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,930
I earned it.

635
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:18,890
Mom,

636
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,990
I have two good friends.

637
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,500
They are very nice to me.

638
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,340
They take care of me

639
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,630
and teach me how to earn money.

640
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,100
One of them is like my brother

641
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,420
and the other is like my sister.

642
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,330
I know.

643
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,030
No matter what happens to me in the future,

644
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,640
they're not gonna leave me alone.

645
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,180
They are my family.

646
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,900
Don't worry, mom.

647
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,280
Mom.

648
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,710
I'm here to see you.

649
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,870
In my next life,

650
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,040
I'll be a dog for you.

651
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,720
I'll wag my tail when I see you.

652
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,420
I won't piss you off anymore.

653
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,570
What are you doing?

654
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,030
What are you doing?

655
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,190
Thank you

656
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:52,940
for doing this for me.

657
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:13,800
All right.

658
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,290
This is as far as our car will go.

659
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,820
Just walk inside.

660
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,750
Can you?

661
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,620
What kind of road are you looking for here?

662
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,510
Right.

663
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,490
What is this place?

664
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,030
Don't we have to build roads the same way we build yards?

665
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,390
That's not the point.

666
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,350
Right ahead. Two steps away.

667
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,750
What's the key?

668
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,670
The key is the size of the beach,

669
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,470
the price of the lease

670
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,790
and the depth of the water. Do you know?

671
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,690
Be careful.

672
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,320
Listen, if it's not appropriate...

673
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,870
Boss, do you want to

674
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,510
throw him in the ocean if it doesn't fit?

675
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,950
I'm gonna pick the deepest part of the sea.

676
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,030
Listen.

677
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,870
If you throw me into the sea, I'll drag you down.

678
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,750
See?

679
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,520
The area of the beach is large enough.

680
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,500
If we build it here,

681
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,590
we'll have no problem piling up tens of thousands of tons of steel.

682
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,590
It's 100 times bigger

683
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,470
than our junk yard.

684
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,750
Isn't this too big?

685
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,470
You know nothing.

686
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,190
Let me tell you.

687
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,630
The larger the area, the greater the room for development.

688
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,550
Got it?

689
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,670
Do you see the depth?

690
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,310
I've asked about

691
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,030
this body of water.

692
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,260
The water is definitely deep enough.

693
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,670
Like Fatty says,

694
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,590
we're gonna build a dock right here

695
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,390
when we make money in the future.

696
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,710
The 10,000-ton ship

697
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,360
can pull directly into the dock.

698
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,310
And we go straight

699
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,750
to the yard.

700
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,790
Then the van skills

701
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,960
you learned in there

702
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,490
will be useless.

703
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,030
You're talking on paper

704
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,840
and blowing your own trumpet.

705
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,000
A 10,000-ton ship?

706
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,880
You need a 10,000-ton freight?

707
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,130
How many tons of goods do you have?

708
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,510
Pull the sand away?

709
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,510
You're so shortsighted.

710
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,870
Boss, I think.

711
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,530
We need a big parking lot.

712
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,670
I'll get dozens of big trucks

713
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,760
and put them there.

714
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,590
Very imposing.

715
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,790
Here,

716
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,670
we need a three-story house.

717
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,360
We need a receptionist on the first floor

718
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,070
to meet clients.

719
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,060
And the kitchen and the dining room.

720
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,890
And the second floor

721
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,750
is the office, only office function.

722
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,950
Well... What about the third floor?

723
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,090
I haven't decided yet.

724
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,270
But we need to

725
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,360
get some bedrooms.

726
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,310
If we get tired of working, we can go straight to sleep.

727
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,370
Maybe you should

728
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,870
get a game room, too.

729
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,990
I think we need a pool hall, too.

730
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,880
Did you ask the price?

731
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,540
Yes.

732
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,670
I asked a lot of people.

733
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,750
200,000 a year.

734
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,960
at most.

735
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,070
But,

736
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,390
I haven't spoken to the village chief yet.

737
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,550
Where are you going?

738
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,490
Borrow money.

739
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,430
Hello.

740
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,700
Is this Mr. Qiu?

741
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm Xu Banxia's cousin.

742
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,900
We've met before.

743
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,030
Miss Xu asked me to get the books.

744
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,430
Right, your books,

745
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:54,770
for the last two years.

746
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm diagonally across the street

747
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,450
from your factory,

748
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,510
in a white Jetta.

749
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,390
Okay.

750
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,830
Dong.

751
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,380
There you are.

752
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:18,910
What?

753
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,310
What are you doing at noon?

754
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,310
I have no plans.

755
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,670
What have you got?

756
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,470
How about this?

757
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,020
You go to the usual place

758
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,380
and get some good food.

759
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,480
Let's have some wine at noon.

760
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,400
I'll let someone else do it.

761
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,450
Look at you.

762
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,230
I'm busy.

763
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,010
You have to buy it yourself.

764
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,430
You know what I like to eat.

765
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,280
The same three things.

766
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,350
Fine.

767
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,620
You take this.

768
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,120
Look.

769
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,960
You should take it.

770
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:25,410
[Feng Jia Cun]

771
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,660
When will you give me an answer?

772
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,610
We'll get back to you as soon as possible.

773
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,010
Keep an eye on him.

774
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,210
See what he's doing while I'm not here.

775
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,350
I'm not going back to the factory this afternoon.

776
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,280
Okay.

777
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,830
Thank you.

778
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,430
Hello, Fatty.

779
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,660
We got the books.

780
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,890
If you and Tong

781
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,190
have time today,

782
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,390
go back to the village.

783
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,270
Okay. Then I'll wait to hear from you.

784
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
Okay, I see.

785
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:03,990
Well,

786
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,820
stakeouts and stalking.

787
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,010
Aren't they the boss's friends?

788
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,670
Are you stupid?

789
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,260
There're no friends in business.

790
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,710
But,

791
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,380
how can we do business without friends?

792
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,510
Chen Yuzhou.

793
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,920
You got bad.

794
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,750
Things are different now.

795
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,570
The idea that

796
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,680
it's either good or bad

797
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,110
is not simple. It's stupid.

798
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,500
Take your time.

799
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,270
Bro.

800
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,280
Don't worry.

801
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,850
As long as Fatty and I are here,

802
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,220
you won't be hurt.

803
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:39,990
Get out. Get out.

804
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,820
Fatty went home to borrow money today.

805
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,430
I don't know if it goes well.

806
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,890
I reckon it's a long shot.

807
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,910
What?

808
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,760
Her family doesn't treat her well?

809
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,740
Do you know

810
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,340
why Fatty is called Banxia?

811
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,370
Why?

812
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,520
Banxia, namely pinellia, is a kind of medicine.

813
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,310
I know. Pinellia oral liquid.

814
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,130
Pinellia oral liquid is made from cooked pinellia.

815
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,560
Raw pinellia

816
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,950
is poisonous.

817
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,650
Fatty's mother died giving birth to her.

818
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,440
Her father hated her.

819
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,230
So he named her Banxia.

820
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,700
Raw pinellia

821
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,370
is poisonous.

822
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,840
Is her father a man?

823
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,560
It's hard to say.

824
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,450
Seriously? Why are you so far away?

825
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,220
You're right.

826
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:01,590
She

827
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,230
left home when she was very young.

828
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,670
Her father

829
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,240
later married another woman.

830
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,449
Her stepmother gave birth to a sister.

831
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,139
So Fatty

832
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,380
got married

833
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,820
right out of college.

834
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,670
♫The cabbage♫

835
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,440
♫Has turned yellow in the ground♫

836
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,389
♫She's only a couple of years old♫

837
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,659
♫And her mother was gone♫

838
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,239
-Kuan is coming. -You did a good job in the first part.

839
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,889
But the back...

840
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,659
What's the date today?

841
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,030
In the teens.

842
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,570
Why is she here again?

843
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,810
I don't know.

844
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,239
It's not the end of the month yet.

845
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,230
What are you doing here?

846
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,679
Can't I visit you before the end of the month?

847
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
I miss you, okay?

848
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,650
Come inside and get some water.

849
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,190
Yes. Here, here.

850
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,030
Here.

851
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,600
♫The cabbage♫

852
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,540
What's the matter? Tell me.

853
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,070
Didn't I give you extra money

854
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,470
last month?

855
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,540
I asked you to dye your hair.

856
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,590
Why didn't you dye your hair?

857
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,670
Dye it once can last six months to a year.

858
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,340
I'm almost 60.

859
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,560
Why do I dye my hair?

860
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,710
No need.

861
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,630
Your sister Qian is young.

862
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,890
It's gonna take a lot of money.

863
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,070
Yes, she's a kid.

864
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,350
All she does is spend money.

865
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,920
Here, have some water.

866
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,680
What are you doing here?

867
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,270
Kuan is here.

868
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,250
Add two dishes.

869
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,630
I'm talking about you.

870
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,080
I'll talk to her.

871
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,670
Do you remember what I told you the last two months?

872
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,530
What is it?

873
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,990
Your sister...

874
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,670
She's taking vocal music level 9.

875
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,870
The teacher

876
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,470
carried the accordion on her back every day to teach her.

877
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,230
She kept complaining to us

878
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,230
that the accordion is not good.

879
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,470
We must use the piano.

880
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,070
But we don't have a piano at home.

881
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,560
Yes.

882
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,070
The teacher has a piano,

883
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,430
but it's too far away.

884
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,750
Back and forth cost us a lot of time.

885
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,750
When we got back, it was already midnight.

886
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,390
And she has no time to do her homework.

887
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,670
We had to

888
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,390
go to the mall to check out the piano.

889
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,830
The price

890
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,100
is not too expensive.

891
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,950
More than 4,000 yuan.

892
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,430
Less than 5,000 yuan.

893
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,870
The piano is fine.

894
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,670
You can buy it whenever you want.

895
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,350
You agreed?

896
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,740
Thank you.

897
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,750
I came to talk to you

898
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,870
about something important.

899
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:19,550
Dad.

900
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,820
The domestic scrap steel business is not good.

901
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,180
I have a friend.

902
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,110
He has a way

903
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,280
to take me up north

904
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,480
and start a steel import business,

905
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,350
very profitable.

906
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,290
It pays off very fast.

907
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,900
But my principal is not enough.

908
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,630
I want to borrow some money from you.

909
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,350
If this deal goes through,

910
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,530
I can give you more

911
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,710
next time I come back.

912
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,120
I get it.

913
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,150
You came back here today

914
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,740
to get money from your family.

915
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:52,670
Dad.

916
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,900
I'm not asking for money.

917
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,140
I'm borrowing money.

918
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,640
You can count the interest.

919
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
The interest can be higher.

920
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,680
You can

921
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,540
talk about it.

922
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,740
I'll wait.

923
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,150
No need.

924
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,510
I have the final say.

925
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,640
How much do you want?

926
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,870
500,000.

927
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,510
What?

928
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,910
500,000?

929
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,310
Go to the street.

930
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,540
You can ask anyone who's seen 500,000 yuan.

931
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,300
Right.

932
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,750
How dare you say that.

933
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,130
Help me

934
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,270
through this,

935
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:31,770
okay?

936
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
We let you get by.

937
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,870
You got to let us get by.

938
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,190
We fight every day about a piano.

939
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,910
We can't even come up with 4,000 yuan.

940
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,950
I told you about the piano.

941
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,680
You can buy it anytime.

942
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,490
Okay, okay.

943
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,990
Forget about the piano.

944
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,360
We really don't have 500,000 yuan.

945
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,900
Go. Just go.

946
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,060
Dad, didn't we...

947
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,490
Didn't we agree to talk this through?

948
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,040
I'm really in trouble.

949
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,080
I really need the money.

950
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,550
You're not short of money.

951
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,950
You're not in trouble.

952
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,110
You're in our house now.

953
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,470
You're breaking up our family, you know?

954
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,270
I borrow money from you.

955
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,340
How can you say I'm destroying your family?

956
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,690
When did I ever talk to you?

957
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,500
So

958
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,350
you treat your family

959
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,530
the way you do business.

960
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,230
Do you feel distressed

961
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,990
to give us money every month?

962
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,510
So you want it back all at once.

963
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,100
What are you doing?

964
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,870
You scared me.

965
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,000
What are you doing sneaking around?

966
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,590
Let me see.

967
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,350
Who is sneaking around?

968
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,860
I'm in charge of purchasing.

969
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,030
I need to take some photos for my boss

970
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,070
to see your equipment

971
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,070
and steel.

972
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,590
Where is your boss?

973
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,550
He's in the house.

974
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,360
Well, take me to him.

975
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,200
Go, go, go.

976
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,500
Let's go.

977
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,560
Brother, someone came by to talk business.

978
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,930
[Business License]

979
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:37,830
Sir.

980
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,190
Guo Qidong.

981
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,460
Hello. Hello.

982
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,110
You're welcome. Have a seat.

983
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,650
Step outside for a second.

984
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:51,730
What's your name?

985
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,590
My surname is Chen.

986
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,380
I went out in a hurry today

987
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,210
and forgot my business card.

988
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,670
I'll give you a number later.

989
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,440
Okay.

990
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,860
Sir.

991
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,540
Which company do you work for?

992
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,980
You look a little new to me.

993
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,890
Our company is in Yong Zhou,

994
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,240
called Yuzhou Steel Trading Company.

995
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,730
What kind of business is your company in?

996
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,000
What size do you want?

997
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,120
Our company

998
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,860
is mainly engaged in cooking utensils.

999
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,560
We need 21 thick sheet of steel.

1000
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,040
How much do you need each year?

1001
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,530
It depends on the order.

1002
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,660
But a year,

1003
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,060
1,000 tons at least.

1004
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,730
1,000 tons at least.

1005
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:39,750
Dad.

1006
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,450
I'm not here to fight.

1007
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,150
And I'm not here for the money.

1008
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,790
My business is having a hard time.

1009
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,350
I'm really in trouble.

1010
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,470
I'll mortgage my house to you,

1011
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,950
-okay? -No, no.

1012
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,340
We dare not take it.

1013
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,980
Your house and your car.

1014
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,630
So what?

1015
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,820
You want it back in the future?

1016
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,440
What are you doing?

1017
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,750
Torturing us every day?

1018
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,910
Well, I have to warn you.

1019
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,650
The house you're living in

1020
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,220
belonged to my grandparents.

1021
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,200
My name is on the deed.

1022
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,750
And I have the deed.

1023
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:17,710
My mom's gone,

1024
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,270
and now I have the house.

1025
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,070
I have the right to do what I want.

1026
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,260
What do you want?

1027
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,760
If I can't borrow money,

1028
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,350
I'll have to take this house

1029
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,470
to the bank as collateral.

1030
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,280
The court is fair and impartial.

1031
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,750
I don't believe you can go to the court

1032
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,670
and talk this shit.

1033
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,370
You... You.

1034
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,630
Xu Youren.

1035
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,030
I was unlucky to marry you.

1036
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,220
What am I gonna do?

1037
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm gonna sleep on the street with my kid.

1038
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,150
You can have the court throw me out.

1039
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,750
Xu Banxia, listen.

1040
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,500
If you take this to court,

1041
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,270
I'll disown you.

1042
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,220
Do you know?

1043
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,860
Mom, do you want to eat?

1044
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,710
I'm hungry.

1045
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,670
Eat what?

1046
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:52,420
Go and beg for food.

1047
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,050
Go practice your song.

1048
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,700
Sweetie, what are you doing?

1049
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,540
Dad, please help me.

1050
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,250
Think about it.

1051
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,890
Are you tired

1052
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,100
of living like this every day?

1053
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,270
Take care.

1054
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,960
Get out!

1055
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,620
Get out!

1056
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,980
We don't need you in this house.

1057
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,280
Don't act like you're rich.

1058
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,170
We don't have you in our family.

1059
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:17,690
Get lost!

1060
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,710
You got it right this time,

1061
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,180
being angry and scared.

1062
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,090
Let's do it again.

1063
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,360
♫He married a new wife♫

1064
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,470
♫Three and a half years later♫

1065
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,230
♫she had a younger brother♫

1066
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:44,130
♫Better than her♫

1067
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,630
Mr. Qiu.

1068
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,990
We've been staking out these for days.

1069
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,720
What about these?

1070
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,490
He ran a factory in the country behind your back.

1071
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,800
The legal person is Guo Qidong.
