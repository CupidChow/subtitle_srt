how to be a head of a cell?

how to behave so one can come out early?

Why did they agree?

In my opinion,

it's not necessarily a bad thing

we might have rent it

We can negotiate with them later.

As long as they don't go too far,

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,080
everything will be negotiable.

60

must have been scared off by them.

and polluted the whole intertidal zone.

It's so distressing.

It's just about a small amount of money.

94

Whatever the amout is, we can discuss.

95

You can't mess around in business.

103
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,840
At least this place

104
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,620
is managed by the government of People's Republic of China.

105
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Whoever did something like this, isn't he afraid of divine retribution?

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,659
when you did something like this?

107

Stop talking nonsense.

108
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,340
Do you have any evidence

109
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,470
that we did it?

110

don't frame us.

Are we stupid?

119

I tell you,

120
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,940
You don't need to complain to us.

121
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,140
Call the police and tell them.

122
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,030
The county government has reported it to the city.

Are you fooling me?

Don't bluff!

125
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,620
Didn't you say several groups of people

come to see this inertidal zone?

127
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,940
Several groups of people.

128
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,910
Why don't you ask them?

129
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,620
Why are you so sure that we did it?

130
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,420
Why?

131
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,500
Let me tell you.

132
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,080
Your heart is so black

133
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,380
This is your retribution.

Don't go!

136
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,700
That's the way they taught me to negotiate.

137
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,540
Will you still rent this intertidal zone?

138
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,530
Yes.

139
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,580
OK. OK. The price

140
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,770
and other conditions,

141
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,750
We can do as you say.

142
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,299
But there is one thing

143
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
you should clean the beach yourselves.

144
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,740
Keep your promise, we made a deal!

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,440
Fatty

146

Fatty

147
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,080
Shut up!

148
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,900
What?

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,340
Did you do it?

150
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,240
Did you?

151
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,420
Are you crazy?

152
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
What do you want?

153
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,300
Do you know

154
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,060
what did the people there say?

155
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,510
People who did it will die in a gutter

156
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,420
and can't go to the heaven.

157
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,930
You tell me what I should do.

158
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,220
The Foreigner wants to see the storage yard.

159
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,340
What can you show him?

160
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,610
What should we do if we didn't do it?

161
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,790
Did you get it?

162
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,010
Take it. Get out.

163
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,590
You bought the trucks.E278

164
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,200
I don't want it. Take it back.

165
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,180
Take it.

166
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,850
I said no.

167
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,650
I'll be caught if they investigate

168
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,660
Why do I need it?

169
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,030
Do you still want to go to jail?

170
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,340
Do you think

171
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,550
you haven't been in there long enough?

172
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,030
Can you use your brain?

173
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,940
What the hell are you doing?

174
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,970
They deserve it.

175
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,210
What did they do?

176
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,860
20 to 50, 50 to 70.

177
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,750
We should teach them a lesson.

178
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,970
Teach them a lesson?

179
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,630
Don't you have enough lessons for yourself?

180
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,790
Tong Xiaoqi,

181
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,310
You've been in jail for five years.

182
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,750
Are you missing the time there?

183
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,060
I deserve it.

184
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,250
I just want to go to jail.

185
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,180
I just want to go back.

186
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,390
All right, it's my idea.

187
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,820
Don't take the blame for him.

188
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,460
Say that again.

189
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,180
Not enough?

190
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,300
-Say it again. -Come on. Go on.

191
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,080
Slap me.

192
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:03,830
Come on.

193
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,580
Come on.

194
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,460
Stop!

195
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:05,900
Don't stop her.

196
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,010
Let her beat me.

197
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,700
Satisfied?

198
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,590
I did it.

199
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,300
What I did

200
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,010
won't implicate you.

201
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,750
Five or ten years at worst.

202
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,200
It may not be that long.

203
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,150
Bye.

204
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,820
You have to come and see me this time.

205
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,310
♫Gently, I will leave you♫

206
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,970
♫Please wipe away the tears in the corners of your eyes♫

207
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,620
♫In the long night, in the days to come♫

208
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,770
♫Don't cry for me, my dear♫

209
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,250
♫The road ahead is bleak♫

210
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,970
♫But please bless me in a smile♫

211
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,700
♫Despite the strong wind and heavy rains♫

212
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,690
♫I'm still missing you so much♫

213
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,300
♫In the days without you♫

214
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,170
♫I will cherish myself more♫

215
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,750
♫In the years without me♫

216
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,970
♫Please take care of yourself♫

217
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,270
♫You ask me when I will return to hometown♫

218
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,980
♫Also I gently ask myself♫

219
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,790
♫Not at this time, and don't know exact time♫

220
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,500
♫I guess I'll be back in the winter ♫

221
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,240
♫Not at this time, and don't know exact time♫

222
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,330
♫I guess I'll be back in the winter ♫

223
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,710
♫Not at this time, and don't know exact time♫

224
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:31,970
♫I guess I'll be back in the winter ♫

225
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,820
You need to add another 50,000 yuan+E859

226
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,790
to rent this intertidal zone.

227
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,060
You wants to repeat the same trick?

228
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,370
We had a deal.

229
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,620
But now,

230
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,860
the whole village's seafields are ruined.

231
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,560
If we rent the intertidal zone now,

232
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,250
the villagers will think

233
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,730
we should compensate them with this money.

234
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,260
The village committee

235
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,160
wants to use this money

236
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,620
to overhaul all the boats in the village.

237
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,690
You guys do big business,

238
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,880
this is only a small amount.

239
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,030
Our work will be easier if you agree.

240
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,060
The rent has been settled.

241
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,800
Don't agree

242
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,060
any other conditions.

243
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,940
The cost of cleaning-up

244
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,860
is about 200,000 yuan.

245
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,940
And the compensation for seafields is 50,000 yuan.

246
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,550
We only got so much money,

247
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,800
it's not enough.

248
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,100
If you say yes to this one, then you can't refuse the next one.

249
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,050
Next time they'll say,

250
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
the families have no money to send their children to school.

251
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,820
Don't you still have to pay?

252
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,090
We are just building a storage yard,

253
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,270
now becomes their village bank.

254
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,250
I don't understand

255
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,750
You are so nice to others

256
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,770
How could you treat your brother like that?

257
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,930
Go to hell if you don't understand.

258
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,990
The waste motor oil

259
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,740
can't be cleaned for years

260
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,820
What do you want me to do?

261
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,100
Did you see the villagers?

262
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,900
They rely on

263
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,620
these seafields to live.

264
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,180
How can they survive

265
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,000
in this situation?

266
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,100
What else can I do

267
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,180
but pay for it?

268
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,380
Tell me.

269
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,380
What should I do?

270
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,340
How am I supposed to fix this?

271
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,620
If you dare to speak up for him again…

272
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,980
Yes, you're right.

273
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,710
It's Xiaoqi's fault.

274
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,460
But he did do it for us.

275
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,320
We are really busy now.

276
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,650
How about asking him back?

277
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,470
We need more help.

278
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,180
No.

279
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,550
Send him the paperwork of his truck squad+E304

280
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,300
when you're available

281
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,390
Give him something to do.

282
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,000
Then he won't cause trouble.

283
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,740
Do you hear me?

284
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,670
What's up?

285
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,870
Want to go have some fun?

286
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,710
What fun?

287
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,650
Games, of course.

288
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,590
You know The King of Fighters?

289
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,580
Come here. Let me teach you.

290
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,180
I haven't asked you.

291
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,140
How did you get in?

292
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,220
Assault, high degree.

293
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,900
Seriously? Who did you hurt?

294
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,680
How?

295
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,590
Have a look at the mutton kebabs.

296
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,980
You won't go to the jail again, right?

297
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,860
Where do you live?

298
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,270
Is it the same as last time?

299
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,870
Let me give you a ride.

300
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,850
I don't want to go back.

301
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,380
Wanna stay outside for a few days.

302
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,970
I don't want to work.

303
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,880
You don't want to work

304
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,360
Freeload?

305
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,579
Didn't you set up a truck squad+E312?

306
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,920
Take me there to have a look.

307
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,930
What's there to see? It's not done yet.

308
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,640
I don't know what's the future like.

309
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,339
You brag.

310
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,450
Nevermind.

311
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,800
Tell me. I won't laugh at you.

312
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,860
Go, let's buy something.

313
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,990
You really have a squad+E487.

314
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,250
Can I come here often?

315
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,420
Wei,

316
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,540
Take this down and pack up.

317
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,160
Let's have hotpot tonight.

318
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,890
-Okay. -Okay.

319
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,860
I don't know your name yet.

320
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,260
Gao Xinyi.

321
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,530
Thia name doesn't sound good.

322
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,260
Call me Miss Gao.

323
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,160
Yes, Miss Gao.

324
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,660
Enjoy yourselves.

325
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,700
Thank you, Miss Gao.

326
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,820
Dismiss.

327
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,770
Let's go.

328
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,280
You've got quite the corporate culture.

329
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,010
You're back.

330
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,230
Doctor Su.

331
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,720
What are you doing?

332
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,050
Waiting for you.

333
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,670
Why?

334
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,380
Are you free later?

335
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,650
Yes.

336
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,620
Great.

337
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,720
Let's eat together.

338
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,180
You brought a pot?

339
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,390
I have a pot.

340
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,910
With my own pot,

341
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,620
I know the temperature.

342
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,780
First of all, your dad's medical report

343
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,350
came out.

344
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,880
Don't worry. There's nothing serious.

345
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,630
He just has arrhythmia.

346
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,180
And his cardiovascular vessels are bit clogged.

347
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,290
You can leave him to me.

348
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,500
Also,

349
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,290
didn't you say you'd buy me dinner?

350
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,390
You seem busy.

351
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,780
I don't think you have time.

352
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,380
Moreover

353
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,030
I don't like eating out.

354
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,360
The oil that restaurants use is not good.

355
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,220
and the meat is not clean.

356
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,740
So I brought some food.

357
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,640
Let's cook for ourselves.

358
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,700
Don't underestimate my hands.

359
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,540
My knife skills are legendary.

360
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,430
I can sew a 1.5mm blood vessel.

361
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,690
The tofu strips I cut,

362
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,180
honestly, I don't dare to open the window,

363
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,380
or it will be blew away by the wind.

364
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,500
Guys,

365
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,100
This first toast is to all of you.

366
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,420
Thank you for your trust in me.

367
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,490
You got nothing

368
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,500
but repair and work day and night.

369
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,130
You helped me.

370
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,760
I remember.

371
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,520
Cheers.

372
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,860
Come on. Cheers.

373
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,670
Boss, don't say that.

374
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,320
If you hadn't

375
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,350
given such a job to us

376
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,700
Someone like me

377
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,380
will go back to the jail again.

378
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Truth.

379
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,110
For the second toast

380
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,940
I want to say

381
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,050
that in the future –

382
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,180
Tong Xiaoqi.

383
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,250
What are you doing here?

384
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,890
I smelled the meat.

385
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,510
You have a good nose.

386
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,180
Come on.

387
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,510
Let me introduce

388
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,300
my best friend.

389
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,360
Chen Yuzhou, you can call him Chen.

390
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,050
Hello, Chen.

391
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,110
You scared me. Sit down.

392
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,740
Come on.

393
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,470
Have a seat.

394
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:47,970
Come on.

395
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,580
Let's eat.

396
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,190
Slow down.

397
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,540
This one.

398
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,550
Leave some.

399
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,710
It's hot.

400
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,440
Leave some for me.

401
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,630
Can you be like a human?

402
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,590
I can't wait.

403
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,090
Sorry.

404
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,190
I've been working all day. I'm hungry.

405
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,250
Let's wait a little longer.

406
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,270
How's it? Taste good?

407
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,710
Yeah.

408
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,950
This is stir-fried eel.

409
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,690
Pick fresh eels,

410
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,830
which are as thick as chopsticks.

411
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,070
Remove the bones

412
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,390
and fry till the eels are crisp.

413
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,600
This is boiled and dried bean curd.

414
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,810
It's made with bean curd shreds with Jinhua ham shreds.

415
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,740
It's all about the fragrance of bean and meat.

416
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,090
This is pork ball.

417
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,870
Fresh lotus leaves are a must.

418
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,020
Meat should be cut slowly.

419
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,810
Don't chop it.

420
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,540
If you chop it, the smell of meat will be gone.

421
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,210
This is Longjing Prawns.

422
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,190
This dish is a bit cruel.

423
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,680
To preserve its umami,

424
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,740
the prawns are peeled alive.

425
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,710
Delicious.

426
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,180
I don't know

427
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,930
you are so good at cooking.

428
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
If it were in the ancient times,

429
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,340
you would be a royal chef.

430
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,190
I'll serve you some more.

431
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,670
Here.

432
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,300
Since my grandma passed away,

433
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,260
I haven't had such a delicious

434
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,580
home-cooked meal for a long time.

435
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,460
Your grandma brought you up.

436
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,590
Such delicious dishes.

437
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,380
Let's have a drink.

438
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,300
Sure.

439
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,200
You can do this?

440
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,260
How can you survive

441
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,660
without some specialities?

442
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,800
You're so cute.

443
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,920
Not like a sophisticated businessperson.

444
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,500
Give me your hand.

445
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,400
That one.

446
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,700
Ouch ouch.

447
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,340
Cute?

448
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,220
So cute.

449
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,910
Really?

450
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,180
You have strong hands.

451
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,550
You're not like you at all.

452
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,460
Does it hurt?

453
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,870
Yes.

454
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,350
It hurts.

455
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,530
That means you have a health problem.

456
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,980
I was always bullied when I was a kid.

457
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,900
So I learned to catch the purlicue

458
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,190
from my grandpa.

459
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,620
My grandpa is a senior doctor of traditional Chinese medicine.

460
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,110
So is my dad.

461
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,060
My dad named me

462
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,630
in the name of a Chinese medicine.

463
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,940
Banxia, do you understand?

464
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,500
Raw pinellia ternata

465
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,750
Poison.

466
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,520
The environmental makes me and shapes me.

467
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,620
I have no choice.

468
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,480
If you were me,

469
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,400
you wouldn't even be able

470
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,980
to finish the nine-year compulsory education.

471
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,090
Have you figured out what to do?

472
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,320
Thank you.

473
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,310
For what?

474
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,840
Thank you for taking the blame for me.

475
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,570
Nonsense.

476
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,740
Who took the balme for you?

477
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,900
I did do it.

478
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,200
So I have to take the blame.

479
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,510
If I go to the jail

480
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,760
you will send me meals.

481
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,190
We are brothers after all.

482
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:01,620
I guess

483
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,150
she won't come.

484
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,460
Fatty asked me to give it to you.

485
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,300
No.

486
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,570
We are disbanded after this meal.

487
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,860
Don't be silly.

488
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,930
What about your buddies if the squad+E899 is disbanded?

489
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,730
Have you thought about them?

490
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,410
You have to understand her.

491
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,120
You have so many brothers now.

492
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,420
If one of them makes a mistake

493
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,220
you will also be mad.

494
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,120
Fatty doesn't have anyone else.

495
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,100
Just the two of us.

496
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,470
We finally reunite.

497
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
We can't just break up.

498
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,900
Sometimes, people are just willing to

499
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,900
vent their anger on the person closest to them.

500
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,280
Aren't they?

501
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,160
Fatty asked me to tell you,

502
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,700
first, pick good drivers.

503
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,660
Be loyal and never cause troubles.

504
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,890
One having work to do and food to eat

505
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,590
is better than anything.

506
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,100
The company will buy these cars.

507
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,380
All three of us have shares.

508
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,600
You run the business and take the profits or losses.

509
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,290
Second, she knows you are loyal

510
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,350
and good to people.

511
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,570
But only one thing.

512
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,530
Remember,

513
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,790
You can't do anything illegal.

514
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,770
Don't take drugs.

515
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,580
Got it?

516
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,160
Shut up.

517
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,370
Fatty spent 200,000 yuan more

518
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,790
to clean the waste motor oil up.

519
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,060
The oil has seeped into the ground.

520
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,300
We have to dig out all the soil.

521
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,790
Otherwise, it will seep into the sea.

522
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,900
The pollution will get worse.

523
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,840
The villagers

524
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,360
will tear us apart then.

525
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,220
I didn't expect

526
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,210
it to be so serious

527
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,940
and to be a large scale.

528
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,240
What a sin.

529
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,590
This place can only be a storage yard.

530
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,110
Or I can't figure out

531
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,890
what else to do.

532
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,750
We've already started cleaning.

533
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,360
The construction will start as soon as we are done.

534
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,600
There's a thing

535
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,820
I'm very curious about.

536
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,460
Why do you stick to

537
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,210
15,000 tons?

538
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,370
15,000 tons is a starting point.

539
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,450
At least it is worth my while.

540
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,210
The more I get back,

541
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,900
the more you earn.

542
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,470
Right?

543
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,780
So you did me a favor

544
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,970
by borrowing money from me?

545
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,710
I need a starting capital.

546
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,240
You need a stable supply channel.

547
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,980
We each take what we need.

548
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,620
The international steel price fluctuates so much.

549
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,340
I can sign the acquisition contract in the future.

550
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,030
I can lend you the money.

551
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,260
But I have three conditions.

552
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,530
No bargain.

553
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,580
First, I have the pricing power.

554
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,130
Second, the money I gave you is not a loan.

555
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,360
It's called advance payment.

556
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,700
Which is the price of purchasng steel

557
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,750
with transportation and tax.

558
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,220
As for your profits,

559
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,770
when the steel reaches the port,

560
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,980
I'll decide by the quality.

561
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,640
What do you think?

562
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,460
Is my opinion important?

563
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,480
Of course not.

564
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,690
Do you always do business like this?

565
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:05,740
Miss Xu.

566
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,100
I think I should

567
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,200
remind you of your situation.

568
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,150
It's you that borrow money from me.

569
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,530
And,

570
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,380
since you earn money through hard working,

571
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,100
I can spend less,

572
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,500
if you work harder.

573
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,440
Profiteer.

574
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,430
I like this name.

575
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,660
It sounds better than a handsome guy.

576
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,540
What's the third condition?

577
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,020
Third,

578
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,340
you need to build the storage yard as soon as possible.

579
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,580
I can provide

580
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,370
quotas and funds for imports

581
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,140
But I won't pay

582
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,970
the money for building.

583
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:36,680
OK?

584
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,020
Yes, no problem.

585
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,100
Prepare all the materials

586
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,450
and come to the company to sign the contract.

[Binhai Banxia Storage Yard plan sketch]

614
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,390
Hey, there.

615
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,630
Hurry up.

616
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,470
Stop dawdling.

617
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,690
Hurry up.

618
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,310
Miss Xu.

619
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,440
How's the cleaning-up going?

620
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,010
The soil is cleaned up.

621
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,300
The oil in the sea is troublesome.

622
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,480
Money comes earlier than you.

623
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,100
Get up and have breakfast.

624
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,380
Do you know until what time I worked last night?

625
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,120
I just slept for a few hours.

626
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,990
How's it going over there?

627
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,930
Did you get the money?

628
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,420
It's not that easy.

629
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
The contract he asked me to sign

630
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,340
is thicker than my textbooks in school.

631
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,590
Just sign the contract. Don't worry.

632
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,820
How can I not be anxious?

633
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,780
They said

634
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,200
they wouldn't pay if we can't build the storage yard.

635
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,780
Then my efforts will be in vain.

636
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,460
It's all gonna work itself out

637
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,440
Take it step by step.

638
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,600
Just calm down.

639
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,880
It's getting cold.

640
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,370
You can't stay here every day.

641
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,890
Let's take turns.

642
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,380
Are you kidding me?

643
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,870
You're a girl. How can you sleep at a construction site?

644
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,830
There are so many workers.

645
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,800
It's inconvenient.

646
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,630
I just need to get through this.

647
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,730
Didn't we agree

648
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,890
to build a big yard here

649
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,080
when you come back from abroad?

650
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,970
We'll build three big houses with great yards.

651
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,680
One for you and one for me.

652
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,100
And one for you know who.

653
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,540
Who?

654
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,720
Who else could it be? Of course Xiaoqi.

655
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,800
So petty.

656
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,550
Can you two take a break? Stop working.

657
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,540
D-D-Don't talk

658
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,430
if you don't work.

659
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,220
Just stay there.

660
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,820
One, two, three.

661
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,770
W-What are you doing?

662
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,220
Working!

663
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,090
You spilled the cement on the ground.

664
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,070
The cement–

665
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,040
The bricks are broken.

666
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,060
Well, how else

667
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,860
can we deal with the cement?

668
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,830
Besides,

669
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,870
It's not our job,

670
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,580
You know?

671
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,590
You spilled my cement.

672
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,830
-You think you're right? -What are you doing?

673
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,510
Shut up!

674
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,110
I-I-Is this what you do?

675
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,640
Do the math for me.

676
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,380
How much does my cement cost?

677
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:15,970
Ask him to pay.

678
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,460
Why should we compensate you?

679
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,390
We have nothing.

680
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,470
Listen, Chen.

681
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,540
I'm doing you a favor.

682
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,860
Enough.

683
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,700
How dare you say that?

684
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,800
Where do you come from?

685
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,440
Shut up.

686
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,510
Didn't Tong Xiaoqi ask me to do it?

687
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,360
Where did you find them

688
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
to work for me?

689
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,600
Do you know how much the cement is?

690
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,030
Boss,

691
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,120
Are you really going to take Xu Banxia with you?

692
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,090
You are too partial to her.

693
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,260
How could you say that?

694
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,070
She has been with us for years.

695
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:43,850
Right?

696
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,790
And she has been begging me.

697
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,500
The scrap steel in China

698
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,490
is now a tough business.

699
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,420
It's not easy for Xu.

700
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,750
Oh yeah?

701
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,540
You don't know the foreigner lent her money.

702
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,850
It's of no use that we tried so hard

703
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,990
to fawn on him

704
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,620
I wonder what tricks she used.

705
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,170
Who do you think the Foreigner is?

706
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,650
Only Banxia, this crazy girl,

707
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,340
can accept

708
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,290
his imparity clauses.

709
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,540
And even if she borrowed money,

710
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,370
The amount she gets

711
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,520
is up to us,

712
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,110
isn't it?

713
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,760
Well.

714
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,630
Okay.

715
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,620
Suit, overcoat,

716
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,929
leather shoes and handkerchiefs.

717
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,070
No way.

718
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,020
Why is there a lighter?

719
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,719
STDupont lighter.

720
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,179
That's a standard set for people going abroad.

721
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:23,920
Really?

722
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:24,630
You can take a look.

723
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,000
Let me see.

724
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,820
Let me see.

725
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,060
Look. It's really nice.

726
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,590
Look.

727
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,469
It's like gold-plated.

728
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,690
How much is this?

729
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,420
60 yuan.

730
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,300
All right.

731
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,909
Get one for each of us.

732
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,810
That's great.

733
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,460
Qiu pays for it.

734
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,790
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

735
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,050
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

736
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,230
Let's make a plan.

737
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,460
After getting there,

738
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,170
we'd better finish the business as soon as possible.

739
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,940
And stay there for a few more days.

740
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,550
Really?

741
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,070
Of course. Eat and drink.

742
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,310
I'll take

743
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:51,889
my wife's camera.

744
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,600
And by then,

745
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,130
we can look around.

746
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,780
Yeah.

747
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,280
♫A Night At Moscow Suburb♫

748
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:02,590
♫Stillness in the night garden♫

749
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,590
♫The leaves are not rustling♫

750
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,000
Can you sing this song?

751
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,760
Sure!

752
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,620
I mean

753
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,080
I don't have many friends.

754
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,950
And people in the hospital

755
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,100
are just collegues.

756
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,210
I divorced once.

757
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,440
I think,

758
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,670
we are good friends.

759
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,180
That's not what I meant.

760
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,280
I…

761
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,320
That's what I meant.

762
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,530
I mean

763
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,380
since we are friends,

764
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,730
I should do something

765
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,870
for my friend, right?

766
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,530
I took some money out this afternoon.

767
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,880
I have a younger brother.

768
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,050
He's already in college.

769
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,630
My parents are in good health.

770
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,200
I don't need much money.

771
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,670
You can take it if you need it badly.

772
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
I need money badly,

773
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,220
But not your money.

774
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,400
Tell me. Who told you that?

775
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:15,880
Your dad

776
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,830
came to the hospital two days ago.

777
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,510
Why did he go to the hospital again?

778
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,270
He just took your stepmother there

779
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,760
for a checkup.

780
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,600
I happen to have a spot.

781
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,680
He really likes taking advantage.

782
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,650
What else did he tell you?

783
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,620
About me?

784
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,910
He said you were doing business

785
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,040
and projects with people from the north.

786
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,760
And you lack money.

787
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,890
He also said,

788
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,310
the man who ran business with you in the north

789
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,400
is Gillevsky.

790
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,610
He's your father's overseas friend,

791
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,210
and came to China once.

792
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:47,800
He had a stroke.

793
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,090
Your dad cured him with acupuncture.

794
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,480
Afterwards, he often visited your dad.

795
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,690
You were still young back then.

796
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,150
That's what he told you?

797
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,590
You believe it?

798
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,630
Doctor Su, I suggest you going to your hospital

799
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,740
and getting a psychiatrist.

800
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,350
Take a good look at your brain.

801
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,150
If you trust him so much,

802
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,030
ask him to give you acupuncture,

803
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,550
and see whether he can cure you brain.

804
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,670
Take the money back.

805
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,350
I don't need it.

806
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,350
You treat me as a friend.

807
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,730
I also treat you the same.

808
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,530
Take it. Don't mention it.

809
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,820
I'm not being polite to you.

810
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,460
If he is like

811
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,280
what he said,

812
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,440
knowing some Russian people,

813
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,310
I will just ask him

814
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,480
for money.

815
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,260
Keep it.

816
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,940
I really don't need it.

817
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,730
Stay and have dinner at my home?

818
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,660
Let me do the cook.

819
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,370
Well,

820
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,120
Not having tasted your cooking for few days,

821
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,150
I've been craving for it, indeed.

822
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,470
Your dad said

823
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,580
your cooking is terrible.

824
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,340
You have to take what he said

825
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,960
with a grain of salt.

826
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:00,930
Eat slowly.

827
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,670
I'm not full.

828
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:05,900
Another bowl please.

829
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,940
Do you think I ate too much?

830
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,570
No.

831
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,300
It's nice to eat a lot.

832
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,180
It's best if you can eat it all.

833
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,480
I spend all day at the construction site.

834
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,100
I don't feel like eating when I'm busy.

835
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,460
I can have better meals home.

836
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,740
Also thanks to your cooking.

837
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,280
Don't you want more?

838
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,140
I'm full.

839
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,910
I see food in the fridge

840
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,910
are not that fresh.

841
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,310
You'd better hurry up to eat them.

842
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:36,400
Okay.

843
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,350
If you don't have time to buy groceries,

844
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,570
I can do it for you.

845
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,780
If you're not home,

846
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,540
I can leave them outside your door.

847
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,430
No, thanks.

848
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,820
You don't have to turn me down.

849
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,610
I'm not a bad person.

850
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,250
I don't have bad intend.

851
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,060
Eat slowly.

852
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,940
It's bad for your stomach if you eat fast.

853
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,800
In a few days, I'll be back to my hometown

854
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,110
and bring you some salted duck eggs.

855
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,130
All are well-marinated.

856
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,340
Put them in the fridge after you cook them.

857
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,540
Take one when you want to eat.

858
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,370
Well,

859
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,290
Just take

860
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,560
that 70,000 yuan.

861
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,950
How about writing me an IOU?

862
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,390
I'll take it back if you don't need it.

863
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:31,910
Actually,

864
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,860
you don't have to be so nice to me.

865
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,980
I can't afford it.

866
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,200
You can–

867
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,930
Thank you for taking care of me.

868
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:50,840
♫You say I'm like an elusive cloud♫

869
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:57,580
♫You don't know my heart♫

870
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:08,660
♫You say I'm like an unreal dream♫

871
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,110
Well...

872
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,160
When we go to the construction site tomorrow,

873
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:16,740
♫You don't know my heart♫

874
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,380
remember to wear a mask

875
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,830
It's dusty. Take care.

876
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,420
Okay.

877
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,440
Then I should go.

878
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:25,980
♫You say I'm like an obscure mystery♫

879
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:35,910
♫I just hide my true feelings with my indifference♫

880
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:46,020
♫I'm afraid I can't afford my affections for you♫

881
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,230
Dry-Fried Green Beans with Chili.

882
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:53,780
♫So I dare not get too close to you♫

883
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,710
Heat the oil and then add Sichuan peppercorn.

884
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,270
Fry ginger and chili to bright red color.

885
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,380
Wash the beans and filter them.

886
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,080
Fry the green onion to stimulate its fragrance.

887
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:03,230
♫You say you'd travel far and be sad alone♫

888
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,720
Throw it into the heated oil.

889
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,040
After stir frying for a bit,

890
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,640
add two spoons of soy sauce.

891
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,990
A spoonful of white vinegar and some MSG.

892
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,260
Use gentle heat to reduce liquid and stir fry.

893
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:15,690
♫I won't let you see my crying eyes♫

894
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,700
After the sauce thickens,

895
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,740
add salt to the pot.

896
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,330
Look.

897
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,230
This is the dock.

898
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,120
Here is our storage yard.

899
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,080
East gate, west gate.

900
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,510
We have our own trucks.

901
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,370
We can ensure the basic transportion running smoothly.

902
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,090
I've rented this intertidal zone for 30 years.

903
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,740
When I have money, I'll extend it slowly.

904
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,050
We can build a larger yard if we get money.

905
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,390
I can run a factory.

906
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,290
The raw materials are nearby.

907
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,020
Running a factory by yourself is tiring.

908
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,960
All is worth.

909
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,240
When the foundation is ready next week,

910
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,680
we can basically see the prototype.

911
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,240
But based on the current progress,

912
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,020
you won't be able to finish constructing

913
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,470
before you leave.

914
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,090
I'll hurry up.

915
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,070
You can't finish it no matter to what extent you hurry up.

916
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,210
Only when the storage yard is done,

917
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,900
the contract can come to effect.

918
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,140
I hope you remember it.

919
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,680
I promise you.

920
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,000
When I come back,

921
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,160
the construction will finish.

922
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,440
How can you guarantee that

923
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,340
You are going out for more than two months.

924
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,930
If something goes wrong,

925
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,830
for example, if your capital chain is broken,

926
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,010
What should you do?

927
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,090
Mr. Zhao,

928
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,740
my life is on it.

929
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,590
I agreed

930
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:19,800
all of your clauses,

931
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:20,780
no matter how unfair they are.

932
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,430
What else can I do?

933
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,760
Mr. Zhao,

934
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,680
If the storage yard is not completed when I come back

935
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,500
I'll carry the scrap steel

936
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,900
to your company myself, piece by piece.

937
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:40,720
What do you think?

938
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,290
What are your conditions?

939
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,270
How can I get the money?
