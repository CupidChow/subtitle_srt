169
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,460
We'll have to do this

170
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,730
when his father is on duty.

171
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,510
Let's work all-day

172
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,490
and take as much as we can.

173
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,390
We'll split the money between us.

174
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,510
You go inform

175
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,130
the city's scrapyard.

176
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,270
Tong Xiaoqi.

177
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,670
Can you get the truck out?

178
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,130
Look, look.

179
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,060
I told you he's a liar.

180
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,500
Is your name Tong Xiaoqi?

181
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,590
Is your name fake too?

182
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,920
Who are you calling a liar?

183
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,480
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

184
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,430
I've just learned to drive and I'm not very good at it.

185
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,710
Do you dare to use the truck?

186
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,550
If you do, I dare to drive it too.

187
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,630
Fatty, hurry up!

188
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,140
I'm coming.

189
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,440
You're good.

190
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,900
You really drive it out.

191
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,480
I'm a man of my word. Come on.

192
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,390
I'm coming.

193
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:18,950
Come on.

194
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,390
Slow down, slow down.

195
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,380
Do you know how to drive or not?

196
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,640
Backward!

197
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,830
Move it!

198
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,550
Backward!

199
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,480
Backward!

200
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,860
Backward!

201
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,070
Yes, yes.

202
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,910
Hit the wheel, hit the right wheel.

203
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,430
What are you doing, Tong Xiaoqi?

204
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,230
Turn right.

205
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,430
Turn right.

206
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,030
Tong Xiaoqi, can you do it?

207
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,420
Right, backward.

208
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,140
Move backward!

209
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,950
Hurry up!

210
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,060
Not enough.

211
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,140
♫Never mind how it will end later♫

212
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,580
Slow down, slow down.

213
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,750
I told you this guy was unreliable.

214
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,240
♫At least we've been together before♫

215
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,670
He's got a car, and he's got a shitty car.

216
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,870
♫Don't bother binding each other♫

217
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,110
♫And no need for verbal commitment♫

218
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:28,800
Watch your feet.

219
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,180
♫As long as we've had it♫

220
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,510
♫It's enough for you and me♫

221
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,430
♫There are many memories in our lives♫

222
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,020
♫At least you have me in your memory♫

223
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:23,819
Tong Xiaoqi.

224
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,750
Who told you to take the car out?

225
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,760
Do you know how to drive?

226
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,370
If an accident happens on the road,

227
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,420
can you take responsibility?

228
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,260
Master, I... I was wrong.

229
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,990
Don't call me master.

230
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,680
You're no longer my apprentice.

231
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,990
You've been fired from the factory.

232
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,030
Get out of here.

233
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,630
Don't, Master.

234
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,230
Go away!

235
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,630
Wait a minute.

236
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,030
You'll have to come with us.

237
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,510
Chief Li.

238
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,430
Hurry up and go!

239
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:42,990
Go.

240
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,350
Master.

241
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,100
Go now!

242
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:44,920
He can't go.

243
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,050
If you get him in the prison,

244
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,660
that boy's life will be screwed.

245
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,430
We must give the factory manager an explanation.

246
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,310
I'll take care of the factory manager.

247
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,990
You can rest assured.

248
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,990
Liu, Liu.

249
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,470
The truck is back. The truck is back.

250
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,510
We're fine.

251
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,000
Who is it?

252
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,670
Speaking of

253
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,780
the devil.

254
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,300
Come on in.

255
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,150
Good timing.

256
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,030
Come on, let's share the money.

257
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,550
You've returned the truck?

258
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,110
We earned a total of

259
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,620
3,158.20 yuan.

260
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Tong, take it.

261
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,190
Here's the change, plus 500 yuan.

262
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,880
Pay off your mother's medical expenses.

263
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,710
Take it.

264
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,630
Take it. Come on.

265
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,760
That leaves 2,600 yuan.

266
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,750
That's 866 for each of us.

267
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,950
Each of us will take 500 yuan out of it

268
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,540
as our capital to start the company.

269
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,550
That leaves 366 yuan as pocket money.

270
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,550
This is yours. This is yours.

271
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,070
Mine.

272
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,820
This is mine.

273
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,410
I can't take this.

274
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,420
I took over 200 yuan from you last time.

275
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,200
What are you talking about?

276
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,190
You can take it.

277
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,950
We gave away the money

278
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,640
for a good deed.

279
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,500
I really can't have it.

280
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,950
You've already helped me enough.

281
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:05,990
Thank you.

282
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,030
Tong.

283
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,950
That's not

284
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,750
pity money.

285
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,060
We did the work together.

286
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,790
Before you came here, me and Chen

287
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,870
had already discussed it.

288
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,110
We'll share it equally.

289
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,090
This is your share.

290
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:21,910
Take it.

291
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,360
Did something happen?

292
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,460
It's nothing.

293
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,630
Is your mom…

294
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,520
No, it's not.

295
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,550
Then what's wrong with you?

296
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,710
Just tell me.

297
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,930
I was fired from the power plant.

298
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,500
Is it because

299
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,200
you took the truck out?

300
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,030
It's okay.

301
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,870
It's good. We'll work together from now on.

302
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,670
Really?

303
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,520
Of course.

304
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,320
Okay.

305
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,380
Now put the money in your pocket.

306
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Okay.

307
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,110
I'll just... I'll take a hundred yuan.

308
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,790
What are you talking about?

309
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,550
I told you

310
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,280
this is for a good deed.

311
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,110
Take it, take it.

312
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,990
All right, all right.

313
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,320
I'll take this money to buy you a big meal tomorrow.

314
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,620
What meal?

315
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,810
To the first bucket of money we made.

316
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,430
Cheers!

317
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,450
-Cheers. -Cheers.

318
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:49,090
♫In the spring of my life♫

319
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:59,860
♫I was robbed of my joy♫

320
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:13,390
♫I was bold enough to tell the truth♫

321
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:23,570
♫But the chains became my reward instead♫

322
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,260
Tong Xiaoqi.

323
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,650
Stand up.

324
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,180
What's wrong?

325
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,390
Turn around.

326
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,080
Go shopping for clothes with me tomorrow.

327
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,340
Tong.

328
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,500
Come here.

329
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,130
Try it on.

330
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,640
I don't want it. It doesn't suit me.

331
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm buying it for my husband.

332
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,750
Try it on.

333
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,700
Let's take you to eat something first.

334
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,510
Then we'll go to

335
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,080
the Steel Industry Trade Conference.

336
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,740
This is for you.

337
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,070
From now on,

338
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,510
you'll be the business manager,

339
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,260
Vice President Tong

340
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,310
of Banxia Steel Co., LTD.

341
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,140
[Tong Xiaoqi]

342
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,140
[Business Manager]

343
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:21,960
Understand?

344
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,160
I've been running the business of scrap steel

345
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,440
these years.

346
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,670
There are price differences in all regions of the country.

347
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,520
We can get the information at the conference.

348
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,950
For example, some of the steel scrap

349
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,210
in the south

350
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,490
is cheaper.

351
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,850
We can hoard some

352
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,050
and then sell it to some small steel mills.

353
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,060
Sometimes the business is good.

354
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,920
Sometimes not.

355
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,160
I had bought it for you before I got to the prison.

356
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,610
The day I went shopping for clothes with you.

357
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:13,520
[1991]

358
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:37,760
Just stop here.

359
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,170
You can go back.

360
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:44,830
Okay.

361
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:45,790
Thank you.

362
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,020
Xu, you're back.

363
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,310
Listen, someone opened the door.

364
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,650
Someone's back.

365
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,790
Wang Quan!

366
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,560
How can you do this to me?

367
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,950
How can you do this to me?

368
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,850
You bastard!

369
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,710
Get out of here!

370
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,360
I...

371
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,750
This is my house. Get out!

372
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,980
Go screw yourself!

373
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,770
Screw you!

374
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,380
Get out of here!

375
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,920
This is my house.

376
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,130
Why should I get out?

377
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,190
They fight every day.

378
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,300
She's caught him in the bed.

379
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,100
Get out of the way!

380
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,700
What are you doing here?

381
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,600
Screw you!

382
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,770
Who told you to come back?

383
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,310
Wang Quan, stop it!

384
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,560
Get out of my way!

385
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,380
I can just choke you to death!

386
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,680
Let's call the police.

387
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,550
How ruthless!

388
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,910
He's so tough.

389
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,230
He'll... he'll just kill him.

390
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,910
He's trying to kill him.

391
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,310
The criminal Tong Xiaoqi

392
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,220
shall be sentenced to five years in prison

393
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,050
for intentional injury.

394
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,510
Why did you throw it away?

395
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,640
Open your eyes and take a good look.

396
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,590
It's a whole new world.

397
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,920
I'll go get a room card.

398
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,470
Take out the trunk.

399
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,400
Mr. Wang, it's been a long time.

400
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,380
How's your business these days?

401
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,590
You are?

402
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,790
I'm Xu.

403
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,920
Xu from Binhai.

404
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,100
You don't remember?

405
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,270
I'm in the steel scrap business.

406
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,790
I made you a toast

407
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,040
last year at the Luzhou Fair.

408
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,710
Have you forgotten?

409
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,450
Mr. Wang.

410
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,430
I brought you some specialties from my hometown.

411
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,230
Take it.

412
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,790
You're welcome.

413
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,580
I'll need you to take care of my business in the future.

414
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,690
Then I'll see you at the conference.

415
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,070
-See you later. -I’ll see you at the conference.

416
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,050
Why did you put all your stuff on the floor?

417
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,560
Where should I put it?

418
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,110
Mr. Li, it's been a long time.

419
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,490
I came to say hello to you.

420
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,030
I've brought you a little gift.

421
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,480
Take it.

422
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,950
This is my cousin from the countryside.

423
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,110
If there is something you don't want to do,

424
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,550
you can give the boy a chance,

425
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,510
so that he'll learn.

426
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:49,970
Good.

427
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,940
Say hello to Mr. Li.

428
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,290
Hello, Mr. Li.

429
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,690
Mr. Zhang, long time no see.

430
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,090
Is your wife here?

431
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,450
I brought her a little present.

432
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,670
She'll love it.

433
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,800
-A nice silk scarf. -Thank you.

434
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,830
This is my cousin from the countryside, Tong.

435
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,150
Take care of him in the future.

436
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,830
Hello, how are you?

437
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,430
See you tonight then.

438
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,350
Okay, see you tonight.

439
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,960
-See you tonight then. -See you tonight.

440
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,250
Xu, you're here too.

441
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,710
I have to, Mr. Wang.

442
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,830
I've brought you some gifts.

443
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,140
Thanks for your care over the past year.

444
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,900
Thank you. Thank you.

445
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,650
Would you come in and have a seat?

446
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,230
No, no, I'll see you tonight.

447
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,610
Let's have a few more drinks, then.

448
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,500
Okay, okay.

449
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,620
How many more?

450
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,180
We're just getting started.

451
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,510
We haven't even done anything yet

452
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,120
and you're already tired?

453
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,260
Bao'er, don't be angry.

454
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,020
I told you.

455
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,850
It's not that I choose not to bring you here this time.

456
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,360
Okay.

457
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,620
It's because she's with me.

458
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,160
I swear to you.

459
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,590
I really don't want to come.

460
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,180
What do I have to say to those people?

461
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,270
They're here to drink and talk.

462
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,020
I didn't want to stay with them.

463
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,470
I've been thinking of you

464
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,950
since I got out of that door.

465
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,740
Mr. Feng.

466
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,790
I... I have to go.

467
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,510
I'll call you back tonight.

468
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,150
I've been thinking about you.

469
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,570
You're here so early.

470
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,280
What's the point of this, do you think?

471
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,590
We're just small businessmen.

472
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,300
Why are we all here for a conference?

473
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,030
I brought some dried bamboo shoots for your wife.

474
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,080
And a silk scarf.

475
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,580
Is she in the house?

476
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,380
I'll bring it to her.

477
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,140
No, no, I'll take it.

478
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,040
I'll thank you for her.

479
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,390
This is my brother, Tong.

480
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,030
He's now the vice business president of my company.

481
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,060
Take care of him.

482
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,570
Pay your respect.

483
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,400
Mr. Feng.

484
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,160
Take off your glasses.

485
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,910
No, no.

486
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,470
Keep them on.

487
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,770
Xu.

488
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,820
I still have to call Bao'er

489
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,010
tonight.

490
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,190
Just tell her we're playing cards together.

491
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,580
If she asks, don't ruin it for me.

492
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,400
Can you use someone else as a shield?

493
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,350
You always make me do this.

494
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,020
We're leaving.

495
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,000
I have to say hello to the people.

496
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,510
See you tonight.

497
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,620
Remember that.

498
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,270
What kind of people do you know?

499
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,530
What a mess.

500
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,030
Who are you talking about?

501
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,130
Mr. Feng.

502
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,940
I'm telling you.

503
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,050
Don't be rude

504
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,810
at the conference at night.

505
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,150
I'm here to find business opportunities,

506
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,350
not enemies.

507
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,670
And don't drink.

508
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,270
Don't tell them I'm a college student.

509
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,290
These guys are generally not well-educated.

510
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,450
They don't like college students.

511
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,970
Don't let it slip.

512
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,790
We haven't seen each other for almost a year.

513
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,720
[Jiangdong International Steel Fair]

514
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,670
That's right.

515
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,310
I agree.

516
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,460
Let's work together to win.

517
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,440
Mr. Qiu.

518
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,030
Xu, why did you come so late?

519
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:04,830
I've been waiting for you for so long.

520
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,710
Let me introduce him to you.

521
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,070
This is my good buddy, Tong.

522
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,160
-Hello, how are you? -He’s now…

523
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,110
Come here. Come here.

524
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,770
What's wrong?

525
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,800
Look, look.

526
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,540
He hasn't come yet.

527
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,070
Besides, even if he does,

528
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,780
you still should be the one to sit here.

529
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,000
You're the boss.

530
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,030
Good, good.

531
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,710
Have a seat.

532
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,030
Mr. Wu and Mr. Guo are here.

533
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,450
Keep your voice down.

534
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,940
Let me tell you.

535
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,030
I just got a batch of equipment.

536
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,470
You've brought in new equipment?

537
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,820
How much are you expanding your business,

538
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,370
Mr. Qiu?

539
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,800
Stop mocking me.

540
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,370
I would've been fine if I hadn't bought this equipment.

541
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,790
Since I bought this equipment

542
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,130
as he advised,

543
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,310
I've been losing money every day.

544
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,910
I'm almost broke.

545
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:44,640
It's true.

546
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,990
You have to help me.

547
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,180
I have everything on the account.

548
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,280
If you have time,

549
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,730
go check the books for me.

550
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,230
You ask me to check the books for you?

551
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,390
I don't think it's appropriate.

552
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,330
What's wrong with that?

553
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,430
Someone is trying to screw me, you know?

554
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,120
Who's trying to screw you?

555
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,480
Are you suspecting it's Vice President Guo?

556
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:05,670
Qidong.

557
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,480
You are the only college student

558
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,139
among us.

559
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:10,860
You see?

560
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,250
You should've sat on the couch.

561
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,380
But you have to find a small bench for yourself.

562
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,630
It's not good enough for you to be a vice president for Qiu.

563
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:23,989
Without Mr. Qiu, I wouldn't be here today.

564
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,550
Thanks to his encouragement, right?

565
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,389
Good, good.

566
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,389
It's good for you to have gratitude.

567
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:27,900
Yes.

568
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,060
But then again,

569
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,469
you're young.

570
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,170
Right.

571
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,610
You'll be able to do great things in the future

572
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,270
starting with the basics.

573
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,520
You're very kind. I count on your support.

574
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,620
Look at him.

575
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,330
Look at him kowtowing.

576
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,969
I'm telling you, is he still my man?

577
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,150
Why are you worried about him?

578
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,830
Mr. Guo has been with you since he graduated from college

579
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,030
for so many years.

580
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,070
You're still worried about him?

581
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,570
Xu, listen to me.

582
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,770
No one can be trusted these days.

583
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,080
Of all these people, I only trust you.

584
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,500
You have to help me.

585
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,139
I'm telling you.

586
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,610
I don't ask for your help

587
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,600
unless it's for something really serious.

588
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,140
Okay, Mr. Qiu.

589
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,910
Let's talk about it later.

590
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,590
Let's go in first.

591
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,670
No, no.

592
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,380
We can't go in together.

593
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:07,690
I'll go in first.

594
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,190
Then you can follow later.

595
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,450
Okay, you go first.

596
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,750
What a big man you are!

597
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,390
Mr. Qiu.

598
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,100
Wu Jianshe has taken your seat.

599
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,070
He doesn't know the rules.

600
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,520
Mr. Qiu, I'm sorry.

601
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,030
I must have taken your seat.

602
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,070
Come, sit here.

603
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,320
No, no. Only you can sit here.

604
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,780
If you don't take it, who dares to?

605
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,900
Get seated.

606
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:34,910
Mr. Feng is also here.

607
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,670
Boss.

608
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,600
Feng.

609
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,150
Feng.

610
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,490
You just made a call, am I right?

611
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,940
Don't mention it.

612
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,230
I knew it.

613
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,310
Stir all the bubbles out

614
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,180
for me.

615
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,540
Make it taste like plain water.

616
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,970
Get a waiter to put it on my table.

617
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,100
Why would the waiter listen to me?

618
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,530
Give him five yuan.

619
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,690
Why wouldn't he listen to you?

620
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,330
You can sit at the table by the door later.

621
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,110
Don't just focus on the food and drink.

622
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,730
Keep an eye on me.

623
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,060
I'm a vice president too.

624
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,670
Why am I sitting there?

625
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,120
The guy named Guo is sitting there.

626
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,110
We are in the scrap steel business.

627
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,310
It's good that we can be here.

628
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,270
The one who talked to me at the door just now,

629
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,990
the bald guy

630
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,560
is Qiu Bizheng, Mr. Qiu.

631
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,230
The vice president sitting next to him

632
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,510
is his second-in-command.

633
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,230
His name is Guo Qidong.

634
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,470
There's something fishy between them.

635
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,030
That's Feng Yu, Mr. Feng.

636
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,160
The one with his back to us is Wu Jianshe.

637
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,200
He's the boss of us.

638
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,040
All these years

639
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,900
I've been doing business with him.

640
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,620
I have to drink a lot tonight.

641
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,620
Otherwise, they won't take me with them.

642
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,690
Do you hear me?

643
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,610
Go on.

644
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,380
Keep an eye on me.

645
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,230
You're here.

646
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,090
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu.

647
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,530
Hello, everyone.

648
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,900
I feel very familiar

649
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,620
to see you all

650
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,040
at this annual meeting.

651
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,150
Every year, we can see

652
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,800
many new friends join us here.

653
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,180
Of course,

654
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,400
some old friends have left us too.

655
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,000
Mr. Wu.

656
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,170
Now that we're all here,

657
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,510
can you share your important information

658
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,190
with us?

659
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,920
You youngsters just can't wait, right?

660
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,470
Let me ask Xu first.

661
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,490
Xu, you're a professional steel collector.

662
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,870
Can you tell us about

663
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,520
the current market of scrap steel?

664
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,030
12,000 yuan for cutting scrap.

665
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,560
1,400 yuan for heavy scrap.

666
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,240
What's the good news, Mr. Wu?

667
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,720
Wait.

668
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,380
Did you hear it?

669
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,050
Yes.

670
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
But if I tell you

671
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,520
there is such a place

672
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,710
where the scrap is 350 yuan a ton

673
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,810
and it's as much as you want…

674
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,640
Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous.

675
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:53,930
How can there be such a place?

676
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,730
Don't tell lies.

677
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,530
Tell us

678
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,660
where this place is.

679
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,300
That's right.

680
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,640
It's in the north.

681
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,020
All of your hard work

682
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,390
and tireless efforts.

683
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,300
Do you know?

684
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,200
This place has been chaotic

685
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,880
since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

686
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,840
But the crisis also means business opportunities.

687
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,950
There is this son of my comrade

688
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,170
who has been there for many years.

689
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,990
He sent me a message.

690
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,180
He personally checked out on

691
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,860
the steel scrap mill.

692
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,510
I asked him

693
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,020
to order 50,000 tons for me in one go.

694
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,910
But it's such a good thing.

695
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,640
I can't take it all by myself.

696
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,580
In any case,

697
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,440
I'm a big brother.

698
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,010
Why don't we

699
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,330
all do it together?

700
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,700
Do the math.

701
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,970
In addition to customs fees and taxes,

702
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,030
we'll take the 500,000 tons

703
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,750
at 750 yuan per ton.

704
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,260
You don't even have to go.

705
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,730
I'll go there myself.

706
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,840
You're even saving the traffic fare.

707
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,760
Mr. Wu, I'll go with you.

708
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,390
Don't rush.

709
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,830
Qiu, what do you mean?

710
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,440
Why are you so silent?

711
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,000
You don't trust me?

712
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,000
It's the most critical year

713
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,990
to run the business well

714
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,210
and go towards a virtuous cycle.

715
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,680
Here, I implore

716
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,320
all of you

717
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,500
to unite together

718
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,300
and make the best efforts

719
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,810
for our

720
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,480
national steel industry.

721
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,290
Thank you all.

722
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,670
How about this?

723
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,920
If you want it, we'll go together.

724
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,880
Is that okay?

725
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,460
Boss, if you say so,

726
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,630
if we can go together,

727
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,920
you have to take me with you.

728
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,450
I've known you for so many years.

729
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,320
I know you well.

730
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,310
Take me too.

731
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:48,980
I'll go with you.

732
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:49,910
I'll go too. I'll go too.

733
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,820
I can carry your bag.

734
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,380
What bag?

735
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,810
We'll bring it back and share it with you.

736
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,360
No way. I have to go myself.

737
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,640
Mr. Wu, you're in the cold rolling business.

738
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,520
Mr. Qiu, you're in the decoiled steel sheet business.

739
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,130
Feng focuses on component processing.

740
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,910
I'm a professional steel scrap collector.

741
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,670
It's just perfect to have me with you, right?

742
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,610
That's right.

743
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,010
You're a pro.

744
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,180
Boss, let's get down to business.

745
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,050
How do you want to split these 50,000 tons?

746
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,970
Well, I've thought about it.

747
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,400
According to your financial strength, of course.

748
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,950
Me, 25,000 tons.

749
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,570
Qiu, 15,000.

750
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,900
Feng, 10,000 for you.

751
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,220
Xu, if you have to go,

752
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,620
I'll give you

753
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,940
5,000 tons

754
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,480
from my share.

755
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,570
No, Mr. Wu.

756
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,460
I have to go with you.

757
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,210
Mr. Wu, here is a toast to you.

758
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,350
Count me in.

759
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,600
I can get 15,000 tons.

760
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,890
Let's talk about it later.

761
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,480
Take me with you, Mr. Wu.

762
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,850
Boss, it's worth being your friend.

763
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,790
With you as my big brother, I...

764
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,580
I feel safe.

765
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,490
Come on, let's make a toast to big brother.

766
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,000
Come on.

767
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,810
Come on, thank you, Mr. Wu.

768
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,670
-Thank you, Mr. Wu. -Don’t you have high blood pressure?

769
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,270
-Can you drink? -What’s wrong with that?

770
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,570
I... I could die here.

771
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,400
I'll finish it first.

772
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,420
Take me with you.

773
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,800
15,000 tons, okay?

774
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,200
Thank you for thinking of us.

775
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,070
Thank you for thinking of us.

776
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,090
Thank you, Boss Wu.

777
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:04,880
Excuse me.

778
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,560
Hello, what can I do for you?

779
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:09,940
Hurry up with the food!

780
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,590
We're starving.

781
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,580
There are no more dishes here.

782
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,860
There are dishes all over on other tables.

783
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,220
Don't eat too fast, okay?

784
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,530
We're done, so hurry up with the serving.

785
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,600
We have other things to attend to.

786
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,110
We're out of drinks too.

787
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,120
Take it yourself.

788
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,820
What are you thinking?

789
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,370
You've been staring for so long.

790
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,030
That girl. Is that your girlfriend?

791
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,210
She seems older than you.

792
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,240
Don't talk nonsense.

793
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,960
That's my boss.

794
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,530
What are you doing?

795
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,170
It's fake.

796
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,700
What are you talking about?

797
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,470
It's genuine.

798
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,530
Really? Let me smell it.

799
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,170
Take a sip.

800
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,650
When your boss finishes the pot,

801
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,980
you'll offer the waiter five yuan

802
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:38,850
to replace it with this.

803
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,730
What company are you in?

804
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,430
How dare you drink fake liquor?

805
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,650
Have you thought about it?

806
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,880
With the 50,000 tons of steel coming in,

807
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,540
who will we sell it to?

808
00:42:59,180 --> 00:42:59,780
Yeah.

809
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,670
That Mr. Zhao.

810
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,140
That fake foreign devil.

811
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,700
Sell him. He can take it.

812
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,020
Yes, I'm already here.

813
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,380
What table are you at?

814
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,320
That way, right?

815
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:09,940
Come on.

816
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,740
Coming.

817
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:11,750
There.

818
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,830
Wish you good business next year.

819
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,510
They’re all going up.

820
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,710
When will it be

821
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,320
our turn?

822
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,980
Gotta find a way to grab it.

823
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,890
How?
