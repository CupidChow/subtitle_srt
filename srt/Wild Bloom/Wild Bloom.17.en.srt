00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,120
Alright.

00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,950
You know all my friends.

6
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,200
Just like me,

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,890
you should treat them as your family.

8
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,870
They are my family.

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,860
Today,

10
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,390
I gather you here

11
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,500
for one reason.

12
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,530
Today is the 99th day

13
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,210
since I met Zhou Qian.

14
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,640
You remember it so clearly.

15
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,020
I’m serious.

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,840
Zhou Qian.

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,610
I hope

18
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,110
I can be with you forever.

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,170
Just like the pearls,

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,390
which are longlasting and flawless.

21
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,660
Let me put it on you.

22
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,570
Look at him. Why don't you learn from him?

23
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,000
He is so honest.

24
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,280
Your boyfriend is so nice to you.

25
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,140
You have to treat him well.

26
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,710
Chen.

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,350
Kiss!

28
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,720
What? Kiss!

29
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,110
Kiss!

30
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,170
Kiss! Kiss!

31
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,230
That's right. Kiss her.

32
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,950
Come on. Kiss her.

33
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,750
Kiss!

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,950
Why kissing?

35
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,110
What's wrong with kissing?

36
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,150
Let me see. Is it pretty?

37
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,430
Isn't it 99 days?

38
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,650
You haven't kissed for 99 days?

39
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,310
Isn't it normal to kiss someone in a relationship?

40
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,060
That's right. Have a kiss.

41
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,960
Okay. Have a kiss. Come on.

42
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,250
What are you doing? Kiss the face?

43
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,600
The mouth.

44
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,650
Kiss the mouth.

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,870
Hurry up.

46
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,410
Hurry up.

Come on.

49
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,260
What's wrong, Chen?

50
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,200
Blood, you coughed up blood.

51
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,070
I'm fine.

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,220
He vomited blood.

53
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,190
I'm fine.

54
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,750
Why are you standing up?

55
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,250
Sit down.

56
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,420
-I’ve been like this since I was a kid. -Let’s go to the hospital.

57
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,440
It's okay. Sit down. Why should we go to the hospital?

58
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,570
You coughed up blood.

59
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,950
I'm fine. Sit down.

60
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,790
You're coughing up blood.

61
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,350
Sit down.

62
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,950
-Sit down. He used to be like this. -It’s OK.

63
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,380
Come, sit down. It's okay.

64
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,550
It's okay. I'm always like this.

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,790
Come on, let's eat.

66
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,250
Come on.

67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,090
Cheers.

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,100
Don't work tomorrow.

69
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,300
Go back and have a good rest.

70
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,110
How can you be such kind a boss?

71
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,500
You always ask your employees to rest.

72
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,980
You're all busy. I'll lie down.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,730
What am I to you?

74
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,490
Besides, someone has to watch the storage yard.

75
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,490
It's okay. I won't die.

76
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,930
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,520
Say something auspicious, okay?

78
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,090
Are you angry?

79
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,470
Just kidding.

80
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,770
Su said last time

81
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,140
although you had blood disease before,

82
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,550
there are several indicators

83
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,850
you need to check again.

84
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,310
You're almost out of the medication you were prescribed, right?

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,990
Go to the hospital tomorrow

86
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,030
and have a check again.

87
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,830
Why bother?

88
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,540
I know my own health.

89
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,330
I'm not going.

90
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,580
You go with him.

91
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,409
No.

92
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,490
Chen.

93
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,710
I still have a lot of information to check

94
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,120
for bidding State No.2 Steel.

95
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,570
I'm busy.

96
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,310
Don't worry about it.

97
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,040
I can handle it.

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,370
Don't worry.

99
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,510
Did you hear that?

100
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,880
I'll go, okay?

101
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,760
I'll do the most expensive ones.

102
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,870
I'll check all the organs in my body.

103
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,790
I'll make you feel extra hassle.

104
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,260
Okay.

107

How long will it take?

108
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,380
There are many people today.

109
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,580
I think it will take another hour.

110
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,950
Another hour?

111
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,390
Chen, are you tired?

112
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,880
How about this?

113
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,910
You go back first. I'll wait here.

114
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,810
It's okay. Sit down.

115
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,570
Get up.

116
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,990
Get up!

117
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,670
Why did you leave us?

118
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,440
What should we do in the future?

119
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,030
How can we live?

120
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:23,900
Come here.

121
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,970
No more waiting. Let's go.

122
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,400
The report is not out yet.

123
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,070
Leave it.

Section Chief Chen from the tax bureau

127
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,720
can meet you.

128

And at 10 a.m. the day after tomorrow,

129

to meet you.

131
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,530
What about Division Director Wang of customs?

132
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,390
Have you made an appointment?

133
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,670
I called him several times.

134
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,760
It's hard.

135
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,210
You may leave.

136
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,280
Sis, I want to talk to you about the truck teamt.

137
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,960
The company and the storage yard are being investigated

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,220
and the truck team is out of service.

139
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,820
As long as we seperate the truck team

140
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,130
as last time,

141
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,790
the truck team can apply for

142
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,270
lifting restrictions to the court.

143
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,390
Did you two discuss this?

144
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,630
He doesn't know. It's my idea.

145
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,289
Even if he knows, he wouldn't agree.

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,980
So I thought

147
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,850
to discuss with you alone.

148
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:43,799
Sis,

149
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,970
if the truck team can be unbanned,

150
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,430
we can start making money.

151
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,750
We don't know how long the current situation will last.

152
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,020
If the truck team has income,

153
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,680
it'll be a guarantee for the company.

154
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,530
That's it?

155
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,870
No problem.

156
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,710
The truck team

157
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,120
has always been managed by Tong.

158
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,940
Chen and I were not involved.

159
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,460
Sis, thank you.

160
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,560
It's useless to thank me.

161
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,630
I have no problem.

162
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,210
It doesn't mean there's nothing wrong with Tong and others.

163
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,390
Think about how to tell Tong.

164
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:39,910
Honey,

165
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,390
What surprise are you giving me?

166
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,960
Come on.

167
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,650
Here.

168
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,340
Look from there.

169
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
This area and here.

170
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,320
Right here.

171
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:51,640
Here?

172
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,590
There's nothing

173
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,710
in the wilderness.

174
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,770
I see.

175
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,110
Honey, you're awesome.

176
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm awesome, right?

177
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,480
I'm telling you, I've drawn the blueprints.

178
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,760
Building a factory here

179
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,060
is indeed cost efficient.

180
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,510
But don't you think

181
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,400
this place is a little small?

182
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,580
Besides, the traffic

183
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,470
is not convenient as we drove by.

184
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,200
No, Bao'er.

185
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,520
This is not a factory.

186
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,520
This will be our new home.

187
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,620
New home?

188
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,510
It's so nice here, with mountain and water.

189
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,480
The air is so fresh.

190
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,240
Look far away.

191
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,490
We can go fishing there.

192
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,200
And start from there,

193
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,000
we'll build a three-story building.

194
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,550
The first floor is the kitchen and living room.

195
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,630
Your parents live on the second floor.

196
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,680
The two of us and the baby will live on the third floor.

197
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,790
I've thought about it for that area.

198
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,680
In that forest,

199
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,710
there are many bamboo shoots inside.

200
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,430
When they are ripe, dig them out and stew them with meat.

201
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,900
Stop talking. I don't agree.

202
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,100
Feng Yu, let me tell you.

203
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,330
I came out of the village

204
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,340
not for going

205
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,430
back to it with you.

206
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,010
Hello, Mr Zhao.

207
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,520
Mr. Zhao.

208
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,160
How is it?

209
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,830
The materials we prepared

210
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,000
and procedures have been submitted.

211
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,460
Experts from customs

212
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,670
provided us with evidence.

213
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,730
But it's too sensitive.

214
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,980
The arguments are fierce among management.

215
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,170
So we can only wait.

216
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,280
Since I can't get it,

217
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,780
they won't get it.

218
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,910
Actually, the person who wants this steel factory the most

219
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,860
was Wu Jianshe.

220
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,980
Qiu Bizheng just wanted to take this opportunity

221
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,390
to make some money.

222
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,680
These two

223
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,240
are just teaming up and taking advantage of each other.

224
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,100
Because once they break up,

225
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,230
it won't work.

226
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,530
I should teach him a lesson.

227
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,950
What do you want to do?

228
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,870
Let's see who can withstand the investigation.

229
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,600
The result will be a loss to both sides.

230
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,810
Yes, it will be.

231
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,710
They hurt me first.

232
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,120
I have the right to fight back.

233
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,570
Don't listen to their nonsense.

234
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,230
How could I be investigated?

235
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,110
Don't worry about your payment for goods.

236
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,040
There's no problem.

237
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,910
I'll send the goods to you on time,

238
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,460
Okay?

239
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,480
Section Chief Liu.

240
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,590
We've known each other for a long time.

241
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,240
Right?

242
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,230
I've been doing business in Binhai for so many years.

243
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,690
I've always been law-abiding.

244
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,760
Mr. Qiu,

245
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,910
you know how much taxes you've evaded.

246
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,070
I advise you to

247
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,510
hand over the real ledger.

248
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,210
Otherwise,

249
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,000
you will be suspected of obstructing the law.

250
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,020
I've handed in what I should.

251
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,410
I've said what I should.

252
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,980
How else can I cooperate?

253
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,060
You can talk somewhere else.

254
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,270
The police will be here soon.

255
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,720
Fatty is addicted to sending houses.

256
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,270
It's inappropriate.

257
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,170
Why not?

258
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,780
I've asked someone to clean and disinfect it.

259
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,290
The bed sheets, blankets, daily necessities,

260
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,180
and furniture

261
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,440
are all new.

262
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,820
Boss said

263
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,230
you can stay here from now on

264
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,900
so that you can take care of each other.

265
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,300
What's wrong? Are you not satisfied?

266
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,150
Tong Xiaoqi, come and help me.

267
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,140
Why is there only one bed here?

268
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,230
Where is mine?

269
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,910
There's no such term

270
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,900
in our contract.

271
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,700
Isn't there a sofa?

272
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,800
Make do with it.

273
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,010
Let's celebrate the move.

274
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:54,890
-Come on. -Let’s celebrate.

275
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,850
Yes, let's celebrate.

276
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,630
Come on.

277
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:56,930
Chen.

278
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,500
Cheers.

279
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,840
Take it.

280
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,320
Chen.

281
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,160
Tong Xiaoqi.

282
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,530
Tell me.

283
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,090
Since the first time you stole the manhole cover,

284
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,330
and came to my junk station,

285
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,060
how many years have we known each other?

286
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,280
Seven years.

287
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,600
Seven years.

288
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,640
Time flies.

289
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,370
It's great fate that brought

290
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,930
us together.

291
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,050
Let's toast to our fate.

292
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,430
Yes.

293
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,890
Cheers.

294
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,420
Come on.

295
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:44,930
Cheers.

296
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,860
Cheers.

297
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,070
What are you doing?

298
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,580
Chen, what are you doing?

299
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,720
Tong Xiaoqi, what do you mean?

300
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,250
Chen, what are you doing?

301
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,550
What do you mean?

302
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,700
Stop pretending.

303
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,780
Go away.

304
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,120
Let me tell you

305
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,790
when the steel price fell,

306
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,030
we asked you to leave the truck team independent.

307
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,540
That's our idea.

308
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,770
Yes, you were loyal.

309
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,150
The storage yard was a mess.

310
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,710
Fatty was full of trouble.

311
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,730
You were transporting sand. We faced it together.

312
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,240
But now,

313
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,670
you have money,

314
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,200
and a girlfriend,

315
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,710
and you say you want to be independent?

316
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,040
What are you talking about?

317
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,310
Who's going to be independent?

318
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,170
Stop pretending.

319
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,680
You've already started the withdrawal process.

320
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,460
I mentioned it.

321
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,020
I did.

322
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,450
Chen, I discussed it with my sis.

323
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,640
With the current situation,

324
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,910
it's not a bad thing

325
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,590
for the truck team to be independent.

326
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,950
Tong Xiaoqi doesn't know about this at all.

327
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,900
If he knew, he wouldn't agree.

328
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,510
It's all my fault. Don't blame him.

329
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,790
You should vent your anger on me.

330
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,320
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

331
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,330
Gao Xinyi, who asked you to be on behalf of me?

332
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,610
Tong, listen to me.

333
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,320
I thought I could ask sis

334
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,870
to talk to you.

335
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,210
Listen to me.

336
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,050
What are you doing?

337
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,900
Tong Xiaoqi. What are you doing?

338
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't call.

339
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:04,900
Don't.

340
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,780
Chen, don't go.

341
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,550
I've discussed it.

342
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:06,900
Wildcat.

343
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,430
Tong Xiaoqi.

344
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,960
Chen, don't...

345
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,450
Wildcat.

346
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,880
Give me your phone.

347
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,510
Give me the phone.

348
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,390
Sit.

349
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,089
Sit.

350
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,100
Tong.

351
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,640
I misunderstood you.

353
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,900
You know,

354
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,630
people tend to overthink when they are sick.

355
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,600
I thought you wanted to break up with us

356
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,510
when seeing the company is in trouble.

357
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,790
I should have known

358
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,780
you're not that kind of person.

359
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,180
I was wrong, okay?

360
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,200
It's over.

361
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,100
But I have something else

362
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,630
to tell you.

363
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,650
Just in case,

364
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,120
in case

365
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,550
I die one day,

366
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,690
Treat Fatty better.

367
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,130
Fatty

368
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,070
loves to shoulder everything by herself.

369
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,950
It's really not easy.

370
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,930
If anything happens to her,

371
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,580
If I'm gone, you also left.

372
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,950
She really won't have anyone

373
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,630
to talk to.

374
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,710
Remember what I said.

375
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,580
Shouldn't you tell me

376
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,600
"you won't have that day"?

377
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,510
I see it on TV.

378
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,210
You won't have that day.

379
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,350
We are a law-governing country.

380
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,310
Don't you understand

381
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,070
to act in accordance with the law?

382
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,150
Stop calling me.

383
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,170
I can't help you.

384
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,090
President Gao, Miss Xu is here.

385
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,250
President Gao.

386
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,200
Have a seat.

387
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,050
The customs

388
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,760
have asked me to be the forensic expert.

389
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,370
I explained to them

390
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,600
this is the current situation

391
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,910
selling scrap steel abroad.

392
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,950
In principle, you have no intention or tendency

393
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,210
for arms trafficking.

394
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,380
These tanks and cannons

395
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,020
are sold in the form of scrap steel.

396
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,220
This is also

397
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,510
a commercial loophole of their country

398
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,370
in this special historical period.

399
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,830
Yes, we have procedures.

400
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,930
Zhang has contacted the provincial steel company.

401
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,330
They are willing to buy all your goods

402
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,290
at the market price of scrap metal.

403
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,590
I’ll fight with customs.

404
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,230
If a SOE

405
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,390
acquired this batch of steel,

406
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,920
can we

407
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,200
let it go?

408
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,440
President Gao,

409
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,950
I've ordered the goods.

410
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,400
Zhang.

411
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,220
President Gao.

412
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,880
Add hot water.

413
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,420
Okay, President Gao, I'll listen to you.

414
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,090
I'll figure something out.

415
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,290
Xu,

416
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,720
the auction of State No.2 Steel is inevitable.

417
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,030
This is a signature event

418
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,080
of our national system reform.

419
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,250
Of course. Bidding also means competition.

420
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,510
But you can find someone to work with you.

421
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,850
I've talked about

422
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,960
cooperation before.

423
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,910
But in cooperations,

424
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,850
if the two sides have different thoughts,

425
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,320
this cooperation is not equal,

426
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,910
what's the point?

427
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,400
I've come this far.

428
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,670
I can only choose to compete.

429
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,290
I always think

430
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,750
system has its benefits.

431
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,930
It has a vision of overall situation

432
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,760
and it's closed.

433
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,480
Of course, the market has its strengths.

434
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,550
It is independent and flexible.

435
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,030
If you are all my subordinates,

436
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,420
these problems

437
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,530
wouldn't be so complicated.

438
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,930
At this point,

439
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,140
I can't control you

440
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,500
or others.

441
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,100
We are in the same industry.

442
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,870
Take care.

443
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,630
Qiu Bizheng, come out.

444
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,330
Someone bailed you out.

445
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,010
[Prison area]

446
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,010
[Prison of Yong'an District, Binhai]

447
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,700
Mr. Qiu,

448
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,860
the smuggling munitions case has come to an end.

449
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,970
It's not established.

450
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,400
Whether these scrap steel is arms or not,

451
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,700
we're both clear.

452
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,210
I don't understand.

453
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,240
Mr. Qiu, I've been good to you these years.

454
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,430
You can't do this

455
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,210
while accepting my bonus.

456
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,830
Then what are you doing?

457
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,790
This detention center.

458
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,900
You put me in, then I was in.

459
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,050
-You get me out... -It's a revenge.

460
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,290
You did this to me.

461
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,330
I have to teach you a lesson.

462
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,430
Are you trying to stall me

463
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,800
and stop me from bidding for State No.2 Steel?

464
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,630
Let me tell you. Dream on.

465
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,540
You tried so hard to get me out.

466
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,150
What do you want? Tell me.

467
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,850
Actually,

468
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,100
the main competitor

469
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,780
in the bidding

470
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,890
is me and Wu Jianshe,

471
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:50,860
not you.

472
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,010
As long as you choose the right person,

473
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,070
you'll have a share in this cake.

474
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,160
Do you want to share this cake with me?

475
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,850
You're right.

476
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,390
The main competition is between you and Wu Jianshe.

477
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,150
But none of you can leave me.

478
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,270
Neither of you can control this factory alone.

479
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,050
Speaking of sharing the cake,

480
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,070
OK. How?

481
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,650
I can promise you

482
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,900
anything that Wu Jianshe has promisded you.

483
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:19,770
Mr. Qiu,

484
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,420
we've been doing business for so many years.

485
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,060
How well we do

486
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,430
and what the current situation is,

487
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,480
you can see clearly.

488
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,970
Is there a future standing with Mr. Wu

489
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,850
or with me?

490
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,450
You're a sensible person.

491
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,540
Let's not talk about the future.

492
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,160
Let's talk about the present first.

493
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,640
Let's talk about you.

494
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,170
You keep saying

495
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,200
these men brought you out.

496
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,240
That's why you're here.

497
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,910
You are grateful.

498
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,490
You remember our kindness.

499
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,820
But ask yourself.

500
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,080
Have you really thought about this?

501
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,550
Do you have any

502
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,280
gratitude and respect to us?

503
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,940
Who gave you the nerve

504
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,630
to insult me like this?

505
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,240
I want to ask

506
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,290
is there any rule in your eyes?

507
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,130
Do you respect us as elders?

508
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,860
How can you talk to me like that?

509
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,630
Wu Jianshe and I have been

510
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,040
in this industry for years.

511
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,880
You've only been in this industry for a few years.

512
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,380
Do you really think that just because you make some money

513
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,370
means you've grown?

514
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,630
You began as a junk collector.

515
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,180
What makes you capable to talk business with me?

516
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,010
It used to be Dong.

517
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,730
Now it's about the bidding.

518
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,830
How many times

519
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,220
you trampled on my face?

520
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,670
I've been doing business all my life.

521
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,470
You insulted me this much.

522
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,350
You requested me. I have to beg you.

523
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,250
I can only get a piece of cake

524
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,740
by begging you.

525
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,900
You share it with me?

526
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,400
Who do you think you are?

527
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,340
Since we've gotten

528
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,220
to this point,

529
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,580
I want to fight you too see

530
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,080
who is tougher, whether it's you, a new born calf

531
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,780
or me, old ginger?

532
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,300
Mr. Qiu,

533
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,850
you still don't know how to do business.

534
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,090
Xu Banxia, listen.

535
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,250
Don't be too arrogant.

536
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,170
You will be punished.

537
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,120
How dare you do this at such a young age?

538
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,400
So many goods.

539
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,530
How much does it cost?

540
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,280
Jinbao, you're a good businessman.

541
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,320
Feng Yu, these are goods we will sell within today?

542
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,190
These haven been returned today.

543
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,090
Returned?

544
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,580
What's going on, honey?

545
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,510
Why didn't you discuss with me

546
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,020
when you hired these workers?

547
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,110
Where did you find them? Can they work?

548
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,600
Do they have a technical license?

549
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,590
Why are you yelling at me?

550
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,270
I don't think it's difficult.

551
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,980
Honey, don't be angry.

552
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,520
My mom is still here.

553
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,010
I'll be careful next time.

554
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,000
There's no next time.

555
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,810
Even if we sell the factory now,

556
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,890
it won't sell much.

557
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,310
Leave this factory alone.

558
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,810
[Top Squad]

559
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,500
Happy opening!

560
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,460
Happy opening!

561
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,270
Boss, Cat.

562
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,510
We pooled our money

563
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,720
to prepare a gift for you.

564
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:33,960
Hope you like it.

565
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,890
Come on. Give it to me.

566
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,720
Come in.

567
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,010
Slowly.

568
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,750
Slowly.

569
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,160
Here you go.

570
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,480
Here you are.

571
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,420
Guys, let me announce

572
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,750
every one of you

573
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,590
will be the shareholder of this company.

574
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,510
Thank you, boss.

575
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,820
Don’t thank me. It’s Cat’s idea.

576
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,960
Cat.

577
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,430
This fleet

578
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,510
will be your home.

579
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,250
As long as we work together,

580
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,480
and do our best,

581
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,030
I'll let you be bosses in the future.

582
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,700
Okay.

583
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,420
Hang it up.

584
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,920
Come on, hang it up.

585
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,650
Here.

586
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,610
Be careful.

587
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,730
Okay.

588
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,660
Higher.

589
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,550
What's the matter?

590
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,020
Several suppliers

591
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,440
wanted the payment.

592
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,650
Pay them

593
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,890
and tell them

594
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,810
we will never do business with them.

595
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,460
But our company's account

596
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,440
has been frozen.

597
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,250
Why are you panicking? Get out.

598
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,370
Mr. Qiu.

599
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,970
What's wrong again?

600
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,900
Bad news! Bad news!

601
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,490
Captain Hu.

602
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,150
Mr. Qiu.

603
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,040
Is something wrong?

604
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,260
We received a real-name report

605
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,440
that there are

606
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,720
a lot unqualified goods in your factory,

607
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,470
which went into the market.

608
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,990
That's impossible.

609
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,460
Our factory attaches great importance to quality.

610
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,860
The evidence is very detailed,

611
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,430
including the container number.

612
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,410
Mr. Qiu, please open the warehouse.

613
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,770
We can't get over the fake product.

614
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,890
We will be sentenced.

615
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,650
What do you think?

616
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,730
This is the first contract.

617
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,680
It's a business contract signed

618
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,600
between my company and your Kaiping factory.

619
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,370
From now on, I will give all my business in Kaiping

620
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,460
to you.

621
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,320
You decide the price.

622
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,790
This is a shareholder transfer agreement.

623
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,780
From now on,

624
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,730
you have 15% shares

625
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,920
of my factory.

626
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,620
All these illegal contracts

627
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,150
are signed by both of us.

628
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,650
We need someone to take responsibility.

629
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,430
Stop.

630
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,480
[Share Transfer Agreement]

631
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,480
[Business Cooperation Agreement]

632
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,150
Stop it.

633
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,900
Take the blame for me.

634
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,570
How can you say that, Qiu Bizheng?

635
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm on parole.

636
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,460
I know you're on parole.

637
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,740
Did you sign the contract?

638
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,200
If I go to prison, can you run away?

639
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,760
Either you or I go in

640
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,970
or we go in together.

641
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,830
Then let's go in together.

642
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,120
Then let's go in together.

643
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,690
Sit.

644
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,610
Don't touch me.

645
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,380
Dong.

646
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,480
Sit down and talk.

647
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:34,780
Sit.

648
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,410
Dong.

649
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:50,970
Do you know

650
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,900
how long it takes for you to have these wealth?

651
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,030
These are real gold and silver.

652
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,450
I'm the legal person of this factory.

653
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,400
If I go in, it's all over.

654
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,980
If I stay outside,

655
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,929
we still have a chance to make a comeback.

656
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,199
Besides, I can take care of your family.

657
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,050
How long will it take to get me out?

658
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,199
I promise.

659
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,460
Three months.

660
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,300
Xie Jinbao.

661
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:04,910
Get down!

662
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:05,930
Coming.

663
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,500
Coming.

664
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,260
What's wrong, honey?

665
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:11,960
What's wrong?

666
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,760
What's wrong?

667
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,870
Is this the account book you made?

668
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,770
This one and this one.

669
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,350
I paid you to learn accounting.

670
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,070
You did such kind of accounting?

671
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,020
Take a good look

672
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,490
what you've made.

673
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,230
A donkey's lip is wrong with a horse's mouth.

674
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,290
Why did you throw them?

675
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,950
You tell me.

676
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,490
Why are you yelling?

677
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,700
Why am I yelling?

678
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,430
What do you mean, Feng Yu?

679
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,140
You tell me.

680
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,840
Give me my official seal.

And the contract seal.

683
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,380
What's the use of giving it to you?

684

You tell me.

685
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:34,860
Do you really think the factory

What did you say about me?

695
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,320
You loser.

696
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,430
Do you really mean it?

697
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,220
Hit me?

These are all the information

709
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,080
I can find on the Internet about steel companies in Shenyang.

710
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,830
But it's not entirely true.

711

It's okay. I have my own channels.

Why don't I go with you?

713
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,260
Maybe I can help.

714
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,240
No need.

715
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,880
Just focus on your internet.

716

Bring to him later.

I said a bunch of shit.

847

Don't take it personally.

848
