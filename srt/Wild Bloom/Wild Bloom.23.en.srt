00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,990
Anyone else?

171
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,110
Anyone else?

172
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,980
Go after it.

173
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,150
Anyone else?

174
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,780
50 million yuan for the first time.

175
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,740
No more bids?

176
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,120
Go after him, Zhao Lei!

177
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,170
50 million yuan for the second time.

178
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,020
Zhao Lei, what are you doing?

179
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,430
Go after him!

180
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,140
Go after him, Zhao Lei!

181
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,110
Do you hear me?

182
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,340
Go after him!

183
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,440
Zhao Lei, go after him!

184
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,970
Zhao Lei, say something!

185
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,020
Go after him!

186
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,260
Zhao Lei, go after him!

187
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,620
Zhao Lei! Zhao Lei!

188
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,210
50 million yuan for the third time.

189
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,310
Sold.

190
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,260
Awesome!

191
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,570
I should be the chairman and legal representative too

192
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,230
of this steel mill in the future.

193
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,930
My company doesn't need to be a hundred years old.

194
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,280
Give me ten years,

195
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,820
I believe it won't

196
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,670
be worse than these companies.

197
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,740
If we have our steel mill,

198
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,990
we can make our steel in the future.

199
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,620
Wu Jianshe's company will become our downstream company.

200
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,710
As soon as you arrive,

201
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,620
we'll sign the labor contract right away.

202
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,020
Don't worry about your life.

203
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,340
I will arrange everything for you.

204
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,740
Without the channel of imported steel scrap,

205
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
they are nothing.

206
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,620
Today, I just want them to know

207
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,430
who calls the shots and who is the boss.

208
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,310
After each chemotherapy treatment,

209
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,890
he kept throwing up.

210
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,330
And his hair fell out by the handful.

211
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,220
According to my experience,

212
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,680
his remaining life is as short as one month,

213
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,360
and as long as six months.

214
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,760
I will take the steel mill.

215
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,400
I will let Chen see that day.

216
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,850
You're here to make fun of me?

217
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,420
Why should I?

218
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,590
I just came to see how you're doing.

219
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,750
I've asked a lot of people.

220
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,400
They said you might be here.

221
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,690
It's just a steel mill.

222
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,870
It won't affect your business.

223
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,130
Take a good look.

224
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,870
This large area of land is all yours.

225
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,090
You're doing well in business now.

226
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,280
It's much bigger

227
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,390
than mine now.

228
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,400
If only this was just a steel mill.

229
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,620
If you think you've trusted the wrong person,

230
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,860
there's no need for this.

231
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,180
Business is business.

232
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,670
If you were Boss Wu,

233
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,540
what choice would you have?

234
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,540
Think about it.

235
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,460
It's natural that the first thought of people in trouble

236
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,810
is about himself.

237
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,710
Some day later,

238
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,080
I mean it,

239
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,530
you can come to my courtyard.

240
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,470
How about it?

241
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,180
Feel the nature.

242
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,680
The healing power of nature.

243
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,820
I mean it.

244
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,530
Let's go fishing there one day.

245
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,520
I promise you won't think of anything.

246
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,890
Here, I'll take your bowl

247
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,100
and drink with you for a while, okay?

248
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,260
Go ahead.

249
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,820
I have to go take care of something.

250
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,580
Zhou Qian.

251
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,280
Zhou Qian.

252
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,440
Chen, you...

253
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,390
Let's go.

254
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,330
Get dressed.

255
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,510
Where are we heading for?

256
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,690
There is a cab.

257
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,750
Excuse me.

258
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,099
Tell me, Chen.

259
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,270
Where are we going

260
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,609
at this time of night?

261
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,130
Let's get on first.

262
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,400
Get in the car.

263
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,099
Go to the airport.

264
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,460
Get a good sleep on the plane.

265
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,400
Forget all about this place.

266
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,230
Do you really want to go?

267
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,400
Aren't you afraid?

268
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,080
I am.

269
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm afraid I won't be able to go.

270
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,050
You have to let me go this time, okay?

271
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,300
I've booked the room.

272
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,570
A room with a sea view.

273
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,850
It's right on the beach.

♫I might as well look for you in the memories♫

275
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,740
We can see the sea from the bed.

276
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,720
You see?

277
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,170

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,520
what this steel mill means to me.

337
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,940
You knew it all along.

338
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,580
Why did you do that?

339
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,360
Are you in cahoots with Wu Jianshe and the others?

340
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,710
You just wanted to make fun and me

341
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,420
and make me a laughingstock?

342
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,740
I was saving you, you know?

343
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,340
Save me?

344
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,940
You heard it. 50 million yuan.

345
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,580
And this is just the beginning.

346
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,340
And after that?

347
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,480
Chen will die soon.

348
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,250
I just want to get this steel mill

349
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,640
before he is gone

350
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,500
so that he can see it.

351
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,580
Do you think Chen can live

352
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,500
if you take the steel mill?

353
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,660
This is the only thing I can do.

354
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,270
Do you want Chen to see you go bankrupt

355
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,340
after he's gone to heaven?

356
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,380
This is a business deal.

357
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,760
Can you be rational?

358
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,660
Zhao Lei.

359
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,510
I told you.

360

Once I commit to my feelings,

361
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,900
it won't end up well.

362

Do you want to prove it yourself?

363
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,880
You thought about everything.

364
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,310
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

365

Is this a business between us?

366

Business is rational.

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,310
But I believe you are not rational.

368

Xu Banxia, I should tell you.

Wu Jianshe did come to me before.

He said that as long as I helped him to get State No.2 Steel,

he'd make me

I think you will know these sooner or later.

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,780
I've caused you trouble again.

503
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,070
I'm not used to you not causing me trouble.

504
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,860
Open the curtains for me.

505
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,410
Fatty,

506
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,830
lift the bed for me.

507
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,320
You guys talk first.

508
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,950
Miss Xu, I'll wait for you outside.

509
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,080
I've heard

510
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,590
Wu Jianshe finally got the steel mill.

511
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,060
Those who came from the Northeast

512
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,570
are not to enjoy their retirement here.

513
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,560
Tell me

514
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,160
about your next plan.

515
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,140
I do not know what to say.

516
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,920
Seeing you like this,

517
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,900
why should I bother to do business and earn money?

518
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,610
Fatty,

519
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,280
this is not you.

520
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,600
We've been in worse situations than this before.

521
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,970
But we've survived, right?

522
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,090
It's just a loss of business rights.

523
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,240
Just think about what to do.

524
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,290
You're not a person without ideas.

525
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,510
I'm just not sure.

526
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,090
I'll tell you when I decide.

527
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,370
Fatty,

528
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,230
have you forgotten

529
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,480
how we planned it in the first place?

530
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,930
Yes, I remember.

531
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,270
We are going to open a steel mill,

532
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,250
a steel mill of our own.

533
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,490
We'll do it ourselves.

534
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,660
Order equipment.

535
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,000
Get loans.

536
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,470
Let the people from the Northeast work for us.

537
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,670
We can have our steel mill.

538
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,540
But

539
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,190
I may not be able to see it.

540
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,219
You will.

541
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,870
I have to thank you

542
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,750
for taking me so far,

543
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,370
so that I can have so many things

544
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,949
to recall.

545
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,840
When I think about it,

546
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,370
I'm not afraid of death anymore.

547
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,210
Stop talking and take a break.

548
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,160
Zhou Qian is waiting for me outside.

549
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,360
Fatty,

550
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,540
I left her some money.

551
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,200
She's a nice person.

552
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,490
Don't give her a hard time.

553
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:37,970
Okay.

554
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,250
I'll order equipment, take out a loan

555
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,770
and build a steel factory.

556
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,360
Live well.

557
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,760
You must see it.

558
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,730
[Intensive Care Unit]

559
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,620
Was he in good spirits just now?

560
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,130
Thank you for your hard work.

561
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,180
He hasn't been this well for a week.

562
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,320
You took good care of him.

563
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,220
He knew about the fact you hired me.

564
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,360
He's only awake two or three hours a day.

565
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,120
The window never opens.

566
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,230
I have to stay here.

567
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:11,780
Do you think

568
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,420
I'm having a good time every day?

569
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,810
I know it's hard for you.

570
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,620
How about

571
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,120
me finding someone else to replace you?

572
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,290
Why?

573
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,040
Who could take better care of him than me?

574
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,800
It's not that I haven't seen a man before.

575
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,300
I was sent out to date men as a fraud.

576
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,680
Someone said they liked me

577
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,050
and wanted to marry me.

578
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,700
They even asked me to meet their parents.

579
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,160
Do you understand?

580
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,520
It's not that I'm not wanted.

581
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,510
I...

582
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,340
I was...

583
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,720
I was just afraid of being arrested by the police.

584
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,920
But I had a good time the rest of the time.

585
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,550
If I hadn't done it for the money, I wouldn't have come

586
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,950
and I wouldn't have fallen in love.

587
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,430
Xu Banxia,

588
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,490
you made me fall in love.

589
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,490
And now you're telling me that this person will die soon.

590
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,880
You... you... you...

591
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,370
What a bunch of trash!

592
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,090
You…

593
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,050
How do you expect me to live?

594
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,190
If he's gone, what should I do?

595
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,180
Where do you want me to go?

596
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,430
I'm watching the man I just fell in love with

597
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,540
get closer to death every day.

598
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,250
I might as well be living in hell.

599
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,520
I'm sorry.

600
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,710
I didn't know you…

601
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,390
Go away.

602
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,020
Go away.

603
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,820
Go away.

604
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,190
I'm here to pay for the ICU of Chen Yuzhou.

605
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,300
Sister.

606
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:47,740
You're coming.

607
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,620
He is less and less awake.

608
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,520
Sometimes he couldn't say a few words for a long time.

609
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,210
Sister.

610
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,770
Do we still need to pay Mr. Zhao next month?

611
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,380
He actually hasn't left for the past half month.
