[Episode 10]

4
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,729
-Mr. Zhao. -You came alone?

5
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,259
Busy man.

6
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,610
I finally see you.

7
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,740
I wanted to visit you after the Chinese New Year.

8
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,650
But you rich man didn't want to see me.

9
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,930
It was I, a debtor, who was looking for you.

10
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,740
How is it?

11
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,919
I brought back 50,000 tons.

12
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,340
Do you know what the steel price is now?

13
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,470
1,200.

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,540
With my quality,

15
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,860
I dare to take 1,400.

16
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,640
Take a look.

17
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,430
The costs of the pile of steel

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,079
I brought back

19
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,010
are 735 yuan per ton.

20
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,270
According to today's price,

21
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,010
which is 700 yuan per ton,

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,260
I'll lose 35 yuan per ton.

23
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
I have 50,000 tons.

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,110
Then I'll lose 1.75 million yuan.

25
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,750
Mr. Zhao.

26
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,900
You won't accept the steel based on today's quote,

27
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,520
will you?

28
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,060
According to the contract,

29
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,420
you did lose money.

30
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,120
Then can we slow the speed down?

31
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,770
I really can't afford it.

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,950
Maybe one day the steel price will come back.

33
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,590
Not necessarily.

34
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,920
You know our business depends on Nature.

35
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,260
If there was a war,

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,760
you'd be a billionaire.

37
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,490
The steel price will go up.

38
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,460
But according to the current situation,

39
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,070
unless there is a big adjustment to policy,

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,100
the trend is that the steel price will go down.

41
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,530
Let's discuss it.

42
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,140
Can you help me?

43
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,950
Accept the steel based on my purchase price.

44
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,810
As long as I can break even,

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,900
735 yuan per ton,

46
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll sell it right away.

47
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,020
I'll take it all for nothing.

48
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,300
I won't make money for my hard work either.

49
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,579
Have you ever thought

50
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,850
if I sign it at this price,

51
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,100
how can I explain it to my company?

52
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,430
Have you thought about it?

53
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,970
I'm not here to force you.

54
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,230
I just want to tell you

55
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,230
you must be mentally prepared

56
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,660
for the current situation.

57
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,850
I can hold on for you for a few more days.

58
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,340
But

59
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,680
I can't hold on for you for a long time.

60
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,780
You have to think carefully

61
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,140
what to do next.

62
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,320
Miss Xu.

63
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,900
Miss Xu, have a seat.

64
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,060
Although it's late,

65
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,700
I still have to express New Year's greetings.

66
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,760
Happy New Year.

67
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,860
Thanks to Mr. Guo,

68
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,860
I spent the New Year in a detention center.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,270
Don't you know that?

70
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,230
Miss Xu.

71
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,220
You must have misunderstood me.

72
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,530
It really wasn't me.

73
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,640
Qiu.

74
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,700
Besides, you still owe me one million yuan.

75
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,340
I have no motive for doing that.

76
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,670
Right?

77
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,010
Miss Xu, the New Year is over.

78
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,670
Let's talk about business.

79
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,920
When will you return the one million yuan

80
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,659
you owe me?

81
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,470
You're in need of money right after the New Year?

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,890
Don't worry.

83
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,650
That one million yuan will be repaid with interest.

84
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,300
That's a lot.

85
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,450
30 percent.

86
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:52,840
Enough, Miss Xu.

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,820
We all know how much the steel price in China

88
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,060
went down.

89
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,750
There's no need to beat around the bush.

90
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,500
You don't want to pay back the money,

91
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,740
because you don't want to give up your steel.

92
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,400
You want to shoulder it, right?

93
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,460
You want to wait until the steel price to go up.

94
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,840
I want to ask Mr. Guo.

95
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,450
How long do you think the difficult time of the steel price

96
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,580
will last?

97
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,740
To be honest, Miss Xu,

98
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,310
based on the current situation, I think

99
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,980
in recent months,

100
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,970
steel is overstocked.

101
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,370
The consumption is suspended and the steel markets are oversupplied.

102
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,240
So, Miss Xu,

103
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,390
it might last from six months to a year.

104
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,850
If you're unlucky,

105
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,220
it might last for more than a year.

106
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,240
Are you trying to scare me?

107
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,540
Miss Xu.

108
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,950
Do I have to scare you?

109
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,080
Take a step back.

110
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,680
Half a year.

111
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,750
Can you shoulder it?

112
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,760
So let's talk

113
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
about my one million yuan.

114
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,260
Fine.

115
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,659
What do you want? Tell me.

116
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,390
I'll be frank then.

117
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,480
According to my judgment,

118
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,590
if I wait for your interest,

119
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,530
I might have to wait until you go bankrupt.

120
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,980
So I changed my mind.

121
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,090
I remember

122
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,660
the scrap steel you imported

123
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,040
from the Black Sea

124
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,610
is 350 yuan per ton,

125
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:13,970
right?

126
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,890
At this price,

127
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,510
the one million yuan you owe me

128
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,140
is equivalent to

129
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,380
2,800 tons of scrap steel.

130
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,790
I don't want the interest either.

131
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,300
You don't need to give me the scrap steel in a hurry.

132
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,230
You can give it to me

133
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,100
whenever you want.

134
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,640
It's like my investment.

135
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,460
I cooperate with you.

136
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,560
But the premise is

137
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,150
my cost price is 350 yuan.

138
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,900
Are you robbing me, Mr. Guo?

139
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,100
I pay for the shipping

140
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,250
and tax by myself, right?

141
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,400
Mr. Guo, if you talk like this,

142
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,100
we won't be able to negotiate.

143
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,900
Of course.

144
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,100
if you don't agree,

145
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,640
you can choose to pay back the money now.

146
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,560
But you have to pay the interest.

147
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,290
Miss Xu, I'll be frank with you.

148
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,950
I asked you here today

149
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,950
because I want to confirm something with you.

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,660
Will you choose to shoulder it

151
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,090
or give up the steel?

152
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,340
Mr. Guo, forget about the investment.

153
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,429
I don't accept it.

154
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,010
I'll repay the loan, as well as the interest.

155
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,100
I'll shoulder it.

156
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,500
Boss, what's wrong?

157
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,530
How is your team?

158
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,910
We've agreed on the salary.

159
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,850
We can shoulder it together.

160
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,070
You didn't want to hire unsavoury people.

161
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,290
But they're loyal.

162
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,400
They're not like you businessmen

163
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
who usually turn against each other.

164
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,740
Sign this.

165
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,290
Why don't you take a look?

166
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,340
What's there to see?

167
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,260
Why are you looking for me?

168
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,320
Chen and I have discussed it.

169
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,420
We'll withdraw the shares of the truck team

170
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,300
from the company.

171
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,930
You'll be in charge of the whole truck team.

172
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,950
You're independent now.

173
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,000
Your team doesn't belong to the company anymore.

174
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,070
If the company uses your team,

175
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,440
we'll pay for it.

176
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,740
What do you mean?

177
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,590
Is this what the contract I signed is about?

178
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,220
No.

179
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,980
So you kicked me out.

180
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,120
You don't want me to shoulder it, right?

181
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,410
No way. Either shoulder it together

182
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,630
or die together.

183
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,040
We agreed to be tied together.

184
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,640
What if we can't shoulder it one day?

185
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,630
Why?

186
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,250
What if the construction costs,

187
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:07,940
storage costs,

188
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,450
and other costs of the storage yard

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,530
can't be paid one day?

190
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,030
If our company is sued

191
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,970
and the court take compulsory execution,

192
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,250
your team,

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
which belongs to the company,

194
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,870
will definitely be confiscated.

195
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,830
We don't want you to be implicated.

196
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,330
We also want you to start your own business

197
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,460
and make money yourself.

198
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,540
You can have your bread and butter.

199
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,140
If Chen and I

200
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,300
can't pay for dinner one day,

201
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,590
we can go to your place.

202
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,780
Do you understand?

203
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,110
Fine. I'll listen to you.

204
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,050
I've signed the contract anyway.

205
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,660
But I only have one condition.

206
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,250
If anything happens, we three will shoulder it together.

207
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,140
OK?

208
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,160
OK.

209
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,570
Did Foreigner

210
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,120
force you?

211
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,490
No, he didn't.

212
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,220
If he had forced me,

213
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,380
I would have lost hope.

214
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,890
Then what are you afraid of?

215
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,860
By the way, the 150,000 yuan...

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,700
Don't worry about it.

217
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,500
I'll handle it. Don't worry.

218
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,240
How will you handle it?

219
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,070
With my charm.

220
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,960
She likes me.

221
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,050
Besides, I remember it.

222
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,080
When we have money,

223
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,020
we can repay her.

224
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,300
Repay her with the interest.

225
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,870
We are really brothers.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,850
Both of us are shameless.

227
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,260
Why should we feel ashamed?

228
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,540
What exactly is the 24,500,000

229
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,020
about?

230
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,140
I didn't expect this to happen.

231
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,460
The finance department told me

232
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,170
there was no contract

233
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,750
while transferring the money.

234
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,810
We are a foreign invested enterprise.

235
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,400
You can't do whatever you want.

236
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,220
This is illegal.

237
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,810
Steve.

238
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,900
In my employment contract,

239
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,390
it clearly states that I have this right.

240
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,100
If you think it's illegal,

241
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,050
please help yourself.

242
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,440
I don't understand.

243
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,510
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

244
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,500
Why are you so confident?

245
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,850
I have my own judgment.

246
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,290
The raw materials of scrap steel in China...

247
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,540
The raw materials of scrap steel in China

248
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:21,940
are few.

249
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,250
And the price is so high.

250
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,940
There are cheap ones in the international market.

251
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,960
Why not buy them?

252
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,870
I'll be responsible for my decision.

253
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,900
Of course, you can

254
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,940
report it to the headquarters.

255
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,820
This is your right.

256
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,230
Buy them all at the market price.

257
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,110
This is my suggestion.

258
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,470
Thank you for your suggestion.

259
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,170
If there's nothing else...

260
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,940
As you've seen, my friend is here.

261
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,630
Okay.

262
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,350
Come in.

263
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,100
Mr. Zhao.

264
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,720
What's up?

265
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,990
I brought you a leather jacket

266
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,190
from the north.

267
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,960
Do you want to try it on?

268
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,630
Yes, I do.

269
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,790
Thank you.

270
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,370
Sorry for the trouble I've caused.

271
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,820
You have good taste.

272
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,820
The leather jacket is of good quality.

273
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,250
I'm thinking

274
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,610
if I sell the steel at a low price,

275
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,950
will you have less pressure?

276
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,130
That's a good idea.

277
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,570
But if you sell it,

278
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,680
what will you do? Have you thought about it?

279
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,250
I...

280
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:56,810
I...

281
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,400
I have a storage yard.

282
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,790
I have a truck team.

283
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,460
Do I look good in it?

284
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,270
Yes.

285
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,380
The trucks of your team

286
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,250
are shabby.

287
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,870
How long will it take

288
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,090
to recoup your loss with those trucks?

289
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,980
And the storage yard.

290
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,290
Now the steel price is low.

291
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,810
What can be stored in your storage yard?

292
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,420
Don't worry about me.

293
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,980
No matter what happens,

294
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,150
my life will be better than yours.

295
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,590
I heard from President Gao

296
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,500
that it is the trend that within these 5 years,

297
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,380
the international steel price will be reduced every year.

298
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,210
Trend?

299
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,860
If you believe in the trend,

300
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,920
don't do business.

301
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,890
I just want to relieve your stress.

302
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,810
Are we dating?

303
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,620
Of course not.

304
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,310
OK.

305
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,610
I hope you won't be emotionally involved

306
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,410
in our next conversation.

307
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
I treat you as my cooperator.

308
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
I respect and trust you.

309
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,140
I hope you can do the same.

310
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,590
I didn't become emotionally involved.

311
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm also talking from the perspective of a cooperator.

312
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,420
You trusted me and helped me.

313
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,500
If I can save a person from the water,

314
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,820
of course I hope

315
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,460
the person I saved was you.

316
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,580
I treat you as my cooperator.

317
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,720
I invested money.

318
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,820
One part is an advance payment,

319
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,700
and the other is the loan.

320
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,140
Of course,

321
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,740
there are some conditions

322
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,880
which are unfair to you.

323
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,810
Now I'm reaping what I sow.

324
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,220
I'm stuck in the market.

325
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,140
You too, right?

326
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,730
Yes. And then?

327
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,460
We need to find a way.

328
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,660
The only way now

329
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,130
is to wait

330
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,460
until the market becomes better.

331
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,300
I believe in my judgement.

332
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,850
I hope you can be confident and patient

333
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,980
instead of coming here

334
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,090
to show off your loyalty.

335
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,190
You think too much.

336
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,700
What did I show off?

337
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,850
We're cooperators,

338
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,560
so I think of you.

339
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,600
So,

340
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,790
you gave me

341
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,940
the emperor's new clothes?

342
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,650
I'm kinder than the emperor.

343
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,960
Tell me, what should we do?

344
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,200
Who has a way?

345
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,550
We finally get together.

346
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,600
We can't break up like this.

347
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,380
The trucks are still here.

348
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,290
Find a way to find a job.

349
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,200
Why don't we tie people up?

350
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,040
Boss, that boss came to me again.

351
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:29,890
He said yes.

352
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,570
Go on.

353
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,220
Boss, you have to think like this.

354
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,710
Is there a good person there?

355
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,110
The one who owes money is not a good person.

356
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,060
If we do this,

357
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,040
we'll do a good thing.

358
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,580
Those who owe money

359
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,280
live a comfortable life.

360
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,980
We haven't got anything

361
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,860
after these months' work.

362
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,710
Boss, it's not easy to be a good man.

363
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,300
Plunger, you're wrong.

364
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,960
You're doing a good work here.

365
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,740
Boss hasn't said anything yet.

366
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,020
What's the rush?

367
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,740
Look, what's the use

368
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,859
of these shabby trucks?

369
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,660
Listen.

370
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,270
Do you believe I'll kill you?

371
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,660
No.

372
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,140
He was talking nonsense. Don't do it.

373
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,780
Plunger, I'm warning you.

374
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,940
If you ever mention this again,

375
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,010
get out of the team.

376
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,670
Don't say you know me.

377
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,360
Behave well.

378
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,970
Leave here.

379
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,060
Leave here.

380
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,990
Who sued me?

381
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,860
Guo Qidong.

382
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,730
He is sick.

383
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,840
What's the use of looking for him now?

384
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,940
Listen to Attorney Zhang first.

385
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,460
Miss Xu, calm down.

386
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,980
I know

387
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,920
your company's current situation.

388
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,820
Think carefully.

389
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,470
If you have to go to court,

390
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:10,960
do you have money to pay

391
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,100
if you lose?

392
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,740
If not,

393
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,550
this batch of steel is your company property,

394
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,320
so it will be auctioned by the court.

395
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,840
Once it is auctioned openly,

396
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,380
other creditors

397
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,220
besides Guo Qidong

398
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,480
may ask for a lawsuit

399
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,700
and seizure

400
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,730
in order to protect their property.

401
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,790
At that time, I'm afraid your situation

402
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,390
will be worse than now.

403
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,660
You're only facing

404
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,600
Guo Qidong now.

405
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,990
But if things get to that point,

406
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:42,930
you will face

407
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,260
all the creditors.

408
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,870
You can't

409
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,490
stop it now.

410
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,670
This is just the beginning.

411
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,150
Is there any other way?

412
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,810
My suggestion is

413
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,400
no matter what

414
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,550
Guo Qidong requests,

415
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,300
you have to satisfy him.

416
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,530
Let him withdraw the lawsuit first.

417
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:04,850
Miss Xu.

418
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,970
Let me give you an example.

419
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,550
If you have to cut flesh,

420
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,000
do you want to do it yourself

421
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,520
or let the other person do it?

422
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
What you need to do now

423
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,660
is to put all the creditors

424
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
in order.

425
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,820
Fatty.

426
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,220
Miss Xu.

427
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,620
Fatty.

428
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,100
Miss Xu.

429
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,720
Fatty. Fatty.

430
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,700
What's wrong, Miss Xu?

431
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,220
Fatty.

432
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,780
Miss Xu.

433
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,590
Can you see me clearly?

434
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,910
Yes.

435
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,790
What happened?

436
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,270
Hypoglycemia.

437
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,420
You must not eat well again.

438
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,700
And palpitations.

439
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,780
Do you have to

440
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,730
faint from hunger?

441
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,750
Lie down.

442
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,210
Chen, don't stop her.

443
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,200
See if she can get up.

444
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,170
She didn't get enough sleep.

445
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,780
She didn't eat well and was under great pressure.

446
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,220
According to traditional Chinese medicine,

447
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,410
you've lost a lot of qi.

448
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,930
There's a deficiency of both blood and qi.

449
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,030
I've discussed it with Su.

450
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,780
We'll get you a bed to let you rest for two days.

451
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,400
She should be hospitalized for further observation.

452
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,590
I've written it down.

453
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,440
Lie down.

454
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,270
Stay here for a week.

455
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,100
I won't stay in hospital.

456
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,150
I have to go home.

457
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,530
Why?

458
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,880
I have a lot to do in the company.

459
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,720
If I stay in hospital,

460
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,370
people will think I'm hiding.

461
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,860
Can you find a solution if you don't hide?

462
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,000
Solutions can be found.

463
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,550
Kuan.

464
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,870
Your platelets are so low.

465
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,660
Do you know that?

466
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
You're wearing makeup now.

467
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,140
Go home and wash your face.

468
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,060
Look at yourself.

469
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,530
What's wrong with staying in hospital for a few days?

470
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,420
Listen to me.

471
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,770
Pull it out.

472
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:11,900
Will you pull it out or not?

473
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,690
Do you think I own the hospital

474
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,490
so you can come and leave as you like?

475
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,070
Do you want to die?

476
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,780
Is your life yours?

477
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,240
Tell me.

478
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,560
Xu Banxia.

479
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,930
I've never seen someone like you.

480
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,150
You're too proud.

481
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,060
What problems can be solved

482
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,980
if you go home now?

483
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,900
Why are you so stubborn?

484
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:42,730
Doctor Su.

485
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,280
You can't walk anymore, right?

486
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,800
Take a rest.

487
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,880
Don't stay with me.

488
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,140
Get back to work.

489
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm on the night shift today.

490
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,740
It's your turn.

491
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,340
I'm sorry.

492
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,090
What are you doing?

493
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:19,900
A pair of three.

494
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,420
Mr. Wang, this is for you.

495
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,860
Get me some water.

496
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,100
Coming.

497
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,290
Hurry up.

498
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,180
Who wants water?

499
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,410
I've waited a long time.

500
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,280
Here.

501
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,380
I owe him 900 yuan.

502
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,230
I owe him 1,600 yuan.

503
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I haven't paid it back yet.

504
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,420
I know you are unhappy,

505
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,860
but it's useless to glare at me.

506
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,860
Our company has been investigated by the court.

507
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,270
We have nothing left.

508
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,160

Doesn't the house belong to us now?

611
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,840
Yes.

612

But the steel there is cheap.

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,530
About the matter of borrowing money last time,

680
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,780
I was wrong.

681
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,620
I apologize to you.

682
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,900
Let's eat first.

683
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,870
Thank you.

684
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,740
Sit down and eat with me.

685
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,580
I'll go get some food.

686
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,580
I haven't eaten in the canteen for a long time.

687
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,210
It smells good.

688
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,310
Mom.

689
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,040
Tong has something to tell you.

690
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,730
Auntie.

691
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,370
Gao Xinyi.

692
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,010
I can't even eat

693
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,910
when I see you.

694
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,740
Look at you.

695
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,100
You're fiddling around.

696
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,580
You hang out with some unemployed men

697
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,140
every day.

698
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,270
I'm not talking about you.

699
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,550
Did you study for nothing?

700
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,430
You don't want to work.

701
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,380
You don't want to get a master degree either.

702
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,350
Why are you eating so well?

703
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,210
Fine. I failed to educate my daughter well, OK?

704
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,360
I admit it.

705
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,310
Tell me, what do you want?

706
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,310
What's the benefit of pissing me off?

707
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,110
Oh, there's a benefit.

708
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,440
Both of us can be relieved

709
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,910
if we can't see each other anymore.

710
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,400
Right?

711
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,940
Mom, do you have to...

712
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,580
What mom?

713
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,610
What do you want to say?

714
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,890
Auntie, here's the thing.

715
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,230
I have 15 Dongfeng trucks.

716
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,090
I have a truck team.

717
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,450
And

718
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,320
the drivers are all veterans.

719
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
They are all experienced.

720
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,820
So I want to ask

721
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,420
if there's any job

722
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,270
my team can do?

723
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,860
You don't work

724
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,120
with Xu Banxia now?

725
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,150
No.

726
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,500
The truck team is independent now.

727
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,140
My boss was worried

728
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,020
the team would be affected by the company.

729
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,270
So we split away.

730
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,010
I also think that if the truck team can make money,

731
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,030
we can help the company repay the money.

732
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,980
You're quite loyal, aren't you?

733
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,120
Zhang, please come here.

734
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,890
In our company,

735
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,040
there's a department which is in charge of the vehicles.

736
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,500
Just contact her.

737
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:51,940
Okay.

738
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,550
Also,

739
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,860
come to me alone if you need anything.

740
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,080
Don't bring her along.

741
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,400
Business is business.

742
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,770
Okay, President Gao.

743
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,800
I'm speechless.

744
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,660
It's easy for her to help you.

745
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,860
But she had to scold me.

746
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,940
It's because you're with an unemployed man.

747
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,420
Eat.

748
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,320
Here you are.

749
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,250
I have so much.

750
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,080
Help yourself.

751
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,780
Eat more.

752
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,980
What happened to your face?

753
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:34,950
It was bumped.

754
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,260
Who did it?

755
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,500
It's nothing.

756
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,270
Don't worry about me.

757
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,690
Tell me if you need anything.

758
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,100
I have to go back to the storage yard.

759
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,680
The debt collectors beat you in the storage yard?

760
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,700
Did you fight?

761
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,330
What are you thinking?

762
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,990
I drink tea with them

763
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,160
in the office every day.

764
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,160
We're friends now.

765
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,910
Really?

766
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,320
We play cards together.

767
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,700
How are your parents?

768
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,200
Is everything okay at home?

769
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,690
I fell out with them this time.

770
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,840
I pledged the house.

771
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,350
I used all the treasury bonds and pensions

772
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,000
they saved.

773
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,830
But it's okay. I'm prepared.

774
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,890
At worst, I'll go back

775
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,180
and kneel down

776
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,180
when the problems are solved.

777
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,290
Enough, stop asking me.

778
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,050
You have so many creditors.

779
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,050
Can you handle them?

780
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,320
I have ten holes waiting for me to fill.

781
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,350
I wish I had nine lids.

782
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,340
But I only have three lids.

783
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,660
What can I do?

784
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,300
But you have to hurry up and deal with

785
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,780
the rent of the land in the village.

786
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,650
As soon as possible.

787
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,780
What's wrong?

788
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,470
Nothing. Don't worry. I'll handle it.

789
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,260
The court only confiscated the stocks in the storage yard.

790
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,860
The land use rights

791
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,620
are still ours.

792
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,929
When the lawsuit is over,

793
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:11,860
I hope we can still have the land.

794
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,940
Have you decided

795
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,150
to sell the steel we imported?

796
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,730
Mr. Zhao said there's still a chance to rebound.

797
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,040
Let's not sell the goods now.

798
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,460
I trust him.

799
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:31,650
What about you?

800
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,719
Did you know something happened to Mr. Zhao?

801
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:37,540
What happened?

802
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:38,920
He was demoted.

803
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,810
Will you call him?

804
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,920
What should I say to him?

805
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,159
Be sorry for him

806
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,250
and pity him?

807
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,060
We have the same personality.

808
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,590
He doesn't like to be pitied at this time.

809
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,300
Forget it.

810
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,400
Fine.

811
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,340
You trust him.

812
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,160
I trust you.

813
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,330
I'm going back to the storage yard.

814
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,820
When I recover,

815
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
I'll take your shift.

816
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,690
You can't do it alone.

817
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,370
All right. Rest assured.

818
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:27,960
I'm leaving.

819
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,130
Add some oil.

820
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,530
Be careful.

821
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,000
How is it?

822
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,600
It's done.

823
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,240
Hurry up. Let's go.

824
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,700
Okay.

825
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,220
Stop it.

826
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,990
Get in the truck or you'll catch a cold.

827
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,550
No.

828
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,380
I want to share weal and woe with you.

829
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,100
Stop it.

830
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,380
I want to help you.

831
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,470
Hurry up.

832
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,110
I'll go first.

833
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,430
Okay.

834
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,580
Be careful.

835
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,500
Come on, get in the truck.

836
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,420
One, two, three.

837
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,750
Are you cold?

838
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:29,110
Why are you following me?

839
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,130
It's hard and tiring.

840
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,520
I'm willing to do it.

841
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,060
My mom pitied you

842
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,160
and arranged it for me.

843
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,370
I have to supervise you.

844
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,580
Besides,

845
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,260
you still owe me money.

846
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,600
Fine, I'll even give myself to you.

847
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,250
♫Your gentle sweetness♫

848
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,740
♫Is like a bird flying in the sky♫

849
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,520
♫It's only because♫

850
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:57,160
♫We love and hug each other♫

851
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,260
♫Your eyes♫

852
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,350
♫My tears♫

853
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,120
♫It's precious even if it's painful♫

854
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,650
♫It's only because♫

855
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:11,810
♫You're by my side♫

856
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,980
I envy Xu Banxia.

857
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,210
When can you

858
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,530
work so hard for me?

859
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,510
♫I said I only have you in my eyes♫

860
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,580
You can tell me when you need me.

861
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,980
♫You're the only one I can't forget♫

862
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:19,940
Really?

863
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,300
Anytime.

864
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,360
♫Spend every night♫

865
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,180
♫And every day♫

866
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,820
♫I'll be by your side to protect you♫

00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,480
♫I said I only have you in my eyes♫

868
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,940
♫You're the only one I can't forget♫

869
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,840
What are you doing? I'm driving. Stop it.

870
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,050
It's none of your business. You said 'anytime'.

871
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,330
♫Spend every night♫

872
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,140

♫You're a miracle in my life♫

876
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,780
See? I told you to stay still.

877
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:48,690
Does it hurt?

878
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,500
♫I hope we can move the sky♫

879
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,290
No, it doesn't.

880
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,420
♫And move the earth♫

881
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,180
♫Let us be together forever♫

882
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,360
Sit tight.

883
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,890
♫Never be apart♫

884
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,560
♫I said I only have you in my eyes♫

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:10,480
♫You're a miracle in my life♫

♫Never be apart♫

890
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,940
Zhao Lei.

891
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,390
How is it going over there?

892
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,560
Can you wait?

893
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,760
Are you in a hurry?

894
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,020
Nothing.

895
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,750
I'm calling you to see how you are now.

896
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,570
Don't always act like there's a disaster.

897
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,820
If the sky fell, there would be a tall person to withstand it.

898
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,420
I'm the tall person.

899
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,500
Whether you're telling the truth or not,

900
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,630
I'm really grateful

901
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,700
for what you said.

902
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,860
I've talked to the legal and finance departments

903
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,080
of my company.

904
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,010
They are all my subordinates.

905
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,390
I handled the project.

906
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,660
I signed the contract.

907
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,740
In this project,

908
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,080
I didn't get any money.

909
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,390
So I'm not afraid of their investigation.

910
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,420
But

911
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,090
they might call you

912
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,610
to confirm something.

913
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,340
Don't be nervous.

914
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,010
Just tell them the truth.

915
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,990
Sorry for the trouble.

916
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,830
I know you're under great pressure.

917
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm trying my best to find a solution.

918
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,480
Don't worry. I'll hang in there.

919
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,160
People are under pressure no matter what they do.

920
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,700
I'm calling you

921
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,060
to tell you

922
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,500
this deal is right.

923
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,650
The international steel price

924
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,350
is going to drop below the cost price.

925
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,920
There are saturation problems in Europe and America.

926
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,740
But everything in China has just begun.

927
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,060
This is an opportunity, understand?

928
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,860
Yes.

929
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,540
That table is south-facing.

930
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,440
I'll take that table.

931
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,080
Only this table is left.

932
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,440
Are you busy?

933
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,200
Isn't he afraid of death?

934
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,440
Are you busy?

935
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,420
Go on.

936
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,010
You caught a lot of fish today.

937
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,480
Go inside.

938
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,670
Take them away.

939
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,060
I'm here to talk to the village chief. I brought some gifts.

940
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,540
Don't take them away.

941
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,190
We can eat together, chief.

942
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,150
Give us back the land.

943
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,140
If they beat you again later,

944
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,830
I can't stop them.

945
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,700
Don't stop them.

946
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,600
I just greeted them.

947
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,490
I'm here to send gifts to the village chief.

948
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,430
Let's go out and talk. Let's go.

949
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,890
Don't fight now. Find another place.

950
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,930
Don't be splashed with blood.

951
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,590
I'll talk to the village chief.

952
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,680
This road.

953
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,040
Are you shameless?
