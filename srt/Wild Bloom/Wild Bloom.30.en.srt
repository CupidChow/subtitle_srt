[Episode 30]

4
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,470
Why are you here?

5
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,280
We're here to see Mr. Wu

6
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,750
and talk to him.

7
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,620
What can you talk about?

8
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,509
Why bother?

9
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,729
There's a saying that nothing is more lamentable than a dead heart.

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,380
Everyone is in trouble.

11
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,530
He's looking for a scapegoat now.

12
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,630
Listen to me. Leave now.

13
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,680
Leave. Don't come.

14
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,740
On the surface,

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,560
he is good-tempered,

16
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,070
but he's actually as stubborn

17
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,830
as cattle.

18
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,540
He might listen to you when things go smoothly.

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,329
In this situation,

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,410
you really can't go to him.

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,530
Are you going or not?

22
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,079
Let's go. Let's meet Mr. Wu first.

23
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,520
Don't bother. Listen to me.

24
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,940
Boss.

25
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,890
They're here.

26
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:58,990
Mr. Wu.

27
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,240
You are really something.

28
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,540
-You even found this place. -Mr. Wu.

29
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,020
Come here.

30
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,030
Since you're here,

31
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,700
I'll show you around.

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,810
Xu, let me test you.

33
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,170
Do you know what they are?

34
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,170
They are the accessories for electronics.

35
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,870
They're used in televisions or refrigerators.

36
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,490
When we open refrigerators,

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,180
the lights are on.

38
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,480
They're controlled by them.

39
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,880
They're precise.

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,600
Good job.

41
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,310
You really learned abroad.

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,660
You know them well.

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,010
I got the equipment

44
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,380
from Germany.

45
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,890
It's definitely the original.

46
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,070
The metal that they have processed

47
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,160
is the result of technology.

48
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,070
No matter the standard

49
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,960
or the technology of metal stamping parts,

50
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,300
they're connected to the international criteria.

51
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,610
This is what I have now.

52
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,220
It's also the livelihood of the whole village.

53
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,500
When I was living a wonderful life,

54
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,800
I built this factory.

55
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,850
I didn't expect it would become my way out today.

56
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,730
Mr. Wu,

57
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,160
you really don't want your steel mill?

58
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,290
Mr. Wu.

59
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,600
I've thought about

60
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,810
what you told me before.

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,500
I was thoughtless last time.

62
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,650
I didn't take the overall situation into consideration.

63
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,210
Now I'm willing to accept your offer

64
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,610
and accept your mill.

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,540
Let's find a way

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,940
to pay off all the debts of your mill.

67
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,830
You're really a scrap dealer.

68
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,610
You dare to take such big scrap?

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,950
But now,

70
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,990
these things have nothing to do with me anymore.

71
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,540
The steel mill

72
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,230
can go bankrupt.

73
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,670
Take it back if they want.

74
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,620
The police can arrest me if they want.

75
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,930
I'm ready

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,470
to go to jail.

77
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:02,890
Mr. Wu.

78
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,180
We came here

79
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,280
because we want to discuss a solution with you.

80
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,500
Do you have to destroy yourself and people around you?

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,340
I don't know if I'll influence others.

82
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,300
I'm dead meat anyway.

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,660
I didn't expect that among the five people who went to the north,

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,040
one is in prison,

85
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,200
one is in the cowshed,

86
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,900
one went into liquidation,

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,890
and another one was sued.

88
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,360
And now

89
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,220
Feng Yu lives the best instead.

90
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,130
Maybe this is the fate.

91
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,580
Since you mentioned the five of us,

92
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,670
as the eldest brother,

93
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,270
do you want to see

94
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,730
we end up like this?

95
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,380
You've worked hard for half of your life.

96
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,170
Are you really willing

97
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,610
to accpet it?

98
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,610
What's the use of being unwilling?

99
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,150
All right, let's not talk about this.

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,150
But I didn't expect

101
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,620
you would come here.

102
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,970
It's not easy to come here.

103
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,380
You should stay

104
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,660
to have dinner together.

105
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,250
I'll bring Qiu here too.

106
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,480
Even if it's a farewell dinner,

107
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,600
it should be decent.

108
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,750
It's getting harder and harder to get together.

109
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,120
The last time we gathered

110
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,960
was at Feng Yu's wedding.

111
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,990
These plums

112
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,390
were picked by me one by one.

113
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,630
I made the wine too.

114
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,020
Here, have a taste.

115
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,460
It reminds me of my childhood.

116
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,470
It's harder and harder to find what we had in childhood.

117
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,060
When I was young,

118
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,860
I lived in an air-raid shelter with my parents.

119
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,900
I also chewed the bark.

120
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,000
At that time, I thought

121
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,670
I must get ahead

122
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,140
and let my family live a good life.

123
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,970
I've suffered a lot.

124
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:44,880
But

125
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,740
the more people suffer,

126
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,770
the more respect they want.

127
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,120
They are bold,

128
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,980
but they're afraid of being looked down upon.

129
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,340
I lost my dignity

130
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,530
all of a sudden.

131
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,450
Wu.

132
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,670
I need to explain it to you.

133
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,800
About the matter of the TV station,

134
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,020
I did go too far.

135
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,280
I apologize to you.

136
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,420
But I really didn't want

137
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,140
to let them expose it.

138
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,400
I just wanted to take some photos

139
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,660
to threaten you

140
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,700
and give you some pressure.

141
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,460
Qiu.

142
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,429
You've been in the cowshed for so long,

143
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,650
but you still haven't figured it out.

144
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,450
We've been friends for so many years.

145
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:42,940
Do you know

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,070
what I hate most about you?

147
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,140
You're venal.

148
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:49,890
Yes.

149
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,470
It's justifiable for businessmen.

150
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,220
But I won't do that.

151
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,070
You went too far.

152
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,580
What is this?

153
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,900
Betrayal!

154
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,670
If it had happened in the past,

155
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,540
you would have been considered as a traitor

156
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,920
and would have been shot.

157
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:09,920
Go ahead.

158
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
You can scold me.

159
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll listen. I'll accept it.

160
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,110
But I did persuade you about pollution.

161
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,320
I couldn't persuade you.

162
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,340
I didn't want it

163
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,940
to end up like this.

164
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,870
I had no choice.

165
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I want to live.

166
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,540
I don't want to die.

167
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,130
So you let me die alone.

168
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,710
And you.

169
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,030
If we weren't all in trouble today,

170
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,700
you wouldn't want to help me.

171
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,310
Foreigner.

172
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,520
Tell me the truth.

173
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,040
Did you know

174
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,330
my steel mill would end up like this?

175
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,420
While we were bidding for State No.2 Steel,

176
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,350
I put my cards on the table for you.

177
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,990
But at the scene,

178
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,890
you deliberately raised the price

179
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,530
and forced me to increase my price to 50 million yuan.

180
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,300
You really set a trap for me.

181
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,410
Do you admit it?

182
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,680
You're right, Mr. Wu.

183
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,250
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,580
But you and Miss Xu

185
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,450
were both determined to take over State No.2 Steel.

186
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,750
Who do you think I can stop?

187
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,740
I shouldn't have said it.

188
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,100
They all happened in the past.

189
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,130
It's meaningless to talk about them.

190
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,660
Let's

191
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,500
have a farewell dinner.

192
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,820
Let's go our separate ways

193
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,770
in the future.

194
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:48,990
Mr. Wu.

195
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,360
I apologize to you again.

196
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,300
I just thought about giving up the steel mill,

197
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,590
but I ignored your feelings.

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,880
It was my fault.

199
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,600
But we're here today

200
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,800
to solve the problem.

201
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,200
I don't want things to get worse.

202
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,600
We came here with sincerity.

203
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,380
You still have a solution?

204
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,840
What we want to say

205
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,960
is not just about the steel mill.

206
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,360
Do you know what's the most profitable business now?

207
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,130
What is it?

208
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,340
Real estate.

209
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,390
After Miss Xu got the news in Shanghai,

210
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,890
she took actions when she came back.

211
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,930
She bought a lot of land.

212
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,990
Besides building the steel mill,

213
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,800
there will be a lot left.

214
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,340
Then the rest of the land

215
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,590
will all be used for real estate development.

216
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,560
When the new steel mill is established,

217
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,740
thousands of newcomers will live here.

218
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,900
How many more houses will they need?

219
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,450
You can calculate it.

220
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,620
This land, including the new steel mill.

221
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,020
I'm willing to work with you.

222
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,290
Miss Xu's land

223
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,770
faces the sun and is by the sea.

224
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,090
If we can really use it to develop real estate,

225
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,560
building hotels, villas,

226
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,570
malls and schools,

227
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,670
this is not only land.

228
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,660
This will be a gold mine instead.

229
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,880
Why don't you do

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,800
such a good thing yourself?

231
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,540
Mr. Wu.

232
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,380
I always told you

233
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,640
I wouldn't be where I am today without you.

234
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,040
You are the person I respect the most.

235
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,260
This is the truth.

236
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,140
We've been working hard

237
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,690
all the way here.

238
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,750
Everyone had a good time.

239
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,210
Everyone fell down.

240
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,830
It's hard for all of us.

241
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,900
We've been fighting for so many years.

242
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,750
Who benefited from it?

243
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,270
It didn't do us any good.

244
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,480
So in business,

245
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,240
we should unite.

246
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,450
Uniting can help us make money together. What do you think?

247
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,960
So I think

248
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,810
I will merge the new steel mill,

249
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,760
Yuzhou Steel Plant and your Jian She Steel Mill together.

250
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,000
I own 60% of the shares in this new steel mill.

251
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll give you 25% of the shares.

252
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,340
I'll give Mr. Qiu 10% of the shares.

253
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,400
I'll give Mr. Feng 5% of the shares.

254
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,440
I'll be the head of this new steel mill.

255
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,430
I'll leave all the business management to you.

256
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,820
Mr. Qiu will be in charge of export and sale.

257
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,500
As for the production, I'll leave it to Jia Chang'an.

258
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,040
He's the chief engineer of the new company.

259
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,420
He'll supervise it.

260
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,970
I've thought about your steel mill.

261
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,370
Strip what should be stripped. Sell what should be sold.

262
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,170
Keep what should be kept.

263
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Instead of being old-fashioned,

264
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,000
we'd better move on.

265
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,040
I'll build a railway

266
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,690
to connect

267
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,170
the two steel mills.

268
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,120
Transport raw materials from the old steel mill

269
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,200
and let them be processed in the new steel mill.

270
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,910
Both mills can be used.

271
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,820
Let's not talk about

272
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,330
going our separate ways.

273
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,490
Let's help each other.

274
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,900
From now on, we are family.

275
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,590
Would you like

276
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,870
to share the quota with me?

277
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,300
As you know,

278
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,020
I want 15 thousand tons.

279
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,450
Mr. Qiu,

280
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,900
in the past year,

281
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,420
your mill would decline

282
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,020
without me, right?

283
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,110
I've been good to you all these years.

284
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,780
You can't take advantage of me

285
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,490
while doing this.

286
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,150
As long as you choose the right person,

287
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,110
you'll have the share.

288
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,250
Mr. Qiu,

289
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,170
you still don't know how to do business.

290
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,310
Mr. Wu, I'll go with you.

291
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,180
I can help you carry your bag.

292
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,370
Count me in.

293
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,030
I can get 15 thousand tons.

294
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,990
I can't leave.

295
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,110
I have to get the money back.

296
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:18,980
I don't believe

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,440
there is the only one steel mill here.

298
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,320
There's nothing I can do, Mr. Wu.

299
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,880
If I took over your mill,

300
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,300
I would be in trouble too.

301
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,390
Let's work together.

302
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,890
I will respect every partner of mine.

303
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,700
But the head of the steel mill has to be me.

304
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,960
Cheese!

305
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,380
It seems

306
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
this is not the time for me to retire.

307
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,590
Fine.

308
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,260
I'll work with you young people

309
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,790
to fight again.

310
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,760
Let's drink and don't say anything.

311
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,460
It's all in the drink.

312
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,540
Cheers.

313
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,120
Cheers.

314
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,530
How long?

315
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,510
Not long.

316
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,360
When did you find out?

317
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,460
Two days ago.

318
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,450
Does mom know? What did she say?

319
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,040
She said nothing.

320
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,600
What's your plan?

321
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,560
You don't want it?

322
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,290
What do you think?

323
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,460
Go to bed first.

324
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,940
Mr. Wu, don't see us off.

325
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,500
Go back.

326
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,350
Go.

327
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,690
I'll visit you when I go back to Binhai.

328
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,420
I really can't let you leave like this.

329
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,480
Erzi,

330
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,370
bring two bottles of plum wine

331
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,300
and put them in their car.

332
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,170
-Okay. -No need, Mr. Wu.

333
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,180
Before the new company starts,

334
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,570
I'm still your boss.

335
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,300
I have the final say.

336
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,600
OK.

337
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,350
Thank you. We're leaving.

338
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,860
OK.

339
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,510
Please stay.

340
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:21,890
Zhao Lei.

341
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,940
You made me believe,

342
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,530
step by step,

343
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,650
you are the Mr. Right in my life.

344
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,170
You didn't believe in it till now?

345
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,050
Think about it.

346
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,100
After having you,

347
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,180
my life

348
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,050
had many important turning points.

349
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,470
I have you by my side.

350
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,600
That's why I became better

351
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,980
and more like a woman.

352
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,750
Tell me the truth.

353
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,200
Do you regret

354
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,830
that you met me so late?

355
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,840
No, I don't.

356
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,220
I think this is the best time.

357
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,970
Go to a place with me.

358
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,290
Where is it?

359
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,050
It's a place where you should go.

360
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,000
You're up.

361
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,380
Have breakfast.

362
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,550
Have some milk.

363
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,420
Well,

364
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,420
I'll cook lunch and send it to you.

365
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,120
Don't eat the food in the canteen.

366
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,850
No need.

367
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,300
I'm going to be late.

368
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,260
See you.

369
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,570
Be careful.

370
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,650
Xu.

371
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,470
Xu.

372
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,780
Have you thought about

373
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,240
letting Qian study abroad?

374
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,210
She's too young to study abroad.

375
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,820
She's not young.

376
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,180
The teacher said

377
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,570
we can't let our children lose at the starting line.

378
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,300
I've asked around.

379
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,000
There's a school of music in UK

380
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,250
named Che...

381
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,190
Marx once studied there.

382
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,370
The tuition is 50 thousand yuan a year.

383
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,130
Is 100 thousand yuan enough if we add the fees for food and accommodations?

384
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,330
100 thousand yuan a year?

385
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,430
It's expensive indeed.

386
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,750
Now is the most important time for Qian.

387
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,360
Let me tell you.

388
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,970
Her voice will change soon.

389
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,200
If the teacher is not good,

390
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,270
her voice will be hurt

391
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,440
and her life will thus be ruined.

392
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,840
100 thousand yuan.

393
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,710
Do you know how many prescriptions

394
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,340
I have to give?

395
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,290
Cut the crap.

396
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,270
I know you have money.

397
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,210
Kuan gave it to you.

398
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,970
I don't have money.

399
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,190
If you don't take it out now,

400
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,330
when are you going to take it out?

401
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,180
Dad.

402
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,230
Dad.

403
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:14,870
Kuan.

404
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,070
Who is he?

405
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,090
His name is Zhao Lei.

406
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,490
We're getting married.

407
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,540
I came back to bring him to see you.

408
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,120
This is my dad.

409
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,370
This is Aunt Liu.

410
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,310
Nice to meet you.

411
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,040
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

412
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,760
We didn't prepare anything.

413
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,070
I just made a last-minute decision.

414
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,110
Yes.

415
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,400
So we didn't bring you any gifts.

416
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,140
Well,

417
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,300
you haven't eaten, right?

418
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,160
Make yourself at home.

419
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,230
Help yourself.

420
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,060
Eat more.

421
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,860
Zhao.

422
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,990
What do you do?

423
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,860
I work in a foreign trading company in Shanghai.

424
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,280
Which company?

425
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,450
A Chinese branch of a foreign invested enterprise.

426
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,270
What's your position?

427
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,290
General manager.

428
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,780
General manager?

429
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,990
It's the leader of the company.

430
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,730
I know.

431
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,750
Sort of.

432
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,330
A leader like you

433
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,380
will earn a lot of money a month.

434
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,610
Our salary is not fixed.

435
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,320
It's related to business every month.

436
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,230
I'm not talking about

437
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,150
the highest amount.

438
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,500
I mean what's the monthly salary

439
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,220
you usually get?

440
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,460
Including five social insurances and housing fund,

441
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
he earns 3,860 yuan a month.

442
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,440
Liar.

443
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,940
A leader

444
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,790
of a foreign trading company in Shanghai

445
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,930
only earns a few thousand yuan?

446
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:47,710
Dad,

447
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,620
Zhao Lei came back from abroad.

448
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,010
He cares about privacy.

449
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,900
Don't ask about the salary.

450
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
You came back from abroad?

451
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,980
No wonder

452
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,190
you look different from others.

453
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
Yes. Look.

454
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,180
Why is he so successful?

455
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,750
Yes.

456
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,030
You've been abroad for a long time, right?

457
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,360
President Gao.

458
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,000
I need to take the call. You eat first.

459
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,220
You were abroad, then you...

460
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,140
President Gao.

461
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,700
It's been solved.

462
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,680
Yes.

463
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,890
But there is still something

464
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,980
I want to report to you.

465
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,300
Go and cut some vegetables.

466
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,920
Add another dish for Zhao.

467
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,190
Okay.

468
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,730
Zhao.

469
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,280
We need to talk.

470
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,880
Do you know she was married before?

471
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,600
I know.

472
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,970
Do you know why they divorced?

473
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,100
I know Tong Xiaoqi.

474
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:58,760
How long

475
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,360
have you known each other?

476
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,970
We've known each other for more than three years.

477
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,490
We've been together for over a year.

478
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,370
It's been a long time.

479
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,500
Did she tell you

480
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,680
she doesn't come back often?

481
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,130
They don't get along well.

482
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,500
Uncle,

483
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,090
I know why you named her Banxia.

484
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,210
Okay.

485
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:46,780
Uncle.

486
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,140
Drink to you.

487
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,630
She doesn't come back after taking the call.

488
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,400
I'll go and take a look.

489
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,840
President Gao.

490
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,580
I've made a deal with Wu Jianshe.

491
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,190
Strip the equipment which should be stripped in his mill

492
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,880
and keep what should be kept.

493
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,890
I'll merge his mill with my newly built steel mill.

494
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,090
No dice, Xu Banxia.

495
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,450
That is State No.2 Steel.

496
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,900
Even if its name has been changed,

497
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,200
it's still the foundation of national factories.

498
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,030
You deal with it like this?

499
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,550
No one can take the responsibility.

500
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,360
President Gao.

501
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,900
You know that steel mill.

502
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,020
A lot of equipment has been used for a long time.

503
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,070
It's valueless.

504
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,560
Even if the provincial government took it back and let it be bid again,

505
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,690
who would be willing to bid for it

506
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,830
after knowing Wu Jianshe's matter?

507
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,360
In the end, we still have to emerge it with another mill.

508
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,400
Otherwise, it'll become useless.

509
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,230
You're right.

510
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,810
But this mill has decades of history.

511
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,870
Many people have feelings for it.

512
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,440
If you deal with it rashly,

513
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,750
I'm afraid

514
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,960
you'll face a lot of obstacles.

515
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,230
President Gao, to be honest,

516
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,440
I didn't want to take over it.

517
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,380
But Mr. Wu and I finally reached a consensus.

518
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,870
We'll work together

519
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,240
to run these two mills well.

520
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,720
It's a good thing for us.

521
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,210
And I've stopped for a long time.

522
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,440
Chinese New Year is coming.

523
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,350
After Chinese New Year,

524
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,560
the experts of NDRC will come here to check our work.

525
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,290
I can't wait any longer.

526
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:12,930
This matter

527
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,590
oversteps my authority.

528
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,530
I must report it to my superiors.

529
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:23,820
Fine.

530
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,110
I'll guarantee it.

531
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,410
You

532
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,850
focus on the project.

533
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,890
Nothing can go wrong.

534
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:34,850
I know.

535
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,230
Don't worry.

536
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,000
What are you doing here?

537
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,960
Aren't you eating?

538
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,900
Zhao is a nice person.

539
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,010
He's better than your ex.

540
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,590
You must get along with him.

541
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,510
I think you two are a perfect match.

542
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,700
You noticed it again?

543
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,150
You've only been together for a while.

544
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,250
Why do you think he's nice?

545
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,570
Why can't I tell?

546
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,450
You are my daughter.

547
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,790
I know you like him.

548
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,790
Your dad has been there before.

549
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,590
Fine.

550
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,540
I brought him back for dinner.

551
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,460
Zhao.

552
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,620
Why are you so good?

553
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,570
You are so successful.

554
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,010
People have to study abroad.

555
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,490
Only when people go abroad

556
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,800
can they be successful.

557
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,730
You want me to study abroad

558
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,770
and study further?

559
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,340
I'm talking about your sister.

560
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,980
-Your sister… -You...

561
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,790
-See if the dumplings are ready. -She's at the most critical moment.

562
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,940
The school named...

563
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,610
-Yeah. -School.

564
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,680
I have no choice.

565
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,360
Let me feel Zhao's pulse first.

566
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,350
My dad is a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner.

567
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,130
I was born into a family of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. I'm the fourth generation.

568
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,350
Why didn't you teach me?

569
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,460
You're a girl.

570
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,980
You're in good health.

571
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,250
You have spleen qi deficiency.

572
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,950
Just like her. It's because you're too tired.

573
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,210
But it doesn't matter.

574
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,630
Take some medicine from me.

575
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,580
You'll be fine after drinking it.

576
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,770
It means you're healthy.

577
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,500
By the way,

578
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,890
I heard that you were sued

579
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,850
because of business?

580
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,510
Is that true?

581
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,470
It's not serious.

582
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,500
If I lose, I'll be in jail for three years

583
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,830
and pay a few hundred million yuan.

584
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,770
Are you trying to scare me?

585
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:16,940
Zhao.

586
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,360
Tell me the truth.

587
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,910
How is she now?

588
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,100
She does owe a few hundred million yuan to the bank.

589
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,320
How could this happen?

590
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,140
Why didn't you listen to me?

591
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,420
Isn't it good

592
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,860
to live a stable life?

593
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,260
Why do you want to earn more money?

594
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,650
Why are you so ambitious?

595
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,280
Zhao, let me tell you.

596
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,870
She went to the north to buy steel at the beginning.

597
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,140
Then she built a storage yard

598
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,520
and wanted to buy State No.2 Steel.

599
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,340
Now you see,

600
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,710
she's involved in a lawsuit.

601
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,550
If you lose this case,

602
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,490
can you afford it?

603
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,320
A few hundred million yuan.

604
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:56,520
I...

605
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,920
My blood pressure is high now.

606
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,230
Dad, you're old.

607
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,860
Don't be emotional.

608
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,400
How can I not be emotional?

609
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,270
These things make me unable to sleep.

610
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,990
You know?

611
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,000
Rest assured.

612
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,560
I'll bear everything by myself.

613
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,030
You don't have to worry about me.

614
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,180
I'm your father.

615
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,820
How can I not worry about you?

616
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,830
How can I not worry?

617
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,290
Just like Zhao now.

618
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,750
He's going to marry you.

619
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,380
How can he ignore your business?

620
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,630
Zhao,

621
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,430
we are family now.

622
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,230
So you have to

623
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,450
bear it with her, right?

624
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,940
Uncle, don't worry.

625
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,170
Come back often.

626
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,430
Drive slowly.

627
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,690
Come often.

628
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,110
Don't be too tired.

629
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,990
Do you think 100 thousand yuan a year is enough?

630
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,400
I don't think it's enough.

631
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,880
Why do you always talk about money?

632
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,390
Think about it.

633
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,570
Only tuition fees are not enough.

634
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,100
We also need to pay the food and accommodations, right?

635
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,100
Although you told me in advance

636
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,520
and I was mentally prepared.

637
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,600
But when I saw them,

638
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,480
I think your family

639
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,770
is quite interesting.

640
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,090
Now you know how hard it is for me.

641
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,210
So I'm Banxia.

642
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,210
But now you are mature.

643
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,440
You're no longer poison.

644
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,840
You're medicine.

645
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,330
If I were medicine,

646
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,400
are you sick?

647
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:38,860
Yes.

648
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,570
Lovesickness.

649
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,110
We've finished the procedures.

650
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,300
Then

651
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,840
shall we get to the point?

652
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,830
Zhao Lei.

653
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,910
Before we apply for a marriage license,

654
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,350
let's get a prenuptial agreement.

655
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,570
If you agree,

656
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,590
we can get it before Chinese New Year.

657
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,700
When did you come up with this idea?

658
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,910
Not long.

659
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,840
Why?

660
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,770
Because even if we get married,

661
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,920
I don't want us to be tied together.

662
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,510
Are you worried

663
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,020
that I'll pay off the debts with you in the future?

664
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,980
Or are you afraid that I'll covet your money?

665
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm afraid my ambition

666
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,360
will get you involved again.

667
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,360
Do you think this is implication?

668
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,000
I think so.

669
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,310
If that's the case,

670
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,790
what's the difference

671
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,860
between getting married and not getting married?

672
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,740
The difference is if I hadn't met you,

673
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,170
I would never get married again.

674
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,660
This is my condition.

675
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,880
The money is mine.

676
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,700
The debts are also mine.

677
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,590
These are all mine.

678
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,820
It's none of your business.

679
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,340
I don't want our relationship

680
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,970
to involve any financial factors.

681
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,330
Can you accept it?

682
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,390
No, I can't.

683
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,750
Why?

684
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,340
To be honest,

685
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,970
I think it's too selfish of you to think like that.

686
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,240
Since we chose to get married,

687
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,840
it means we are one.

688
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,960
No matter what happens in the future

689
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,480
or what happened,

690
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,870
we should face it together.

691
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,540
I don't believe it.

692
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,260
I just think

693
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,880
if I am in trouble one day,

694
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,060
I don't want you to get involved too.

695
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,480
If I flew to the sky one day,

696
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,930
I hope you can pull me back in time.

697
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,000
Do you understand?

698
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,120
You're back.

699
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:22,940
Let's eat.

700
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,630
I asked Plunger's wife to bring me

701
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,370
a free-range chicken from the countryside.

702
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,739
I stewed it for two hours.

703
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,330
Drink it while it's warm.

704
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,440
I think

705
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,920
my cooking skills can't be wasted.

706
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,960
Let's see which dishes are better cooked.

707
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,719
Try them.

708
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,400
I'll cook more for you.

709
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,770
Do you want this baby?

710
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,090
You don't want me to go abroad?

711
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,590
Yes.

712
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,120
I want this baby.

713
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,110
I want to be a father.

714
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,680
I've never been well-behaved

715
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,020
in my life.

716
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,090
I never thought

717
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,350
when I could have a home

718
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,810
until I met you.

719
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,190
You are very important to me.

720
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,810
This home is very important to me.

721
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,380
If I can have this baby,

722
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,450
I think this home will be more complete.

723
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,240
I know you have your pursuit

724
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,090
and dreams.

725
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,500
I support you. I really support you.

726
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,700
I just think if it is possible

727
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,170
to pursue your dreams

728
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,260
after the baby is born?

729
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,560
Have you ever thought

730
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,950
if I give birth to it,

731
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,630
I'll be its mother forever.

732
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,560
I haven't known the world well yet.

733
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,120
Tong Xiaoqi,

734
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,620
when can you think for me?

735
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,750
It's time to eat.

736
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,580
Xu Youren, get up.

737
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,370
Are you waiting for someone to feed you?

738
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,450
I'm thinking about something.

739
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,090
What are you thinking about?

740
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,220
Kuan is really getting married this time.

741
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,430
What should we give her?

742
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,770
What do you want to give her?

743
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,380
Give it to me.

744
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,860
She's a big boss now.

745
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,090
We should give her something expensive.

746
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,320
It has to be suited to her identity.

747
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,420
Suited?

748
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,140
Suited to her identity?

749
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,780
We can't meet the standard even if we went bankrupt.

750
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,390
Why don't you sit down?

751
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,500
Slow down. It's hot.

752
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,550
What does she lack?

753
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,360
How would I know?

754
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,340
Well...

755
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,960
Do you know what she lacks?

756
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,890
Have you ever been invited to her mansion?

757
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,700
You don't know what she lacks, right?

758
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,830
I have to go and have a look.

759
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,500
Shame on you.

760
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,460
Did she invite you?

761
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,780
I don't need to be invited.

762
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,770
We're family.

763
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,620
I'm her father.

764
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
Do you know the door number?

765
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,770
Block 4, Yuehu Building Complex.

766
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,650
Which unit?

767
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,450
I'll know when I get there.

768
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,460
Dad, take me with you.

769
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,880
I'll go and check the address.

770
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,530
I'll take you and your mom with me next time.

771
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,080
Don't promise her everything

772
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,090
when you get there.

773
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,050
Think about yourself.

774
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,540
Don't pretend to be rich.

775
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,110
I know myself.

776
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,250
You're going out?

777
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,680
Yuehu Building Complex.

778
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,210
Drive. Yuehu Building Complex.

779
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,160
Are you going to see your daughter?

780
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,660
Wang Quan?

781
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,270
I heard that you...

782
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,210
Didn't you go to Shenzhen?

783
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,540
It's been so many years.

784
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,090
How are you?

785
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,110
Do you think I'm okay?

786
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:44,920
Wang Quan!

787
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,090
How could you cheat on me at home?

788
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,970
How can you do this to me?

789
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,850
How can you do this to me?

790
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,820
Get lost!

791
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,760
This is my home.

792
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,790
Don't lie in my bed.

793
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,960
Go to hell!

794
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,420
Who asked you to come back?

795
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,370
Wang Quan!

796
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,470
Let go!

797
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,800
You're a taxi driver now.

798
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,270
Your income is not bad, right?

799
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,210
By the way, you're in poor health.

800
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,850
Well,

801
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,960
don't tire yourself out.

802
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,860
With this,

803
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,130
I can't drive for long a day.

804
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,320
Your daughter

805
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,340
is amazing.

806
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,310
I heard she's going to build a steel mill.

807
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,200
She's a rich woman.

808
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,390
Rich people's life is not easy.

809
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,590
I found

810
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,150
she has to go to four to five places

811
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,790
from morning to night.

812
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,000
She has to work

813
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,960
14 hours every day.

814
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,950
You can't see her many times.

815
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,680
Yes. She's doing business now.

816
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,220
Well,

817
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,860
she's busy with business.

818
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,340
How about this?

819
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,240
I'll make an appointment someday.

820
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,980
You...

821
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,760
I can see her anytime.

822
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,680
Yuehu Building Complex.

823
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:01,860
She lives in a mansion.

824
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,970
It's not the place where people like us

825
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,190
can go.

826
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,690
Sit tight. Let's go.

827
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,120
I'm coming.

828
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,870
Open the door!

829
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,510
What's wrong?

830
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,950
I'm pregnant.

831
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,160
Isn't it good to be pregnant?

832
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,780
Why are you crying?

833
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,150
Sister, tell me.

834
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,950
What's wrong with Tong Xiaoqi?

835
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,220
You don't know.

836
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,290
He served me tea and water

837
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,420
and greeted me with a smile.

838
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,140
He cooked different dishes for me every day.

839
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,970
I thought he was so nice to me.

840
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,150
I didn't expect

841
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,370
he wanted this baby to keep me.

842
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,210
You also know that.

843
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,340
Everyone, including my mom, knows

844
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:14,540
that I'm going abroad.

845
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,700
But you're pregnant.

846
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,600
You don't want it?

847
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,180
I don't know.

848
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,980
It's not a kitten or puppy.

849
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,600
I can't make a decision soon.

850
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,340
Sister.

851
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm hungry.

852
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,240
Is there anything to eat?

853
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,050
Yes. I'll get it for you.

854
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:39,170
So annoying. What's wrong with him?

855
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,150
Have some dates.

856
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,620
They're good for your blood.

857
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,170
Eat them first.

858
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,490
You're pregnant.

859
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,320
Don't be so emotional.

860
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,580
I'm not emotional.

861
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,050
I'm not emotional at all.

862
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,070
Don't try to persuade me.

863
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,390
Sister.

864
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,490
Why don't you think for me?

865
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,650
Is there anything else to eat?
