Are you okay?

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,050
The typhoon is coming.

7
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:46,800
Look.

8
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,130
These are signs of it.

9
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,780
I've been taking care of my grandson,

10
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,060
washing diapers, warm milk, and cooking.

11
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,480
I also need to cooperate with the Interviews and investigations from time to time.

12
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,910
I suddenly felt that

13
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,730
I'm getting old.

14
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,590
This feeling is getting stronger.

15
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,870
You're still young.

16
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,710
You're not good at flattering people.

17
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,300
Before the investigation,

18
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,250
those young people praised me

19
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,360
how young I looked.

20
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,100
They said, "You look like you're in your thirties."

21
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,620
How couldn't I know whether I'm old or not?

22
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,100
My hair is gray.

23
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,800
I've had the presbyopia.

24
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,240
My skin is loose.

25
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,980
As well as those symptoms that I can't say them out.

26
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,060
They seemed to praise me,

27
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,140
but actually,

28
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,260
they all said

29
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,970
why this old woman hasn't retired

30
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,520
and left them the position.

31
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,240
Don't be angry with them.

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,540
Of course I won't.

33
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,710
But many things have happened recently.

34
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,460
Sometimes I thought

35
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,700
they were right.

36
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,430
The development of human society

37
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,970
is to keep updating.

38
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,030
It's the metabolism.

39
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,450
We'll get old and die.

40
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,620
That's why young people

41
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,700
can growth healthily.

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,370
In this case, our country

43
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
can have better development.

44
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,640
It's all worth it.

45
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,320
I think I'm going to let you down.

46
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,409
Now,

47
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,290
I'm like a grass on the alkaline land,

48
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,300
which appears

49
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,409
and grows quietly,

50
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,940
but now has withered quietly too.

51
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,409
I understand how you feel.

52
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,250
The smuggling is convicted and found guilty.

53
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,310
The prospect of the embezzlement of state assets case

54
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,860
is not optimistic.

55
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,210
The steel mill is closed, and you're facing the shortage of funds.

56
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,820
You'll face the liquidation and bankruptcy.

57
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,250
No one can handle it,

58
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,480
let alone you.

59
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,720
You're still a little girl.

60
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,970
Banxia, when I was in college,

61
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,670
I really liked Guo Moruo's poetry collection Goddess.

62
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,900
One of the poems

63
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,620
is called Phoenix Nirvana.

64
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,260
I hope you can carry on.

65
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,980
Hang in there.

66
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,840
You will be reborn.

67
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,020
Have you heard?

68
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,900
The typhoon this time is called Phoenix.

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
Phoenix Nirvana

70
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,680
You can't fall asleep

71
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,940
because of the two cases, right?

72
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,880
The case of corruption of national assets

73
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,440
is more controversial than the smuggling case.

74
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,920
Reading and checking every contract

75
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,870
and each numbers makes me believe that

76
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,990
these two cases won't be settled

77
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,470
in two or three years.

78
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,270
Why are you reading these now?

79
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,960
For others,

80
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,460
these are only cold and meaningless numbers and paper.

81
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,150

are full of my memories.

86

Seeing these photos

93

171
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,220
if you can hear me,

172
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,080
♫Is shed on the sea level of life♫

173
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,940
please tell Boss in her dreams.

174
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,550
Just tell her

175
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,600
♫Like a telescope♫

176
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,870
that she doesn't need to be afraid.

177
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,910
♫To see the wind and waves in the distance♫

178
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,820
Everything will be fine.

179
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,500
♫A wall of ideals♫

180
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,600
She will listen to you if you tell her so.

181
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,520
♫Lies across love and hate♫

182
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,300
♫Like a magnifying glass♫

183
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:37,590
♫It reflects inner yearnings♫

184
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,610
Xinyi.

185
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,070
How much cash do we have?

186
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,780
Tell me after you calculate the amount.

187
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,500
Got it.

188
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,700
Zhang.

189
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,110
Yes.

190
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,340
Inform all the executives of the company

191
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,220
to be on duty.

192
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,770
We'll have a meeting at 2 p.m.

193
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,650
Got it, Miss Xu.

194
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,570
Miss Xu.

195
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,180
Some of the workers left and some chose to stay.

196
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,710
Some are rushing

197
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,460
here, angrily.

198
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,840
They want to talk to you face to face.

199
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,010
OK.

200
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,350
You two go with me.

201
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
I advise you not to go.

202
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,130
Everyone is angry now.

203
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,550
What can you say to them if you go?

204
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,130
-Let me go. -Tong is right.

205
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,540
They're not bad people.

206
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,820
But they're all angry.

207
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,220
It's Miss Xu's car. Miss Xu is here.

208
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,200
Miss Xu is here.

209
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,740
It's Miss Xu.

210
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,490
Hurry up.

211
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,730
Miss Xu.

212
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,310
Miss Xu.

213
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,410
Miss Xu.

214
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,860
Is there anyone who's willing to go to Binhai with me?

215
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,050
I will build a new steel mill

216
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,730
in Binhai.

217
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,100
We really need technical backbones like you.

218
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,720
I know it's hard for you to leave your hometown.

219
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,040
But sometimes people will get better development when they have high mobility.

220
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,100
Let's start a new life together.

221
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,580
At least, you'll have a way out.

222
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,790
We don't know

223
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,680
if your factory can be built successfully.

224
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,250
If we go with you,

225
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,000
but you say you can't make it

226
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,140
and send us back,

227
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,030
we won't be able to live here.

228
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,430
What should we do if that happens?

229
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
Once you arrive Binhai,

230
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,700
we'll sign the labor contract immediately.

231
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,460
I will arrange everything

232
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,810
for you.

233
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,840
On behalf of our family,

234
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,910
I'm officially informing you now that

235
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,190
we'll go with you.

236
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,590
During the suspension,

237
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,550
I know you have a lot of complaints.

238
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,580
I also care about you.

239
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,270
During these days,

240
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,910
I've been thinking...

241
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,960
I really want to give you

242
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,290
a satisfactory result soon

243
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,410
as I did last time in Northeast.

244
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,040
But I underestimated the seriousness of the matter,

245
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,940
and overestimated my ability.

246
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,480
I sincerely apologize

248
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,460
to you all here.

249
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,580
I really have no choice.

250
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,770
So,

251
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,700
I have to terminate the employment relationship with everyone.

252
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,340
But I will find a way

253
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,330
to compensate you.

254
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,130
We've been waiting for so long

255
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,400
just for such a reply like that?

256
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,640
You're trying to kick us away.

257
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,980
I shouldn't have come.

258
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,840
You're fooling us.

259
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,070
Liar!

260
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,560
Don't worry.

261
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,860
The compensation plan will be out soon.

262
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,470
Let's wait at home.

263
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,490
Let's go home and discuss it.

264
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,370
How about this?

265
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,470
If you have any other requests,

266
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,390
please tell us.

267
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,140
If we can manage it,

268
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,390
we'll try our best to satisfy each of them, okay?

269
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,390
Excuse me.

270
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,200
Excuse me.

271
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,010
Uncle Jia. Auntie Sun.

272
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,830
Miss Xu.

273
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,980
Don't worry.

274
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,540
Don't be anxious.

275
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,530
Don't be too anxious, everyone.

276
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,620
There's nothing we can't overcome.

277
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,590
Look, we're old.

278
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,180
We can still see the good days ahead.

279
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,780
We have to go forward together.

280
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,660
Yes.

281
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,630
As long as we're here, we'll figure it out.

282
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,510
Miss Xu,

283
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,050
I made dumplings today.

284
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,640
I know you're busy.

285
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,890
I got you a bowl of dumplings.

286
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,860
Take it back.

287
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,540
Thank you, Auntie Sun.

288
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,740
You're welcome.

289
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,360
Everyone,

290
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,180
Miss Xu brought us here

291
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,349
from Northeast China.

292
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,410
She did help everyone, didn't she?

293
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,180
But Miss Xu can't expect

294
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,290
the situation now herself.

295
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,010
Speaking of difficulties,

296
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,990
she's more difficult than us.

297
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,950
Let's not force her.

298
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,730
It's useless to make things difficult for her.

299
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,280
If we can't find a way,

300
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,230
let's figure it out ourselves.

301
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,140
OK?

302
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,380
We can stay here for two more months, right?

303
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,450
Maybe there will be a new opportunity.

304
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,510
Dismiss, everyone.

305
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,020
Dismiss.

306
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,510
Have you ever thought about

307
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,810
opening our own steel mill?

308
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,910
We have our own storage yard,

309
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,530
pier

310
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,250
and our own scrap steel channels.

311
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,270
If we own our own steel mill,

312
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,430
we can make steel ourselves.

313
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,630
Three years later,

314
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,900
not only our storage yard and pier,

315
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,420
I will make this whole area

316
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,700
bright with lights.

317
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,620
No matter how long you've been here,

318
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,140
you've always done your best.

319
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,770
You've been attentive

320
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,110
and dedicated.

321
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,850
You've been accompanying the company's growth

322
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,340
and my personal growth.

323
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,940
At the hardest time of the company,

324
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,690
at my most difficult times,

325
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,560
none of you chose to resign.

326
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,440
I really appreciate it.

327
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:24,990
But now,

328
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,560
I'll announce a painful decision.

329
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,820
I'll disband all employees of the company.

330
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,650
Please find other jobs.

331
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,660
If one day the company can be back on track,

332
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,880
and you are willing to return,

333
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,250
you're more than welcomed.

334
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,820
Today is the last day of work.

336
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,050
You can go home early.

337
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,340
Xinyi.

338
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,040

Actually, Chen didn't like sweet porridge.

He liked Porridge with preserved eggs.

00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,490
Nothing.

504
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,040
-It's just a pile of medicine. -Stop!

505
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:00,740
Let go!

506
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,600
What are you doing?

507
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,870
Let go!

508
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,060
What are you doing?

509
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,590
Nothing.

510
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,430
There's really nothing here.

511
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,610
Nothing.

512
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,010
Let go!

513
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,210
People will see you.

514
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,660
Give it to me.

515
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,220
You're really something.

516
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,360
I saw it.

517
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,430
What if I didn't?

518
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,630
You just took it away?

519
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,670
You took it without a word, right?

520
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,890
She's in trouble and needs money now.

521
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,960
I'll send it to her.

522
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,890
Xu Youren.

523
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,750
Qian and I are not your family, are we?

524
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,220
You only have one daughter, right?

525
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,400
Qian is so young.

526
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,470
Don't you care about her?

527
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,250
Qian is young. I'll take care of her.

528
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,140
She gave us the money.

529
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,540
We went through without spending a penny.

530
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,580
Don't make me look like I'm neglecting her.

531
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,300
If she begs in front of our home

532
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,750
one day,

533
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,950
I'll take her in.

534
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,610
But now,

535
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:52,810
she has a home.

536
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,290
She has a husband and a car.

537
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,480
You don't need to care about her.

538
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,590
A skinny camel is bigger than a horse.

539
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,180
She's 100 times better than you.

540
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,500
You can say these.

541
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,340
You only care about your eldest daughter.

542
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,460
Do you love us?

543
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,230
Don't do this. Listen to me.

544
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:05,870
You...

545
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,630
Listen to me.

546
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,050
Didn't you just say

547
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,310
she has been stubborn since she was a child.

548
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,040
No one took care of her since she was little.

549
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,000
I never took after her.

550
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,510
She is in big trouble now.

551
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,140
She can't say anything.

552
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,090
Xu Youren,

553
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,030
I'm not doing this for me.

554
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,620
I did it for Qian.

555
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,770
For our daughter.

556
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,860
I know, I know.

557
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,250
You know, I'm a father.

558
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,540
If I don't help her now,

559
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,220
how can I face her and myself?

560
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,980
I don't care.

561
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,810
Give it to me.

562
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,310
I don't care.

563
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,030
Xu Youren.

564
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,140
I'm telling you,

565
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,490
If you leave today,

566
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,070
I'll divorce you.

567
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,960
Xu Youren!

568
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,380
I'll be right back.

569
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,460
Let's talk when I'm back.

570
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,510
She's coming.

571
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,140
Miss Xu is out.

572
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,890
Miss Xu.

573
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,140
I don't want your liquidated damages.

574
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,290
I just want steel.

575
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,760
If I can't produce on time,

576
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,790
who will compensate my liquidated damages?

577
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,140
You have so many lawsuits.

578
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,840
Can you pay me back or not?

579
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,310
I don't want the interest,

580
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,380
as long as you can pay me back the principal first.

581
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,020
What are you doing?

582
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,990
Get out of the way!

583
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,900
Get out of the way!

584
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,470
What are you doing?

585
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,030
Miss Xu.

586
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,050
Our company is in urgent need of money.

587
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,740
We can't afford it.

588
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,150
Can you pay us the second installment

589
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,570
in advance?

590
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,320
Miss Xu, don't go.

591
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,370
Can you settle the follow-up payment?

592
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,840
Tell me the truth, Miss Xu.

593
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,750
Miss Xu.

594
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,700
Please don't go, Miss Xu.

595
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,820
Dad.

596
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,360
Seeing your cowardice,

597
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,350
I thought about

598
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,650
if I should find another dad.

599
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,110
But at times like this, I comforted myself that

600
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,270
I could change my worn clothes

601
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,560
but not my dad.

602
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,140
I have no other choice.

603
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,570
I only have one dad.

604
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,940
No matter we're close or not,

605
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,900
you're still my dad.

606
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,300
Without you,

607
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,050
there won't be me.

608
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,480
In my eyes,

609
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,430
you were a jerk before.

610
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,420
But today,

611
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,230
you're a hero

612
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,980
in my eyes.

613
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,360
My girl,

614
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,670
actually, since the day you were born,

615
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,330
I've always wanted to be a good father.

Right?

You came at the right time.

726

-I'm here to visit Mr. Qiu. -Feng, what did I say?

727
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,020
We should have bathed him.

728

It's not too late.

729
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,780
Now!

730
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,750
Take the clothes off and bathe him now.

731

No need.

734
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,000
We're just kidding.

736
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,380
Don't say 'ahh'.

737
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,170
It's not that hot.

738
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,740
Test the temperature.

739
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,050
Isn't it hot, right?

740
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,620
You feet

741
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,580
smell like a cow shed.

742
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,130
Boss,

743
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,660
you reminded me of this.

744
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,860
I suddenly want to know the reason

745
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,790
why you were sent to the cow house that year.

746
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,780
I'm asking you.

747
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,640
I was thinking that he could wash my feet

748
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,910
after he went out from the cow house.

749
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,680
You ungrateful thing.

750
00:36:59,170 --> 00:36:59,970
Let me ask you.

751
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,470
Who treats you the best in your life?

752
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,820
No one?

753
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,410
Do you have a conscience?

754
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:09,740
It's me.

755
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,420
Right.

756
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,750
My contribution to you is worth it.

757
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,300
Is he the only one who treats you well?

758
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,050
I treat you well too, right?

759
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,480
You see.

760
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,610
You're not confused yet.

761
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:24,890
Okay.

762
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,580
Xu, do me a favor.

763
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,600
Pass me the foot cloth.

764
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,440
Let me ask you again.

765
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,350
Who do you hate the most in this world?

766
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,910
Who?

767
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,020
How kind are you.

768
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,840
You don't hate anyone, do you?

769
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,030
No one at all?

770
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,900
Or did you forget

771
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,770
about the hatred?

772
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,800
Fine, old man.

773
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,430
You can live longer without hatred.

774
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,610
Xu.

775
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,820
Do you know

776
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,470
what he cares the most in his life?

777
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,600
What? Tell us.

778
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,250
Can't you say it?

779
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,760
Tell me yourself.

780
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,860
What do you care the most?

781
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,630
What?

782
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,470
Let me say it for you.

783
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,020
One word.

784
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,250
Money.

785
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,260
-He smiles. -He's smiling.

786
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,880
You have the prettiest smile when we talk about money.

787
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,870
Now our company is bankrupt.

788
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,480
Do you know how much we're going to lose?

789
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:24,330
Do you know?

790
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,110
He wants to write.

791
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,860
You do?

792
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,380
OK, we have paper.

Let me get it for you.

794

You even know math now?

797
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,610
Write it down and let me see.

798
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,320
What?

799
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,240
Don't bother.

800
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,150
Forget it.

801
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,070
Let me tell you the answer.

802
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,890
We don't have any money.

803
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,080

I suddenly remembered the days

807

when we went abroad for steel.

808
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,280
I still thought

809

After getting the uncertain news,

816
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,070
I took everyone there.

817
