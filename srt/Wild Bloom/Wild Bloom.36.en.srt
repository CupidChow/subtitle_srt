00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,980
or selling equipment.

172
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,690
When Mr. Wu's steel mill merged with yours,

173
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,080
if you knew these clauses,

174
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,460
you must be prepared

175
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,520
for the company's liquidation and bankruptcy.

176
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,830
The best result is to get a huge fine.

177
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,790
If you didn't know,

178
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,650
you have to persuade Mr. Wu

179
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,100
to take the corresponding liability for fraud.

180
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,620
There are only two possibilities.

181
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,280
You have to choose one.

182
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,450
Miss Xu.

183
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,740
You can't

184
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,950
choose the first plan.

185
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,840
Sacrifice is inevitable in success.

186
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,170
That way, the company will also be safe.

187
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,610
What did the lawyer say?

188
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,070
The lawyer said

189
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,010
if we continue the legal battle,

190
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,730
the risk will be higher.

191
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:19,890
It's not going to be good

192
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,990
for everyone.

193
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,400
So he gave me two options.

194
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,730
One is to admit the guilt

195
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,630
and have a good attitude

196
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,150
in order to end it with a high fine.

197
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,000
Then we can get the company back on track

198
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,830
and continue the plan to list the company.

199
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,060
The other is to sacrifice Wu Jianshe,

200
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,250
letting him bear all the charges of embezzling

201
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,110
state-owned property.

202
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:43,720
In this way,

203
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,370
you can be exonerated.

204
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,490
Mr. Wu.

205
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,120
Do you know

206
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,400
how much the Soviets sacrificed

207
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,410
to protect

208
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,080
Volgograd?

209
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,480
11 army groups.

210
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,700
120 divisions.

211
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,430
They guarded the place for seven months in freezing conditions

212
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,840
and lost two million people

213
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,650
before they kept the Germans at bay

214
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,220
and won a victory.

215
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,950
This became a turning point

216
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,910
in World War II.

217
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,500
Mr. Wu, I mean

218
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,530
any victory

219
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,750
has to be paid for with sacrifice.

220
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,370
Mr. Wu,

221
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,600
if Miss Xu pleads guilty on behalf of the company,

222
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,790
the company will have a hard future.

223
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,470
Besides, when the two steel mills merged together,

224
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,510
you also hid something, right?

225
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,320
Actually,

226
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,140
it is the company

227
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,190
and yourself

228
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,750
you plead guilty for.

229
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,110
You're not doing it for Xu Banxia.

230
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,230
Look.

231
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,370
You own 25% of the shares in the company.

232
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,430
If the company is fine

233
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,590
and be listed,

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,030
your shares are still there.

235
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,020
Money comes from money.

236
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,160
On the contrary,

237
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,420
if the company is ruined,

238
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,260
you'll lose

239
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,090
everything.

240
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,040
Mr. Wu.

241
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,180
If you have any conditions, just tell me.

242
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,560
Miss Xu will definitely agree.

243
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,690
Xu Banxia asked you to come?

244
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,160
This is my own idea.

245
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,760
I'm doing this for the company's sake.

246
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:41,970
Here.

247
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,710
Mr. Wu.

248
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,310
Who do you think you are?

249
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,020
How dare you teach me how to do things?

250
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,140
Let alone you,

251
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,990
even if Xu Banxia was here,

252
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,170
I wouldn't be polite to her.

253
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:53,800
Get lost.

254
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,710
Mr. Wu, please reconsider.

255
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,260
We really...

256
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,540
Get lost!

257
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,240
Get lost!

258
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,960
I remember in 1998,

259
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,270
the Ministry of Finance carried out a spot check

260
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,420
on the annual financial statements of 100 major state-owned enterprises

261
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,440
from 1997 to 1998.

262
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,000
The results showed that 80 percent of them

263
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,140
had misrepresented their assets

264
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,690
and inflated their profits.

265
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,220
This was a hopeless reality.

266
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,250
Last year,

267
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,700
at the most difficult time,

268
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,860
more than 50% of the companies

269
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,790
have experienced a shortage of funds

270
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,290
and poor sales.

271
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,260
It was not easy

272
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,860
to stick with

273
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:56,910
and survive.

274
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,330
Our state-owned enterprises

275
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,240
needed to cover up their predicament

276
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,690
by falsifying their financial statements.

277
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,570
In order to realize the restructuring of the state-owned economy,

278
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,000
our country promoted the diversification

279
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,180
of investment and property rights,

280
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,100
which expanded the space

281
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,050
for the development of private enterprises.

282
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,910
The provincial government is going to start reform.

283
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,020
State No.2 Steel is going to be bid for.

284
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,770
This is a public bidding.

285
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,460
Everyone has equal opportunities.

286
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,370
Our goal was very clear.

287
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,850
We guided private enterprises to strengthen internal management,

288
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,660
standardize governance structure,

289
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,910
accelerate technological innovation,

290
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,350
and gradually move toward a modern enterprise system.

291
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,670
In this process,

292
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,160
everyone felt

293
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,810
the difficulty of deepening the reform.

294
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,780
But at the same time,

295
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,500
they were full of excitement, confusion,

296
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,700
ambiguity and contradiction

297
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,590
about the reform.

298
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,820
Have you ever thought about

299
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,100
running our own steel mill?

300
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Have you ever thought

301
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,020
becoming a steel maker

302
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,010
from a steel dealer?

303
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,460
I think this is an opportunity.

304
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,340
The auction of State No.2 Steel is inevitable.

305
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,540
This is a landmark event

306
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,600
in our country's structural reform.

307
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,680
You can find someone to cooperate with.

308
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,920
Let's cooperate again

309
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,370
and take over State No.2 Steel.

310
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,540
Let's become

311
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,630
real partners.

312
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,930
The steel mill

313
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,900
is not about how much money you have and how to divide the money.

314
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,830
If you think you can run a steel mill

315
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,410
if you have money,

316
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,940
I think

317
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,810
you consider it as an easy thing.

318
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,230
At that time, some of our enterprises

319
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,140
had outdated products,

320
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,840
superfluous workers,

321
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,600
and heavy burdens.

322
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,430
Under such circumstances,

323
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,220
it was inevitable to seek diversified development.

324
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,380
State No.2 Steel was like this.

325
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,830
Many enterprises like State No.2 Steel

326
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,569
were like this.

327
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,650
The sooner they changed, the sooner they took the initiative.

328
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,220
They'd play a passive role if they changed later.

329
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,260
If they didn't change,

330
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,310
there would be no way out.

331
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,980
Mr. Wu, there are indeed many problems.

332
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,859
It's a good mill.

333
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,060
The key is the management.

334
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,339
This is an enterprise.

335
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,270
The steel mill is an enterprise.

336
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,440
An enterprise needs to be run.

337
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,579
Do you know how to run an enterprise?

338
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,690
Have you ever run an enterprise?

339
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,930
I suggest

340
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,020
you cooperate with Wu Jianshe.

341
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,480
Isn't it more realistic for you to work together

342
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,140
to run State No.2 Steel well?

343
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,210
However, since there was no national

344
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,780
legal reform plan,

345
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,820
there were dozens of methods

346
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,180
of transfer of property rights.

347
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,060
These methods had no solid legal basis

348
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,270
and regulatory measures.

349
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,890
So during this process,

350
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,350
we may make mistakes

351
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,670
and have problems.

352
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,450
But luckily,

353
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,800
we found the problems in time.

354
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,340
This led to the rapid development

355
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,560
of the state-owned economy.

356
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,450
Now our generation is old.

357
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,010
We did what we should do.

358
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,740
We also taught the young people a lesson.

359
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,920
The mistakes we didn't correct in time

360
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,190
will be made up for by them continually.

361
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,370
They'll make our country stronger and stronger

362
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,950
and keep our national economy

363
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,860
developing rapidly and healthily.

364
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,570
This is their responsibility.

365
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,320
Just like today, you investigated me

366
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,410
in order to find out the truth.

367
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,600
This is your responsibility.

368
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,820
Me too.

369
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,150
If the loss of state assets

370
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,670
was because of me,

371
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,970
it was my fault.

372
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,690
This is my responsibility.

373
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,540
People.

374
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,720
Those who're lying down want to stand up.

375
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,300
Those who're standing don't want to lie down.

376
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,640
Instead of being a loser,

377
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,370
why don't we try our best?

378
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,950
Have you forgotten?

379
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,470
For us,

380
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,820
you drank

381
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,810
so much liquor.

382
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,290
You were so manly.

383
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,590
But now,

384
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,230
the problem we face is

385
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,920
whether to fight or compromise.

386
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,770
Enough.

387
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,070
You can't come up with any ideas now.

388
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,300
If we fight,

389
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,480
that's a waste of time.

390
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,370
But can our steel mill afford it?

391
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,280
If we compromise,

392
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,560
it's a confession.

393
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,510
If the guilt is admitted, the sentence will be light.

394
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,330
But who will go to admit the guilt?

395
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,410
Miss Xu.

396
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,530
Can you tell me your final decision?

397
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,810
We're going to make a solution soon.

398
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,830
I've read some books about law recently.

399
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,560
I've also studied many cases of state-owned enterprise reform.

400
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,380
When I merged my mill with Mr. Wu's steel mill,

401
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,540
I didn't know

402
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,850
the equipment of the steel mill can't be damaged and sold at will.

403
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,540
I still think I'm innocent,

404
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,800
so my principle won't change.

405
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,310
I won't choose to plead guilty.

406
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,070
As for the second plan you proposed,

407
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,090
I can't say it.

408
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,520
Before I met Mr. Wu,

409
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,210
I was a scrap dealer.

410
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,840
I wouldn't be where I am today without him.

411
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,590
I've been where I am

412
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,520
by following his steps.

413
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Although I have surpassed him

414
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,370
and been ahead of him,

415
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,710
can I leave him alone?

416
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,100
No one can always

417
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,330
be ahead of others forever.

418
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,560
We'll be fallen behind one day.

419
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,550
Miss Xu,

420
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,710
I know you well.

421
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,150
I also know it's not loyal

422
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,110
to do this.

423
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,310
You said more than once

424
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,210
this company doesn't only belong to you.

425
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,260
It's your hard work.

426
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,050
But in business,

427
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,480
you still need to consider

428
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,910
the long-term development of the company.

429
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,120
After all,

430
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,830
it's the livelihood of many employees of the company

431
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,700
and the workers of the steel mill.

432
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,620
Let Mr. Wu sacrifice himself

433
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,130
to protect the whole company.

434
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,180
I don't dare to say he'll be remembered forever,

435
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,820
but at least everyone will be grateful to him.

436
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,730
He will eventually understand you.

437
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,510
Mr. Wu, Mr. Qiu

438
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,680
and I

439
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,660
have been fighting against each other for so many years.

440
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,950
We've gained a lot,

441
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,940
but we lost more.

442
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,220
We

443
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,990
set each other up

444
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,580
and betrayed each other.

445
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,110
In order to do the business,

446
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,170
we fought tooth and nail,

447
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,980
but in the end we got nothing.

448
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,640
Now that I think about it,

449
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,620
I miss the time

450
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,860
when we worked hard to survive together.

451
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,900
They are quite cute.

452
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,650
Although it is said that businessmen value profit and separate easily,

453
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,260
I don't want to be a businesswoman who only cares about business.

454
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,130
I choose to be a businesswoman who values friendship.

what made you come this far.

596

I didn't figure it out.

597
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,860
Then I thought

598
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,860
what made me

599
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,790
come this far.

600
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,870
I still didn't figure it out.

601
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,450
If you ask me,

602
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,040
when we went to the north together,

603
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,090
would I think of today?

604
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,530
No, I wouldn't.

605
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,000
When I first met you,

606
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,450
I thought you were

607
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,490
a straightforward, passionate,

608
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,590
and kind girl

609
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,280
who only wanted to make money

610
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,940
and might be a capable girl later.

611
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,730
I didn't expect you to be an entrepreneur.

612
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,090
You're so good at it.

613
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,380
I admit

614
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,950
when I bid for State No.2 Steel,

615
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,350
I did it partly for business

616
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,300
and partly

617
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,990
for competing with you.

618
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,440
I knew what equipment had problems

619
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,140
and what conditions were inappropriate,

620
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,270
but I still signed the contract.

621
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,700
When I transferred it to you,

622
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,750
I didn't tell you these problems.

623
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,480
I didn't dare to say.

624
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,100
Our mills wouldn't have been merged if I had told you.

625
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,470
I've been a coward.

626
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,730
I've been hiding it.

627
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,870
Why did I hide it?

628
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,130
If people are too selfish,

629
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,980
it will also hurt others.

630
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,170
It's like an apple seller

631
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,250
who puts the rotten ones at the bottom.

632
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,630
If people can't see them,

633
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,400
all of them can be sold.

634
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,240
But they will rot sooner or later.

635
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,320
Just like what I've done.

636
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,400
I should admit and solve them soon.

637
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,020
Otherwise, things will become worse.

638
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,810
To put it bluntly, I don't dare to face it.

639
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,600
Now I feel relieved.

640
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,800
Have you done something bad?

641
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,970
No, you haven't.

642
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,250
Remember.

643
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,850
When I'm released,

644
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,530
you can't get into trouble.

645
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,870
Xu Banxia,

646
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,740
do me a favor.

647
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,030
Come and pick me up

648
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,430
when I'm released.

649
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,610
After all,

650
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,400
I'm your eldest brother.

651
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,250
Let's do this business together.

652
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,760
Xu, if you insist on going,

653
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,210
I'll give you five thousand tons

654
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,000
from my share.

655
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,810
I'll pay for your loss.

656
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,890
It's not safe for you

657
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,160
to stay here alone.

658
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,590
Xu,

659
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,370
can you join us?

660
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,630
Let's

661
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,250
work together again.

662
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,510
Among these people,

663
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,320
I'm partial to you.

664
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,590
You're so unpopular.

665
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,800
If we didn't come,

666
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,710
no one would come to see you.

667
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,230
Boss,

668
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,969
I did that back then.

669
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,190
I should be the one to confess.

670
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,489
Chen has gone.

671
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,560

It's my conscience.

That year, in order to build a storage yard and a dock,

727

I chose an intertidal zone.

a company,

I haven't built a snowman for years.

in the past

761
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,290
was fearless.

762

There was fire burning in her heart.

She burned all the withered grass.

764

Her crazy dream grew wildly.

765
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,180
She believed

766

that her dream would come true one day.

767

Later,

the kid gradually grew up.

Her dream has come true.

770
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,640
But

771
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,010
something she did

772
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,080
left traces of pain.

773
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,330
She thought she could escape like before.

774
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,470
But after traveling around the world,

775
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,380
she found

776
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,300
she had nowhere to escape.

777
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,000
She fell into the abyss

778
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,900
and deserved to die.

779
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,540
Now the kid has not only grown up,

780
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,590
but also learned a lot.

781
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,760
She folded the past

782
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,670
and put it in her memory.

783
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,910
If life is possible to win,

784
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,620
it's not because we win the time,

785
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,700
but because we finally reconcile with our memories.

786
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,920
Fold all regrets and keep them.

787

No delusion

788
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,800
and no more pain.
