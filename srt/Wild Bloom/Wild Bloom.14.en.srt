4
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,300
Well...

5
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,890
Fatty, are you looking for me?

6
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,440
Did they have nothing to do?

7
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,660
What did they talk about me to you?

8
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,020
Fatty, don't believe them.

9
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,480
They gossiped a lot.

10
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,230
They made things up.

11
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,670
I... I'm heading out.

12
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,940
What did they talk about you?

13
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,100
I...

14
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,220
Nothing.

15
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,579
Why are you looking for me?

16
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,300
I want to ask you

17
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,700
whether you have prepared the materials

18
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,610
for President Gao.

19
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,420
I'll get it for you.

20
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,300
Wait a minute.

21
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,420
Well, it's ready.

22
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,700
Come back. Tell me.

23
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,140
What did they say about you?

24
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,340
I...

25
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,980
What could happen to me?

26
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,900
Nothing.

27
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,420
Then there must be something.

28
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,510
You'd better tell me the truth.

29
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,650
Don't wait until I find out from them.

30
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,020
Fatty,

31
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,550
I'm in love.

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,160
Her name is Zhou Qian.

33
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,660
She came from another city to work in Binhai.

34
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,380
She works as a designer

35
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,180
in a clothing factory.

36
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,780
She's very hardworking.

37
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,660
She's nice.

38
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,700
I think

39
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,060
she has a similar background with me.

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,460
So,

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
we got together.

42
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,579
Right.

43
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,660
I was never in a relationship.

44
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,780
And I thought

45
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,610
I would never date in my life.

46
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,000
But she and I...

47
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,500
I didn't expect

48
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,150
we would meet

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,880
and get together.

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,590
Congratulate me.

51
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
Do you really love her?

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,100
I love her.

53
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,820
Just because she has a similar background with you?

54
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,970
Do you know what love is?

55
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,610
Of course I know what love is.

56
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,090
Then tell me.

57
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,700
Okay.

58
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,550
Love is

59
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,770
no matter what I do now,

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,210
I would think of her.

61
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,130
I want to see her

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,270
all the time.

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,610
Whenever I have happy things,

64
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,960
I want to tell her right away.

65
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,860
When I'm unhappy,

66
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,390
as long as I think of her,

67
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,040
the unhappiness is gone.

68
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,280
Do you think this is love?

69
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,700
I think

70
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,020
you should find a boyfriend.

71
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,540
I bet if you are in a relationship,

72
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,970
you wouldn't be in this state now.

73
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,340
Do you believe it?

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,410
Mr. Zhao.

75
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:13,900
Mr. Zhao.

76
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,560
What are you doing?

77
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,730
Are the auditors looking for me again?

78
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,340
Yes, they are waiting for you in the meeting room.

79
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,900
For your information,

80
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,260
I won't come here tomorrow.

81
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,340
The company doesn't ask you to leave.

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
If you do that,

83
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,420
the headquarters will probably be unhappy.

84
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,700
I'm unhappy.

85
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,860
Have you ever thought about

86
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,820
the consequences?

87
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,050
Aren't you involved

88
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,580
in those contracts

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,620
the auditors questioned me about?

90
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,440
What do you mean?

91
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:51,780
I know.

92
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,860
You have a good relationship with Steve.

93
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,270
You

94
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,100
tell him for me.

95
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,950
Don't make it hard on me.

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,380
We'll meet often

97
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,540
in the future.

98
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,100
Mr. Zhao.

99
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,060
Mr. Zhao.

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,390
I can't help you with that.

101
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,790
If you leave like this,

102
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,110
you're just being irresponsible.

103
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,700
What do you think is being responsible?

104
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,390
Do you get a new job?

105
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,010
No.

106
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,460
Your problem here

107
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,340
hasn't been solved yet.

108
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,210
Are you really leaving?

109
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,480
Aren't you afraid the company will make trouble for you?

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,260
Why me?

111
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,820
I'm neither corrupt nor negligent.

112
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,780
It's been two months.

113
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,220
I don't have that much time

114
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,030
to waste with them.

115
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,460
Besides, from the moment I submitted my resignation,

116
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,300
they refused it and suspended my salary.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,860
What are they trying to do? Exhaust me?

118
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,030
Mr. Zhao, tell me the truth.

119
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,630
Do you have a new job?

120
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,220
I'll resign no matter what.

121
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,060
I really suggest you hold on for a while.

122
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,210
Let me remind you.

123
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,990
If you do that,

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,640
it won't look good on your resume.

125
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,380
How long have you worked for me?

126
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,700
What do you mean?

127
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,270
If I remember correctly,

128
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,550
it's been four years, right?

129
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,410
Four years.

130
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,550
I finally know you today.

You're out.

133
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,300
Thank you.

134
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,659
The air is better outside.

135
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,620
Here.

136
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,950
I'll do it myself.

137
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,380
Give it to me.

138
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,580
You've suffered inside.

139
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Let's go.

140
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,230
Get in the car.

141
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,890
Okay.

142
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,500
Sir.

143
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,140
Later,

144
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,710
give him a good rub.

145
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,340
Okay.

146
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,410
Let him get rid of the bad luck.

147
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,020
Mr. Qiu,

148
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,310
my family...

149
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,700
Don't worry. I've arranged everything for you.

150
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,580
I'll send you home after we eat hot pot.

151
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,340
Do you miss your wife?

152
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,730
I'll remember

153
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,740
your kindness to me.

154
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,590
Don't mention it.

155
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,690
You are a talent.

156
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,980
Your words

157
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,740
saved me 300,000 yuan.

158
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,000
I should thank you.

159
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,590
It's nothing.

160
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,620
This time I came out,

161
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,820
I will work hard for you.

162
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,760
I promise to help your steel factory defeat Wu Jianshe's

163

164

Dong,

165
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,780
you've been in jail for so long.

166
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,660
You don't know much

167
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,180
about the market.

168
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,760
It's Xu Banxia's world now.

169
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,140
Even I

170
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,900
have to rely on her.

171
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,140
But with your wisdom

172
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,060
and my money,

173
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,370
no one can stop us from making money.

174

Qiu,

175
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,610
what should we do?

176
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,180
I'll listen to you.

177
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,300
You should apologise to Xu Banxia first.

178
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,870
I know you don't want to,

179
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,060
but you have to bear with it.

180
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,490
You are a businessman.

181
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,900
As long as there is a profit,

182
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,920
as long as Xu Banxia can make money for us,

183
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,640
I can even take her as my ancestor

184
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,100
if you ask me to.

185
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,020
Am I right?

186
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,420
Come on, keep rubbing.

187
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,360
♫Do you know I love you, miss you♫

188
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,020
♫I resent you and miss you, but my love for you will never change♫

189
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,700
Let me tell you.

190
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,020
I tried to borrow the car our boss bought

191
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,840
♫Don't you ever look back?♫

192
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,380
for many times,

193
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,040
but she didn't lend it to me.

194
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,490
Yet she lent it to you to date.

195
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,460
♫Think about yesterday's vow♫

196
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,250
♫Even if you miss the narcissus♫

197
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,590
Stop looking at yourself.

♫blossoming in the water♫

199
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,020
It's like you're getting married.

200
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,050
Why are you so mean lately?

201
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,680
♫Don't forget the lonely lily in the valley♫

202

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,720
You learned that from Wildcat?

204
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,860
I'm just being happy for you.

205
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,260
No need. Thank you.

206
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,100
Zhou Qian.

207
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,080
Chen.

208
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,340
You're here.

209
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,300
You came early.

210
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,900
Yes, I came early.

211
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,140
No, I'm late.

212
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,530
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,220
It's okay. You must be busy

214
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,300
so you're late.

215
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,410
I guess your business must be good.

216
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,430
It's good.

217
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,010
It's really good recently.

218
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,020
What should we do now?

219
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,500
Tell me.

220
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,780
What do you want to do?

221
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,220
What do you think?

222
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,810
I don't know. Your call.

223
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,240
Well,

224
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,090
where did you like to go

225
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,450
with your ex-girlfriend?

226
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,580
No.

227
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,060
What do you mean?

228
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,990
No ex-girlfriend.

229
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,230
I mean I was never in a relationship before.

230
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,100
Well,

231
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,710
what about you?

232
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,920
I've never dated anyone either.

233
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,620
How about this?

234
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,010
Let's find a place to eat.

235
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,460
Chen,

236
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,180
it's 3 p.m.

237
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,950
I just ate.

238
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,620
Right.

239
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,690
Well,

240
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,500
how about this?

241
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,970
Let's take a walk around here?

242
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,220
Sure, let's take a look around.

243
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,920
This looks good.

244
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,300
Try it on.

245
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,450
No, Chen.

246
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,260
Don't be afraid.

247
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,180
Let me put it on you.

248
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,030
Turn around.

249
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,000
Turn around.

250
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,000
Buckle this.

251
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,210
Come on. Turn around. Hurry.

252
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,610
There you go.

253
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,660
Okay.

254
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,180
How is it?

255
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,760
Does it look good?

256
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,270
What do you think?

257
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,900
Look.

258
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,160
It looks perfect on you.

259
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,710
It's good.

260
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,940
That's it. How much is it?

261
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,100
2,688 yuan.

262
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,460
Okay.

263
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:13,940
How much is it?

264
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,050
2,688.

265
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,450
Sorry, we don't want it.

266
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,380
Put it on. Don't take it off.

267
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
-Wear it. -No. No.

268
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,060
Wear it.

269
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,990
Don't go.

270
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,020
Qiu Bizheng has a big ego.

271
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,070
When you talk to him,

272
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,470
just keep up appearance for him.

273
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,120
Say whatever he wants to hear.

274
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,630
Alright.

275
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,780
Mr. Wu is the big boss.

276
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,330
Be polite to him.

277
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,450
By the way,

278
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,540
play it by ear

279
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,980
when Xu Banxia comes later.

280
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,880
Xu, you are here.

281
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,900
We're waiting for you.

282
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,940
Let me introduce.

283
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,940
This is my babe.

284
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,480
Babe, this is Banxia.

285
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,460
Banxia.

286
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,180
Feng always mentioned you to me.

287
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,570
We finally meet today.

288
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,730
You have a well-deserved reputation.

289
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,540
Right.

290
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,060
Do you know, Banxia?

291
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,460
You are my role model.

292
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,820
I always tell Feng

293
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,220
it would be great

294
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,340
if I were half as good as you.

295
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,740
Feng.

296
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,140
Your new wife?

297
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,450
I have to take her out

298
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,730
to see the world.

299
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,220
I need her to help me

300
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,170
with the factory in the future.

301
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,220
If she has any questions,

302
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,220
please let her ask you.

303
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,040
Xu, I'm here

304
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,050
waiting for you.

305
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,320
As you know,

306
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,260
they're up to no good.

307
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,410
If they say

308
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,740
something bullshit,

309
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,140
don't be angry.

310
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,720
Just do me a favor.

311
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,390
Okay?

312
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,860
What are you talking about? Why should I be angry?

313
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,650
That's right.

314
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,030
Let's go.

315
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,780
No anger.

316
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,340
This way.

317
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:47,820
This way.

318
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,160
Mr. Wu booked the biggest room.

319
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,580
Who will be there?

320
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,260
Xu is here.

321
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:57,980
Miss Xu,

322
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,860
we've been waiting for you.

323
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,510
I'm glad you came.

324
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,050
Dong is here too.

325
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,100
Hello, Miss Xu.

326
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,060
Nice hairstyle.

327
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,560
Was the food good in jail?

328
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,340
How can the food in jail be good?

329
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,030
Please come in.

330
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,610
Come here.

331
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,610
Mr. Wu, you invited so many people today.

332
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,380
Is it necessary?

333
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,240
Yes, it is.

334
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,200
We're friends.

335
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,320
Come here. Have a seat.

336
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,820
Why is Mr. Zhao here?

337
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,870
He has nothing to do with this, right?

338
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,010
Yes, he has.

339
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,210
You won't be here without Mr. Zhao.

340
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,380
Besides,

341
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,810
you should thank Mr. Zhao.

342
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,460
Without Mr. Zhao,

343
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,330
Miss Xu wouldn't get to where you are today.

344
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,940
Right?

345
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,610
Yes, you're right.

346
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,190
Come on.

347
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:42,970
Have a seat.

348
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,740
Come on.

349
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,820
In that case,

350
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,940
Mr. Zhao, sit here.

351
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,180
No, you...

352
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,860
I'll sit here.

353
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll sit here.

354
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,530
Right-hand seat please, Miss Xu.

355
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,040
Right.

356
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,500
-Sit at the right-hand seat. -Sit here. Sit here.

357
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,240
Then I...

358
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,460
Sit down.

359
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,180
Come on.

360
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,910
Since Mr. Zhao doesn't move,

361
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,090
I'll sit here.

362
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,660
Well...

363
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,760
Mr. Qin, right-hand seat for you.

364
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,320
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

365
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,460
Miss Xu.

366
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,940
This is your fault.

367
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,960
You have to save face for Mr. Wu.

368
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,900
If you don't take this seat,

369
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,640
who else deserves it? Please take the right-hand seat.

370
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,780
Alright then.

371
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,620
Ladies first. We'll listen to Miss Xu.

372
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,500
Qin, sit here.

373
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,900
Mr. Wu told you to...

374
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,760
It's not appropriate.

375
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,780
Don't pull me.

376
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,340
Sit down.

377
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,460
Have a seat.

378
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,100
Have a seat.

379
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,240
We're all friends.

380
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,100
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

381
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,140
Okay, everyone is here.

382
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,680
We can start the banquet.

383
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,390
Thank you for coming.

384
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,140
Well, I invited you here

385
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,880
to celebrate

386
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,660
that Guo got outside.

387
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,420
To be honest, a friend is better than an enemy.

388
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,490
Let's take this opportunity

389
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,940
to communicate with each other and resolve the misunderstanding.

390
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,430
Another thing is Mr. Zhao.

391
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,740
We need to comfort Mr. Zhao.

392
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:20,609
Mr. Zhao.

393
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,980
What's there to comfort me about?

394
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,420
The difficulties are temporary.

395
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,500
Don't worry.

396
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,700
I'm good

397
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,500
as always.

398
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,850
I like your confidence.

399
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,940
Okay.

400
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,860
Be confident.

401
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,620
Well, Guo,

402
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,350
say something.

403
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,220
Miss Xu.

404
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,330
I...

405
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,230
I don't drink today.

406
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,180
I have to meet some friends later.

407
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,270
It's okay if you don't drink. Just listen.

408
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,660
Qiu held up

409
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,170
while I was in there.

410
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,100
Thank you.

411
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,840
If it weren't for your channel of steel scrap,

412
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,630
he would have gone bankrupt.

413
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,220
I'll drink it up.

414
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,050
You mean,

415
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,230
without you,

416
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,820
Mr. Qiu's factory would have gone bankrupt?

417
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,780
Is that what you mean?

418
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,300
That's not what he meant.

419
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,330
He's been in there for too long.

420
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,740
He don't know how to talk when he comes out.

421
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,950
He might sound a bit annoyed.

422
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,620
Dong, listen.

423
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,570
Let bygones be bygones.

424
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,940
You can't make the same mistake

425
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,460
anymore.

426
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,730
I do have difficulties,

427
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,380
but I admit my mistake.

428
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,350
I won't make the same mistake again.

429
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,300
Since everyone is here today.

430
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,060
I have something to say.

431
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,580
Mr. Qiu and I

432
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,470
never owe you a penny

433
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,170
or delay any payment, right?

434
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,940
I just want to make it clear today.

435
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,140
I admit everything, wrong or right.

436
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,340
We have to collaborate in the future.

437
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,420
Do business together.

438
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,430
I don't want to hide secrets.

439
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,770
Miss Xu.

440
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,180
As for that one million,

441
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,590
please don't fixate on it with me.

442
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,090
Don't think I'm kicking a man when he's down.

443
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,010
May I ask

444
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,420
why you

445
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,730
didn't tell Mr. Qiu

446
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,470
what I did

447
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,820
when I lent you money

448
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,610
while you stocked steel scrap?

449
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,180
Did you

450
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,720
do the right thing?

451
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,220
I'm being honest with you

452
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,010
today,

453
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,900
because I really want to

454
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,360
get it over.

455
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,240
From now on,

456
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,360
let's not talk about it anymore.

457
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,230
Bottoms up.

458
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,860
Guo.

459
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,410
Qiu.

460
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,090
Remember

461
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,660
to follow the rules

462
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,780
in the future.

463
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,110
Businessmen in Binhai

464
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,610
do business so well

465
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,060
because we follow the rules.

466
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,190
Mr. Wu is right.

467
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,990
Binhai people do business well

468
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,980
not only because we follow the rules,

469
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,490
but also because we care about the relationship.

470
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,690
It's over.

471
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,000
What Miss Xu said just now

472
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,480
was very good.

473
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,610
It's over.

474
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,780
I have high blood pressure.

475
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,340
I can't drink normally,

476
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,570
but I have to propose a toast today.

477
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,130
This is meaningful.

478
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,360
First, I want to thank Miss Xu for her generosity.

479
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,980
Second, I'd like to thank Mr. Wu for his arrangement.

480
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,940
I suggest

481
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,250
we should work together

482
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,840
and make our business thrive.

483
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,070
Cheers.

484
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,900
Come on.

485
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,600
Cheers.

486
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,300
Come on.

487
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,860
Together.

488
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,260
Together.

489
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,780
Together.

490
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,300
Come on.

491
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,060
Cheers.

492
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,990
Thank you very much for coming.

493
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,140
Mr. Wu said

494
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,130
you wouldn't be here if I hadn't come.

495
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,790
Mr. Wu was right.

496
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,860
Cheers.

497
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,540
I have something else to tell you about.

498
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,340
You must have all heard of

499
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,700
the bidding for the sale of State No.2 Steel.

500
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,570
This is the first time

501
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,580
for a state-owned enterprise to change into a proprietary company in our province.

502
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,150
I think

503
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,330
we can work together

504
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,650
and get the State No.2 Steel deal.

505
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,940
Let's become

506
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,980
real partners.

507
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,330
Qiu, say something.

508
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,490
Okay.

509
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,620
We've discussed this

510
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,380
in private.

511
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,220
We just need to split up our shares.

512
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
In my opinion,

513
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,680
Mr. Wu has 50%.

514
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,560
I have 20%.

515
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,160
Miss Xu, you also have 20%.

516
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Feng,

517
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,650
the remaining 10% is yours.

518
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,460
In this way,

519
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,280
we can gather money

520
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,420
to do things easily.

521
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,530
Xu,

522
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,140
what do you think?

523
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:35,900
Mr. Wu,

524
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,010
did you divide the shares?

525
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,650
Xu, here's the thing.

526
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,220
We will definitely face many difficulties

527
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,180
managing a previous state-owned enterprise from our perspective of private capital.

528
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,680
It's a good thing,

529
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,780
but at the same time, there are risks.

530
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,260
In fact,

531
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,270
we're all testing each step before taking it.

532
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,760
Since I'm the oldest,

533
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
I should take more risks

534
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,690
than you.

535
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,420
Your company has just started.

536
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,940
You have many things to deal with.

537
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,180
Besides, you're not familiar with those people from the province.

538
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,770
We need to unite

539
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,970
to make big money.

540
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,540
Right?

541
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,960
So that's why

542
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,480
I can invite Mr. Qin over.

543
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,030
Mr. Wu.

544
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,370
I'm not appointed yet.

545
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,110
This will happen soon.

546
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,400
Don't be modest, Mr. Qin.

547
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,340
To be honest,

548
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,440
I've talked to Mr. Qin

549
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
about our sales channel for State No.2 Steel in the future.

550
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,380
We'll have a strategic partnership

551
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,020
with Rongste later.

552
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,460
Mr. Qin has confirmed on that.

553
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,500
The sales channels are settled.

554
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,660
Don't worry.

555
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,380
Let's toast Mr. Qin.

556
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,300
Thank you for your help, Mr. Qin.

557
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,180
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

558
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,540
Cheers.

559
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Thank you.

560
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,060
Cheers.

561
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,980
Don't mention it.

562
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,900
It's my pleasure.

563
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,200
A toast to you.

564
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,860
Xu, didn't you

565
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,830
drink baijiu just now?

566
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,960
What do you think now?

567
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,160
I think

568
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,260
we can talk about our collaboration later.

569
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,660
Mr. Wu is right.

570
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,380
It's important to work together.

571
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,940
I don't know if my idea is appropriate.

572
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,460
Mr. Wu,

573
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,330
you and I each takes 40%.

574
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Mr. Feng, Mr. Qiu,

575
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,090
you split the remaining 20%.

576
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,990
I'll hold the operational right for three years.

577
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,770
If I keep making profits,

578
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,620
I will

579
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,050
buy some of your shares

580
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,490
to ensure my controlling power.

581
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,380
If it doesn't perform well,

582
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,410
we'll talk about it later.

583
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,380
But

584
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,310
if anything goes wrong during this period,

585
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,950
I have the veto right.

586
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,560
What do you think?

587
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,290
Xu.

588
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,910
We can discuss the proportion,

589
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,830
but not the operational right.

590
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:33,960
Mr. Wu,

591
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,370
what Miss Xu suggested was

592
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,350
you two

593
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,570
take 80%.

594
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,550
Then there's only 20% left,

595
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,810
which I have to share with Mr. Feng.

596
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,770
In other words,

597
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,730
I only have 10%.

598
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,200
It doesn't make sense.

599
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,390
Mr. Wu, we can't

600
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,040
let an amateur lead professionals.

601
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,000
I think we need to be careful about

602
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,940
the management right of the steel factory.

603
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,040
Am I right?

604
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,970
Mr. Zhao, are you really hungry?

605
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,260
Don't just eat.

606
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,260
You are also experienced among us.

607
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,060
What's your opinion?

608
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,650
What do you think?

609
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,050
You really want to what I think?

610
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,820
If I have a say,

611
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,620
I think

612
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,410
you should focus on your own business.

613
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,540
It's not about how to divide shares or money

614
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,510
on this steel factory thing.

615
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,450
If you think you can make it

616
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,930
as long as you have money,

617
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,010
then you're too naive.

618
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,290
For example,

619
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,190
It's like we buy a car,

620
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,900
but we don't know how to drive or have a driver.

621
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,340
What can we do about this car?

622
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,420
Shall we push it?

623
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,260
Mr. Zhao.

624
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,380
What do you mean?

625
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,590
Kindness.

626
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,150
I advise everyone not to be impulsive.

627
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,220
So you

628
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,460
are looking down on us?

629
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,480
Mr. Zhao is straight.

630
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,640
He just said what he thought.

631
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,060
As the old saying goes,

632
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,760
whoever understands the times is a great man.

633
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,060
Everyone here today

634
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,600
has worked hard

635
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,310
to get to where we are.

636
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,330
I believe in our times,

637
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,860
a smart person,

638
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,020
a talented person,

639
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,990
and a sensible person

640
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,420
won't be mistreated.

641
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,380
What do you mean by that, Mr. Wu?

642
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,700
You forced me to say it.

643
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Otherwise, I wouldn't have said that.

644
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,380
Of course, I know

645
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,660
you may not listen to

646
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,180
whatever I say,

647
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,310
since you're all passionate about the steel factory.

648
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,980
But I hope you can really think about it.

649
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,020
What have you been through

650
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,560
when importing steel scrap?

651
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,540
Not everything

652
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,420
is positive.

653
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,000
When you calm down,

654
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,980
think about it.

655
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,850
Can you really

656
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,740
make this steel factory run?

657
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,020
Think about it.

658
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,300
OK.

659
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,240
Since you mentioned importing steel scrap,

660
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,640
let's talk about it.

661
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,770
I admit

662
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,630
if we hadn't gone on that trip to import steel scrap,

663
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,900
we wouldn't have achieved

664
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,290
what we have today.

665
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,060
Look.

666
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,580
Now we can even

667
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,060
sit together and discuss

668
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,100
to run the State No.2 Steel.

669
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,250
You contributed a lot to this.

670
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,330
But

671
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,940
I'm afraid the one you really want to help

672
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,380
is not us, right?

673
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,140
We just ate some leftovers.

674
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,630
Mr. Zhao, are you willing

675
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,900
to tell us what you really think?

676
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,030
What's your plan?

677
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,620
Let us learn from you.

678
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,680
Mr. Wu, you're drunk.

679
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,020
Let's call it a day.

680
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
Miss Xu, it's okay.

681
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,090
Mr. Wu has something to tell me.

682
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,700
That's right.

683
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,740
No one can leave before we finish.

684
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,300
Now that everyone is here,

685
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,920
let's talk it through.

686
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,230
Well, Boss.

687
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,780
Sit there and talk.

688
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,950
Foreigner,

689
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,840
when I tried to borrow the deposit from you,

690
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,750
you didn't give me a penny

691
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,530
but gave her that much.

692
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,820
You made her succeed without paying anything.

693
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,660
Without you,

694
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,580
she wouldn't be here today.

695
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,860
Now she has the right to sit here.

696
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,260
How dare she talk to me like that?

697
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,770
She even asked me for the operational right?

698
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,300
When the steel price was low,

699
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,620
if you hadn't helped her,

700
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,020
she would have gone bankrupt.

701
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,020
Two years ago, she begged me to take her

702
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,580
to get the 15,000 tons of steel.

703
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,340
I don't understand you.

704
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,130
You risked your life helping her

705
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,940
and even sicrificed yourself.

706
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,910
What do you want from it?

707
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,770
I don't need to explain what I want to you.

708
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,300
You won't understand.

709
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,530
Mr. Wu, don't think low of me.

710
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,300
Also, why

711
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,500
did I help her instead of you?

712
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,690
You should all know the answer.

713
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,380
After you were scammed when importing steel scrap,

714
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,550
who made it to the end?

715
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,530
Who found a turning point abroad?

716
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,860
All of you were back.

717
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,180
Who made it to the end?

718
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,530
Was it you, Mr. Wu?

719
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,450
Mr. Qiu or Mr. Feng?

720
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,190
None of you.

721
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,490
So why should I help her?

722
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,050
Don't you understand?

723
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,530
Alright, enjoy yourselves.

724
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:23,840
I have to go.

725
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,200
What do you mean?

726
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,950
Did you mean,

727
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,930
without Xu Banxia,

728
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,860
we would all have starved to death?

729
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,860
You can't say

730
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,940
she deserves it

731
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,360
only because she had good luck

732
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,380
and got the chance to make it successful.

733
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,120
You just need to say

734
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,500
who is the most qualified

735
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,340
among us

736
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,540
to get the operational right of State No.2 Steel?

737
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,740
None of you is qualified.

738
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,410
Get your hands off.

739
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,060
No.

740
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,700
Mr. Zhao.

741
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,610
Boss.

742
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,140
Sorry.

743
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,140
Miss Xu.

744
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,160
Miss Xu.

745
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,790
Miss Xu.

746
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,060
Please wait.

747
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:20,720
What's wrong?

748
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,610
Mr. Zhao has left the company.

749
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,350
Do you know about this?

750
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,000
Here's the thing.

751
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,730
I planned to resign with Mr. Zhao,

752
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,580
but

753
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,560
my girlfriend and I

754
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
are getting married soon.

755
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,580
If I resign now,

756
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,250
our marriage

757
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,100
will be ruined.

758
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,750
What does it have to do with me?

759
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,100
What are you trying to say?

760
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,670
Here's the thing.

761
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,620
I'm in a dilemma

762
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,580
in the company.

763
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,020
I can only do

764
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,780
what I was told to.

765
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,950
It's hard for me.

766
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,150
I really don't know

767
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,140
how to say it.

768
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,180
What do you want to say?

769
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,190
Fine.

770
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,060
Let me get straight to the point.

771
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,420
I'm here

772
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,900
to get some information for the company

773
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
about

774
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,540
the imported steel scrap.

775
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,080
Is there anything illegitimate?

776
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,140
What do you mean by "illegitimate"?

777
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,970
Well,

778
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,860
are there any interests

779
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,380
between

780
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,650
you and Mr. Zhao?

781
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,590
Qin Fangping, are you crazy?

782
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,300
Bribery is a crime.

783
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,490
Are you trying to make trouble for Zhao Lei?

784
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,360
No, no.

785
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,240
Miss Xu, you misunderstood.

786
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,300
That's not what I meant.

787
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,290
Here's my advice.

788
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,330
He promoted you as your former leader.

789
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,900
If you dare hurt him now

790
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,900
and kick him when he's down,

791
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
you and your company

792
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,980
won't end well.

793
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,050
Don't let people in the industry

794
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,620
know you're a traitor,

795
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,690
which will ruin your reputation.

796
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,500
Then who would want to collaborate with you?

797
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,880
Zhao Lei is capable.

798
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
When God closes a door, he opens a window.

799
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,070
Who knows

800
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,440
when he will become a boss of another company?

801
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,560
You'd better give yourself leeway.

802
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,739
Waiting for a car?

803
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,600
Let me give you a ride.

804
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,370
Are you interested in working at my company?

805
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,300
Think about it.

806
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,560
Where's your car? It's cold.

807
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,680
Over there.

808
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,020
