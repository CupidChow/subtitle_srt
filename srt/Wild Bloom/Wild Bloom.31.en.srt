Why not?

As soon as she was pregnant,

138
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,430
I took her pulse.

139

As soon as I felt her pulse,

I knew she was having a girl.

141

From that day on,

143

I went out to buy her osmanthus cakes every day.

There's the choice of osmanthus cakes.

145
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,180
Every morning I got up early

146
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,390
to buy the first pot of osmanthus cakes.

147
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,340
It tastes different.

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,100
In winter,

when it snowed,

150
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,830
I wrapped the osmanthus cakes

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,640
with a scarf.

152
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,630
Then put this scarf

153
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,070
in my arms

154
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,710
and walk home.

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,680
When I put the cake on the table,

156
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,430
it's still warm.

157
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,110
Even hot.

158
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,440
I sat there

159
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,720
watching her mother

166

The baby can't have the smell of amniotic fluid.

167

Look at her now.

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,030
about her mother.

175
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,600
Her health was not good.

176
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,590
She suffered a lot

177
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,640
because of the pregnancy.

178
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,820
She drank bowls and bowls of

179
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,850
the herbal medicine I made for her.

180
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,010
It's bitter,

181
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,220
but she drank them all.

182
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
After all we done,

183
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,550
she still had a difficult labour.

184
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,500
I felt heart-broken thinking about it.

185
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,960
I don't know if the medicine does not work,

186
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,430
or the dosage is not enough.

187
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,790
Anyway,

188
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,140
the baby was born,

189
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,120
but she was gone.

190
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,570
Cat, the noodles are ready.

191
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Eat it while it's warm.

192
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,480
Okay.

193
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,010
The noodles...

194
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:24,960
Where are you going?

195
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,750
The hospital.

196
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,300
Why does she in such a hurry?

197
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,140
To do the prenatal checkup?

198
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,410
What prenatal checkup?

199
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,860
Didn't she say

200
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,790
she's not sure if she wants the baby.

201
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,270
Do you have to tell her about mother's difficult labor?

202
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,180
I told you she's pregnant.

203
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,760
By the way,

204
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,990
there was an outsider just now.

205
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,750
So there's something urgent

206
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,630
I didn't tell you.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,670
He's back.

208
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,100
Who?

209
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,170
Wang Quan

210
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,570
Wang Quan is back.

211
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,390
He drove me here.

212
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,930
He knows you live here.

213
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,930
If Wang Quan knows you live here,

214
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,930
you won't be safe.

215
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
If he dares to come here,

216
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,620
I'll kill him today.

217
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,440
Alright, you should go home now.

218
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,700
If anything happens to you,

219
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,870
I have to take care of you.

220
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,340
You are my daughter.

221
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,650
How can I not care about you?

222
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,930
By the way,

223
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:32,930
I brought this

224
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,340
passbook here today.

225
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,710
The money in here was yours.

226
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,180
You can see if this is enough

227

to get a bigger house?

228
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,710

Let me make it clear.

231
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,880
I won't pick her up.

232
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,990
Just let her calm down at your place.

233
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,250
Wildcat went to the hospital.

234
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,990
Go to the hospital to find her.

235
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,460
She went to the hospital?

Let me tell you.

Even if she doesn't want this child,

239
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,670
you have to talk to her properly.

240

Don't hurt her.

241
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,370
Do you hear me?

242

Ok, I got it.

Remember, his name is Wang Quan.

249
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,220
I don't know if he changed his name.

250
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,420
He's driving a taxi now.

251
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,020
The license plate number is Jiang C12458.

You go where she goes.

256
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,760
What happened to Boss?

257
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,350
Cut the crap.

Why aren't you answering my call?

262

What's wrong?

263

I just finished a meeting. I'm at work.

Stop working.

Look at your baby.

It's been six weeks.

278

Everything is fine.

279

The baby is growing very well.

280

I can hear heartbeat.

Since I was kicked in there,

My bladder couldn't save pee.

341

I need to put a plastic bucket in my car,

342

So that I could pee anytime anywhere.

343

I dare not drink water all day long.

344

Sometimes I can't carry the bucket,

345
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,390
I can only buy diapers.

Now I drive a taxi,

347

I can't even change diapers when I'm busy.

348
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,420
My crotch is almost rotting.

349
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,490
Because of it,

350
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,090
I can't go to the bathhouse.

351

Tell me,

352
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,630
how can you

353

make up for it?

354
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,530
Your business is quite big.

Right, Miss Xu?

356
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,930

What should I do?

As long as you are happy,

I feel uncomfortable.

You want to bully me?

we can't file a case.

What should we do?

387
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,230
I think

388
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,940
this is not over.

389
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,450
He should still be in the hospital.

390
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,220
I'll talk to him again.

391
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,440
Stop looking for him.

392
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,420
He's crazy. It's useless.

We have to talk.

Don't worry, I know what to do.

I'll go with you.

396
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,910
You shouldn't go again.

397
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,100
Go home now.

398
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,370
Wildcat must have been waiting for you all night.

399

Don't worry. It's fine.

400
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,460
Call me if anything happens.

According to the field assessment,

the first phase of Yuzhou Steel Plant

is qualified.

and start the work as soon as possible.

Thank you for taking care of my brother.

the production of the new steel factory?

440
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,320
I think

00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,620
real estate using steel

442
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,610
will reach saturation.

443
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,800
The future belongs to a high-quality product market.

444

Such as the surgical knife,

445

the essential equipment for aircraft and navigation.

These things will be popular

in the future.

451

Ok, stop bragging.

452
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,010
This just an empty talk.

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,460
he's overly ambitious?

455

A minor concussion.

503

But her vitals are stable now.

504

She needs to rest.

505

Fortunately, the workers who worked overtime

to debug the equipment found her in time

and caught the man.

You don't have to thank me.

686
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,860
I believe in your professional judgment.

687
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,380
If there's nothing else,

688
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm hanging up.

689
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,170
Mr. Qiu, here's to you.

690
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,950
Don't toast me yet.

691
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,320
Listen.

692
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Miss Xu agreed to meet you

693
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,710
doesn't mean it'll work.

694
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,650
This is the first point.

695
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,530
Second,

696
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,420
I've never seen what you just showed me

697
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,290
on your phone.

698
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:47,780
I understand.

699
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,080
Mr. Qiu,

700
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,410
With your help,

701
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,440
I'm sure

702
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,410
we can make it.

703
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,600
Also, Mr. Qiu,

704
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,480
whether it works or not,

705
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,510
this amount

706
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,560
will be yours.
