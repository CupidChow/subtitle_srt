Why don't you

have a taste?

111
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,060
We're a decent company.

112

Why do you need aesthetics at work?

113
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,820
We just need to have a decent image.

114

A decent company?

115

A decent company sells scrap steel?

116
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,000
If I don't sell scrap steel,

117

how can the truck team get new cars?

118

Stop kidding.

119

Without Tong Xiaoqi,

120
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,220
would you still be alive?

121
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,470
Yes, you're right.

122
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,740
I didn't have chance

123
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,910
to say thank you.

124
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,700
You've been working with him for half a year.

125
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,020
It's quite tough.

126
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,650
Thank you.

127
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,370
But I still don't understand

128
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,820
why a young lady like you

129
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,540
was willing to do the tough work with him

130
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,730
for half a year.

131
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,510
My dad was in prison before.

132
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,340
Just like Tong Xiaoqi.

133
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:39,760
Five years.

134
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,049
At that time,

135
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,040
he ran a steel mill with my mom.

136
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,850
He wanted to take everyone to make more money.

137
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,300
Then they started working secretly

138
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,020
and produced another batch of steel out of the plan.

139
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,120
Then it was investigated.

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,820
But my dad took all the blame.

141
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,270
He took the blame for my mom.

142
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,280
Doesn't it look like Tong's situation?

143
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:05,980
Of course.

144
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,740
I'm not my mom.

145
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,870
He's not my dad either.

146
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,180
Excuse me?

147
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,780
Coming.

148
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,980
Can you find me a pair of leather shoes to match my suit?

149
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,340
Okay.

150
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,060
Thank you.

151
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:21,860
You're welcome.

152
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,710
What happened next?

153
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:25,950
After that...

154
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,970
After my dad got out of prison,

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,820
he got sick

156
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,390
and stopped working.

157
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,420
But all the decisions my mom made

158
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,880
was actually made by my dad.

159
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Due to the support of my dad,

160
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,800
she gains whatever she owns today.

161
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,200
I like Tong Xiaoqi

162
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,910
also because

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,300
that

164
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,250
he treats you so well.

165
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,800
I was thinking

166
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,350
if I fall in love with him

167
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,390
and become his girlfriend,

168
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
he would be much nicer to me.

169
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,410
Okay.

170
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,400
Look at me. Satisfied?

171
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,370
If I want to thank a man,

172
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,390
what should I buy

173
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,260
for him?

174
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,510
A man?

175
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,380
How old is he? What does he do?

176
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm telling you, giving gifts

177
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,100
is a delicate matter.

178
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,470
Do you like him?

179
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,140
If you like him, I'll recommend some certain kind.

180
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,910
If you don't, that's another type of gifts.

181
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,510
Don't think too much.

182
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,190
Check, please.

183
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,990
The suit and the pair of shoes.

184
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,660
Tell me about him.

185
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,590
Do I know him?

186
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,140
Promise me that

187
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,530
if you really love Tong Xiaoqi,

188
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,050
keep an eye on him.

189
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:28,980
Hello, Miss Xu.

190
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,600
Hello.

191
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,340
Hello.

192
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,450
There's a lot in Black Sea. Don't worry.

193
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,380
You can have as much as you want.

194
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,560
This is your seat.

195
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,940
Why have you changed your style?

196
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,090
From today onwards,

197
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,500
Miss Gao will work here.

198
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,340
She's with you. You should guide her.

199
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,220
You've incorporated her?

200
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,540
What do you mean?

201
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,460
I came here

202
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,170
for the sake of Tong Xiaoqi.

203
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,350
You can discuss

204
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,870
and communicate on business more.

205
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,180
I'll get back to work.

206
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,340
Okay.

207
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,340
Have a seat, please.

208
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,380
I'll finish the accounts first.

209
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,630
I'll give you a task later.

210
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,430
31511.

211
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,210
Wrong calculation.

212
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,770
You can't even distinguish the bank debit from the loan.

213
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,620
Step aside.

214
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,140
You know how to do it?

215
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,090
Step aside.

216
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,030
You really know? Come here.

217
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,110
Try it.

218
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,150
Where is the contract?

219
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,350
Here, the sales agreement.

220
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,320
What are you doing?

221
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,260
Carry them to the car.

222
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,390
What happened?

223
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,820
Cut the crap and do it.

224
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,920
Why are the police here?

225
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,040
Is it necessary?

226
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,280
Your factory can do it without me?

227
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,590
1,000 per ton.

228
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,150
You really don't regret it?

229
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,180
It's almost 1,500 yuan now.

230
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,720
It's my pleasure. That's a thank gift.

231
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,100
Smith.

232
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,970
You did a great job for the company.

233
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,980
I look forward to working with you.

234
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,660
Happy cooperation.

235
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,680
There's a Chinese saying that

236
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,020
we will be more  familiar with  each other next time.

237
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,180
If necessary,

238
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,470
our company is willing to cooperate with you again.

239
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,780
Happy cooperation.

240
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,770
Happy cooperation.

241
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,460
Thank you.

242
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,430
This is for you.

243
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,150
Mine?

244
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:32,890
One million.

245
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,260
What do you mean?

246
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,610
You've helped me a lot.

247
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,660
This is a gift to express my gratitude.

248
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,620
Is it a bribery?

249
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,010
I can't take the money.

250
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,650
Thank you.

251
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,580
If you really want to thank me,

252
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,230
treat me a meal.

253
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,540
Okay, my treat.

254
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,420
Well, today？

255
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,810
Okay.

256
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,460
What's wrong with the factory?

257
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,830
Nobody is working.

258
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,810
What are you doing?

259
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,430
Feng Yu.

260
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,900
Let's settle the score.

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,820
What should we do?

262
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,380
Xu, you're finally here.

263
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,740
Sister-in-law.

264
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,500
Let's

265
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,980
talk it out.

266
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,260
Don't divorce.

267
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,770
As for Feng Yu,

268
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,930
we'll criticize him for you.

269
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,780
Don't make yourself angry.

270
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,240
Don't get too angry. It's bad for your health.

271
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,060
Xu,

272
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,300
how do I treat you?

273
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,460
You're very nice to me.

274
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,070
You've always treated me as your own sibling.

275
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,660
Siblings?

276
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:57,860
Then why did you

277
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,020
help this bastard

278
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,120
lie to me?

279
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
You're a woman too.

280
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,530
How could you do that?

281
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,970
None of you is good.

282
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,000
It's been more than ten years.

283
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,310
I've been treating him so well.

284
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,780
I gave him everything.

285
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,400
What did I get in the end?

286
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,200
He said we didn't have love.

287
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,720
Then why did you marry me?

288
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,420
Why did you get married with me?

289
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,180
Sister-in-law.

290
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,300
Tell me what love is!

291
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,450
Sister-in-law, don't be angry.

292
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:27,700
Don't worry.

293
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,780
No matter when,

294
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,900
we will only recognize you.

295
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,080
Look at this factory.

296
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
Without you, this factory wouldn't be where it is today.

297
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,460
It was so hard in the past few years.

298
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,640
We've been through it.

299
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,100
When you think back to it,

300
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,420
you shouldn't have gone this far.

301
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,180
Besides,

302
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,630
the situation is so good now.

303
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,840
Making money is like stealing money.

304
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,410
Good days just started.

305
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,490
Yes, just because good days are here,

306
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,420
let's live our own lives.

307
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,210
In the past, we had no money, only debts.

308
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,720
We didn't dare to divorce.

309
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,000
Now we have money.

310
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,220
I don't want to

311
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,860
live in fear anymore.

312
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,740
Maybe one day the steel price will drop again.

313
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,300
I can't divorce him even if I want to.

314
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,260
Let's divorce.

315
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,420
Sister-in-law,

316
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,100
don't think about anything else.

317
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,060
You should think for your child.

318
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,320
You can't take this step.

319
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,540
Don't worry. From now on,

320
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,060
we'll keep an eye on Feng.

321
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,780
Xu, comfort her.

322
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,640
Sister-in-law,

323
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,620
if you have made up your mind,

324
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,020
I won't persuade you to stay.

325
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,630
My heart is dead.

326
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,230
Forget it.

327
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,620
It's not that I haven't tried.

328
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,560
It's not that I haven't endured it.

329
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,190
Maybe he's right.

330
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,030
That's not love.

331
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,600
Then give it back to him.

332
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,670
Feng Yu.

333
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,380
From now on,

334
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,100
you don't have to say

335
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,010
this factory belongs to our family.

336
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,100
From now on,

337
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,470
this factory is yours.

338
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,610
It belongs to you.

339
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,290
It's not easy for this factory to come this far.

340
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,490
You and your babe,

341
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,730
please run it well.

342
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,630
You two can be my witnesses.

343
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,940
I only took

344
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,020
half of our assets that belongs to me.

345
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,100
I didn't bully him.

346
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,260
Sister-in-law.

347
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,260
Sister-in-law.

348
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,680
Feng, look at you.

349
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,530
What a good life.

350
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,430
How did it end up like this?

351
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,500
Besides, this factory

352
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,370
was supported by your wife.

353
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
If you babe can do it,

354
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,690
it will go bankrupt sooner or later.

355
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,450
Look at you now.

356
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,980
You made people look down on you,

357
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,660
how can they

358
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,620
do business with you?

359
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,260
That's good.

360
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,250
I'm quitting.

361
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,330
How much money is enough for people?

362
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,110
Just let it go.

363
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,220
What are you doing?

364
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,460
What are you doing?

365
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,010
You don't treasure your good life,

366
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,980
and insisted on getting a divorce!

367
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,160
Qiu Bizheng sued Guo Qidong.

368
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,820
He will get at least a two-year penalty.

369
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:25,890
This...

370
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:27,940
You...

371
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,940
Look at you.

372
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,300
I asked you to persuade her.

373
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,680
How could you say that to her?

374
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,660
Well,

375
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,380
you can only share the hardship, not the happiness.

376
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,530
Whatever.

377
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,060
I don't care.

378
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,180
Am I late?

379
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,540
No, I came early.

380
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,230
Congratulations.

381
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,510
You've finally become a rich woman.

382
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,970
You must be happy

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,910
seeing the steel price rise every day.

384
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,230
What is this?

385
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,620
We've been through a lot.

386
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,300
I think the scrap steel market

387
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,510
still has room to rise.

388
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,710
So I raised some money

389
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,410
and got some steel from Black Sea.

390
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,500
I bet the price will keep rising.

391
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,140
Where did you get the money?

392
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,090
I brought Wu Jianjian and others in.

393
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,430
We'll sell the steel out immediately.

394
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,810
The difference is pretty high.

395
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,170
I can see

396
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,270
you are really gambling.

397
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,290
Thank you.

398
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,050
This is called courage.

399
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,560
Otherwise, how can I get to where I am today?

400
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,730
I have a big plan.

401
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,460
Do you want to take a look?

402
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:29,800
Okay.

403
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,690
This is the blueprint of my storage yard.

404
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,150
I bought this land.

405
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,430
In the future, I will build

406
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,720
a pier that can anchor 10,000-ton ships here.

407
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,750
If that's the case,

408
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,020
you'll still have a lot of financial pressure in the future.

409
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,130
What will you do

410
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,340
if another crisis like the one that occurred before?

411
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,480
Not every time could you be so lucky.

412
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,190
So I hope

413
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,550
to get your support.

414
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,180
Of course. I'm here for you.

415
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,260
Of course.

416
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,220
Only if the company

417
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,900
is still under my control.

418
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:12,980
I will support you.

419
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,700
But the situation

420
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,780
is different now.

421
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,340
What do you mean?

422
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,310
I want to leave.

423
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,760
Why?

424
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,140
The steel price has increased.

425
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,020
Your company earned a lot

426
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,260
in this deal.

427
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,280
But after going through so many things,

428
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,670
I finally understand

429
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,660
I can't work under the Southeast Asian.

430
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,020
But I can't leave for a while.

431
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,610
They are still auditing me.

432
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,410
Is there anything I can help you with?

433
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,560
No.

434
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,940
Mr. Zhao,

435
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,220
if you trust me,

436
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,280
the one million you rejected today

437
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,380
will be my invitation

438
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,580
for inviting you as my risk consultant.

439
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,740
Help me to watch the scrap-steel importing business.

440
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,150
This is the payment to you.

441
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,950
I will continue to do

442
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,970
the steel-scrap importing.

443
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,060
From now on, I'll pay you

444
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,380
every time I make a profit.

445
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,180
Consider it an investment to me.

446
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm not bribing you.

447
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,690
Take this money as your investment.

448
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,180
You should give me a chance

449
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,660
to express my gratitude.

450
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,460
That's a good idea.

451
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,870
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

452
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,730
Why are you thanking me?

453
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,350
I should thank you

454
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,040
fo making money together with me.

455
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,180
In that case,

456
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,210
with your funds,

457
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,580
you can share the risk with me.

458
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,220
And I'll have someone

459
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,690
who can discuss things with.

460
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,090
Thinking that we can still be like before,

461
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,140
I feel so relieved.

462
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,220
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

463
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,990
We definitely will.

464
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,600
By the way,

465
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,620
I have a gift for you.

466
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,840
What is this?

467
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,180
Open it.

468
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,260
I hope you like it.

469
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,300
Let me guess.

470
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,770
Is it a necklace?

471
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,930
Isn't it too precious?

472
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,450
It's a paper cutter.

473
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,040
European nobles

474
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,200
give this to each other.

475
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,710
It's a token of friendship.

476
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,150
They wish their friends have prosperous career.

477
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,540
A gift of friendship?

478
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,550
It's a good knife.

479
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:55,930
[1998]

480
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,620
Bravo.

481
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,780
Today the city's first 10,000-ton

482
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,200
private freight terminal opens.

483
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,540
This is the first 10,000-ton private freight terminal in our city

484
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,550
-and even in our province. -Come here, Chief.

485
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,540
Come, sit here please.

486
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,050
This represents our city's private enterprises

487
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,680
have entered upon a new phase.

488
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,650
What's worth mentioning is

489
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,040
-the owner of this pier  -Stand closer.

490
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,870
is a very young

491
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,620
businesswoman in the city,

492
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,840
Miss Xu Banxia.

493
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,180
Her

494
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,210
Binhai Banxia Steel International Trading Co., Ltd.

495
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,460
is also a very young company.

496
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,330
Although it was not established long ago,

497
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
it has become the mainstay of

498
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,800
private steel enterprises in our province.

499
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,130
Bravo! Bravo!

500
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,600
Bravo!

501
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,950
Dear leaders,

502
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,420
distinguished guests,

503
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,580
we gather here today

504
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,780
in the fruitful season.

505
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,140
It's warm today.

506
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,210
Our hearts are also burning hot.

507
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,210
-What do you think of the script I wrote? -We're also passionate.

508
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,130
Not bad.

509
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,760
I'll write your speech of congratulation

510
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,440
for your wedding ceremony.

511
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:31,960
-No. -No.

512
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,580
It's a new spring.

513
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,860
The warm smell of spring

514
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,090
comes in my heart.

515
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,950
The continuous river...

516
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,600
Thank you very much

517
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,490
for coming here today

518
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,630
to witness

519
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,180
the extremely important event to me.

520
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,490
The construction of storage yard and pier

521
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,580
is completed successfully today.

522
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,500
We can't make it without your hard work.

523
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,290
I believe that with our joint efforts

524
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,410
and everyone's trust,

525
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,380
I will be more confident

526
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,710
to make our storage yard

527
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,860
into a national class

528
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,900
and even world-class

529
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,540
material storage yard distributing center.

530
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,480
We'll let more steel supplies

531
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,860
make contribution to our country's construction.

532
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,730
Bravo!

533
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,420
Bravo!

534
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,620
Bravo!

535
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,200
Bravo!

536
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,960
Qiu, I was wrong.

537
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,860
I really thank you

538
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,740
for forgiving me

539
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:52,850
and coming to see me.

540
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,320
I feel guilty.

541
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,360
I've learned a lesson.

542
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,820
Every day I'm here,

543
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,920
I've been reflecting.

544
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,050
I'm very happy

545
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,040
to see your attitude.

546
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,620
And don't worry.

547
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,910
Lawyer Zhou is going through the procedures of

548
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,720
your application for sentence reduction.

549
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,000
The result will be out soon.

550
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,870
Thank you, Qiu.

551
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,200
Thank you so much.

552
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,480
I have one more thing today.

553
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,720
There's something wrong with

554
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,380
the proportional valve of the hydraulic shearing machine.

555
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,780
I asked the engineer.

556
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,980
It will cost 150,000 for changing the four of them.

557
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,260
Let me see.

558
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,420
Take a look, please.

559
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,360
Mr. Qiu, you don't need to change this proportional valve.

560
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,380
Look at this.

561
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,510
Look here.

562
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,040
This is the Container Marshaling Yard

563
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,300
and Marshaling Yard.

564
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,530
Now the collect port operation

565
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
and harbor operation

566
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,450
have all been executed properly.

567
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,900
Our company is also studying

568
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,920
how to complete the double-container yard plan.

569
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,210
Loading and unloading can be at the same time. And the resources can be wisely allocated.

570
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,830
The warehouse here

571
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,730
is mainly stored for reefer containers

572
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,300
and dangerous cargo containers.

573
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,170
That's pretty good.

574
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,820
It seems that our era

575
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,180
has passed.

576
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,350
Who said that?

577
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,180
She did develop rapidly.

578
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,070
But whether she can go far and steadily or not,

579
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,560
let's wait and see.

580
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,020
You're right.

581
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,250
So you should think about transformation.

582
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,540
President Gao, what do you mean?

583
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,550
The country's industrial system is changing.

584
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,020
The old heavy industrial equipment

585
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,500
will be replaced by new technology.

586
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,400
Some outdated heavy equipment

587
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,900
will be gradually eliminated by our country.

588
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,810
But if private enterprises

589
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,580
can take over the equipment

590
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,000
and make some technical improvement at this time,

591
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,780
it will still be very profitable.

592
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,990
Later,

593
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,870
I have something to tell her.

594
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,050
Help to persuade her later.

595
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,060
To persuade her?

596
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,400
What is it about?

597
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,310
What else could it be?

598
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,980
She and Qiu didn't get alone well with each other.

599
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,900
Guo Qidong will be out soon.

600
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,250
I want to

601
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,610
make peace with them.

602
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,020
Peace is important for us.

603
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,110
I'm here today is to...

604
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,500
I see.

605
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,429
tell you something.

606
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,750
The provincial government is going to reform.

607
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,750
State No.2 Steel is going to be contracted.

608
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,500
This is once in a blue moon

609
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,010
to you.

610
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,260
It's a public bidding this time.

611
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,000
Everyone has the equal chance.

612
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,110
Okay.

613
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:26,880
President Gao,

614
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,360
can I have a word with you?

615
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,840
OK.

616
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,949
Think about what I said carefully.

617
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,210
Okay.

618
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,699
Xu.

619
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,460
Mr. Wu.

620
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,860
-You really worked hard. -Mr. Feng.

621
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,000
First of all, congratulations.

622
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,800
You've made great progress.

623
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,370
It's only been a few years.

624
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,060
From the storage yard to the pier,

625
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:45,980
you've made great progress.

626
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,389
Congratulations.

627
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,429
Congratulations.

628
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,030
I'm flattered.

629
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,110
If it weren't for your

630
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,030
helping and guiding,

631
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,219
I wouldn't be here today.

632
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,889
Look at you.

633
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,699
Not like that.

634
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,030
According to your current development,

635
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,850
maybe

636
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,340
you need to guide us in the future.

637
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:07,900
Feng.

638
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,640
In terms of seniority, it's not my turn yet.

639
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,160
Yes, it's my fault.

640
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,350
What I said is inappropriate.

641
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,180
I expressed my ideas in a wrong way.

642
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Well, I...

643
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,550
want to talk to you about something.

644
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,520
What is it?

645
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,540
Mr. Wu wants you

646
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,550
to do him a favor.

647
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,410
Here's the thing.

648
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,260
It's been a while

649
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,300
since Dong sent to the prison.

650
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,020
Qiu has been busy with

651
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,270
his parole.

652
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,240
Guo Qidong will be out in a few days.

653
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,930
He's trying to get him out?

654
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,270
Aren't he afraid to be hurt again?

655
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,740
Every dog has its day.

656
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,600
Everyone will have difficulties.

657
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,930
For example, Foreigner.

658
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,820
His life

659
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,110
is getting harder and harder.

660
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,100
What's wrong with him?

661
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,300
Don't you know?

662
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,260
He's in big trouble.

663
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,270
He might even be sued.

664
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
His house and car

665
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,920
were taken back by Steve.

666
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,710
He's no longer dignified now.

667
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,630
Really?

668
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,520
Of course. How can I lie to you?

669
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,940
So,

670
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,110
you have to spare others

671
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,740
and leave a way out for them.

672
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,500
Maybe

673
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,660
it might be a way out for yourself later.

674
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,100
Mr. Zhao,

675
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,380
on May 12, 1997,

676
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,180
you signed the contract

677
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,050
with Shandong Laiyang Steel Factory.

678
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,100
Why was the fund three months late?

679
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,240
Please explain.

680
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,350
Mr. Zhao.

681
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,500
from April to July 1996,

682
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,980
the public relations fee in the reimbursement list

683
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,700
has seriously exceeded the standard.

684
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,640
Please explain.

685
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,960
Mr. Zhao, in January 1997,

686
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,490
the 24.5 million loan

687
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,910
related to Binhai Steel Co., Ltd.,

688
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,740
why didn't you

689
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,980
lend it

690
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,950
without the permission of the board.

691
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:34,820
Please explain.

692
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,240
Mr. Zhao.

693
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,060
You have to ask Steve

694
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,340
about Shandong Laiyang Steel Factory's contract.

695
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,540
That's his man.

696
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,810
The fee is exceeded...

697
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,960
You are auditors.

698
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,330
You don't understand

699
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,360
the Market Development.

700
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,560
As for the contract with Banxia Steel,

701
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,790
you can check with

702
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,710
the company's finance.

703
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,510
You'll see how much profit

704
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,790
this contract brought to the company.

705
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,950
Mr. Zhao,

706
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,010
you signed these document

707
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,400
and contracts.

708
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,760
We can only ask you.

709
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,160
What kind of explanation

710
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,540
do you need?

711
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,250
Of course we need the real explanation.

712
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,640
Actually,

713
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,690
you know everything clearly

714
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,870
about these contracts.

715
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,590
I just don't understand

716
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,090
what your true intention is.

717
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
It's been two months.

718
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,750
Cheers.

719
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,260
Cheers.

720
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,060
Fatty, we were so great today.

721
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,870
Do you think we were showing off?

722
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,420
My mom just called me.

723
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,050
She said she saw me on TV.

724
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,350
I think we're returning home in glory, right.

725
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,700
No way.

726
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,900
We're honouring our ancestors.

727
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,460
Almost the same thing.

728
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,440
Have you ever thought about

729
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,800
settting up our own steel mill?

730
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,310
What do you mean?

731
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,880
You're so bold.

732
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,790
Why not?

733
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,260
Have you ever thought

734
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,780
we'd become

735
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,790
a steel producer one day?

736
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,130
We have our own storage yard,

737
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,720
pier,

738
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,590
and our own scrap steel channels.

739
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,460
If we have our own steel mill,

740
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,620
we can make steel by ourselves in the future.

741
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,320
Wu Jianshe's factory will be our downstream firm.

742
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,490
That's right.

743
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,170
Why don't we do it

744
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,920
with what we have on hand?

745
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,170
Boss, I heard that this steel mill

746
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,520
need at least thousands of workers.

747
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,320
We have no experience.

748
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,980
If we don't have experience, we can ask and learn.

749
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,470
As long as we succeed,

750
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,440
no one will

751
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,430
call us second-hand dealers anymore.

752
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:37,980
In the future,

753
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,600
we'll become real industrialists.

754
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,960
Do you remember

755
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,380
the three of us once said

756
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,040
that we'd be very successful in this city in the future?

757
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,560
I think this is an opportunity.

758
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,990
Sleep on it.

759
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,130
Are you in?

760
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:06,670
Yes.

761
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,630
I have to take a call.

762
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,010
Boss.

763
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,780
Why do you suddenly

764
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,940
want to start a steel mill?

765
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,970
I know little about movies.

766
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,920
You choose the movie. I'll go with you.

767
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,620
How are you doing recently?

768
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:30,830
Okay.

769
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:32,960
You hang up first.

770
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,510
Well...

771
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,030
I'm hanging up.

772
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,450
What are you doing? Are you eavesdropping?

773
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,910
Chen, are you in love?

774
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,980
Don't talk nonsense.

775
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,390
Who is she? Tell me.

776
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,970
Fine, since you don't tell me,

777
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,040
I'll let Xu Banxia ask you.

778
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,290
Well...

779
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,170
My mom...

780
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,870
The matchmaking agency introduced her to me.

781
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,020
It's not even clear yet.

782
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,060
Don't tell others.

783
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,350
She's introduced by others? What does she do?

784
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,220
She's a fashion designer.

785
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,660
Her condition is not bad.

786
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:11,910
But

787
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,530
she might not like me.

788
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,390
Let me tell you.

789
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,140
This is only between you and me.

790
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,380
Don't tell this to others.

791
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,920
I can't promise you though.

792
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,180
I'm thinking about

793
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,680
who should I tell first?

794
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:25,690
Wildcat!

795
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,600
Are you idle?

796
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,930
You come here every day.

797
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,570
What are you doing?

798
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,690
You're so unreasonable.

799
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:50,870
What?

800
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,320
Are you in love?

801
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,500
Tell me the truth.

802
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,310
I knew Wildcat had a big mouth.

803
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,620
Tell me, am I right?

804
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,320
So what?

805
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,980
Chen Yuzhou, you're so ungrateful.

806
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,670
Why am I the last one to know?

807
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,380
Keep your voice down.

808
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,460
What do you mean?

809
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,350
It's none of your business.

810
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,340
Tell me more.

811
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,780
Did you hold hands?

812
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,370
Did you kiss?

813
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,430
Do you know how to be in a relationship?

814
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,820
Tong Xiaoqi.

815
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,210
You're a rogue.

816
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,010
This is the Accounting Room. No admittance except on business.

817
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,640
Get out!

818
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,870
Stop talking nonsense.

819
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,720
You...

820
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,500
What does that girl do?

821
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,890
Is she pretty?

822
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,220
What does she want from you?

823
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,940
I'm handsome, okay?

824
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,260
-Get out! -That’s nonsense.

825
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:37,920
Get out!

826
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,380
Stop talking nonsense.

827
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,080
-Get out! -Tell me! Tell me!

828
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,400
Or I'll ask boss.

829
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:42,780
Don't!

830
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,390
Why are you so annoying?

831
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,930
So I'm not the last one to know this.

832
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,340
Listen.

833
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,960
Don't talk nonsense outside.

834
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,660
Tell me. Share with me.

835
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,610
What should I tell you?

836
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,420
Mr. Chen, Miss Xu calls you.

837
00:42:58,730 --> 00:42:59,210
Got it.

838
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,620
Oh no, she knew already.

839
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,000
Big-mouthed!

840
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,620
Why did you hit me? I didn't tell her.

841
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,490
Wait for me here.

842
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,730
Ask me if you have any questions!
