The steel price has increased again.

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,540
Our cost for this deal decreased

7
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,520
by 20% than that of the last one.

I think only when you look down from the sky,

you would see this view.

♫But please bless me in a smile♫

171
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,210

♫Despite the strong wind and heavy rains♫

173

♫I'm still missing you so much♫

174
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,570

♫Not at this time, and don't know exact time♫

186

202
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,730
Banxia.

203
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going home.

204
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,480
I've bought the tickets. Right today.

205
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,490
My cousins were arrested

206
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,510
for scamming as marriage brokers.

207
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,970
I plan to go back and find a good job.

208
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,810
Go back and find a proper job.

209
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,470
You can also work in my company.

210
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,600
Do you think I have the words

211
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,150
"Chen's woman" on my forehead?

212
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,320
I didn't mean that.

213
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,240
Chen left you some money.

214
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,490
Why does he think I need some money?

215
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,420
The first thing I want to do

216
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
after I get home is to fall in love.

217
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,040
I want to find

218
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,430
a healthy person

219
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,140
who loves me.

220
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,610
We can be together happily.

221
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,330
We will work

222
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,290
or

223
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,720
stay home and farm.

224
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,670
I want to forget everything.

225
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,540
I must.

226
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,030
I don't want his money.

227
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,430
I'm a shill of wedding,

228
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,240
but I never love anyone else.

229
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,960
These days,

230
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,349
I feel like I'm going to burn myself dry.

231
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,210
I feel hot in my heart every day.

232
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,900
Whenever I think

233
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,660
of him,

234
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
sometimes I squat on the ground

235
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,400
and I couldn't get up.

236
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,160
It felt like

237
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,910
my heart being pinched by someone.

238
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,220
It felt bad.

239
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,100
I am not hot in my heart now.

240
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,730
And the chances of my heart getting hot are getting less and less.

241
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,820
Also the firewood in my heart

242
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,700
almost burnt out.

243
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,620
I can't buy it back no matter how much he gives me.

244
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,040
I lost a lot  for being a shill.

245
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,210
That's it.

246
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,950
If you see me on the street,

247
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,340
don't greet me.

248
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,120
Okay.

249
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,520
I hope I've never met you.

250
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,700
Okay.

251
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,170
By the way,

252
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,170
this...

253
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,060
Chen bought this bottle

254
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,910
for his travel to Maldives.

255
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,240
He said he would come back with sand for you.

256
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,220
Then he started chemotherapy

257
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,260
and kept losing hair.

258
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,440
One time, I picked it up from the ground.

259
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,780
I wanted to keep it for memory.

260
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,380
Now,

261
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,780
I don't want it anymore.

262
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,020
Okay, I'm leaving.

263
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,070
Boss.

264
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,030
Before Chen left,

265
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,540
he made a list.

266
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,260
He said it was what he really wanted to do

267
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,650
but he didn't have a chance to do.

268
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,800
I learned from him.

269
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,950
I made one too.

270
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,370
Keep an eye on it.

271
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,840
I hope it will come true in my life.

272
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,720
I'll read it to you.

273
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,620
First,

274
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,030
marry Wildcat

275
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,710
and treat her well.

276
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,450
Second,

277
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,500
study more

278
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,200
and share common interests with Wildcat.

279
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,480
Third,

280
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,510
have a baby with Wildcat.

281
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,070
When he grows up,

282
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,660
Wildcat will tutor him in required courses,

283
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,220
and I'll teach him football.

284
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,200
Our blast furnace is a little small now.

285
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,680
It's only 1,050 cubes.

286
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,590
It's too small.

287
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,020
I remember the one of Bao Steel

288
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,250
is more than 4,000 cubes.

289
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,830
Of course theirs is big.

290
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,390
It produces 10,000 tons of steel every day.

291
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,110
The slag alone is more than 3,000 tons.

292
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,360
There are many nodulations in the furnace.

293
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,840
If the quality of coal is not good

294
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,180
or there are too many residues of raw materials,

295
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,290
these will all lead to nodulations.

296
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,990
If it continues to run,

297
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,370
there will be an accident.

298
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,710
We need to change the cooling system,

299
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,430
including environmental pollution system

300
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,570
and sewage treatment.

301
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,600
I don't think the provincial government will take care of it anymore.

302
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,290
It's not written in the contract.

303
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,590
It's written clearly in the contract

304
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,150
the life span of the machines.

305
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,270
Mr. Wu,

306
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,610
I'm a veteran worker.

307
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,720
I have to say something.

308
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,650
If the blast furnace is not repaired completely,

309
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,200
it's not advised to use it again.

310
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,970
Otherwise, it'll be dangerous.

311
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,790
I've put the reports and budget made by engineers

312
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,110
on your desk.

313
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,240
Okay, I see.

314
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,430
The teacher didn't comment on me. He evaluated me in private.

315
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,840
He saw a student sleeping.

316
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,340
-And... -Sleeping?

317
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,780
Yes. And then...

318
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,370
-Give it to me. -And then he said

319
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,210
to him...

320
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,390
Kuan.

321
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,610
Dad.

322
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,530
Come in.

323
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:02,630
Dad.

324
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,490
I suddenly realized

325
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,170
money is nothing.

326
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,030
No matter how much it is,

327
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,290
it can't buy back relationships

328
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,380
♫I want a home♫

329
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,140
and someone who left.

330
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,740
♫It doesn't have to be a fancy place♫

331
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,640
♫When I'm tired♫

332
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,370
♫I'll think of it♫

333
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,120
♫I want a home♫

334
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,540
All these years,

335
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,460

00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,750
Go back.

505
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,220
The factory is very strict now.

506
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,380
You dress like this.

507
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,580
You'll be in trouble if they catch you.

508
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,540
Who dares to arrest me?

509
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,730
The water in our village is heavily polluted.

510
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,250
I'm here to seek justice.

511
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,660
-Uncle . -Let's see who dares to arrest me.

512
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,410
I'm going back.

513
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,490
I have a lot to do in the factory.

514
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,940
-Why are you leaving? -I'm leaving.

515
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,140
You have no conscience.

516
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:13,900
Shall we continue?

517
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,590
Shall we?

518
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,410
Yes, we have to find it.

519
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,490
We must find it.

520
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,590
Car. Car.

521
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,230
What are you doing?

522
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,390
Who are you?

523
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Are you thieves?

524
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,780
No, we didn't steal anything.

525
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,110
We didn't steal.

526
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,320
We didn't steal anything.

527
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,860
We're here for the sewage.

528
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,620
Let's talk in the office.

529
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,110
Okay.

530
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,780
Security! Security!

531
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,200
Arrest them all!

532
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,770
We didn't steal anything.

533
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,770
We didn't steal anything.

534
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,150
[Security Department]

535
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,230
Mr. Qiu.

536
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,720
What's going on?

537
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,780
I don't know where they got in from.

538
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,650
They're looking for the sewage.

539
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,000
Sewage?

540
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,890
A few shrimp ponds in our village

541
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,300
smell like rust.

542
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,550
Many shrimps died.

543
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,910
Many villagers had diarrhea.

544
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,420
They can't be cured for many days.

545
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,320
Among the factories nearby,

546
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,400
yours is the biggest.

547
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,240
Then who

548
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,790
discharged this sewage if not you?

549
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,830
That's right.

550
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,940
All the fish we raised died.

551
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,970
My son is still in hospital.

552
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,370
Everyone, be quiet!

553
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,970
What's wrong with you?

554
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,680
Who gave you the right

555
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,990
to detain the villagers here?

556
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,410
Who gave it to you?

557
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,180
Folks,

558
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,530
I think there might be a misunderstanding.

559
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,990
Our factory has a formal sewage system.

560
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,180
This can't happen.

561
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,850
I guess the small factory next door

562
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,890
may drain secretly.

563
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,940
This kind of thing

564
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,630
can't be done by our factories.

565
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,250
That's why we need to check

566
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,360
to find out who did it.

567
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
That's right.

568
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,020
Let's check it out.

569
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,450
Sure.

570
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,850
Welcome.

571
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,740
But you must

572
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,810
have legal documents.

573
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,600
Right?

574
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,300
You must have relevant procedures.

575
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,030
Or you

576
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,050
represent the judicial institution.

577
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,260
If you come in secretly like this,

578
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,900
you'll violate the law first.

579
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,740
Am I right?

580
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,320
Someone is dying in our village.

581
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,660
We still care about that?

582
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,400
Well,

583
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,140
I'm just being nice.

584
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,420
If this is your attitude,

585
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,390
I can only call the police.

586
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,490
Go ahead.

587
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:39,740
Go ahead.

588
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,390
Go ahead.

589
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,890
If you don't, I will.

590
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,790
Sit down.

591
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,610
Sit down.

592
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,980
Calm down.

593
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,380
I need to make a call.

594
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,450
Hello, Wu?

595
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,480
Some villagers came here

596
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,550
to check out our sewage distribution system.

597
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,190
Yes, arrange it.

598
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,210
Hurry up.

599
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,010
I'll be right there.

600
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,890
OK. Come on.

601
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,110
Folks, come with me.

602
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,450
Let's go and have a look with him.

603
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,950
Look at the water.

604
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,920
How dare you deny it?

605
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,880
Look at the water. Smell it.

606
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,840
Everyone, listen to me.

607
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,620
What you see now

608
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,930
is the first step to deal with waste water.

609
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,950
We'll only release it after it meets the standard.

610
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,710
Let me show you

611
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,230
how we deal with waste water.

612
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,600
Follow me.

613
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,370
The water in the first pond we saw

614
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,720
is dirty

615
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,640
and smelly.

616
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,220
What's the reason?

617
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,430
There are waste and slag inside.

618
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,420
The water will come here

619
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,610
after flowing through that pond.

620
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,030
First, we need to do concrete, remove oil and filter.

621
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,190
After these three procedures,

622
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,950
when the sewage meets the standard

623
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,970
we will move the water to the pond below.

624
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,130
That's the clear water pond we're talking about.

625
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,640
If you have any questions,

626
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,660
you can go down and have a look.

627
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,110
This is our third pool.

628
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,320
It has reached the criteria.

629
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,740
Smell it.

630
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,920
See if there's any smell.

631
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,710
Smell it.

632
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,290
Isn't it clear?

633
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,930
Mr. Wu.

634
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,130
Mr. Qiu turned on the pollution drainage system.

635
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,730
Everyone.

636
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,680
We run the factory here.

637
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,560
You all live nearby.

638
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,580
We are neighbors.

639
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,240
As the old saying goes,

640
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,060
a nearby neighbor is better than a remote relative.

641
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,720
If something goes wrong with the water of our factory,

642
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,830
you're not the only ones who will be hurt,

643
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,060
but also us.

644
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,940
When we started the factory,

645
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,600
our management told us

646
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,450
that production is important,

647
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,970
but environmental protection is more important.

648
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,980
So the concept of environmental protection

649
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,770
has always been engraved in our hearts.

650
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,170
We dare not forget this.

651
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,270
There is indeed something wrong

652
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,330
in the underground water recently.

653
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,970
I believe we will find the reason soon.

654
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,160
But I can assure you that

655
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,190
there is no problem with our factory.

656
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,900
If you have any request,

657
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,730
just let me know.

658
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,100
My name is Qiu Bizheng.

659
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,810
I'll do whatever you ask.

660
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,240
If you don't have any more requests,

661
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,090
Li,

662
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,440
arrange a car to send the villagers back.

663
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,460
OK.

664
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,450
Let's go somewhere else.

665
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,750
Thank you.

666
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,810
Thank you.

667
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,720
Take care.

668
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,850
Mr. Qiu.

669
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,510
Are we turning it off or not?

670
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:54,980
Why?

671
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,380
They haven't gone far.

672
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:57,690
Okay.

673
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,140
Who ordered to turn it on? Turn it off.

674
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,930
Do you know

675
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,920
how much it costs a minute to start the equipment?

676
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,430
Turn it off.

677
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,800
Mr. Wu.

678
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,270
I asked him to turn it on.

679
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,060
I...

680
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,020
Listen.

681
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,030
Without my permission,

682
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,030
no one is permitted to turn it on.

683
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,260
Do you want your job?

684
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,590
Got it, Mr. Wu.

685
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,670
[Stop]

686
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,470
A group of people rushed in.

687
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,140
How can I not turn it on if they make trouble?

688
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,290
What did the security do?

689
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,780
How did outsiders get in?

690
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,420
Forget about the security.

691
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,030
The government always punished us.

692
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,100
We've been fined three times.

693
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,750
It's not a small loss.

694
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,790
Qiu,

695
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,580
have you calculated this?

696
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,460
Which one is more expensive?

697
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,590
The operation of our broken equipment

698
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,120
or the fine?

699
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,490
When we started the steel mill,

700
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,960
why didn't we think of pollution?

701
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:48,510
Also,

702
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,210
we need to increase the production.

703
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,330
Brother,

704
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,220
we have 2,000 tons per day.

705
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,590
Not enough, not enough.

706
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,840
Send overtime fees to equipment maintenance.

707
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,660
If we don't have enough manpower, we'll hire from outside.

708
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,270
Take turns.

709
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,710
How about Xu Banxia?

710
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,020
When do you think

711
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,960
her factory will be built?

712
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,520
At least two or three years.

713
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,170
That means

714
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,730
we can hold on for two or three years.

715
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,370
When hers is built,

716
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,700
we won't be able to compete with it.

717
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,030
Let's eat

718
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,220
before she grows up.

719
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:17,850
Yes.

720
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,680
Hello, sir.

721
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,780
Hello.

722
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,860
You want to buy a ring?

723
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,150
You want to give it to your girlfriend, right?

724
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,590
Take this out.

725
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,060
Okay.

726
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:47,030
Sir,

727
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,740
are you getting married or proposing?

728
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Is there any difference?

729
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,300
This one is for proposal.

730
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,660
You need to buy a pair for marriage.

731
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,750
Is this the best one here?

732
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:05,560
Yes.

733
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,730
Is it the most expensive?

734
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,490
Yes.

735
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:08,680
Wrap it up.

736
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,150
Yes, sir.

737
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,720
Please wait a moment.
