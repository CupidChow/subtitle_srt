00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,120
Xu,

5
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,570
for the sake of my past care of you,

6
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,100
can you take care of me for once?

7
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,040
Mr. Wu, as you can see,

8
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,550
I just built a new steel mill.

9
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,550
Money has been spending right and left.

10
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,210
No, no, no.

11
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,970
I don't want to borrow money from you.

12
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,900
Then you are...

13
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,770
Xu.

14
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,829
Take over my factory, please.

15
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,990
Think about it.

16
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,590
If you can take over the factory,

17
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,550
you don't have to spend money on the production line anymore.

18
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,240
My equipment can be used, right?

19
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
Since you're in a hurry to get things ready,

20
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,800
you don't need to purchase it.

21
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
Although the equipment is old,

22
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,880
it can still be used.

23
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,840
If so,

24
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,270
you can save tens of millions.

25
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,250
Mr. Wu,

26
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,440
your equipment is not only old.

27
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,060
It should be eliminated.

28
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,900
Your factory's production

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,440
can't keep up with the market needs.

30
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,870
If one keeps doing things beyond his ability,

31
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,290
he will fall apart sooner or later.

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,810
And my first-stage project

33
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,980
will be completed soon.

34
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,220
I can't stop at all.

35
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,410
I can't take it over.

36
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,060
So you don't want to help me?

37
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,490
There's nothing I can do, Mr. Wu.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,940
It's really hard to ask for help.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,130
Mr. Wu,

40
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,260
I can't take over your factory.

41
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,860
But I can arrange

42
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,370
the workers in the factory.

43
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,540
After all, my factory has just been built.

44
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,360
I need workers.

45
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,829
Thank you in advance.

46
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,540
But Xu,

47
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,230
if you don't take over my factory,

48
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,820
my assets will be liquidated,

49
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,260
and I'll be sentenced.

50
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,200
If I am thrown into prison,

51
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,940
my penalty will be more serious than Guo Qidong's.

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,860
Xu, please help me.

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,020
It's an emergency!

54
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,190
Your factory is on the news.

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,410
President Gao also reminded you.

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,880
You insisted on jumping into the fire pit.

57
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,170
How can I help you?

58
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,670
If I take over your factory,

59
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,120
I'll put myself in a pit too.

60
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,940
So,

61
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,680
you've been plotting against me.

62
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,630
What did I do?

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,250
Xu Banxia,

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,910
you knew this would happen.

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,330
You knew this stupid factory would be eliminated, right?

66
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,220
You knew its equipment and blowdown system were old.

67
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,050
So you set me up with Foreigner.

68
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,670
You pretended to compete with me on State No.2 Steel.

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,140
You made me spend so much money

70
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,380
and fall into the pit.

71
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,220
And also Gao Yuejin.

72
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,029
Did she release you the message?

73
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,470
Right after I got the State No.2 Steel,

74
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,820
she gave you preferential policies

75
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,910
to open a new steel mill.

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,650
Without yours,

77
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,050
she would have saved me.

78
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:26,990
Mr. Wu,

79
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,350
you've come this far,

80
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,820
you should reflect yourself more.

81
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,530
I gotta go.

82
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,380
I've prepared Tong Xiaoqi's favorite potherb mustard

83
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,100
and shrimp sauce

84
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,710
for him.

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,260
Take them for him.

86
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,300
No.

87
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,570
Mom, stop it.

88
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,700
I'll tell Tong Xiaoqi to come here to eat next time.

89
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,570
I'm fawning on him

90
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,270
because I'm afraid he'll bully you.

91
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,290
Remember to take them back.

92
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,430
I said no.

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,640
Besides,

94
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,860
how can I carry this heavy bag?

95
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
Ask him to pick you up.

96
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,060
What's the use of marriage?

97
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,410
I don't know

98
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,500
how's your life going on.

99
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,470
Did you have meals on time?

100
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,150
How's the visa?

101
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,370
Can he go abroad with you?

102
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,490
Will you or I call Tong Xiaoqi?

103
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,110
Gao Xinyi.

104
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,950
Gao Xinyi.

105
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,670
Mom, I'm leaving.

106
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,130
Why are you leaving so soon?

107
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,040
What's the rush?

108
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,130
I'm leaving.

109
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,490
Take the food.

110
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,250
I won't take it.

111
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,020
Didn't we agree to ask Tong Xiaoqi to pick you up?

112
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,740
No, no, no.

113
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,890
I'm leaving, Mom.

114
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,780
Stop!

115
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,840
Close the door.

116
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,110
What happened?

117
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,780
What's the matter?

118
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,700
I'm pregnant.

119
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,650
Really?

120
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,909
Here, girl.

121
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,500
Eat more vitamin C.

122
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,390
The baby will have fair skin.

123
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,380
If I chose the induced abortion,

124
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,900
will there be any effect on my future fertility?

125
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,300
Nonsense.

126
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,060
It's great to have a baby.

127
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,470
What are you talking about?

128
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,890
I heard that

129
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,660
two weeks later...

130
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,370
I'll be recovered in two weeks.

131
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,100
Who said that? Stop talking nonsense.

132
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,100
It's very bad for your health.

133
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,770
You know?

134
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,930
It's not easy to get the offer.

135
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,110
If we don't want the baby now,

136
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,560
we can have another one later, right?

137
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

138
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,610
Are you still rebelling?

139
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,730
Your rebellious phase is too long.

140
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,420
We're talking about babies,

141
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,030
not toys.

142
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,990
Gao Xinyi.

143
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,070
You are married now.

144
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,690
You're going to be a mother soon.

145
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,360
Are you kidding me?

146
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,800
I just started to work

147
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,970
when I found myself pregnant.

148
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,110
I was facing a lot of problems too.

149
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,710
But

150
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,060
I never thought of giving up on you.

151
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,570
Look at the present.

152
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,870
I think my biggest achievement

153
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,830
is you.

154
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,370
I'm very grateful

155
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,420
for having a daughter like you.

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,360
Does Tong Xiaoqi know about this?

157
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,050
It's not your own business.

158
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,320
You can't let him hate you.

159
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,990
Miss Xu.

160
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,880
Attorney Zhang, what brings you here?

161
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,610
Are you going out?

162
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,740
I'm going to the construction site.

163
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,100
Miss Xu, I'll get the car ready.

164
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,870
-What's wrong? -Miss Xu.

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,970
I have a question.

166
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,660
Is there any conflict

167
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,050
between you and Xiutan Village?

168
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,230
There's no conflict between me and Xiutan Village.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,960
We've maintained our relationship until now.

170
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,490

They sued you.

They said that you

deliberately used the method of polluting the sea field

178

in order to contract the intertidal zone of their village at a low price.

They had no choice

180
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,250
but to rent the land to you.

181

is not conclusive.

All is their subjective imagination and judgment.

But this is a mass appeal,

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,160
or not,

340
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,390
Xu Banxia,

341
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,810
you can't have any problems.

342
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,080
President Gao,

343
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,320
is there a possibility that

344
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,790
I'll handle the lawsuit myself,

345
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,110
and I'll hand over the company to someone else.

346
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,150
Are you kidding me?

347
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,420
It's such a big business.

348
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,130
How can you hand it over to others?

349
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,920
Not to mention whether the superiors can approve it,

350
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,240
just think abou the problems

351
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,810
you'll face

352
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,860
on the management and production.

353
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,750
Have you considered these?

354
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,300
This factory doesn't only belong to yourself.

355
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,860
There are so many employees.

356
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,930
You have to be responsible for them.

357
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,690
You need to solve the problem

358
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,640
in a practical way.

359
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,250
This is the only way I can think of now.

360
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,420
I'll try my best

361
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,270
to make this plan more secure.

362
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,410
Is it necessary?

363
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:01,810
Yes.

364
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,010
This waste oil can not be scrubbed.

365
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,440
When it seeps in with the sea water,

366
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,160
all the farmers in the village will be finished.

367
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,240
The intertidal zone will die.

368
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,910
It's dying!

369
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,730
You can't be so reckless in business.

370
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,810
Don't you think the one who did so

371
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,610
will be punished by the God?

372
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,420
People who did this will go to hell.

373
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,170
In the future,

374
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,890
you must make our steel mill

375
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,160
the best in the country.

376
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,780
Hello, Banxia.

377
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,880
Hello?

378
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,610
Do you still keep your promise?

379
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,730
What's wrong?

380
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,660
Where are you?

381
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,040
What happened?

382
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,820
If I go back to Shanghai now,

383
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,720
can I be Mrs. Zhao?

384
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,240
Are you still willing to marry me?

385
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,190
Of course I do.

386
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,050
But you have to tell me

387
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,970
what happened first.

388
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,790
Nothing.

389
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,140
I'm just tired.

390
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,270
Banxia.

391
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,580
What happened?

392
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,940
Tell me what happened.

393
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,820
Let me face it with you.

394
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,190
Let's solve it together, okay?

395
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,390
What's going on?

396
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:45,950
Hello?

397
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,300
Xu Banxia, go home first.

398
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,060
No matter where you are, go home now.

399
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,760
I'll arrange a time to find you.

400
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,430
OK?

401
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
Hello, Banxia?

402
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,830
Attorney Zhang,

403
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,420
how's the trial going?

404
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,220
Don't mention it. It's quite troublesome.

405
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,590
I still have no idea how to do it.

406
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:03,750
Sis.

407
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,460
Let's be the friends on QQ later.

408
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,970
Tell me in details this evening.

409
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,500
When will the second-stage payment arrive?

410
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,720
I'm auditing it.

411
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,470
Is everyone here?

412
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,830
I gather you here today

413
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,850
to announce a few things.

414
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,010
First,

415
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,000
the construction of the steel mill has been suspended,

416
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,860
but some of the other plans and construction, including the piers

417
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,720
are invested by the provincial government.

418
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,470
I've consulted the lawyer.

419
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,590
This part won't be suspended.

420
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:37,870
So, Jia,

421
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,500
you'll lead the team to carry them on.

422
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,580
Second, Su,

423
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,570
you need to suspend all your work

424
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,330
and prepare the relevant procedures

425
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,180
to separate your department from the company completely.

426
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,760
You need to establish an independent legal entity.

427
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,100
It must have nothing to do with the current company.

428
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,240
One last thing.

429
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,020
We have to proceed in a few days.

430
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,020
I'll change the legal representative of this steel mill

431
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,050
to Tong Xiaoqi.

432
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,920
I'll deal with the lawsuit myself.

433
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,290
It has nothing to do with the steel mill.

434
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,720
If it goes well,

435
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,420
the first phase of the project can be continued.

436
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,410
That's all I want to tell you.

437
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,060
Boss.

438
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,980
It's such a big steel mill. I...

439
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,780
I really can't handle it.

440
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,480
It's fine.

441
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,330
You can ask Jia if you have any questions.

442
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,100
I've thought about it.

443
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,890
Only by doing this

444
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,000
is the best way

445
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,920
to protect this project.

446
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,330
Xinyi,

447
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,940
help me with the assets audit

448
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:00,860
and assets notarization,

449
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,420
so that we can be investigated at any time.

450
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,050
Go back to your work.

451
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,520
Go ahead.

452
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,190
Jia.

453
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,620
Please help Tong in the future.

454
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,740
Thank you.

455
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,560
Got it.

456
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:48,820
Tell me.

457
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,840
Do you still want the steel?

458
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,140
Are we going to make a comeback?

459
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,240
Are we still building this storage yard?

460
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,390
We must get the intertidal zone

461
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,910
and build the storage yard.

462
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,410
According to Fatty,

♫The destiny of meeting and parting♫

464
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,280
we'll build a pier

stop to the dock.

469
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,000
We can let the goods

470
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,420
into the storage yard directly.
