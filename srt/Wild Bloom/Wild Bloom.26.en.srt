00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,080
Okay.

173
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,500
It's not in the room. I've searched.

174
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,809
The cabinet?

175
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,840
Let me see.

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,039
It's not here.

177
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,900
It's not here.

178
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,800
Tong Xiaoqi.

179
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,720
Isn't it under the tea table?

180
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,450
You insisted it was in the cabinet.

181
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,470
Look at you.

182
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,200
You saved a nest egg?

183
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,220
Send the money to the truck team.

184
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,170
They're waiting for it.

185
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,050
Got it.

186
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,480
First,

187
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,770
marry Wildcat and treat her well.

188
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:19,710
Second,

189
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:20,920
study more

190
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,840
and share common interests with Wildcat.

191
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,520
Third,

192
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,150
have a baby with Wildcat.

193
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,240
When he grows up,

194
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,830
Wildcat will tutor him in required courses,

195
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,380
and I'll teach him football.

196
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,430
I was in a football team when I was in junior high school.

197
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,700
Fourth,

198
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,960
fly to Brazil with Wildcat and the child

199
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,220
to watch football games.

200
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,690
Fifth, mangage the truck team well

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,430
and try to make it a regular company.

202
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,490
Sixth,

203
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,060

204
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,280
Seventh,

205
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,540
do what Chen hasn't achieved.

206
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,820
[Eighth: Be with Tong Xiaoqi forever!]

207
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,750
You're going to study abroad.

208
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,190
You two should discuss this.

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,030
Why did you invite me here?

210
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,600
No matter what decision you make,

211
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,240
talk to him.

212
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:01,720
Sister.

213
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,820
Do you know that Tong has a bucket list

214
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,800
like Chen?

215
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,290
On the list, he wrote down

216
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,780
what he must do in his life.

217
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,320
He'll regret them if he doesn't do them.

218
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,980
I think I've heard of it.

219
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,450
What's wrong?

220
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,120
Boss.

221
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,110
What took you so long?

222
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,500
I was busy.

223
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,260
You've ordered.

224
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,610
You were not here.

225
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,190
I have to eat something good today.

226
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,600
Boss.

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,560
Two more dishes.

228
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,190
Okay.

229
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,270
Come on, drink first.

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,280
Cheers.

233
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,260
Tong Xiaoqi, let me ask you.

234
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,250
How long have we known each other?

235
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,860
Three years.

236
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,640
How long have we been in a relationship?

237
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,910
Didn't we start the relationship from the beginning?

238
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,330
You chased after me. Did you forget?

239
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,730
What happened?

240
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,600
When are you going to marry me?

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,430
Will you marry me?

When are you going to say it?

243

Chinese characters are not easy to be engraved on rings.

271

To be honest, if I had told you,

340
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,260
you wouldn't understand.

341
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,000
That's not what I meant.

342
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:45,860
It's okay.

343
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,580
You're telling the truth.

344
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,990
Tong Xiaoqi.

345
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,160
Didn't you say

346
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,320
if you didn't do something,

347
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,210
you'd regret it when time passed.

348
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,300
So I have to study.

349
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,970
If I miss this chance,

350
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,060
I'll regret it all my life.

351
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,730
And we're still young.

352
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,650
We really want to travel this world

353
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,430
to take a look.

354
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,910
This society changes quickly.

355
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,940
We'll be left behind if we don't pay attention.

356
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,490
Do you understand what I mean?

357
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,250
No, I don't.

358
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,120
Then why should we get married?

359
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,700
You're leaving.

360
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,330
I...

361
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,000
I want you to rest assured before I leave.

362
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,750
Rest assured?

363
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,800
Do you want me or yourself to be rest assured?

364
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,910
Stop looking. It has nothing to do with us.

365
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,680
Banxia.

366
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,980
I've been quite busy lately.

367
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,830
I can't leave now.

368
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,530
How about this?

369
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,260
I'll ask someone to book a ticket for you.

370
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,500
You can come to Shanghai

371
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,470
and stay in Shanghai for a few days.

372
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,640
Take it as a rest, okay?

373
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,130
Look how scared you are.

374
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,130
I lied to you.

375
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm so busy now.

376
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,670
I don't have time to go to Shanghai.

377
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:36,980
Okay.

378
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
We focus on our work.

379
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,340
Okay.

380
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,310
Call me anytime.

381
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,440
Xinyi.

382
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,380
You're right.

383
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,430
The world changes quickly.

384
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,810
But I

385
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,810
don't like to change.

386
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,190
What does the world have to do with me?

387
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,680
I just want to protect what I have

388
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,780
and live a good life.

389
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,080
But I understand what you mean.

390
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,320
I won't stop you if you want to go abroad.

391
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,930
But we don't have to

392
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,940
get married.

393
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,220
I don't want to believe what you promised,

394
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,690
and I won't believe it.

395
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,490
Don't think like that.

396
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,650
What should I think?

397
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,320
Does it matter?

398
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,610
Why are you telling me this now?

399
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,790
Tong Xiaoqi, I didn't mean that.

400
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,790
It doesn't matter.

401
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,180
Forget it.

402
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,590
I won't drag you down.

403
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,220
Have you made up your mind?

404
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:20,970
OK.

405
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,910
What's wrong?

406
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,840
What happened?

407
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,310
I've been changing the truck team and going to night school.

408
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,570
I've been changing too.

409
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,920
Why can't I keep up with her?

410
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,880
Now she wants to go abroad.

411
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,930
What should I change

412
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,410
next?

413
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,200
No matter what,

414
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,560
you must guarantee me

415
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,760
66 thousand tons of steel this month.

416
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,840
Ask people

417
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,490
in the production department to cheer up.

418
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,410
Ask people

419
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,120
in the assistance department to cooperate closely.

420
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,570
In short,

421
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,460
nothing can go wrong. Do you hear me?

422
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,130
Mr. Qiu,

423
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,190
the equipment is overloaded.

424
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,030
They can't stand it much longer.

425
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,650
I don't care.

426
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,800
Just make sure the production is enough.

427
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,780
Let the aid department and testing department

428
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,390
work an 24-hour shift.

429
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,150
Mr. Qiu.

430
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,250
Even animals will be tired,

431
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,230
let alone humans.

432
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,120
I can't hold on any longer.

433
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,800
You can recruite people.

434
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,450
I recruited a lot of people.

435
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,700
But the new employees have to be trained during the day.

436
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,660
It'll take some time before they get to work.

437
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,970
I don't want to hear this.

438
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,890
Remember, if you have conditions, do it.

439
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,700
If not,

440
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,230
you have to create conditions to do it.

441
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,480
Mr. Qiu,

442
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,430
I have to remind you.

443
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,020
This is the condition of our equipment.

444
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,950
If it goes on like this, something will happen.

445
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,580
Many people outside say

446
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,930
we are making dirty money.

447
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,990
What are you talking about?

448
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,240
Dirty money?

449
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,550
It's none of your business.

450
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,930
Why are we doing this now?

451
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,860
We're doing this

452
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,740
to give the employees more bonuses at the end of the year.

453
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,580
Don't you want the bonus at the end of the year?

454
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,250
Get back to work.

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,730
Boss.

506
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,930
♫It is only a part of time♫

507
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,980
When will Cat be back?

508
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:57,950
What's wrong?

509
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,770
♫The rest of the life has limited starts♫

510
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,330
We are waiting for her

511
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,570
to sign and reimburse us.

512
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,660
♫Infinite loop♫

513
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,190
I'll sign them.

514

♫The rest of the life has limited starts♫

515
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,150
♫Infinite loop♫

516
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,780
Let me report the current construction situation.

517
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:16,340
The rotary furnaces, metal mixers, and continuous castings

518
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,670
have been completed successfully.

519
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,430
The walls

520
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,620
and the waterproof buldings

521
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,800
are under construction.

522
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,930
Also, the water, wind and gas pipelines

523
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,030
and the arrangment of the blow-off valves

524
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,840
are almost over.

525
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,570
The rolling lines are being designed.

526
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,720
We're still reviewing them.

527
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,230
That's the situation.

528
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,050
Thank you.

529
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:37,950
It's my pleasure.

530
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,050
What can I do for you?

531
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,620
Miss Xu. Miss Xu. Miss Xu.

532
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,710
What's wrong, Miss Xu?

533
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,290
Should we send her to the hospital?

534
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,310
Come on, help her in.

535
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,540
Send her to the hospital.

536
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,130
You're awake.

537
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,900
Don't move.

538
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,970
What's wrong with my stomach?

539
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:13,790
Gastric perforation.

540
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,530
Gastric perforation?

541
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,840
Do I need surgery?

542
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,540
Not this time.

543
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,480
But I have to cut it for you next time.

544
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,410
Hello.

545
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,750
Which ward is Xu Banxia in?

546
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,940
Turn left. Ward 3.

547
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,370
Thank you.

548
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,660
Boss, are you okay?

549
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,820
What happened?

550
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,560
Gastric perforation.

551
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,980
Supervise her from now on. Let her eat well.

552
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,500
Luckily someone found her fainting this time.

553
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,900
If no one had seen her,

554
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,980
the consequences would have been serious.

555
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,060
I'll go buy some porridge.

556
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,270
Are you stupid?

557
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,910
Can she eat now?

558
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,220
She's right.

559
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,720
She can't eat now.

560
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,120
Does Zhao Lei know?

561
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,530
She didn't allow me to tell him.

562
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,300
Why didn't you tell him?

563
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,590
She told you not to.

564
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,370
What's wrong?

565
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,290
What's the trend now?

566
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,420
You all prefer saying nothing in advance now?

567
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,210
Can't you understand what she said?

568
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,980
This is their own business.

569
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,110
She doesn't want Zhao Lei to worry.

570
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,640
But we have to tell him.

571
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,000
She's already like this.

572
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,030
If Zhao Lei knows we didn't tell him about this,

573
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,780
what will he think?

574
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,340
Keep your voice down.

575
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,690
She needs a good rest.

576
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,110
If you want to fight, fight outside.

577
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,520
So annoying.

578
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,120
I'll go check on other patients.

579
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,150
Lie down.

580
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,240
I'll visit you later.

581
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,190
Sister.

582
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,820
I've found people for you.

583
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,420
They can go to work tomorrow.

584
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,060
Take care of yourself.

585
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,280
I'm keeping an eye on there.

586
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,860
I'll live with my mom for a while.

587
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,360
Call me if anything happens.

588
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,150
Bye.

589
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,360
You haven't been reconciled?

590
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,490
We won't be reconciled.

591
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,100
What do you mean?

592
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,520
I have to talk to you about this.

593
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,800
You two have come this far.

594
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,810
Can you stop being so stubborn?

595
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,490
She's going to study abroad.

596
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,400
She still wants to marry you.

597
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,140
That means she cares about you.

598
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,050
Why can't you get over it?

599
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,770
Don't make me angry.

600
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,170
How could you say that?

601
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,250
She is going abroad.

602
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,510
How many years will she stay there?

603
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,030
When will she come back?

604
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,100
Will she come back?

605
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,340
Who knows?

606
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,880
The distance is getting further and further.

607
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,590
What's the point of getting married?

608
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,710
Don't just talk about me.

609
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,180
If you and Zhao Lei continue like this,

610
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,570
you'll break up sooner or later.

611
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,060
All right, listen to me.

612
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,460
Call him back.

613
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,900
Your business is getting bigger.

614
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,210
You need someone to help you.

615
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,410
You need him.

616
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,360
If you still want to be with him,

617
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,170
you can't go on like this.

618
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,970
You have to stay together.

619
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,620
If his heart is not here,

620
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,410
what's the use of being together?

621
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,120
You still have to be together.

622
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,330
Don't talk about hearts.

623
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,510
You can't even see him.

624
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,750
What's the use of having each other in your hearts?

625
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,140
If you still love him,

626
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,490
ask him to come back and stay with you.

627
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,140
Then you can feel at ease.

628
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,040
You know me well.

629
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,040
You're full of nonsense.

630
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,630
Mom.

631
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,000
What do you think?

632
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,840
No matter what decision you make,

633
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,890
I'll support you.

634
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,070
The problem you're facing now

635
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,940
didn't exist in our era.

636
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,630
Your dad and I worked in the same company

637
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,950
and workshop.

638
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,050
We worked and lived together.

639
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,110
We didn't have your feeling.

640
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,380
Love

641
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,290
depends on what you think.

642
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,130
If it's true love,

643
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,740
you don't need to be afraid of distance.

644
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,680
Just like you and me.

645
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,430
No matter how high you fly in the future,

646
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,860
you are my little kite.

647
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,720
Even if you don't contact me often,

648
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,250
I have the thread.

649
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,210
I will always miss you.

650
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,810
I love you.

651
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,190
Well...

652
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,469
That's different.

653
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,500
We are related by blood.

654
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,389
What about your dad and me?

655
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,570
At that time,

656
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,989
he had been in jail for five years.

657
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,400
We couldn't contact each other often.

658
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,530
We seldom met.

659
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,620
But I remember the days

660
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,420
I went to see him every month.

661
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,240
No matter what happened, I would went to see him.

662
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,700
I would prepare his favorite cigarettes,

663
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,320
his favorite tea,

664
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,090
and his favorite food

665
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,610
a week ago.

666
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:24,090
It was really hard back then.

667
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,360
But now I think it was quite sweet.

668
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,070
During the five years,

669
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,760
have you ever

670
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,770
changed your mind?

671
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,460
Not even once?

672
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,700
Not even once.

673
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:09,990
Mr. Lin.

674
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,890
Didn't our test result meet the standard

675
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,740
last time?

676
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,710
Yes, but you have to stop production.

677
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,330
Look.

678
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,110
Why should we stop when we meet the standard?

679
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,790
Mr. Lin.

680
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,720
You've been here so many times.

681
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,250
We met the standard every time.

682
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,060
You have no reason to stop the production.

683
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,110
The underground water pollution is too severe.

684
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,800
Some people are hospitalized.

685
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,410
The provincial government decided

686
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,130
to suspend the production of the nearby mills

687
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,040
for the time being

688
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,280
to find the reasons.

689
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,310
Mr. Lin, look.

690
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,820
We met the standard last time.

691
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,480
The result of this time is not out yet.

692
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,470
You can't just ask us to stop production.

693
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,160
Thousands of people are waiting to earn money.

694
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,550
We can't stop now.

695
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,060
I just signed the contract.

696
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm working on it.

697
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,330
You want me to stop production now?

698
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,710
You're killing me.

699
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,000
I understand how you feel.

700
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,120
It's just temporary.

701
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,940
I've told you, the production of all the mills should be suspended.

702
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:55,880
Not only your mill.

703
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:56,800
Mr. Lin.

704
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,560
You've been busy the whole morning.

705
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,010
Let's eat first.

706
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,900
I ordered a table of dishes.

707
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,680
Let's talk while eating.

708
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,310
Yes.

709
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,090
I'm in a hurry.

710
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,380
I have to go to the next mill.

711
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,980
Mr. Wu. Mr. Qiu.

712
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,430
I can only ask for your cooperation.

713
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,480
Stop for a while.

714
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,100
I'll let you know right away

715
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,320
when I reveive the information from the province, okay?

716
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,440
Okay, let's go.

717
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,170
Okay, take care.

718
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,600
What should we do?

719
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,060
Leave him alone. Do it secretly.

720
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,020
Listen, boss.

721
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,650
The provincial government inspected it personally.

722
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,150
The nearby mills have stopped.

723
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,750
What if something happens?

724
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,350
Something will happen if the production is suspended.

725
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,490
The fine is not much.

726
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,710
What are you waiting for? Turn them off.

727
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,060
How much will they cost this morning?

728
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,670
Boss.

729
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,310
I always feel that something will happen.

730
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,570
We are too bold.

731
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,750
It'll take a long time for the environmental protection administration

732
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,740
to investigate it.

733
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,260
There's not only our mill.

734
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,710
They won't know it's our fault.

735
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,350
Our priority now is to hurry up

736
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,130
and complete the clients' tasks.

737
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,610
Hello?

738
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,890
Hello, President Gao.

739
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,050
I asked you to stop production.

740
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,550
Why didn't you listen?

741
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,820
Now it has been reported to me.

742
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,640
What should you do?

743
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,680
I've stopped it.

744
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,190
Wu Jianshe, I'm warning you.

745
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,490
Don't play tricks on me.

746
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,930
When we check the contract,

747
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,710
the date of the production will be obvious.

748
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,530
If you keep playing dirty,

749
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,280
it won't end with a warning and a fine.

750
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,320
Should we stop or not?

751
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,220
No.

752
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,800
Dig wells. Dig deep wells.

753
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,070
Let them flow through the deep wells.

754
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,390
They can't find it for a while.

755
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,570
Put it down.

756
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,430
Listen, Wu.

757
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,310
This won't work.

758
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,050
You have to dig deep wells

759
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,660
and bury the tubes deeper.

760
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:19,130
Okay.

761
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,840
After burying them,

762
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,600
cover them well.

763
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,180
Do you hear me?

764
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,820
Mr. Wu.

765
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,380
Can we add another construction team?

766
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,660
OK. Hurry up.

767
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,680
-Hurry up. -Okay.

768
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,360
Boss, can we do it?

769
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,760
Why not?

770
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,220
Qiu.

771
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,330
I was a peasant.

772
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,580
You grew up in a city.

773
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,580
You don't know.

774
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,720
I used to drink the water in ditches when I was young.

775
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,660
I was fine after drinking it.

776
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:41,900
You are from the city.

777
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,170
If I give you some well water,

778
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,070
you'll still have diarrhea after drinking it.

779
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,230
People's immunities are different.

780
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,730
Speaking of which,

781
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,480
no matter what water it is,

782
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,980
boil it and drink it.

783
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,250
It might smell a bit,

784
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,030
but it's okay.

785
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,430
Right?

786
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,860
I'm afraid.

787
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,060
What are you afraid of?

788
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,610
Fertilizer is poisonous, right?

789
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,370
But who eats less vegetables,

790
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,930
fruits and food?

791
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:06,990
It's okay.

792
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,940
You'd better make an appointment

793
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,720
with the people in the environmental protection administration.

794
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,320
Have a good chat with them.

795
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,130
Sit down and eat.

796
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,210
Don't let them come to us all the time.

797
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,230
Got it.

798
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,400
You must be tired

799
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,360
of eating special diets.

800
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,900
I  specially made some food for you.

801
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,750
I didn't add oil.

802
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,620
You can eat as much as you want.

803
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,800
Thank you, Doctor Li.

804
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,790
You're welcome.

805
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,700
Su's friend is my friend.

806
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:34,730
Let me do it.

807
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,840
I'm getting back to work.

808
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,240
Doctor Li is a nice person.

809
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,500
You've heard what she said.

810
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,320
Your friend is her friend.

811
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,230
What do you want to say?

812
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,740
I want to say you two are a good match.

813
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,560
Don't worry about me.

814
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,580
Eat well and recuperate.

815
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,770
Why are you so boring?

816
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,460
You always say that.

817
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,770
You didn't tell Zhao Lei, right?

818
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,510
Hello.

819
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,210
Where are you?

820
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,750
I'm in Beijing.

821
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,460
You're still in Beijing?

822
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,590
I have something important to do this time,

823
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,240
so I have to stay here a few more days.

824
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,240
What about the company?

825
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,670
Wildcat is helping me.

826
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,980
Don't worry.

827
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,340
How are you? Are you doing well?

828
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,250
I'm fine.

829
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,090
How is the weather in Beijing today?

830
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,800
The weather in Beijing.

831
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,270
It's sunny.

832
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,130
Is this Beijing?

833
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,020
Do you want some water?

834
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:36,600
No.

835
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,380
Have some fruits.

836
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,050
No.

837
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,280
What's wrong?

838
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,700
Nothing.

839
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,170
I feel so uncomfortable

840
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,560
in the hospital these days.

841
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,480
