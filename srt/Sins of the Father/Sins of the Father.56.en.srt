This Tuesday...

374
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,533
If the cops catch me
with this much money,

375
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,167
they'll be on my case even more.

376
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,033
Find a way to fix that.

377
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,333
Why did you suddenly leave me?

378
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,033
Please try to understand,
I just wanted to protect you.

00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,300
You don't have to do it.

380
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,667
But I want to, Arissa.

381
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,300
It wouldn't be so bad if
I made things right now.
