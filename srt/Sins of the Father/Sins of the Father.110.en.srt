These days,

540
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:38,167
scams thrive on our ignorance.

541
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,467
So it's best that
we keep vigilant, curious,

542
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,067
and to research before going
into any opportunity.

543
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,733
Remember that fact-checking
is the best protection

544
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,400
against deception.

545
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:56,900
This is the best way
to a real, proper success.

546
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,467
We will succeed.

547
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,233
We will all succeed.

548
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,767
But it's supposed to happen
in a legal and moral way.

549
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:17,900
[SAMUEL] In a child's eye,
 parents never make mistakes.

550
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,933
Everything they do is right.

551
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:25,500
It must be good because
they do it out of love.

552
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:30,067
But as we grow older,

553
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,767
we slowly see the truth.

554
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:35,333
That they're not perfect.

555
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,633
That they have a tendency
to hurt us,

556
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,567
and leave a scar
that could last a lifetime.

557
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,533
But we can't always blame them
for what we've become.

558
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,900
Because as we mature,

559
00:30:56,567 --> 00:31:00,767
we get to choose
who we want to be,

560
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,800
not based on the scars
that we've gotten,

561
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:09,867
but based on the good
that we wish to pass on.

562
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,167
The decisions we make now

563
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,000
will greatly affect the world
we'll leave to our children.

564
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,500
Our world is a borrowed one.

565
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,100
And if we wish to give it back
to them,

566
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:36,500
I hope it's better than the one
 we grew up in.

567
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:40,333
Let's change the world
for our children.

568
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:47,667
A change that does not come
from broken promises,

569
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,033
but from doing what's right
every single day.

570
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,967
Even if it's hard.

571
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,633
Even when no one's looking.

572
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,867
And if more of us
chose kindness,

573
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,367
this world would be a safer,
more honest,

574
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:13,867
and more forgiving place
for them to live in.

575
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:20,533
We can't change the past.

576

But we can make the future
much better.
