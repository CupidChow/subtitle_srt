00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,467
You have to bring me
into Bakunawa's inner circle.

360
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,667
- Hi!
- I want to see all of you.

361
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,367
I called to let you know what's
 happening with your daughter.

362
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,733
Why should I care?

363
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:19,800
Are you ready?

364
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,500
- Ready!
- Yes! All set!

365
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,667
We really manipulated
the algorithm

366
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,700
so he'll surely read it.
