hurt you again.

362
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,867
You let a little kid
get away?!

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,467
How can we get our money
from Trinidad now?!

364
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,300
...no one can escape
the chaos.

365
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,233
Let me torture his sister.

366
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,467
All of your fortune
is in my hands.

367
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,833
I'll kill your family
in front of you.

368
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,667
I'll give you
everything you want,

369
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,833
as long as you leave
my family alone!

370
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,533
Trouble will emerge

371
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,500
bringing the Trinidad
family into shambles.

372
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,233
Serves you right,
you scammers!

373
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:37,233
Their family
is in danger again!

374
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,133
Johnny, this isn't
just about you!

375
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,300
Then what?!
Is it about Samuel?!

376
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,067
They killed you, dear.
I'll avenge your death.

377
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,267
Give me one
good reason

378
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,833
to not blow
your brains out.

379
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,000
Dad! Dad!

380
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,667
Do you know who
you're going up against?

381
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm not afraid
of anything.

382
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:59,667
Only cowards move
in the dark.
