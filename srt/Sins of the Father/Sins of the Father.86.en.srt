[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES]

364
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:54,633
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]

365
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,133
Sir, why are we here?

366
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:12,833
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES]

367
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,567
This used to be an old casino.

368
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,600
But it stopped operating
many many years ago.

369
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:24,867
Although its license
is still intact.

370
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,733
[DIEGO] So...

371
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:28,867
I am acquiring it.

372
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,200
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES]

373
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,567
This will be my legacy, Samuel.

374
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,767
This will ensure

375
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:47,700
that Bakunawa will survive
long after I'm gone.

376
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,533
Sir, why are you showing
this to me?

377
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,500
Because I want you, Samuel,

378
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,167
to be the next

379
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,300
leader of the Bakunawa.

381
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,367
This Tuesday...

382
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,833
Where is it all going?

383
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,100
Luke can't find out
what had happened to Lily.

384
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:20,400
Why? Luke is our friend--

385
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:24,033
Because Congressman Montelibano
 is your dad's accomplice.

386
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,333
What?!

387
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:30,100
Samuel will now reap
what he sowed.

388
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:33,667
I can't entrust Bakunawa
to anyone but you.

389
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,267
You're his right-hand man!
How were you blindsided?!

390
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,467
How ironic.

391
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,400
You've been chosen
to move up the group

392
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,367
that you're planning
to destroy.

393
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,067
He will never know
what's coming for him.
