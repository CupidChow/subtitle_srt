00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,367
Money will put
his son's life in danger.

366
00:23:42,533 --> 00:23:43,467
Over here!

367
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,300
We can't lose the kid.

368
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,833
It's man versus man.

369
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:54,133
Let's see how tough he is
once I kill his precious kid.

370
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,633
I will kill for my son.
