This Tuesday...

545
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,700
- What job can you do?
- None yet.

546
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,433
Yuck!
Who's that man?

Samuel will receive
an offer.

00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,700
The money your father
scammed...

where it is?

00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,600
If you're messing with me,
just leave me alone.

00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:13,533
No one crosses me and
gets away with it, Samuel.

552
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:16,367
As per your instruction,
I taught Samuel a lesson.

He's completely cornered now.
