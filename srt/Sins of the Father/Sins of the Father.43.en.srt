00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,167
- You stole from us!
- You don't play fair.

364
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:41,700
Give me what I want

365
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,933
if you don't want to lose
all your money.

366
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,433
Bro, you should've rest more.

367
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,767
- I'm meeting someone.
- Who?

368
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,000
Why are you asking me?
Are you my boyfriend?

369
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,767
I have a project for you.

370
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,500
Do you really think
I'll be popular?

371
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,733
You can be the next big star!

372
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
- Who are you?!
- I'm the one messaging you.

373
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,567
Help me find my sister.

374
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,267
I need you to do something
for me.
