- What about King?

356
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,433
We've been searching
forever.

357
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,300
Once I find that kidnapper,

358
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,567
I'll ask him what
his connection to Samuel is.

359
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,200
I want to see Daddy.

360
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:43,600
Fate will find a way
to bring them together.

361
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,433
Grandma!

362
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:48,100
King can't breathe.
I'm taking him to the hospital.

363
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,033
I'm coming.

364
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,333
This is your daddy's
office, dear.
