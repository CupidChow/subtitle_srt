353
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:08,167
- Yeah! He won!
- Whoo!

354
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,600
- They were scammed!
- We still won!

355
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:11,667
Yeah!

356
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,067
We're not yet done!

357
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
Beginning this Monday...

358
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,000
I've managed to survive,
but for how long?

359
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,800
I need to find out
who the Old Man is.

360
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,900
Congratulations,
Samuel Trinidad.

361
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,900
I am the Old Man.

362
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,100
The closer they get
to the truth...

363
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:28,567
General Diego Ramirez
is the real leader of Bakunawa.

364
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:29,500
King's grandfather?

365
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,000
Dad!

366
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,233
My father looked up to you,
but you betrayed him.

367
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,733
...the closer they get
to danger.

368
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:38,500
Get in.
We've got somewhere to go.

369
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,967
This will ensure
that Bakunawa will survive

370
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,167
long after I'm gone.

371
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,100
Why are you
showing me this, sir?

372
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,600
Because you, Samuel,

373
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:50,267
are the one I want to take
my place as leader of Bakunawa.
