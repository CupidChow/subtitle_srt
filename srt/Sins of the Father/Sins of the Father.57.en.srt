[STIRRING MUSIC PLAYING]

368
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,733
This Wednesday...

369
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:56,833
Luke gave those.

370
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,867
I thought you liked Uncle Enzo?

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,167
I wish loving someone
was as easy as liking them.

372
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,400
She's Samuel's sister.

373
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,833
They're moving in full force.

374
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,233
Welcome to the group.

375
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,600
I am sure they are
involved in human trafficking.

376
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:12,000
Be alert.

377
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,800
This is your fault, Jacob.

378
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,800
Why do you hate me so much?

379
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,467
No secrets, hon.

380
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,967
Why did Jacob
have me followed?

381
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,333
Is he really risking
losing all of your money?
