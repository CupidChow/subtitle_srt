359
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,567
Alright, go back
to what you were doing.

360
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,133
Oh, you dropped by for a visit?

361
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,600
Yeah, uh...

362
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:34,633
My secretary met an accident.

363
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,167
Unfortunately,
she did not make it.

364
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,467
The one who died was from the
Sacred Congregation of Christ.

365
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,333
One night after Pastor Ferdie
had a meeting with you.

366
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:49,867
Was there anyone else
who saw Pastor Ferdie come here?

367
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:50,867
No one else.

368
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,667
[DIEGO]
 Why do you have to be so nosy?

369
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,333
Such a waste.

370
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,500
- Mira?
- Yeah.

371
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:01,667
Oh my gosh!

372
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,500
Dad...

373
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,000
She was so kind and hardworking.

[DARK MUSIC CONTINUES]

375
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,000
How unfortunate.

376
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,500
I am pretty sure
it will be difficult

377
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,833
for you to replace her.

378
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,500
I know.

379
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,567
Such a waste.

380
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,633
Anyway...

381
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,133
...maybe you can
recommend someone

382
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,900
to be my new
executive assistant.

383
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,367
Someone who can
meet my standards.

[DARK MUSIC CONTINUES]

385
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,900
Let us know when you have
new updates.

386
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,167
Sure! But you did see
my interviews on TV, right?

387
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:48,400
Johnny, what are you doing here?

388
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,000
I was just talking to them.

389
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,433
Uh, sir...

390
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,900
- He's my husband.
- Oh.

391
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:58,900
You know,
your husband's job is exciting.

392
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,033
Tell me if he finds
any leads on the kidnapper.

[DARK MUSIC CONTINUES]

394
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,400
What about our EA, Agnes?

395
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:12,733
Agnes?

396
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,233
She's good.
I can vouch for her.

397
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,867
Are you sure?

398
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,467
But won't you and your brother
still need Agnes?

399
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:23,933
Hon, if Dad needs
a good executive assistant,

400
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,033
then I am willing to give way.

Alright, I mean, we'll see.

403
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,067
Actually, I am looking forward
to meeting this Agnes.

405
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,267
I will do whatever
is best for my son.

406
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,967
Stay away from my son.

407
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:53,233
That's what's best
for him.

408
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,933
Can you get the safety
deposit box contents yourself?

409
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,633
If this is the solution
to finding her,

410
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:58,800
I will do everything.

411
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,900
Let us oppose
human cockfighting.

412
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,467
But that is money
that will come to us.

413
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,500
I will not bow down
to Matthias.

You're worse,
traitor!

417
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,600
And in the fight
against scam...

418
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,300
We cannot let
this opportunity pass.

419
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,833
- I'll go down.
- It's too dangerous.

420
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Follow that truck.
I'll take care of them.

I'll go with you.

Enzo, stay here.

424
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:35,833
We can check
the hard drive.

00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,300
Let him go!
What are you doing?!

426
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,767
...whose breath
will be snuffed out?

427
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,000
Don't be reckless.
You don't know what's coming.
