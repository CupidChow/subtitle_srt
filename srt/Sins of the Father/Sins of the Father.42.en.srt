Each day that passes without me
 being a member of your group,

367
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,033
I will take a bit of your money.

368
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,800
When do you plan
to tell me the truth?

369
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,333
What do you mean?

370
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:25,833
You have no right to decide
what I'm allowed to know.

371
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:28,233
Welcome to Imperial Slots!

372
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,667
This will help
with your situation, Naomi.

373
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,900
Am I going to be a model?

374
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,400
Sins of the Father.
