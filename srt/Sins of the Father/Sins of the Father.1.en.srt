So as promised, I'm here
to listen to your pitch.

Depositing your 100 million
in a savings account is safe,

but it will only earn
a small interest.

will eat up your value.

and government bonds,

121
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,533
around 30% in blue chip

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,400

123
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,833

is from 100 million

124
