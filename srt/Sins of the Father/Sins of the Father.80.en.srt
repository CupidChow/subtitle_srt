00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,900
Make money!

361
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:03,400
- Who are you?
- I'm here to help you.

362
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,467
Oh, really?

363
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:06,167
- [SCREAMS] Madam, help!
 - Wait, wait.

364
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,267
Tighten your grip.

365
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,667
We've already missed out
on so much time with King.

366
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,633
He's also my grandson.

367
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,833
Let's play.

368
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,600
Your grandpa will find you.

369
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,800
Because starting
this Monday,

370
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,567
the real battle
is going to begin.

371
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:22,767
I want to win against Trinidad.

372
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:23,933
I'll take them down

373
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,767
and make sure they won't
be able to get back up.

374
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,233
Jacob vs. Samuel.

375
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,467
- [GRUNTS]
 - Jacob.

376
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:32,567
- Come here.
- [GRUNTS]

377
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,833
Jacob! Stop it, you two!

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,300
- That's enough!
- What did you do this time?

379
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,300
- What are you talking about?
- Answer me!
