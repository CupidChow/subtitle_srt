This Wednesday...

369
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,133
Why were you
in Roldan's office?

370
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:36,633
You work for him?

371
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:39,400
We're not enemies.
We're on the same side.

374
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:46,133
This search for the money
is taking too long.

00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,567
This is taking too long.

376
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,567
We need to level up our game.

377
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,133
Who are you?
What are you-- Aah!

378
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,600
- Let me go!
- Argh!

379
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,833
I won't stop until
I get the truth out of his son.

380
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,600
I can't let my family be
in that kind of danger.
