And you know him well!

361
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,300
They don't know what's
coming to them.

362
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,700
Proceed with caution.

363
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,233
There are no guards.

364
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:12,067
I don't see anyone.

365
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,700
Watch out, Samuel.

366
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,200
I'll get you back.

367
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,667
The good son...

368
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:22,233
...will now face his suffering.

369
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,933
Leah, you need
to get the King.

370
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,200
You need to protect
your child, please.
