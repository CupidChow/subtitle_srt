if you can't hold it in,

366
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,500
at least use protection.

367
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,700
[LAUGHING]

368
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,667
[DARK MUSIC CONTINUES]

369
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:48,567
[DARK MUSIC CONTINUES]

370
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,467
Who's Naomi?

371
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,800
No one to be jealous of.

372
00:19:58,967 --> 00:19:59,933
I remember her.

373
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,200
I saw her talking
to that recruiter.

374
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,567
She gave me a calling card.

375
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,600
- What about you?
- I don't dress like this.

376
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,800
I thought you want to be
the next big star!

377
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,100
Yes, Naomi!
Make love to the camera!

378
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,800
As their worlds close in...

379
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,467
Do you know my history
with Leah?

380
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,467
Of course.
I'm the reason she left you.

381
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,800
Does she know
you had our son kidnapped?

382
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,400
You'll need a sharp strategy.

383
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,633
I know you're hiding money
in there.

384
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:29,933
What the hell?!

385
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,567
Johnny, enough!

386
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,967
Back off.

387
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,167
You can't lose the money!

388
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,233
This is Jacob's fault.

389
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,200
If he didn't tip off the police,

390
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,667
this wouldn't happen.

391
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,667
Are you working with Samuel?

392
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,667
Yes! Are you happy now?

393
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,767
You're toying with me!

394
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,833
Go ahead! Hit me!

395
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,167
I am your brother,

396
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,600
but why are you
siding with Trinidad?

397
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,800
Stop your brother!
He is sabotaging me!

398
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,367
Because of Leah!

399
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,367
You bastard!
