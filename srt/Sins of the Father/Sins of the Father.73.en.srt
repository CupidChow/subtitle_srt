00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:46,333
[SOBBING] You're liars.

363
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,667
Liars...

00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,833
You fooled me, you liars!

368
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,833
It's my fault that Rainier died.

369
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,867
Whatever's in that hard drive,

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm sure it's important to them.

371
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,867
Why was there a problem
with the shipment?!

372
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,333
Our partners in Cambodia
will be furious!

373
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,133
Those who were caught
by the police

374
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:23,633
will lead us
to that scam warehouse.

375
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:25,700
Make sure you keep watch...

376
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,733
Get down, get down, get down!

377
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:29,567
...because the clash
will heat up even more.

378
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,567
Get down now, get down!

379
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,367
- [GRUNTING]
 - Sir!

380
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,567
You're the one who sabotaged
our shipment to Cambodia!
