- Who are you?

356
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,467
Wait, wait!

358
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:01,800
These are the things
he left behind.

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,333
Maybe you can find answers
to your questions here.

360
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
What are these for?

361
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:05,833
Do you have enemies?

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
What kind of question
is that?

363
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,633
It's like the two sides are

364
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,833
No one has the motive to do that
 except for my family.

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,700
Did you bring me here
just to interrogate me?

366
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:14,833
This is against the law.
What's this?

367
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:17,733
Why am I here?

368
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:22,800
If you want to team up with me
against Roldan Rivera,

369
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,533
this is your chance
to expose them

370
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:26,533
and to come clean.
