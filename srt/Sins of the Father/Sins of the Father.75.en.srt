Grandma, Daddy,

Yes, Auntie Ari is just
going through something.

- What is it?
- Son...

365
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:27,700
You're too young
to understand.

366
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
For now,

367
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,733
let's just show
Auntie Arissa our support.

Take care of her.

Of course, Dad!

Well, I really didn't
expect you to join us.

379
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,933
Are you sure we are not
interrupting your schedule, Dad?

380
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,300
No, don't worry.

381
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,833
I told you,
I want to meet my grandson.

Grandpa, this is King,
my best friend.

- Oh... Hi.
- Hello!

Really? I can treat you
as my grandpa?

394
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
[DIEGO] Of course!

395
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,967
You can be my grandson.

396
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,467

Let's work together.

Those who don't perform well
are sent to Cambodia.

for the hard drive

407
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,533
to find out the truth?!

408
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,467
I was right.

00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,667
He's behind
the scam operations.

410
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:48,433
I'll prove Samuel
is the one ruining the group.

take down their enemies.

going to stand there?

on the motorbike.

- Not now, Samuel!
