- What?
- Then--

365
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,033
What are you taking him out for?

366
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,033
What's with your tone?

367
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,533
Are you blaming me?

368
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,033
I know you're angry
with me, Samuel.

369
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,167
But I didn't do anything wrong!

370
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,967
You took my son
without asking

371
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,200
and this happened!

372
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,733
Who else should we blame?

373
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:53,667
I don't even know
what triggered him
in the first place--

374
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,800
Exactly!

375
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,933
You know nothing because
you were never part of his life.

00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,233
Leah, what exactly
is your role in King's life?

378
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,300
Why are you suddenly
getting close to him?

379
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:10,900
I thought you were happy
with Jacob.

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,067
Leah, please...

382
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,600
...stop disturbing us.

383
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,367
King and Chloe are friends!

384
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,467
What do you want?

385
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
For me to split them up? Huh?!

386
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,300
Just because of our past?

387
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,267
Don't be immature, Samuel!

388
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,133
I'm not saying
you should split the kids up.

389
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:34,233
If someday you want to tell
them they're siblings, fine.

390
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:35,767
they're siblings, fine.

391
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,800
I can accept that.

392
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:41,433
But don't give my son
false hope

393
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,267
if you have no plan
to take responsibility for him.

Leah, if you can't stand
by that,

396
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,000
then don't introduce yourself.

397
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,467
Because even now,

398
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,500
I still don't know
how I'm going to tell him

399
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,967
That his mother had left him.

This Wednesday...

402
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
King's mother is your aunt?

403
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,033
Arissa, our lives
have always been tangled.

404
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,300
I found a key
among your sister's stuff.

405
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,033
Maybe this will help me
find my sister.

406
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,267
I'll go with you to the bank.

407
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,800
They're doing something illegal,

408
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,767
so even his son
is getting dragged into it.

409
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:40,167
Don't jump to conclusions.

410
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,033
When it comes his child...

411
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,733
I know you kidnapped my son.

412
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:49,500
...no one can stop
a father's punch.

413
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:50,633
This is for my son!
