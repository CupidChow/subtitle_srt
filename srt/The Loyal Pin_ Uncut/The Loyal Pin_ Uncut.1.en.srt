1
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,052
Come.

2
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:39,703
This is my palace, the Lotus Palace.

3
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,785
Come stay here with me, Lady Pin.

4
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:46,660
From now on, this place will be your home.

5
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:54,633
I want to go home. I miss Father and Mother.

6
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,628
Your father and mother…

7
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:05,751
already passed away.

8
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,575
From now on…

9
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:12,535
I will be a father...

10
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:15,592
and a mother for you, Lady Pin

11
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,316
I’m Anin.

12
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,720
What’s your name?

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,775
Pilanthita, Your Highness.

14
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:25,411
Lady Pin…

15
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:32,703
Are you staying with Princess Pattamika at the Lotus Palace?

16
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:39,253
I’ll call you Pin then.

17
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,784
You don’t have to address me with royal terms.

18
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:43,680
We are now friends.

19
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,885
Here.

20
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,893
Try blowing it.

21
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,224
Come down, Anin.

22
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,925
Or else I’ll go tell your aunt.

23
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,957
Don’t!

24
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,993
(Screaming)

25
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,177
The Loyal Pin

26
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,947
Many years have passed…

27
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:48,176
since Princess Pattamika took me in and let me stay here at His Highness Prince’s Savettavarit Palace.

28
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:53,220
She is a close relative of the prince.

29
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,939
This is because Lady Khlai,

30
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,717
a mother of His Highness Prince at Savettavarit Palace,

31
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:02,999
had adopted Princess Patt and took care of her since when she was very little.

32
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,212
Princess Patt is, therefore, like a younger sister to the prince.

33
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:53,324
Add a little more salt.

34
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,859
Make sure you pound it thoroughly.

35
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,264
Yes, Ma’am.

36
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:04,768
Can you cut the pork into smaller pieces?

37
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:06,755
Yes, Ma’am.

38
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,385
Why don’t you try doing it like this, Lady Pin?

39
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:36,248
Although she might be strict, meticulous,…

40
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:39,275
and strongly adhere to the tradition

41
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:46,085
she loves me dearly, and always teaches me and educates me with a lot of things.

42
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:50,778
Just like the prince and Princess Alisa, who have always been kind to me.

43
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:57,406
His Highness Prince of the Savettavarit Palace

44
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,683
and Her Serene Highness Princess Alisa.

45
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,083
They have three children together – two sons and a daughter.

46
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:15,085
The eldest son is His Serene Highness Prince Anantawut,

47
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:20,846
a kind, caring, and very modern brother.

48
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:27,278
The second son is His Serene Highness Prince Arnon,

49
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:33,370
a prince charming and a pleasure seeker who is now studying in the UK like his older brother.

50
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:41,620
Where is Anin?

51
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,447
I’m here.

52
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:53,225
And the youngest daughter who is His Highness Prince’s favourite child.

53
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,798
Her Serene Highness Princess Anilaphat Savettavarit.

54
00:09:56,798 --> 00:10:00,733
She is known for her God-given beauty

55
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:06,578
a gracious and noble princess of the Savettavarit Palace.

56
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:09,926
But in fact…

57
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:16,491
she has climbed all the trees in the palace.

58
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,023
And if the prince is interested in any tree in particular,

59
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:20,179
Your Highness!

60
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:23,316
that tree will always be the target of Anin and Prik in the next morning.

61
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:23,967
Your Higness! Please come down.

62
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:27,081
Lady Pin will give you an earful if she sees you like this.

63
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:30,481
She wouldn’t know. She’s always busy in the kitchen.

64
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:33,032
Who is always busy in the kitchen?

65
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,053
Pin!

66
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,937
Please hurry up, Your Highness. Someone might find out.

67
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,935
I’m trying.

68
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,644
This is Prik, Princess Anin’s personal servant,

69
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:54,179
a loyal maid and a minion who always stays by her master’s side.

70
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,988
Prik, catch me.

71
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,342
Not to mention other mischievous deeds like climbing the palace wall

72
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:02,061
- or sneaking out of the palace.
- Be gentle, okay?

73
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,320
Oh, Pin.

74
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:37,574
They even dressed up as ghosts to spook out servants in the palace.

75
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,819
Hey, where are you going?

76
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,686
I have to go, Your Highness.

77
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,238
Prik.

78
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,153
Oh.

79
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:47,009
Here you go.

80
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:01,694
Pin.

81
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:04,857
Prik!

82
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,426
Why are you doing this again, Your Highness?

83
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:16,685
You could have told me if you want to eat anything.

84
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:20,657
Stealing food is such bad habit.

85
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,056
Well, it doesn’t taste that good if I can get it easily.

86
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,504
Why are you still not dressed up?

87
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:32,187
A welcome party for Prince Arnon is going to start soon.
You should go and get ready, Your Highness.

88
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,087
Before I’d get angry.

89
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:36,775
You’re so fussy, Pin.

90
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,371
Did you get hurt again?

91
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:13,540
You’re a lady now, Anin. When will you stop running around like a child?

92
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,019
I’m growing weary of telling you off.

93
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,968
I’m not running around.

94
00:14:17,968 --> 00:14:20,000
I just want to eat something delicious.

95
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,004
And I want you to try it too.

96
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:24,231
Did I say I wanted to?

97
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,861
You just want to be mischievous, that’s all.

98
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:34,131
People are saying that it is so hard to hear Lady Pin uttering a word.

99
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:36,642
As if you’re afraid something will fall out of your mouth.

100
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:42,030
But this time, you keep complaining so much that I have to plead guilty.

101
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,294
That’s because you’re so stubborn.

102
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:48,853
Please go get yourself ready, Your Highness. The welcome party for your brother is about to begin.

103
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,264
Or else you won’t make it in time.

104
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,341
Okay.

105
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:25,681
Are you doing well, Your Highness?

106
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:27,024
Yes.

107
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:39,160
Where is Anin, my favourite daughter?

108
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:44,520
Princess Patt told me she was still up to something mischievous earlier, Father.

109
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,806
But Lady Pin is probably trying to get her changed into a new dress at the moment.

110
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,783
We haven’t seen her for years. She’s probably so grown up now.

111
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:58,889
There she is, Your Highness.

112
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,799
Anin.

113
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,849
Is that Princess Anin?

114
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:27,320
Brother!

115
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:34,219
Let’s go, Pin.

116
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,380
Anin!

117
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,275
I miss you so much.

118
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:54,842
I miss you too, Anin.

119
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:02,182
When I left, you were only as tall as my elbow.

120
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:04,675
But look at you now.

121
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:07,380
You are almost as tall as me.

122
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:12,731
Anin is like my eldest daughter.

123
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,645
I took really good care of her.

124
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:17,181
I even fed her with butter and milk like the westerners.

125
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,984
This must be Lady Pin,

126
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:27,353
the one you often told me about in your letter. Am I correct?

127
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:29,386
Yes, Brother.

128
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:35,326
Wow, let me have a look at my favourite niece. You look so pretty, Lady Pin.

129
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:38,691
So pretty like a doll.

130
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,385
Aren’t you being a little biased, Mother?

131
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:45,951
Your youngest daughter also looks very pretty today. Why did you only compliment Lady Pin?

132
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,630
She is so fond of Lady Pin.

133
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,744
She always mentions how she wants another daughter. She no longer wants me as her daughter.

134
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:57,392
But how can you be my daughter, Anin?

135
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,588
You are so naughty like a monkey.

136
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,380
Ah, now I know why you love to climb up my trees.

137
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,572
Try this, Pin.

138
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:34,440
I’d rather not.

139
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,066
It’s good.

140
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:54,080
Let’s dance.

141
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,353
Right here?

142
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,238
Mhm.

143
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:03,106
I just had a class in dancing. Can you help me practise and be my partner?

144
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:08,537
I’d rather not. Aren’t you supposed to do it with a gentleman?

145
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:11,066
It would look peculiar if we do it together.

146
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:17,219
Why not? Does anyone ever say that a lady must only dance with a gentleman?

147
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:21,806
Come on, Pin. It seems fun.

148
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:23,688
No, Your Highness.

149
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,429
Hold my arm.

150
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,161
I don’t know how to dance, Your Highness.

151
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:54,429
Just follow my lead.

152
00:20:55,427 --> 00:21:00,788
Is this a welcome party for my second brother, or his marriage prospects meeting?

153
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,131
Soon, you will have to follow suit.

154
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,894
I will refuse then. I will tell Father that I do not wish to be married.

155
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:14,844
I’d rather grow old in this palace with you.

156
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,818
You already gave me your words, Your Highness.

157
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:21,662
Have I ever abandoned you?

158
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:26,797
No…Never, Your Highness.

159
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:48,551
Hello, my name is Sasa.

160
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,120
Pin.

161
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,948
Why are you crying?

162
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:58,883
I’m lonely. I miss my home.

163
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,744
Why are you lonely?

164
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:03,473
Sasa is your friend now.

165
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:06,578
I miss my parents.

166
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:15,512
Then I can be a father and a mother for you too.

167
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:25,233
I can be anything that you want. Anything at all.

168
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:30,635
Be it a father, a mother, an older sister, or a younger one.

169
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,298
Or a pig?

170
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:35,901
Oink! Oink!

171
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,477
Or maybe…a dog?

172
00:22:38,477 --> 00:22:41,879
Woof! Woof!

173
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:42,927
Or a cat?

174
00:22:42,927 --> 00:22:46,637
Meow! Meow!

175
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,621
Or a rabbit?

176
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,657
Oh, you’re laughing!

177
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:05,478
This is yours, please keep it.

178
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,044
So that you’ll have him to comfort you when you’re lonely.

179
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:17,805
And also to remind you that you still have me.

180
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:28,936
Stop!

181
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:32,728
Anin!

182
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,442
Let’s go.

183
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,423
Why don’t you go in your own car, Your Highness? Where’s your driver?

184
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:44,908
I want to go to school with you.

185
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:48,861
So, I told him to drive around somewhere.

186
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,210
Let’s go, Perm.

187
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,000
Prik, I’ll do the running. You just throw it up, okay?

188
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,361
Yes, Your Highness.

189
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,147
Let’s go!

190
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,877
Prik!

191
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,248
Go and fetch it.

192
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:13,621
I’m sorry, Your Highness.

193
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:15,518
I’ll give you another chance.

194
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,605
If you still can’t do it, I’ll punish you.

195
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:31,160
Ouch!

196
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,606
Pin!

197
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:41,863
Help! Please help! Lady Pin got bitten by a snake!

198
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,312
It hurts, Your Highness.

199
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:57,957
It hurts so much.

200
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,047
What are you doing? Don’t do it, Your Highness!

201
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:40,011
What were you thinking? Why did you take her out to play something dangerous like that?

202
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,523
I’m sorry, Your Highness. It was all my fault.

203
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,720
Stop!

204
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:56,029
Why did you hit her?

205
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:01,269
Lady Pin failed to take good care of Your Highness.

206
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:05,467
She also left you in disgrace and put you in danger.

207
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,416
Fortunately, that snake is not venomous.

208
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,798
It was I who asked her to do such a mischievous deed with me.

209
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:14,410
She was the one who saved me from danger.

210
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:19,147
If it wasn’t for her, I would have been bitten by the snake myself.

211
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:23,005
If you’re going to punish her, you must punish me too.

212
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:30,521
Then I’m afraid I will have to send Lady Pin to a boarding school

213
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:32,731
in order to put a stop to all these mischievous deeds.

214
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:35,941
Please don’t do that.

215
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,992
No.

216
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,779
I’m not going to leave her.

217
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:44,529
If she goes, so will I.

218
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:09,990
Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to go through those lonely and miserable time.

219
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:20,207
Thank you for being my friend, my home, and my everything.

220
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:24,159
I’m your pig, Oink! Oink!

221
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,244
Your dog, Grrr!

222
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,519
Your cat, Meow!

223
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,360
Your rabbit.

224
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:35,521
Stop that, Your Highness. It’s embarrassing.

225
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,738
I’ll never leave you, Pin. You won’t be lonely anymore.

226
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,225
I want to send her to study in England.

227
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:52,899
Father wants me to go study in England?

228
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:58,202
If one day I couldn’t be here to play with you, will you feel lonely?

229
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,960
The Loyal Pin

230
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:24,909
The Loyal Pin

231
00:29:11,637 --> 00:29:13,146
Refreshments, Your Highness.

232
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:14,513
Thank you.

233
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:29,932
I’m thinking of sending Anin to study in England like both of her brothers.

234
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,151
I beg your pardon, Your Highness?

235
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:37,389
I thought you said you wouldn’t send her to study abroad.

236
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
What made you change your mind, Father?

237
00:29:42,318 --> 00:29:44,653
You’re very fond of her and have always wanted to keep her near.

238
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:47,754
Everyone is well aware of this. You often mentioned…

239
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:49,610
how you never wanted her to stay far away from you.

240
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:54,707
It’s probably because Lord Pinij kept persuading him.

241
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:56,069
That’s right.

242
00:29:56,335 --> 00:30:03,101
Lord Pinij told me that, in school, Anin is far more intelligent than other girls her age.

243
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:06,385
Not furthering her study in the Western countries…

244
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,285
would be such a waste.

245
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:14,091
I disagree with you, Your Highness.

246
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:16,360
Anin is still very young.

247
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:19,474
Don’t you worry about her at all?

248
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:23,855
Of course, I do. But this is what we should do.

249
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:26,869
I do not want our youngest daughter…

250
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:29,424
to feel inferior to her brothers.

251
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:37,903
Shall we wait until Princess Anin is a little older, Your Highness?

252
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,271
Very well then, I’ll have a thought about it.

253
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:21,116
Today, we will be making fruits in syrup.

254
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:24,210
Using only watermelons and mangoes, my lady?

255
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:30,029
Yes. Watermelons have cooling effects. They can cool down the heat in your body.

256
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:34,122
Carve them into a rose shape, which is perfect for one bite.

257
00:31:34,122 --> 00:31:36,668
Peel the fermented mangoes,

258
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:43,235
and carve them into a flower and a leaf shape. Then start making the syrup.

259
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:56,323
Sprinkle a little salt.

260
00:31:56,876 --> 00:32:00,471
Add pandan leaves for better aroma.

261
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:03,578
Slowly simmer it.

262
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:07,161
And finally…

263
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:18,886
Now, you are mastering it. I remember when I still had to hold your hands to guide you while carving.

264
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:22,960
It took you a dozen of mangoes and watermelons before you could carve out a nice shape.

265
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,108
Thank you, Your Highness.

266
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,807
Prik, bring it to the princess too.

267
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:29,815
Yes, Your Highness.

268
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:34,102
Aren’t you going to see Princess Alisa?

269
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,872
I have to attend a funeral this evening. I might return very late.

270
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,438
You can go to sleep first. Don’t wait for me.

271
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:41,462
Yes, Your Highness.

272
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:54,185
Fruits in syrup, Your Highness.

273
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:57,404
Lady Pin made this herself.

274
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:18,870
Lady Pin’s dessert is the best.

275
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:26,280
I’d feel so lonely without you.

276
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:32,760
Why are you talking as if I will no longer be with you, Mother?

277
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:39,551
It’s your father. He mentioned that he might send you to study abroad like your brothers.

278
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,977
Father is going to send me abroad?

279
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,549
It’s just a thought.

280
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:49,571
I’m sure he still hasn’t made up his mind.

281
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:54,259
I hope he will finally change his mind.

282
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:11,096
It’s your father. He mentioned that he might send you to study abroad like your brothers.

283
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:31,059
My princess, why do you look so serious?

284
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:34,881
I have to ponder over something important.

285
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:51,081
Where is Princess Patt going, Prik?

286
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:03,777
Princess Pattamika is attending her friend’s funeral on the outskirts of town, Your Highness.

287
00:35:07,361 --> 00:35:12,315
Does this mean she wouldn’t be home tonight?

288
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:15,281
You can be sure of that, Your Highness.

289
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:24,140
Oh, that smirk on your face. What are you planning to do, Your Highness?

290
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:35,291
Where did you say you wanted to take me to?

291
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:40,358
There’s an annual night market tonight. I want you to come with me.

292
00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:44,086
I’m afraid I can’t.

293
00:35:47,526 --> 00:35:48,863
Don’t worry, my lady.

294
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:52,400
My princess and I often sneaked out to the market. It’s not dangerous at all.

295
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,213
We actually had so much fun, my lady.

296
00:35:55,684 --> 00:35:59,311
Please come with us. An opportunity like this doesn’t come to you that easily.

297
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:02,013
No, Your Highness.

298
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,376
Please, Pin.

299
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:08,664
Please.

300
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:10,517
Please say yes.

301
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,935
Please.

302
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:15,349
Please?

303
00:36:16,352 --> 00:36:17,180
Please.

304
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:19,141
Please come with us.

305
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,584
Okay.

306
00:36:43,126 --> 00:36:44,927
Do you enjoy it?

307
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:46,388
Yes.

308
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:49,686
I had always wanted to take you here.

309
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:51,484
But I never had a chance.

310
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:53,950
Today, my dream has finally come true.

311
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,873
If His Highness Prince found out that you often sneak out at night like this…

312
00:36:56,873 --> 00:36:59,856
he would surely be so angry.

313
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:03,355
Well, I’m dying to know what the world outside a palace is like.

314
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:06,158
I’ll give you an eye-opening experience to day.

315
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:32,147
Can’t you eat faster, Koi?

316
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:36,066
What’s with the fuss, Prik?

317
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:39,441
- So good.

318
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:44,212
- When will Princess Anin and Lady Pin come back?

319
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:46,298
- I don’t know too.

320
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:47,795
- How can you not know?

321
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:50,490
- What if Princess Pattakima came back before Lady Pin?

322
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,766
- What would you do then?

323
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:55,518
- Oh, she went to the outer part of town. She won’t be back soon.

324
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:58,168
- What if I already am?

325
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,566
- Answer me.

326
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:20,966
- Nothing, Your Highness.

327
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:26,046
- Very well then. Can you go tell Lady Pin to come see me, Prik?

328
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:38,273
- Lady Pin is not home, Your Highness.

329
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:42,029
- Where is she?

330
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,514
- Did you have a good time today?

331
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:58,790
I had a really great time.

332
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:02,092
Yes, I did.

333
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:06,029
With you, my life in the palace is never lonely.

334
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:13,625
If one day, I could no longer be here with you,

335
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,490
will you feel lonely?

336
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:23,735
Without you, who would have kept me busy with all those mischievous deeds?

337
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:26,634
I wanted to know if you would feel lonely.

338
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,607
I don’t know.

339
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:30,650
It’s not happening yet.

340
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,009
But for me…

341
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:39,536
I would feel so lonely without you.

342
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:43,471
Is there something wrong? Why are you asking me this question?

343
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,745
My lady!

344
00:40:50,872 --> 00:40:52,062
Lady Pin.

345
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:54,617
Princess Patt has told me to take you back home.

346
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:56,081
Is she home already?

347
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:56,827
Yes, my lady.

348
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,686
Why did you sneak out of the palace at night?

349
00:41:13,686 --> 00:41:16,085
I’m truly sorry, Your Highness.

350
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:18,085
If Pin will get punished,

351
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:20,416
then so will I.

352
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:43,229
The Loyal Pin

353
00:41:43,298 --> 00:41:50,215
The Loyal Pin

354
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:04,307
It was already dark, why didn’t you stay inside the palace?

355
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:08,733
I’m truly sorry, Your Highness.

356
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:11,088
It was very reckless of me.

357
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:15,113
It was my fault.

358
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:28,096
I made her go out to the market with me.

359
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:30,118
You made her?

360
00:42:31,036 --> 00:42:36,583
Did you tie her hands and dragged her out of this palace with you?

361
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:39,617
Did she do that, Lady Pin?

362
00:42:45,705 --> 00:42:48,136
No, Your Highness.

363
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:51,495
I went with her at my own will.

364
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:56,613
Since you have done something wrong,

365
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:58,117
I must punish you.

366
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:01,688
But I don’t think leaving the palace at night is a wrong doing.

367
00:43:01,688 --> 00:43:06,492
The only thing wrong is that we didn’t inform you beforehand and made you worried about us.

368
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:10,768
Staying outside the palace after dark while there were only us girls.

369
00:43:12,232 --> 00:43:17,517
It seems you are very well aware of my thoughts, Princess Anin.

370
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:19,452
But why did you still do it?

371
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:23,719
Because I’m still a child.

372
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:28,387
A child who is hardly able to overcome her own curiosity.

373
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:31,521
But hearing your concern earlier,

374
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:35,035
I now understand that you have your own reasons to worry about us.

375
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:39,116
But when I consider them again, there are some parts that I agree with.

376
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,231
And some that I disagree with.

377
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:44,824
Which part do you disagree with me?

378
00:43:45,477 --> 00:43:48,756
I disagree with you because in fact…

379
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,591
the world outside is such an interesting place.

380
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:54,841
A child shouldn’t be kept locked up inside the palace.

381
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:59,674
An adult should accompany her outside and give her guidance and advice.

382
00:44:01,244 --> 00:44:02,802
Interesting.

383
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,712
if children like you do not wish to stay only inside the palace,

384
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:09,826
then maybe next time, I should take Lady Pin…

385
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:12,539
and Princess Anin to the funeral with me.

386
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,980
Oh, maybe not the funeral, please.

387
00:44:18,009 --> 00:44:19,335
Nevertheless,

388
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:22,002
Lady Pin must receive her punishment today.

389
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:24,537
You will be caned three times…

390
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,565
and grounded for a week.

391
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,175
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:36,883
If she will get punished,

393
00:44:37,183 --> 00:44:38,892
then so will I.

394
00:44:39,245 --> 00:44:40,914
I was the one who started it.

395
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:43,635
Although you refuse to punish me,

396
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:46,891
Prik and I insist on staying at the Lotus Palace with Lady Pin…

397
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,081
for seven days and seven nights.

398
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,493
Very well then,

399
00:44:53,493 --> 00:44:56,080
I will punish you too, Princess Anin.

400
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,388
My sincere gratitude for your kindness.

401
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:07,308
Both of you will be grounded to copy the textbooks in the Study Room.

402
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:08,597
You cannot leave the room all day.

403
00:45:08,597 --> 00:45:11,365
But I’m afraid you can’t stay there for seven days and seven nights.

404
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:14,023
His Highness Prince will be very furious if I do that.

405
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:19,485
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:56,732
My princess,

407
00:45:56,732 --> 00:46:01,648
why must you insist on having Princess Pattamika punish you too?

408
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:04,769
So that I can be with Lady Pin.

409
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:07,050
Please stop joking around, Your Highness.

410
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:09,135
I’m not.

411
00:46:09,135 --> 00:46:10,500
I’m serious.

412
00:46:10,764 --> 00:46:13,310
I was the one who convinced you to come with me.

413
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,036
So, I must take responsibility for it.

414
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:18,953
How could I abandon you and let you get punished alone?

415
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,383
It’s not easy at all to punish Anin.

416
00:46:42,648 --> 00:46:45,020
She is very smart.

417
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,136
I agree, Your Highness.

418
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:49,922
I’m afraid I had let her spend too much time with Prince Anan.

419
00:46:49,922 --> 00:46:51,572
He graduated from Europe.

420
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:53,268
So, he tends to be very liberal.

421
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,293
He also raised up Anin like his own daughter.

422
00:46:55,293 --> 00:46:57,291
She is truly walking in his footsteps.

423
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:01,388
Poor Lady Pin, I really pity her.

424
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:03,239
She often gets punished because of Anin.

425
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,682
I wonder how she’s doing.

426
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:37,713
Princess Patt told us to copy the textbooks, why do you only keep drawing, Your Highness?

427
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:39,658
Why should I copy them?

428
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:42,068
They already contain all the letters and words.

429
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,102
So that you can memorize them.

430
00:47:44,402 --> 00:47:46,249
You were so serious…

431
00:47:46,249 --> 00:47:48,967
when you promised Princess Patt about the punishment.

432
00:47:49,585 --> 00:47:51,464
I promised to never leave this room.

433
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:53,946
But I didn’t say I would copy textbooks.

434
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:02,942
What is it that you’re drawing? It looks like a muddle.

435
00:48:07,371 --> 00:48:08,726
I’m drawing you.

436
00:48:10,773 --> 00:48:13,413
Am I that ugly?

437
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:16,883
Why? Do you think it’s ugly?

438
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:19,220
I think it’s pretty.

439
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,482
Which part exactly that is pretty?

440
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,761
This part.

441
00:48:30,502 --> 00:48:33,046
It’s the model who is pretty.

442
00:48:34,193 --> 00:48:35,739
Anin.

443
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:40,683
I’ll draw a new one then.

444
00:48:40,683 --> 00:48:43,261
So that it would look pretty like the model.

445
00:48:44,902 --> 00:48:47,292
Please feel free to do as you wish.

446
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:50,941
As if you would listen to me if I stop you.

447
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:03,621
Pin.

448
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:05,977
Pin.

449
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:09,232
Please smile.

450
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:11,975
Like this.

451
00:49:12,522 --> 00:49:14,151
Smile.

452
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,340
How does it look?

453
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,001
Pretty.

454
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:54,030
Really?

455
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,446
Pretty hideous.

456
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:00,955
Why are the head so big and the limbs so thin?

457
00:50:01,379 --> 00:50:02,713
Is it not similar?

458
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,192
Absolutely not.

459
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:10,043
Not only that you refuse to copy the textbooks, you also keep bothering me.

460
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,735
If you draw me again, I will be offended.

461
00:50:14,705 --> 00:50:16,702
Then I’ll draw something else.

462
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:34,976
I shall not pay attention to you anymore.

463
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,282
I thought you said you wouldn’t pay attention to me.

464
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:53,626
Why do you keep looking at me?

465
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,341
Spending time here with you is so much fun.

466
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,048
I should find more opportunities to be with you alone like this.

467
00:51:11,294 --> 00:51:14,652
I’d like to stay over at the Lotus Palace with Lady Pin.

468
00:51:14,652 --> 00:51:16,639
The examination is approaching.

469
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,645
I’d like her to help enlighten me in the subjects that I’m not good at.

470
00:51:36,658 --> 00:51:43,618
The Loyal Pin

471
00:51:43,674 --> 00:51:50,443
The Loyal Pin

472
00:52:13,473 --> 00:52:16,842
I heard you were detained to copy textbooks all day as a punishment.

473
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,977
You must have acquired a lot of knowledge then.

474
00:52:18,977 --> 00:52:20,563
A lot indeed, Father.

475
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:24,286
Really? I can’t believe it.

476
00:52:24,286 --> 00:52:25,810
Of course, Mother.

477
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,173
Lady Pin has taught me a lot of things.

478
00:52:28,173 --> 00:52:31,456
She made me fell in love with studying.

479
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:35,094
Is that true?

480
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:36,462
Yes, Father.

481
00:52:37,007 --> 00:52:41,335
That’s why I’d like to ask Princess Patt for a permission.

482
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:44,954
A permission for what?

483
00:52:46,317 --> 00:52:48,833
Probably to go out somewhere.

484
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:56,821
No, Father. I’d like to stay over at the Lotus Palace with Lady Pin.

485
00:52:59,254 --> 00:53:01,539
The examination is approaching.

486
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:04,725
There are many subjects that I’m still not good at.

487
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:08,886
I’d like Lady Pin to help enlighten me in those subjects.

488
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:12,481
But I’m afraid it would be too dangerous…

489
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,717
if I have to walk back to the Main Palace…

490
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,011
very late at night after the study session.

491
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,835
She has her reason.

492
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:27,519
My princess is so smart.

493
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:30,843
What would you say then, Patt?

494
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,592
I do not have any objection, Your Highness.

495
00:53:33,592 --> 00:53:36,194
Then I’ll leave this matter to you.

496
00:53:36,194 --> 00:53:38,735
Please provide her with any necessities.

497
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:40,204
Yes, Your Highness.

498
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:43,840
My sincere gratitude for your kindness.

499
00:53:58,013 --> 00:53:59,595
Please come in.

500
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,923
Wow, is this your room?

501
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:10,194
How are we going to study?

502
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:12,880
I don’t see you carrying any textbook.

503
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,283
The most powerful weapon lies within your heart. So does the book.

504
00:54:19,904 --> 00:54:22,865
I just want to spend a night with you.

505
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:24,069
That’s all.

506
00:54:26,113 --> 00:54:30,048
I knew it. How very unlikely of you to wish to study.

507
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:45,324
Do you still keep this pinwheel?

508
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:50,443
How could I throw it away? You gave it to me.

509
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:55,566
I still remember vividly the time when I first came to live here.

510
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:59,553
My life was so lonely and miserable.

511
00:54:59,553 --> 00:55:01,674
And then you came into my life.

512
00:55:02,336 --> 00:55:05,200
You played with me and even made a toy for me.

513
00:55:14,662 --> 00:55:19,177
I have never seen you used this navy ribbon before.

514
00:55:23,051 --> 00:55:25,494
That ribbon is not mine.

515
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:28,985
You dropped it in the car on your way back to the palace.

516
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:31,864
I brought it back and washed it.

517
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:34,777
I was planning to return it to you…

518
00:55:35,322 --> 00:55:36,470
but I forgot.

519
00:55:38,632 --> 00:55:40,083
Is that so?

520
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:42,284
Yes.

521
00:56:09,928 --> 00:56:12,871
Shall we begin the study session, Your Highness?

522
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,998
I don’t want to study.

523
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,788
I’m sleepy. Let’s go to sleep.

524
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,385
Are you going to sleep here?

525
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:27,882
Princess Patt has already arranged a guest room for you.

526
00:56:29,868 --> 00:56:31,959
Let Prik sleep there then.

527
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:34,003
I’m going to sleep here.

528
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:36,758
Your bed has plenty of room.

529
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:46,516
Come sleep next to me, Pin. And read me a story, will you?

530
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:52,354
You surely want everything your way.

531
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:55,274
Please come.

532
00:56:56,676 --> 00:56:57,674
Come on.

533
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:00,053
Let me do it.

534
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:25,705
Isn’t this a handkerchief I gave you on that day when Princess Patt was angry at you?

535
00:57:27,963 --> 00:57:31,674
I already washed it and folded it on the bed.

536
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:34,339
I was planning to return it to you…

537
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,379
but I forgot.

538
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,566
Smells wonderful.

539
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,113
You seem to be very forgetful.

540
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:54,386
It’s been quite a long time.

541
00:57:57,384 --> 00:57:58,584
You don’t have to return it to me.

542
00:57:58,584 --> 00:58:00,012
I give it to you.

543
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,352
I didn’t say I wanted it.

544
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,581
Even so, I want to give it to you.

545
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:17,394
Please keep it as a reminder that I was the one who wipe away your tears.

546
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:24,534
If you insist that you’d like to give it to me,

547
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:27,837
then I will take very good care of it.

548
00:59:36,521 --> 00:59:38,102
Lady Pin.

549
00:59:38,511 --> 00:59:40,417
Are you carving a mango?

550
00:59:40,417 --> 00:59:42,531
Yes, Your Highness.

551
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:47,192
Why do you have to carve so many mangoes?

552
00:59:47,192 --> 00:59:49,217
How can we finish them?

553
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:52,429
There are only two of us in this palace.

554
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:54,364
Just in case, Your Highness.

555
00:59:54,364 --> 00:59:57,011
In case Princess Anin might visit here,

556
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,464
then I can serve her with these mangoes.

557
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:01,872
They are her favourites.

558
01:00:01,872 --> 01:00:07,949
But I believe she is more likely to favour the desserts placed next to the woodshed.

559
01:00:08,594 --> 01:00:11,457
She is very mischievous, Your Highness.

560
01:00:15,215 --> 01:00:17,424
If Princess Anin has to be away,

561
01:00:18,845 --> 01:00:21,324
you would be so lonely, wouldn’t you?

562
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:30,994
Away?

563
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:37,329
I heard Princess Anin is going to further her study in Europe like her older brothers.

564
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:42,172
Prince Arnon went to London when he was 18 years old.

565
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:46,215
But Princess Anin is only 15 years of age.

566
01:00:46,215 --> 01:00:49,064
It’s still a few more years until she’d leave, isn’t it?

567
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:50,894
I’m afraid no, Lady Pin.

568
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:55,115
She is planning to travel in the next two months.

569
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:01,422
Next two months?

570
01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:03,234
Yes.

571
01:01:27,636 --> 01:01:30,546
The Loyal Pin

572
01:01:30,546 --> 01:01:35,198
Lady Pin has been crying so hard, Your Highness. My heart aches for her.

573
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:38,354
Then I should go and console her.

574
01:01:40,874 --> 01:01:43,028
You’re smiling!

575
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,114
I’m so fortunate…

576
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:49,713
that I can still attend the Loy Krathong festival with you this year…

577
01:01:49,713 --> 01:01:52,380
before you will go away.

578
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,596
How I wish you didn’t have to go, my dear.

579
01:01:58,879 --> 01:02:00,866
Lady Pin!

580
01:02:00,866 --> 01:02:03,741
A letter from Princess Anin, my lady.

581
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:07,248
Oh, look at those gleeful smiles you have there, my lady.

582
01:03:36,352 --> 01:03:42,479
The Loyal Pin
