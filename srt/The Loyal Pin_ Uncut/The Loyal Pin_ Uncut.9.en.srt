1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,044
Your Highness!

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:03,706
Prik!

3
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:04,880
You’re back, Your Highness!

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,860
A welcome party for me?

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,699
Yes. I’ll let you decide how you’d like it to be.

6
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:14,615
Hopefully, the princess will find someone she is interested in so that she will finally have a fiancé.

7
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:17,497
Can we really love each other?

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,922
As Princess Patt said, you must eventually get married one day.

9
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:28,507
Please believe me. No one or anything can ever take us apart.

10
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,684
Isn’t Anin here yet?

11
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,203
She probably drank too much last night. She might wake up late today.

12
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:00,607
Morning, Brothers.

13
00:01:00,607 --> 00:01:01,858
There she is.

14
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,454
Were you drunk last night?

15
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:10,237
You just disappeared.

16
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:15,412
Our brother was very worried. He kept looking for you everywhere.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,497
I was so drunk last night so I left for home earlier.

18
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:24,744
I’m sorry for making you worried.

19
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,764
But you’re sober now, aren’t you?

20
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,110
Yes.

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,459
Are you sure?

22
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,497
Brother and I are planning to go to Hua Hin for a vacation.

23
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:40,567
I’m going to invite Miss Orn too.

24
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,669
Would you like to join us?

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,385
She wouldn’t miss a chance.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,892
Of course, I want to go to the beach so badly.

27
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:54,000
See? I told you so.

28
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:59,870
Can I ask Lady Pin, Prik, and Pia to come with us too?

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,155
Sure, that would be fun.

30
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,681
Is there a problem, Brother?

31
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:12,941
Nothing.

32
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:14,198
Let’s eat.

33
00:03:55,655 --> 00:04:00,923
The Loyal Pin

34
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,536
Oh, so lovely.

35
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:09,806
Your Highness, can I really go to the beach with you?

36
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:11,567
I’m not dreaming, am I, Your Highness?

37
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:16,836
That’s right, Your Highness. I’ve only been to the beach in England.

38
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,849
I heard there are sharks in the sea.

39
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:26,670
So, I’d rather not go swimming. I’m scared, Your Highness.

40
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:30,272
Sharks are not that dangerous.

41
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:33,140
It is us humans who disturb their habitat.

42
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,260
If we only stay in our area and do not disturb them, they will not hurt us.

43
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:42,363
Just like how you will not be punished if you do not disturb the princess, Prik.

44
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:47,588
Usually, Her Highness is very kind. Am I right?

45
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,135
You really know me well.

46
00:04:53,575 --> 00:05:01,749
So, for tomorrow, are we travelling with Prince Anan, Lady Parawatee, Prince Arnon, and Miss On?

47
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:04,262
Yes, in 3 separate cars.

48
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:09,088
Isn’t this like a triple honeymoon, Your Highness?

49
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,848
What honeymoon? It’s just a vacation on the beach.

50
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:21,055
Then, don’t let me see you and Lady Pin having any romantic moments by the sea, Your Highness.

51
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,978
I will intrude on both of you without hesitation.

52
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:24,049
So will I.

53
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,178
Then, you should stay here.

54
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:30,481
So that we can have a honeymoon without any interruption.

55
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:50,613
Put them in there.

56
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,278
Pranot, put it inside.

57
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,793
Watee and I are going to stop by at Khao Wang first.

58
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,350
Please excuse me, Brother.

59
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,258
Are we all going, Your Highness?

60
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,425
Ready?

61
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,156
Are Miss Aon and Lady Uang…

62
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:45,692
also coming with us?

63
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,615
Yes.

64
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,324
At first, I thought it would only be us and our family members.

65
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:54,611
I just heard from Brother this morning that they will also join us.

66
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:01,560
How could this be a honeymoon then?

67
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,324
Come, we should get going.

68
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:07,078
Okay.

69
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:14,900
Anin, Lady Pin, Prik, and Pia – all of you can go with Pranot.

70
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,206
As for Miss On and Miss Aon, they will come with me.

71
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,967
Watee and I will arrive a little later than the others.

72
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,934
We are going to have a look around the city for a while.

73
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:25,365
Yes.

74
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:29,611
See you at the Preedee Phirom Palace, Your Highness.

75
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:32,241
Let’s get in the car.

76
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,087
Let’s go.

77
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,080
Let’s go, Your Highness.

78
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,807
Come, Lady Pin.

79
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:50,138
Yes.

80
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:06,972
[Pridi Bhirom Palace]

81
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,871
Anin.

82
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,915
Are you exhausted from travelling?

83
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:22,277
I think Pranot already drove so slowly like a turtle. Isn’t our brother here yet?

84
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,840
Are they having a honeymoon road trip or what?

85
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:29,322
Well, aren’t they usually like that?

86
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:33,467
They have always been a lovey-dovey since the very first day after they got married.

87
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:36,947
Then, I must be getting a niece or a nephew anytime soon.

88
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,751
Absolutely.

89
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,616
Good afternoon, Your Highness.

90
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,722
Hello, everyone.

91
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,793
Surprise, Lady Pin.

92
00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:59,401
You also came?

93
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,015
How?

94
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:05,249
I invited him.

95
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:10,634
It would be fun with a lot of people here.

96
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,209
Right, Kueakiat?

97
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,498
Yes, Your Highness.

98
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:27,739
If I had known that Master Kuea would be here too, I wouldn’t have come.

99
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:32,972
Miss Aon and Lady Uang alone have made me irritated quite enough.

100
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:37,452
I’m afraid I would hardly find any happiness from this trip.

101
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:45,356
I agree, my lady. I believe Prince Arnon is trying to be a matchmaker for you and Master Kuea.

102
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:50,230
If Prince Arnon is going to support his friend this much,

103
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,202
I’m afraid it would be very hard for me to refuse Master Kuea.

104
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,745
That is true, my lady.

105
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:02,173
Nonetheless, you both must stay by my side.

106
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,832
Yes, my lady.

107
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:06,058
I will handle them for you, my lady.

108
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:39,763
I have already arranged an opportunity for you. It’s all up to you now, Kuea.

109
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:41,855
This is all I can do to help.

110
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:44,910
I am very grateful, Your Highness.

111
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:52,410
Hua Hin is a perfect place for lovers. I hope you can win over her heart soon.

112
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:55,051
I’ll be cheering for you.

113
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,998
Thank you, Your Highness.

114
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:07,774
As for me, I also have a girl to win over her heart.

115
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,203
Please grill the squids and prawns after this.

116
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:53,093
Yes, my lady!

117
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:59,035
Pin.

118
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,406
Anin.

119
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,452
I’m preparing food for everyone, Your Highness.

120
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,876
We are on vacation. Why do you still busy yourself with the cooking…

121
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:10,000
and trying to feed me?

122
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:13,144
I’m afraid you might be hungry.

123
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,286
Then, let me help. / - Oh!

124
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:19,859
No, Your Highness.

125
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,889
Please go and enjoy your time on the beach.

126
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,662
Let me take care of it here.

127
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,367
But I want to help.

128
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,962
Please don’t.

129
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:32,296
It is hot. Be careful, Your Highness.

130
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:33,758
It’s all right.

131
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:35,972
Please don’t.

132
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,276
It’s okay.

133
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:38,655
Please don’t.

134
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:46,882
Lady Pin must be afraid that the heat from the ashes might make you evaporate right in front of her, Your Highness.

135
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,479
Pia.

136
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,556
You better go take a seat, Your Highness.

137
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:55,461
Otherwise, I’m afraid no one would get to eat anything today.

138
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,691
Fine.

139
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:06,421
Please hurry up and come sit with me.

140
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:07,294
Yes.

141
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,197
Did Lady Pin shoo you off, Your Highness?

142
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:53,098
Yes.

143
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:59,029
What about you? You seem to be enjoying the view so much.

144
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:03,194
Well, all the girls around you seem to look very lovely.

145
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:06,420
Be it Miss Aon, or Lady Uang…

146
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:08,902
and especially Lady Pin.

147
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,017
You are not suitable for her.

148
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,535
Come on, Your Highness.

149
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:26,614
But even if you didn’t say that, she already doesn’t seem to be quite fond of me.

150
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:30,227
Do you know how she often looks at me?

151
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:45,964
It’s as if she hates all the men in this world.

152
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,387
You are quite smart, Pranot.

153
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,500
That is what I think too, Your Highness.

154
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:59,970
Why did I not feel like it was a compliment though?

155
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:07,711
So, are you interested in anyone in particular?

156
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:10,137
No one, Your Highness.

157
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:14,367
Miss Orn is out of the question. She is your brother’s fiancé.

158
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:19,661
As for Miss Aon and Lady Uang, they are obviously more interested in you.

159
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:23,661
And for Lady Pin, she seems to hate me to her guts.

160
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:29,697
So, there is no one that I could try to pursue here.

161
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:38,186
There are, in fact, 2 more girls here.

162
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:39,609
Who, Your Highness?

163
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,164
Prik and Pia.

164
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:42,432
Oh dear.

165
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:47,405
If I had to pursue either one of them, I’d rather stay single.

166
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,119
What are you two talking about? It seems fun.

167
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,440
I’m trying to be a matchmaker for Pranot and Prik, or Pia.

168
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:57,120
Really?

169
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,824
No, Your Highness. / - Which one do you like?

170
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,828
Your Highness.

171
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:03,961
Can you be a matchmaker for me and Lady Pin too?

172
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:08,942
Prik.

173
00:16:09,605 --> 00:16:11,212
Please tell Lady Pin to come sit with us.

174
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,418
Lady Pin, please let me help.

175
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,658
No need, Master Kuea.

176
00:16:33,157 --> 00:16:40,000
The Loyal Pin

177
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:47,017
The Loyal Pin

178
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:09,245
Pia.

179
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,196
Yes, my lady.

180
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,345
Please bring them to the princess.

181
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:24,419
Why don’t you bring them to her yourself, my lady?

182
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:29,249
Because she doesn’t want to talk to Master Kuea.

183
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,555
Then, let me take care of it, my lady.

184
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:46,383
Are you having a good time?

185
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:47,387
Yes.

186
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:49,900
The food is ready, Your Highness.

187
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,898
They look delicious.

188
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:04,758
My mouth is watering.

189
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,054
Prik

190
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:09,044
Tell Lady Pin to come sit with us.

191
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:15,119
Lady Pin is still busy with the cooking, Your Highness.

192
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:18,888
Just tell her to come.

193
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:21,788
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:23,591
Wait, Prik.

195
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,815
Yes, Your Highness?

196
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:31,959
These are for you.

197
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,421
For me, Your Highness?

198
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:37,948
Thank you, Your Highness.

199
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,784
You are so smart, Your Highness!

200
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,149
What is that? You just gave her food…

201
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:50,893
and she thinks you are smart?

202
00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:53,723
Prik hardly changes from when she was very little.

203
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:57,840
She is probably taking after her master, Your Highness.

204
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,424
Pranot.

205
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:07,657
Please mercy me, Your Highness.

206
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:11,412
This one is quite smart too, Your Highness.

207
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,355
Lady Pin.

208
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:33,551
Please have a seat. You must be exhausted from making us BBQ.

209
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:34,997
Please.

210
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:38,454
Lady Pin.

211
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,437
Please have a seat.

212
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:46,494
Thank you, Your Highness. But I’m still not done yet.

213
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:49,337
Please excuse me. I must go back and continue with the preparation.

214
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:52,644
Don’t worry about that. Please sit with us first.

215
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,093
I can’t, Your Highness.

216
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,841
Please don’t stop her, Brother.

217
00:19:58,474 --> 00:19:59,901
Go on, Lady Pin.

218
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:11,414
Kuea, go and help her.

219
00:20:11,414 --> 00:20:13,054
What are you waiting for?

220
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:16,581
Yes, Your Highness.

221
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,045
Lady Pin.

222
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:44,635
Wow, they all look delicious.

223
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,394
Please let me help.

224
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,609
No need, Master Kuea.

225
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:51,355
Please go back and continue talking with the prince.

226
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,645
I’ve been talking to him all day long already.

227
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,162
Please let me help you.

228
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:00,727
There is no need. It is quite tiresome.

229
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,363
No problem at all. I can do it.

230
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,621
I really like it.

231
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:08,049
Believe it or not, many people actually call me an expert in grilling.

232
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:11,053
Look at this prawn.

233
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:11,868
I think it’s not…

234
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:13,902
Then, please take care of the rest.

235
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:24,370
I beg your pardon, Your Highness.

236
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:27,008
If you do like it that much,

237
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:30,138
then please finish grilling the rest of the food for them.

238
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:36,029
Pin, let’s go play on the beach with the girls.

239
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:37,236
Yes.

240
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:42,650
Master Kuea is so kind. He has volunteered to do it for Lady Pin, Prik, and Pia.

241
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:46,852
Thank you, Master Kuea.

242
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:50,976
I’ll leave it to you then.

243
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,062
Yes, Your Highness.

244
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,722
Let’s go, Pin.

245
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,416
Pia. Prik.

246
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,150
Yes, Your Highness.

247
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,651
Your Highness!

248
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:34,200
That’s enough, Your Highness.

249
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,781
Your Highness!

250
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,491
Please help me, my lady!

251
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:51,253
Lady Pin, Your Highness.

252
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,344
Why are you looking at me like that?

253
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,365
Do you want to play with us too?

254
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:04,915
No. I’m not a child anymore.

255
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:10,262
Lady Pin said that you two are acting like a child.

256
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:14,010
What is wrong with that, my lady?

257
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,913
That’s right, my lady.

258
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:19,422
Please don’t be too serious about everything. Or else you might look older than your age.

259
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:21,474
She’s right.

260
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:27,937
I am not sure now if this Anin is my lover or my daughter.

261
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:30,749
I am both.

262
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:34,508
If you don’t like it, then I will stop.

263
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:38,583
Let’s go take a walk.

264
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:48,455
Wait, Your Highness. How will I get out of this then?

265
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:49,659
Your Highness!

266
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:58,901
Pia! Please help me first! I’m begging you. Help me first! Please. Please.

267
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:00,061
Hurry up.

268
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,357
Oops! I tripped.

269
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:08,357
Pia! Pia! Come back and help me!

270
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:09,882
Pia!

271
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:15,083
Help! What to do now?

272
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,899
1 2 3!

273
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:19,403
1 2 3!

274
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:23,521
Anybody, please help!

275
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,554
Miss Aon seems a little off, don’t you think?

276
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:28,216
Yes, she seems strange.

277
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:34,060
There must be something wrong.

278
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:35,629
Miss Aon!

279
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:43,280
Help! Miss Aon is drowning! Help!

280
00:25:43,597 --> 00:25:46,462
Help! Miss Aon is drowning! Help!

281
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,778
Help! Miss Aon is drowning!

282
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:52,166
Help! Miss Aon is drowning! Help!

283
00:25:58,501 --> 00:25:59,636
Miss Aon!

284
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:32,161
Miss Aon!

285
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:33,407
Aon!

286
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,195
Miss Aon!

287
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:43,655
What should we do? Can you perform CPR, Your Highness?

288
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,413
But she is a lady.

289
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:47,661
Miss Aon.

290
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:50,393
Miss Aon.

291
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,012
Aon.

292
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:25,308
She already came to.

293
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,393
Miss Aon.

294
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:37,262
Miss Aon.

295
00:27:46,192 --> 00:27:48,512
We better take her inside.

296
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,986
Hurry up.

297
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:51,600
Your Highness, Let me help.

298
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:13,300
Have some hot tea so that you might feel better.

299
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,532
Come, let me help.

300
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,265
Easy there.

301
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:44,618
How fortunate that the princess was there to rescue you in time.

302
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:47,926
She was very concerned about you.

303
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,297
She even gave you CPR herself.

304
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:55,433
Where is she now?

305
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:58,443
I’d like to say thank you to her.

306
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:05,775
Please rest first. You can do that when you get better. Right?

307
00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:14,848
Come, let’s take some rest.

308
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,726
May I have a dance with you, Lady Pin?

309
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:55,741
The Loyal Pin

310
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:02,655
The Loyal Pin

311
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:22,862
Pia.

312
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:24,635
Yes, my lady?

313
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:27,426
Please give this towel to the princess.

314
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:34,789
Why don’t you give it to her yourself, my lady?

315
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,862
Yes, my lady.

316
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:00,917
Oh, princess.

317
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:06,034
Anin, why didn’t you go in? Why are you waiting out here?

318
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:08,355
I’m afraid it might be too crowded for Miss Aon.

319
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:10,744
How is she doing?

320
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:14,543
She is still fatigued, Your Highness. But she should feel better after some rest.

321
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,070
Do we have to take her to the hospital?

322
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:23,074
I don’t think so. Please don’t worry, Anin. There is nothing serious. She will recover soon.

323
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:41,382
How fortunate that the princess was there to rescue you in time.

324
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:44,957
She was very concerned about you.

325
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:48,760
She even gave you CPR herself.

326
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:13,771
Miss Aon.

327
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,810
Miss Aon was drowned, Your Highness?

328
00:33:50,672 --> 00:33:53,229
How is she doing now? Does she need to see the doctor?

329
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:57,056
Anin had rescued her in time. She is safe now.

330
00:33:58,854 --> 00:34:01,810
Where is Anin?

331
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,398
Your Highness, are you looking for me?

332
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,385
I’m looking for Lady Pin, have you seen her?

333
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:22,007
I saw her walking miserably in the direction of the beach, Your Highness.

334
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:23,903
Is that so?

335
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:24,814
Yes, Your Highness.

336
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,931
Are you sure she was coming this way?

337
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:38,113
Yes, Your Highness.

338
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:50,210
Oh, there she is, Your Highness.

339
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:53,610
Over there.

340
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:03,949
Pia, stay here and be on the lookout for us. I will go talk to her.

341
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:05,032
Yes, Your Highness.

342
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:08,081
Please be careful.

343
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:31,013
There you are, Pin.

344
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:42,325
Are you upset that I kissed Miss Aon?

345
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:59,708
I admit that I could barely watch it at first.

346
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:01,664
But now I understand.

347
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,067
It was not a kiss.

348
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:07,505
It was CPR, to help someone who had drowned.

349
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,957
I am well aware of that. But I still couldn’t help feeling possessive of you.

350
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:18,941
That is why I am feeling bad about myself right now.

351
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:22,673
That I cannot handle my own feelings at all.

352
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:33,183
But it was like an indirect kiss anyhow.

353
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:37,191
That’s not the same.

354
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:44,890
A kiss is like this.

355
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,615
Someone might see us.

356
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:10,069
No one can see us. I already asked Pia to be on the lookout for us.

357
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:22,185
I’m afraid she would make the others become more suspicious about us.

358
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:29,069
I’m afraid so too. She even looks more suspicious than us.

359
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:49,317
I’m jealous of Miss Aon for getting to spend 7 years with you in England. I did not get to be with you at all.

360
00:37:51,927 --> 00:37:53,755
Please don’t be jealous.

361
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:58,219
It’s all in the past.

362
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,166
From now on, I promise to never leave your side.

363
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:07,410
What about your study?

364
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:12,382
I will pursue it here.

365
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:19,379
I have asked Lord Pinij to take care of it.

366
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:25,498
It should be at the faculty of architecture at your university.

367
00:38:25,498 --> 00:38:27,134
Are you serious?

368
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:28,981
I am true to my words.

369
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,786
Don’t do it, Your Highness!

370
00:38:40,602 --> 00:38:43,611
No! Don’t do that, Your Highness!

371
00:38:43,611 --> 00:38:46,593
Please don’t!

372
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,185
Stop it, Your Highness!

373
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:54,963
My lady! Your Highness!

374
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:57,055
Don’t do it!

375
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,714
Kueakiat, don’t get drunk so soon.

376
00:39:15,714 --> 00:39:17,660
Yes, Your Highness.

377
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:24,155
The chef from a hotel that we have hired has arrived. The food should be ready soon.

378
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:29,739
Miss Aon, are you feeling better?

379
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:35,952
Yes, Your Highness. My sincere apology for causing such a trouble.

380
00:39:36,444 --> 00:39:38,990
Please don’t worry. It was an accident.

381
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:49,305
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

382
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:04,400
Thank you for saving me, Your Highness. Without you, I could have died.

383
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,570
You’re welcome.

384
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:23,512
Let’s take a seat.

385
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:05,646
May I have a dance with you, Lady Pin?

386
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:13,365
I don’t like to dance.

387
00:41:14,596 --> 00:41:16,589
Just one song, please.

388
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:27,570
Please go and dance with him for just one song, Lady Pin.

389
00:41:38,403 --> 00:41:39,618
Yes, Your Highness.

390
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:48,776
Please.

391
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,822
Miss On, would you like to have a dance with me?

392
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:43,315
Your Highness, let me pour it for you.

393
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,360
So annoying.

394
00:42:57,093 --> 00:42:59,053
I agree, Your Highness.

395
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,810
I also find Master Kuea very annoying.

396
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,838
when Lady Pin refused to dance with him, he should have asked me instead.

397
00:43:07,414 --> 00:43:08,186
Prik.

398
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,097
Yes, Your Highness.

399
00:43:09,097 --> 00:43:11,349
I despise him.

400
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:14,509
If you keep complimenting him,

401
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:17,119
you are dead.

402
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:20,199
I’m sorry, Your Highness. Please mercy me.

403
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:48,149
They all look lovely, Your Highness.

404
00:43:49,405 --> 00:43:54,621
Of course, my brother has hired a hotel chef to cook for us here.

405
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:04,551
Please try this one, Your Highness.

406
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:06,084
Thank you.

407
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:23,307
Please have some more, Your Highness.

408
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,905
Thank you.

409
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:47,518
Can I please excuse myself?

410
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:51,922
I’m not feeling quite well, probably because I was out on the beach for too long.

411
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:55,933
Is it bad, Your Highness? / - Is it bad, Your Highness?

412
00:44:58,371 --> 00:45:01,515
Yes.

413
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:06,299
Please excuse me then.

414
00:45:26,668 --> 00:45:28,910
I’ll bring you the drink, Lady Pin.

415
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,041
Yes.

416
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:32,495
Please go take a seat first.

417
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:40,530
Where is the princess?

418
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,434
She has a headache, so she excused herself to get some rest.

419
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,658
Oh, I see.

420
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:12,885
Lady Pin.

421
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:16,635
Lady Pin.

422
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,131
Where are you going?

423
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,157
I’m going for a walk.

424
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:30,152
Then, can I go with you?

425
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:34,349
There is no need. I can go alone.

426
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:37,962
Please don’t worry. It’s not a bother to me at all.

427
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,190
Please let me walk with you.

428
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:44,197
I’m not afraid that it would bother you. I can go alone.

429
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:45,930
Lady Pin.

430
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,288
Let me go.

431
00:46:47,288 --> 00:46:49,455
Please don’t say that.

432
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:51,374
Please let me accompany you.

433
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:53,816
Please don’t bother.

434
00:46:53,816 --> 00:46:54,367
Lady Pin.

435
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:56,600
My lady!

436
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,650
I have been looking for you everywhere. I need your advice on something, my lady.

437
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,504
I’m afraid she must come with me, Master Kuea.

438
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:04,624
Let’s go, my lady.

439
00:47:33,195 --> 00:47:36,384
Can you do me a favour?

440
00:47:36,384 --> 00:47:41,750
Let the stars witness our love tonight.

441
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:04,970
The Loyal Pin

442
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:11,792
The Loyal Pin

443
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:24,611
Thank you, Prik.

444
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,802
Without you, I wouldn’t know what to do.

445
00:48:27,116 --> 00:48:30,048
Don’t worry, my lady. It is my job to protect you.

446
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:32,672
Where are you going though, my lady?

447
00:48:32,672 --> 00:48:36,071
I’m bringing some pills to the princess. I heard she has a headache.

448
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:37,854
Yes, my lady.

449
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:43,092
Just the pills and not something else too, my lady?

450
00:48:43,407 --> 00:48:44,716
Prik.

451
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:14,000
I heard you have a headache, so I brought you the pills.

452
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:16,881
Please come in.

453
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,337
Do you have to be so stealthy?

454
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:38,475
I’m afraid someone might see us.

455
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:41,613
I left in the middle of the party.

456
00:49:42,923 --> 00:49:44,426
Where is Prik?

457
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:48,177
I asked her to be on the lookout downstairs.

458
00:49:48,177 --> 00:49:52,555
I also told her that if she didn’t see me going down after a while, she could just go to bed.

459
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:56,964
Then she has probably gone to bed since when you came up the stairs.

460
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:01,219
She surely wouldn’t be waiting. She knows me too well.

461
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:05,904
If you keep teasing me like this,

462
00:50:05,904 --> 00:50:08,108
I’m going to go back to my room now.

463
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,364
I was just pulling your legs.

464
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:26,869
I saw you talking to Master Kuea earlier.

465
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:29,407
What were you talking about?

466
00:50:30,664 --> 00:50:33,044
He kept pestering me.

467
00:50:33,044 --> 00:50:35,293
He wanted to go for a walk with me.

468
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:38,798
I already refused but he was being persistent.

469
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:42,059
Such an irritating act.

470
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:45,782
Yes. About that dance too.

471
00:50:45,782 --> 00:50:50,318
I didn’t want to do it, but he kept pestering until your brother had to say it for him.

472
00:50:51,523 --> 00:50:53,522
I do not like it either.

473
00:50:53,732 --> 00:50:56,238
I’m getting very possessive of you now.

474
00:50:58,647 --> 00:51:00,776
Please don’t be mad at me, my baby.

475
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:04,377
I did not want to do it either.

476
00:51:07,075 --> 00:51:12,117
My every thought is always occupied with you.

477
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,523
Do you still have a headache?

478
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:35,811
Yes, I do.

479
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,782
Please take some pills then.

480
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:48,518
Actually, I don’t have a headache.

481
00:51:51,294 --> 00:51:53,748
I just didn’t want to be there.

482
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:57,251
And I also wanted to have your attention.

483
00:52:04,768 --> 00:52:08,885
After everyone is asleep tonight,

484
00:52:11,216 --> 00:52:14,186
can you do me a favour?

485
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:16,716
What is it?

486
00:52:41,978 --> 00:52:44,194
The stars are so beautiful.

487
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:50,243
Not as beautiful as you.

488
00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:59,088
Can I lay my head on your lap?

489
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:16,057
You are quite clingy like a little child.

490
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:23,035
Please make sure you are only like this with me. Can you do that?

491
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:27,640
Of course.

492
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,693
I have given myself to you and only you.

493
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,135
What about you? Whom do you belong to?

494
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:47,648
Certainly, you.

495
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:53,802
Why did you ask me when you already knew the answer?

496
00:53:55,793 --> 00:54:01,168
Then, can you prove it to me again tonight?

497
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,496
Let the stars witness our love tonight.

498
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:07,406
You are so beautiful like an angel.

499
00:57:15,786 --> 00:57:18,357
Your horse is here, Your Highness.

500
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:26,445
Do you want to ride a horse? Why are you so naughty?

501
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:29,035
Is riding a beautiful horse considered naughty?

502
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,554
Many people come to Hua Hin to ride beautiful horses.

503
00:57:32,895 --> 00:57:34,226
Am I right, Prik?

504
00:57:34,226 --> 00:57:35,416
Yes, Your Highness.

505
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,842
I’m too scared to ride it.

506
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:44,271
Please give it a try. We can stop if you find it unpleasant.

507
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:56,149
Prik.

508
00:57:57,118 --> 00:57:59,273
Go and play over there as far as you can.

509
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:02,520
I’m going to take a walk with Lady Pin. Don’t follow us.

510
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,958
Yes, Your Highness. Here you go.

511
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:14,859
You are very naughty.

512
00:58:15,888 --> 00:58:19,110
Don’t you like it? This way, we can finally be alone together.

513
00:59:24,113 --> 00:59:28,014
Here we are. This is where I want you to see.

514
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:53,474
Since when did you do this?

515
00:59:54,914 --> 00:59:56,978
This morning.

516
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:23,737
I actually wish to give this to you when it is the right time.

517
01:00:25,475 --> 01:00:30,853
The way Master Kuea behaves towards you has caused me to be unsettling.

518
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:44,302
Somehow, I at least want everyone to know…

519
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:47,426
that you are already taken.

520
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:04,168
Can you please accept this ring as a gift that portrays…

521
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:10,120
all my feelings for you?

522
01:01:12,163 --> 01:01:13,866
Yes.

523
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:21,758
I will accept all of your feelings and cherish them forever.

524
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:03,415
This felt like a dream.

525
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:06,724
Is it a good dream?

526
01:02:07,484 --> 01:02:09,995
Yes.

527
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:16,699
I used to dream that we would stay side by side…

528
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:23,469
and grow old together, until death will do us apart.

529
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:35,338
One day, it will be my turn to put a ring on your finger.

530
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,030
I will be waiting for that day.

531
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:04,773
Lady Pin, can you please sit with me in my car?

532
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:07,592
I’m sorry. I’m afraid I can’t.

533
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:13,446
But if you let me drive alone, I might doze off and get into an accident.

534
01:04:14,153 --> 01:04:17,624
Then, would you like Prik and Pia to sit with you instead?

535
01:04:18,777 --> 01:04:21,040
It’d be our pleasure.

536
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:23,869
Never mind then, Your Highness.

537
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,484
The car is ready, Your Highness.

538
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,836
Let’s go, Pin.

539
01:04:31,884 --> 01:04:34,174
Please excuse me.

540
01:05:02,485 --> 01:05:05,403
The Loyal Pin

541
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:08,635
I saw Lady Pin wearing a diamond ring on her ring finger, Your Highness.

542
01:05:08,635 --> 01:05:10,757
How come I have never seen it before?

543
01:05:10,757 --> 01:05:14,237
If this ring has caused you to be in a difficult situation,

544
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:19,581
you can remove it or put it on your right hand instead.

545
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:24,300
Why do you choose to wear it on your ring finger?

546
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,468
Remove that ring and give it to me right now!

547
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:31,737
You must start preparing for your master’s degree.

548
01:05:31,737 --> 01:05:33,497
Stop seeing Lady Pin for a while.

549
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:36,369
Are you bringing supper for the princess, my lady?

550
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:37,803
Wasn’t she mad at me?

551
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:40,013
Of course, she was, Your Highness.

552
01:05:40,013 --> 01:05:43,563
Let’s do this then.

553
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:17,585
The Loyal Pin

554
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:27,755
Idolfactory
