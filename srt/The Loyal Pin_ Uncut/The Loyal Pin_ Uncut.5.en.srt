1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,404
This is my friend, Kueakiat. You can call him Kuea.

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:06,779
I have heard a lot about you. Finally, we meet.

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,353
Surprise, Your Highness!

4
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,046
Panot! I miss you so much.

5
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:12,859
I miss you too, Your Highness.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,475
I am absolutely certain that Lady Pin has feelings for you, Your Highness.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,285
Please not too much, Anin. Or else I won’t be able to walk back to the Lotus Palace.

8
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:27,712
Then, why don’t you just stay here with me?

9
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,752
And this…

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,047
is a French kiss.

11
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:40,440
You use it to express desire between lovers.

12
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:31,481
Pin.

13
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:37,477
(Thunder)

14
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,406
Pin!

15
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,589
(Door knocking) / - Pin!

16
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:43,425
(Door knocking) / - Pin!

17
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:49,605

00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:51,294
(Door knocking) / - Please open the door!

19

20
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,182
(Door knocking) / Pin!

21
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:55,454
(Door knocking)

22
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:57,539
Can you hear me?

23
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,320
Pin!

24
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:00,629
(Door knocking)

25
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,683
Pin!

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,264
(Door knocking)

27
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:04,497
Pin!

28
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:08,487
Pin!

29
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,822
Can you hear me?

30
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:12,878
(Door knocking) / Pin.

31
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,426
(Door knocking)

32
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,988
Pin.

33
00:03:56,358 --> 00:04:00,419
The Loyal Pin

34
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,057
(Thunder)

35
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:14,092
(Thunder)

36
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,373
Is she mad at me?

37
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,783
I don’t think so.

38
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,676
(Sigh)

39
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:41,093
Lady Pin has asked me to bring you your breakfast, Your Highness.

40
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,600
Where is she?

41
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,680
At the Lotus Palace, Your Highness.

42
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,122
Why did she not bring it herself?

43
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:50,961
Is she sick because she was in the rain last night?

44
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,532
Lady Pin is doing well, Your Highness.

45
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:57,398
She has made this breakfast for you herself.

46
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,598
Is she busy?

47
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,032
No, Your Highness.

48
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:51,234
Your afternoon refreshments, Your Highness.

49
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:56,886
Is Lady Pin not coming again?

50
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:01,163
I’m afraid not, Your Highness.

51
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:35,182
My lady sends her apology for not being able to see you today, Your Highness.

52
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,991
Is that so?

53
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,417
Please tell her that I will come again.

54
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:42,763
Yes, Your Highness.

55
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,000
(Raining)

56
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:51,309
Why are you ignoring the love I have for you, Pin?

57
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,953
(Door knocking)

58
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:44,120
(Door knocking)

59
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,272
Your Highness, I have brought you breakfast. Would you like to come down for your meal?

60
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:59,748
Take it back, I’m not hungry.

61
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:03,238
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,593
Why does it look untouched?

63
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,838
Princess Anin told me to bring it back. I did not dare to argue, my lady.

64
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:28,207
Did she tell you what she would like to eat?

65
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,369
No, my lady.

66
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:38,173
Then, I will make Moo Sarong*, her favourite dish, for her this evening.
(*Deep-fried pork balls wrapped in Chinese noodle)

67
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:39,197
Yes, my lady.

68
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,653
Please tell her that I made it with all my heart.

69
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,382
Yes, my lady.

70
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,124
What to do now?

71
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:24,856
Should I just eat it?

72
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,480
[Moo Sarong: Deep-fried pork balls wrapped in Chinese noodle]

73
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,916
Did she not eat it again?

74
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:46,851
No, my lady.

75
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:54,678
Did you tell her that I made it for her myself?

76
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:56,520
Yes, my lady.

77
00:12:57,658 --> 00:13:00,599
Her Highness told me to bring it back.

78
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,330
Did she say anything else?

79
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,551
She only said that she does not wish to eat your food, my lady.

80
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:22,606
Then…please wait around the Pine Palace.

81
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:26,246
In case the princess might wish to eat anything, I will make it for her.

82
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,515
Yes, my lady.

83
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:49,773
[Two days later]

84
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:05,420
Water, Your Highness.

85
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,829
Thank you.

86
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:19,969
Has everything gone well while I was away?

87
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,158
Yes, Your Highness.

88
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,400
I passed by the Pine Palace earlier. The place looked quiet and deserted.

89
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,694
Has Princess Anin been staying at the front palace?

90
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:34,766
Wasn’t she at the Pine Palace, Your Highness?

91
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,255
Oh, you do not know?

92
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:43,890
Well, I…

93
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,117
I didn’t go to the Pine Palace this morning. So, I do not know, Your Highness.

94
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,205
Is that so?

95
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,238
What about Prik, Your Highness? Did she not come back with you?

96
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:09,107
Oh, that one just rushed off to see the princess as soon as she got out of the car

97
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,059
She must surely miss her.

98
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:16,557
Yes, Your Highness. Princess Anin probably feels lonely and misses Prik too.

99
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:24,160
My princess, I’m back!

100
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,992
I’m back, Your Highness! Do you miss me?

101
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,814
Your Highness!

102
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,899
Your Highness, I’m back!

103
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,044
I’m back now, Your Highness!

104
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:39,536
Your Highness!

105
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,642
Your Highness.

106
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:44,169
Your Highness, I’m back.

107
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,398
Your Highness.

108
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,389
Your Highness.

109
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,176
My princess.

110
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:52,870
Where is she?

111
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,219
Your Highness!

112
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,332
What? Did she pass out?!

113
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:06,281
Just put it on the table and leave.

114
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,054
It’s me, Your Highness.

115
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:31,840
The Loyal Pin

116
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:38,489
The Loyal Pin

117
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,009
Where is she?

118
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:52,973
Your Highness!

119
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:54,810
Your Highness.

120
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:56,351
Your Highness.

121
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:57,765
Princess.

122
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:58,659
Princess.

123
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,033
Princess.

124
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,135
Princess.

125
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:04,435
She’s burning hot.

126
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:06,449
Princess. Your Highness.

127
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,100
What to do? Where should I go?

128
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,912
What? Anin passed out?!

129
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,451
Yes, Your Highness. She’s burning hot with fever.

130
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,909
I did not know what to do, so I came rushing to you.

131
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,214
How is she?

132
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:02,301
The princess has caught a cold. It is nothing serious, Your Highness.

133
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:04,603
I will prescribe some medicine for the princess.

134
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:07,203
Thank you.

135
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:09,201
Please see him off.

136
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:10,369
Yes, Your Highness.

137
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:19,104
Anin, how are you feeling?

138
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:24,519
It’s nothing serious. I will get better in a few days.

139
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,431
You shouldn’t have taken it so seriously, Brother.

140
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:30,027
How could I not?

141
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:34,381
Fortunately, Prik found you not long after you passed out.

142
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,703
I will have the car pick you up and take you to the front palace.

143
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,342
Can you get up?

144
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:46,299
I am fine, Brother. Please let me stay here at the Pine Palace.

145
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:48,011
But at the front palace…

146
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:51,761
Please do not worry. I already have Prik to take care of me.

147
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:00,705
Very well then.

148
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:03,668
Promise me that you will take a lot of rest.

149
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,196
Yes, Your Highness.

150
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:11,931
Come.

151
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,709
Really? The princess usually looks very healthy.

152
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:34,727
Yes. Koi said Her Highness’s face has turned so pale.

153
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:35,810
Good grief.

154
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,506
Is there a problem?

155
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:43,887
Princess Anin has caught a cold, Your Highness.

156
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:46,931
She was found unconscious at the Pine Palace.

157
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:50,874
My goodness. How is she doing now?

158
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:52,706
The princess is now in good hands, Your Highness.

159
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:55,973
Prince Anan has called for the doctor to check on her.

160
00:19:56,826 --> 00:20:01,658
Princess Anin is usually in good health. She hardly falls sick.

161
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:04,247
How come she has caught a cold this time?

162
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:09,884
They said the princess got wet from the sprinkle of heavy rain.

163
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:03,104
Arghh! Ghost! Ghost!

164
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,451
Prik.

165
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,005
Lady Pin.

166
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:15,459
Is it you, my lady? You gave me a fright.

167
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,934
Yes, who did you think I was?

168
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:22,256
I thought you were a ghost, my lady.

169
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:24,692
Nonsense.

170
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:28,779
I am here to see the princess. Has she already gone to bed?

171
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,136
Not yet, my lady. I’m bringing her a towel and a bowl of warm water.

172
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,669
Is she going to do it by herself?

173
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,102
Yes, my lady. Her Highness is very protective of her own body.

174
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:47,762
She does not allow anyone to touch her, even her own mother.

175
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:55,887
Then, please go and rest. I will bring them to her instead.

176
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,949
Yes, my lady.

177
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,448
Prik.

178
00:22:27,784 --> 00:22:30,761
Just put them on the table and leave.

179
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,213
It’s me, Your Highness.

180
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:19,289
You are burning hot. Please let me wipe your body to cool down the fever.

181
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:21,219
No need.

182
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,495
I can do it myself.

183
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:41,881
Please let me do it.

184
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:48,789
You are flushed with fever. You probably do not have enough strength to do anything.

185
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:58,834
Why are you looking away?

186
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,526
Is there anything unpleasant to your eyes?

187
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,777
No, Your Highness.

188
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:05,635
Does that mean it is pleasant to look at?

189
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:28,184
Do you feel better, Your Highness?

190
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:29,977
Yes.

191
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:35,360
Please get some rest then. I will leave now.

192
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:39,127
Pin, my head hurts.

193
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:44,979
Is it that bad, Your Highness?

194
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:46,236
Yes.

195
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:55,459
Can you stay with me for a while?

196
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:02,053
I will stay until you fall asleep then.

197
00:28:05,938 --> 00:28:08,351
Can I sleep on your lap?

198
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:39,116
As long as you do not look at me with such ignorance,

199
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:46,394
I am willing to give you anything, much more than a sleep on my lap.

200
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:52,720
Was it not you who was being ignorant?

201
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:21,601
My lady.

202
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:26,130
How is my princess doing?

203
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,179
Her fever has subsided.

204
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,393
That’s because she has you to take care of her, my lady.

205
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:40,774
I must go to the university today.

206
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:45,021
Please take care of her food and medicine for me.

207
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:46,441
I will return as soon as I can.

208
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:47,903
Yes, my lady.

209
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:53,107
Oh, and…

210
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:56,397
Do not forget to give her the medicine after her meal.

211
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:57,960
Yes, my lady.

212
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:02,717
Also,

213
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,729
do not leave her side, in case she might need anything.

214
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:11,206
Yes, my lady. If you are this worried about her,

215
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:14,193
perhaps you’d rather not leave for the university.

216
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,367
How could I do that?

217
00:30:17,704 --> 00:30:20,202
Then please hurry up or else you will be late, my lady.

218
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:22,334
I will take good care of the princess for you.

219
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,584
Prik.

220
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:46,671
Prince Anan, are you here to see the princess?

221
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:48,921
Please wait a moment, Your Highness.

222
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:52,068
I just want to know if she is feeling better.

223
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,120
Brother.

224
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:01,656
How are you feeling?

225
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:05,655
Much better now. I can even go for a walk with you.

226
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:08,950
Really?

227
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:20,711
It’s such a relief to know you are getting better.

228
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,559
I had taken good medicine.

229
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,205
What medicine?

230
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:25,940
A medicine from you, Brother.

231
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:31,197
Then I believe you will be able to travel to Phrae in the next three days.

232
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,781
Mother said she would like to accompany Lady Uang back to her palace.

233
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:36,870
And would like to take this opportunity to visit our aunt, Princess Dararai.

234
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,795
Mother has already informed me a few days ago.

235
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:41,527
I’m afraid we cannot wait until the next three days

236
00:31:42,178 --> 00:31:45,697
Mother has just received a phone call from Princess Dararai.

237
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,279
She said Prince Jakkham has already passed away.

238
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:50,880
Are you certain?

239
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:56,435
We must immediately leave for the prince’s funeral no later than today.

240
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:11,251
Father could not wait for me.

241
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:15,720
What about you? In what way do you love me?

242
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:37,847
The Loyal Pin

243
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:44,788
The Loyal Pin

244
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,791
Lady Uang.

245
00:33:06,056 --> 00:33:11,642
Father could not wait for me.

246
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:19,978
Please don’t cry.

247
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:26,664
His Highness Prince and Princess Alisa have already left.

248
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:31,079
They would like you to drive along with the Chao Fah Palace car.

249
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:52,783
Why did you not come to see me in the past few days?

250
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,664
You already have many people visiting you.

251
00:33:57,664 --> 00:34:00,630
They all love you and find you very endearing.

252
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:03,885
Except you. You do not love me.

253
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:11,942
How do you know that I do not love you?

254
00:34:13,276 --> 00:34:18,208
You might, but not in the same way that I do.

255
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:24,522
Then, can you tell me…

256
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,288
in what way that you love me?

257
00:34:43,562 --> 00:34:50,739
I love you…in a way that all my thoughts are consumed by you.

258
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:58,457
I love you…in a way that I long to be close to you…

259
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:06,235
to see your face, to hear your voice, and to touch you.

260
00:35:06,893 --> 00:35:09,886
I do not want anyone to get close to you.

261
00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:16,196
What about you? In what way do you love me?

262
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:26,005
I do not see how this kind of love would be possible between us.

263
00:35:27,678 --> 00:35:33,656
I asked you whether you also love me in the same way that I do.

264
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:36,643
I never said it would not be possible.

265
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,969
I do not know what it is that I feel for you.

266
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,830
Should there be someone who keeps lingering in your mind…

267
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,596
from the time you open your eyes…

268
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:19,562
until the last moment before you fall asleep,

269
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:24,063
am I that person?

270
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:37,089
Someone whom your heart aches for when you see them in pain or sorrow.

271
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:41,129
Someone who makes you feel uneasy or restless…

272
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:45,595
when they ignore you or care for someone else other than you.

273
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:50,328
Someone who makes your heart overwhelmed with joy…

274
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:56,131
when you get close or talk to them.

275
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:02,542
Should there be that someone on your mind,

276
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:06,060
am I that person?

277
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:20,594
I do not know.

278
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,704
Never mind then.

279
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,229
If I ever said anything that might offend you today,

280
00:37:49,245 --> 00:37:54,254
please forgive me. I might have been delusional from the fever.

281
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:34,167
Lady Pin.

282
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,296
Lady Pin.

283
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:38,261
Earth to Lady Pin.

284
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:44,163
The food has been ready for quite a while. What were you pondering about?

285
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,192
Nothing important.

286
00:38:50,606 --> 00:38:54,183
Shall we go watch a movie after this?

287
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,834
I’m afraid I must hurry home. Princess Anin is not doing well.

288
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:05,229
The princess again. When will she return to England?

289
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:24,882
Good, isn’t it? / Yeah.

290
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,745
What are you doing, Prik?

291
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,507
Did I not tell you to never leave the princess’s side?

292
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,316
Why are you lazing around at the Lotus Palace?

293
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,680
Princess Anin has already left to Phrae since this afternoon, my lady.

294
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:49,381
Phrae?

295
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,732
How and with whom?

296
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:55,940
There was a phone call from Princess Dararai this morning.

297
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,905
It was about Prince Jakkham. His Highness has suddenly passed away.

298
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:08,972
All the relatives must travel to Phrae to attend the funeral, my lady.

299
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:12,164
How did Lady Uangfah react to this news?

300
00:40:12,622 --> 00:40:17,928
She was devastated. She had been crying her heart out even when she left, my lady.

301
00:40:18,227 --> 00:40:22,305
Princess Alisa tried to console her but it didn’t help much.

302
00:40:24,436 --> 00:40:25,946
Poor her.

303
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:32,819
Yes, my lady. Princess Anin had to hold Lady Uang and wiped her tears away…

304
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:37,347
to make her feel better and stop crying.

305
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:39,468
Hold her?

306
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:40,595
Yes, my lady.

307
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,916
Like this.

308
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:49,252
And wiped away the tears like this.

309
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:59,486
Please sit in the car with me, Your Highness.

310
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:01,774
I do not want to be alone.

311
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:08,143
Yes, I will go with you.

312
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:11,218
I will keep holding your hand until we reach there.

313
00:41:11,955 --> 00:41:16,998
Lady Uang was so sad that Her Highness must go with her in the Chao Fah Palace car.

314
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:21,405
Other members of the family also left in a car driven by Prince Anan, my lady.

315
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:25,467
They were probably holding each other all the way until Phrae.

316
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:29,335
Enough, Prik. I don’t want to hear it anymore.

317
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,665
Yes, my lady.

318
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:37,524
Do you know when the princess will return?

319
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:43,522
Her Highness and Prince Arnon will probably return later than the others, my lady.

320
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:45,909
What do you mean?

321
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:48,613
Princess Anin will stay there for a while…

322
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:51,441
as she had already promised Lady Uang.

323
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,227
Prince Arnon will also stay there and wait for the princess to return together, my lady.

324
00:42:00,427 --> 00:42:04,590
So, they already have a promise between each other.

325
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,810
Such close cousins they are.

326
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:30,882
Will you keep holding her all day long?

327
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:19,898
Prik, why must you be hungry at this hour?

328
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:22,951
It was that Mango with Sweet Fish Sauce.

329
00:43:22,951 --> 00:43:26,282
It had me gone in and out of the toilet until my stomach is empty.

330
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:32,329
Aaah, ghost! It’s a ghost!

331
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:47,063
Lady Pin!

332
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:51,198
What are you doing this late, my lady?

333
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:14,449
As for Pilanthita, she only belongs to you…and you only.

334
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:37,347
The Loyal Pin

335
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:44,284
The Loyal Pin

336
00:44:57,754 --> 00:45:02,531
What about you? In what way do you love me?

337
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:09,264
I do not see how this kind of love would be possible between us.

338
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:18,571
I asked you whether you also love me in the same way that I do.

339
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:21,749
I never said it would not be possible.

340
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,586
I do not know.

341
00:45:49,578 --> 00:45:54,591
Should there be someone who keeps lingering in your mind…

342
00:45:55,726 --> 00:46:00,526
from the time you open your eyes…

343
00:46:00,526 --> 00:46:04,810
until the last moment before you fall asleep,

344
00:46:05,205 --> 00:46:07,876
Am I that person?

345
00:46:14,388 --> 00:46:17,851
Someone who makes you feel uneasy or restless…

346
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:22,534
when they ignore you or care for someone else other than you.

347
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:26,610
What happened to your hand?

348
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,956
The steam probably… / Let me fix the wound for you.

349
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:31,129
Yes, Your Highness.

350
00:46:35,841 --> 00:46:38,521
Someone who makes your heart overwhelmed with joy…

351
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:42,807
when you get close or talk to them.

352
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:44,391
Let’s go.

353
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,671
Should there be that someone on your mind,

354
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,773
Am I that person?

355
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:16,124
Please come back soon, Anin.

356
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:32,934
[Many days later]

357
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:53,196
Good evening, Your Highness.

358
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:58,840
Have you been waiting to welcome me back?

359
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,876
Yes, Your Highness.

360
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:05,084
I was afraid you might be exhausted from travelling. So, I decided to wait for you at the gate.

361
00:48:05,355 --> 00:48:08,872
How are Princess Dararai and Lady Uang doing, Your Highness?

362
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:11,131
Are they able to contend with the loss?

363
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:13,799
The princess is doing much better.

364
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:18,508
Before I left, her face looked quite radiant, and she seemed to be in better spirits.

365
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:22,410
As for Lady Uang, she seemed to be able to accept the loss at first.

366
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,327
But when she knew that Princess Anin must return home earlier than expected,

367
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:27,309
she was in dismay again.

368
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:30,323
Has the princess already returned, Your Highness?

369
00:48:30,323 --> 00:48:33,620
I believe Prik said she would stay there for another week.

370
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:36,871
Prince Arnon has an urgent matter at the Ministry.

371
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:39,736
So, His Highness Prince told her to also return with her brother.

372
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,498
Does that mean the princess is now at the Pine Palace, Your Highness?

373
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,249
Yes.

374
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:46,534
I haven’t seen you for many days. How I really miss you.

375
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:52,241
Weren’t you so impressed that you wouldn’t want to come back?

376
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:54,738
Of course, not.

377
00:49:55,552 --> 00:49:58,404
My heart still remains at the Lotus Palace.

378
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:03,939
How is everyone at the Chao Fah Palace?

379
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:10,207
They are still overwhelmed by the sudden loss.

380
00:50:10,626 --> 00:50:15,142
Princess Dararai is quite strong since she has been prepared for it.

381
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:18,138
But Lady Uang is still in deep sorrow.

382
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:21,839
You must be exhausted from trying to console her.

383
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,066
Not at all.

384
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:27,094
Lady Uang is my cousin.

385
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:30,196
If I did not console her, then who else would?

386
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:34,379
I only hope…

387
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:39,237
that perhaps you did not console her all night long.

388
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:41,906
Not all night.

389
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:45,433
I didn’t hold her when she was asleep.

390
00:50:46,025 --> 00:50:47,929
You slept in the same room?

391
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:50,551
Yes.

392
00:50:51,143 --> 00:50:54,429
A lot of people were coming to stay at the Chao Fah Palace.

393
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:59,222
So, Lady Uang invited me to sleep in her room for many nights.

394
00:51:00,085 --> 00:51:02,196
Did you sleep on the same bed?

395
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:12,804
No. She slept on a mattress next to my bed.

396
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:16,659
I told her to come and sleep on the bed, but she always refused.

397
00:51:26,321 --> 00:51:31,105
Being this inquisitive, do you perhaps start to feel possessive of me?

398
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:33,770
Yes.

399
00:51:34,411 --> 00:51:36,567
I am possessive of you.

400
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,891
I have always been.

401
00:51:41,026 --> 00:51:42,630
Really?

402
00:51:51,634 --> 00:51:53,843
I have something important for you too.

403
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:56,453
What is it?

404
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,169
Princess Dararai gave me these golden and silver hairpins.

405
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:48,504
I’d like us to have matching hairpins.

406
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:54,541
It is too precious. I cannot take it.

407
00:52:57,254 --> 00:53:02,031
Can you refuse a gift from the elder one?

408
00:53:04,844 --> 00:53:08,869
You are almost a year younger than me. Did you forget that?

409
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:16,163
If we are to refer to our family tree, I am in fact your youngest aunt.

410
00:53:16,163 --> 00:53:17,791
Did you forget that?

411
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:45,053
Let me pin it to your hair.

412
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:11,375
It looks stunning on you.

413
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:42,248
From now on, this hairpin belongs to you…and you only.

414
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:58,712
When I told you that I did not know how I felt for you.

415
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:04,207
I was, in fact, lying.

416
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:11,826
I do know. And I have always known…

417
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:16,378
what it is that I feel for you.

418
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:21,120
What is it?

419
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:13,401
From now on, this hairpin belongs to me.

420
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:20,982
As for Pilanthita, she belongs to you…

421
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,401
and you only.

422
00:56:37,637 --> 00:56:42,092
Whom did you say Pilanthita belongs to?

423
00:56:43,128 --> 00:56:45,666
I am yours.

424
00:56:46,308 --> 00:56:48,971
I have always been.

425
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,885
What about you?

426
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:13,122
I have given myself to you from the very beginning.

427
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:39,183
Can you truly be mine tonight?

428
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:45,009
Everything that I already gave to you,

429
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:53,598
you may do anything as you wish to it, Your Highness.

430
01:00:31,008 --> 01:00:33,904
The Loyal Pin

431
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:39,207
We belong to each other now.

432
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:44,327
Happy Birthday in advance, Pin!

433
01:00:48,965 --> 01:00:53,275
Has Prince Anan not told you yet that you must return earlier than scheduled?

434
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:56,416
When do we have to leave?

435
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,427
Next week.

436
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:09,569
If I were able to write my own destiny,

437
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:12,444
I would have chosen to stay and never left, Prik.

438
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:45,493
The Loyal Pin
