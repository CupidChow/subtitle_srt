1
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,020
The Loyal Pin

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,980
Please go back.

3
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,900
From now on,

4
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:41,198
I do not wish to see your face

5
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,912
for even a second.

6
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:46,855
Kissing each other like that,

7
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:48,549
they are clearly not just friends, Your Highness.

8
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,340
If you wish to object to this marriage,

9
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,820
I will help you.

10
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,140
No,

11
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,180
I’d rather live my life quietly like this.

12
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,540
Kueakiat,

13
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
already has a wife?

14
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,460
Where did you get that opinion from?

15
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,540
Things have gone far beyond our control.

16
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:04,926
We cannot change anything.

17
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,740
Even if you have to live in hell,

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,260
for the rest of your life?

19
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,940
Yes.

20
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,224
You can't marry her!

21
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,660
Miss Savitree

22
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,580
All this time, have you seen me as a fool?

23
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,380
You told me you would marry me soon.

24
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,340
What does this wedding mean?

25
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,300
Who are you?

26
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:23,414
Get out of here right now!

27
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,940
Get off me!

28
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,485
Let me go! Let go!

29
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:30,814
Let me go!

30
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:31,949
Let me go!

31
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,100
I am the groom's wife!

32
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,816
What rubbish are you talking about?

33
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,840
Don’t you dare accuse me like that.

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,220
Accuse?

35
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,540
The evidence is clearly in my belly here.

36
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,660
It's your child!

37
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,700
What child?

38
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,300
When did I make you pregnant?

39
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,540
When you came to see me every single day.

40
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,889
Should I tell everyone more?

41
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,300
- That you…
- No!

42
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,180
You got pregnant with someone else

43
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,940
and now you are accusing me of being the father.

44
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,330
You know it better than anyone.

45
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,405
Or else why did you buy me a house?

46
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,140
I had to quit university because my belly is growing bigger.

47
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,180
But all you do is leave me to marry someone else.

48
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:24,649
Stop lying!

49
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,780
Go back right now.

50
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,580
Who is lying?

51
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:31,780
If you accuse me of lying,

52
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,340
then I will beat up this unwanted child,

53
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,220
to death right in front of his own father.

54
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,700
Stop,

55
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,420
Savitree!

56
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,340
- Stop!
- Just die! Die! Die!

57
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,380
Stop it right now, Savitree!

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,612
If you don't want this child,

59
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:46,500
- Stop!
- just let him die!

60
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,700
Enough!

61
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,940
Enough, Savitree.

62
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,020
That’s our child!

63
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Stop it right now, Savitree!

64
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,060
Stop!

65
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:58,868
Stop it right now!

66
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:02,060
Enough, Savitree.

67
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,500
Then, I will marry him.

68
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,900
I will marry Master Kuea, Your Highness.

69
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,300
What are you saying?

70
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,380
Pin.

71
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:10,745
You do not have to do it if you don't want to.

72
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,740
Sometimes, I do not have much of a choice.

73
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,140
I can only wish you to live happily with him.

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,380
Let me go!

75
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,940
I told you stop it, Savitree!

76
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,980
Lady Pin!

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,820
Whoa! Lady Pin!

78
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,460
Lady Pin!

79
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,260
Lady Pin!

80
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,260
Lady Pin! Lady Pin!

81
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,500
Lady Pin!

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,540
Lady Pin!

83
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,860
Lady Pin!

84
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,100
Lady Pin!

85
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,445
Enough, Savitree.

86
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,540
- Let me go!
- That's enough.

87
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,660
That's enough.

88
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:47,157
Enough!

89
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,751
What does this mean, Kueakiat?

90
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,420
You must marry Kueakiat.

91
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,660
But I do not love him.

92
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,620
Your Highness.

93
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:43,263
Please…

94
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,574
Please have mercy on me.

95
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,900
I would surely die,

96
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,269
if I could not see the princess again.

97
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,759
Then so be it.

98
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:01,045
I also want to know if you will,

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,910
eventually stop breathing right in front of me.

100
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,180
No,

101
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,780
we will go live together somewhere.

102
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,142
Then, I will marry him.

103
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,620
I will marry Master Kuea, Your Highness.

104
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,300
What are you saying?

105
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,220
Pin.

106
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,580
You do not have to do it if you don't want to.

107
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,469
Please don't sacrifice yourself for me.

108
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:41,341
No matter what, I will marry him.

109
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:04,255
Kueakiat already has a wife?

110
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,500
Where did you get that opinion from?

111
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,900
It is the truth.

112
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,660
If you do not believe me, you can ask Prik.

113
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,700
Even if what you said is true,

114
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:19,645
I still cannot cancel the wedding that will be held tomorrow.

115
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,900
If you do not cancel this wedding,

116
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,620
you will..

117
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,060
certainly regret it one day.

118
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:30,278
- Stop it!
- Let him die!

119
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,660
That's enough, Savitree!

120
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,940
That’s our child!

121
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,780
Whoa Lady Pin!

122
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:03,062
What is it, Prik?

123
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,716
His Highness would like to see you, Your Highness.

124
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,380
I feel so bad for her, Your Highness.

125
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:34,504
She could hardly eat or sleep before the wedding.

126
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:39,513
And now she must face such a heartbreaking incident,

127
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,580
on her own wedding day.

128
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,190
Please look after her for me.

129
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,140
Yes, Your Highness.

130
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,180
My lady.

131
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,900
How are you feeling, my lady?

132
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,500
I am fine.

133
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,660
What about the wedding?

134
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,140
Slowly. Please let me help you.

135
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:08,965
Let me help, my lady.

136
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,693
The wedding is a complete mess, my lady.

137
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,340
His Highness is now talking to Master Kuea and his family.

138
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,540
Can you go and find out

139
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,660
What is happening?

140
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:35,781
Yes, my lady.

141
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:47,693
Your son has done such disgraceful behavior.

142
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,063
How dare you have the audacity to ask for my wish,

143
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,420
for his wedding, Prince Kobkiat?

144
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,316
Please accept my deepest and sincerest apology, Your Highness.

145
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,486
I did not raise him well.

146
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,140
Don’t apologize to me.

147
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,660
It is Princess Patt and Lady Pin that you should apologize to.

148
00:12:11,828 --> 00:12:13,308
But this is such a grave mistake.

149
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,700
Just an apology from you cannot amend anything.

150
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:21,272
We are willing to do anything, Your Highness.

151
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:25,566
Yes?

152
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,317
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,500
Very well. I want Kueakiat to marry that girl

154
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,140
who is pregnant with his child.

155
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,260
Can you give me your word for that?

156
00:12:59,124 --> 00:12:59,924
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:01,806
Also,

158
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:05,037
do remember that from now on,

159
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,915
you are not allowed to step foot,

160
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,140
inside the walls of Savettawarit grand palace ever again.

161
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,980
As for this wedding,

162
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,756
it shall be deemed as a void.

163
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,020
Your Highness! Your Highness, please let me explain…

164
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,380
You should go back.

165
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,489
I do not want to talk to you right now.

166
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,380
Your…

167
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,860
I never thought Kueakiat would be so selfish like this.

168
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,340
I’m awfully disappointed, Brother.

169
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,620
People are like this.

170
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,980
You only know what they want you to know.

171
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:34,491
I shouldn’t have introduced him to Lady Pin.

172
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,580
I feel I have done her terribly wrong.

173
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:44,014
Don’t blame yourself.

174
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,320
I believe Princess Patt and Lady Pin,

175
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,660
do not blame you either.

176
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,900
We were all fooled by Kueakiat.

177
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,841
He has left us all in dismay.

178
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,700
I could not imagine how horrible Princess Patt and Lady Pin would feel.

179
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm afraid she might not want to see my face right now.

180
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,620
You are driving too fast, Your Highness!

181
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,709
The Loyal Pin

182
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:56,033
The Loyal Pin

183
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,713
She has been standing there for quite a while, Your Highness.

184
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:20,833
She must be very disappointed about Master Kuea.

185
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:25,935
You can leave us alone, Pia.

186
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,230
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:39,826
My dear.

188
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,129
Why are you still standing here?

189
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,921
Why don’t you go and tell Lady Pin about the good news?

190
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,585
Or are you not pleased with His Highness’s judgement?

191
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,553
I’m afraid she might not want to see my face right now.

192
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:04,713
It was I who have brought such shame,

193
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:07,513
and disgrace upon your family.

194
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,193
Please don’t blame yourself.

195
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:16,276
It is Kueakiat who has done us wrong,

196
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:18,002
not you.

197
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,313
Regarding what just happened,

198
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:24,873
if we look at it in a bad way,

199
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,313
it is indeed very dreadful.

200
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:29,167
But on the other hand, it is rather fortunate that

201
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,953
we found out before it was too late.

202
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,033
Nonetheless,

203
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,273
I have tainted your family name with dishonour

204
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,793
and embarrassment.

205
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:41,433
As for Lady Pin,

206
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:44,671
people would surely be gossiping about her.

207
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:48,353
Let them say what they want.

208
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:49,913
Don’t pay them any attention.

209
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,570
I believe His Highness is also not the kind of person…

210
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,513
who would be embarrassed so easily.

211
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:58,475
She is correct.

212
00:18:04,353 --> 00:18:06,153
The one who should be embarrassed,

213
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,433
is Kueakiat,

214
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:08,633
not us.

215
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:10,913
You need not stress any longer.

216
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,323
Yes, Your Highness.

217
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,193
This is just one of the little things,

218
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:19,433
that came into our lives.

219
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:23,433
It is very fortunate that we found out now…

220
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,233
rather than when Lady Pin had already married.

221
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:29,711
Yes.

222
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,149
By then, it would be too late to change anything.

223
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,793
Pattamika,

224
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,508
don’t bother paying attention to that man.

225
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:48,833
I will order everyone to never talk about this incident again.

226
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:02,993
His Highness was furious.

227
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,673
He ordered Master Kuea

228
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:06,113
to marry that woman properly.

229
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:07,393
And also forbade him

230
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:09,753
from stepping foot inside this grand palace ever again, my lady.

231
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:11,793
Banned from this palace?

232
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:12,593
Yes, my lady.

233
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:13,953
Regarding the wedding,

234
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:16,117
What did he say?

235
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:19,057
It shall be considered as a void.

236
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:21,328
Does that mean…

237
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:23,753
I do not need to marry Kueakiat anymore?

238
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,047
Yes, my lady!

239
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,433
Whoa!

240
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,153
My lady!

241
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:39,806
My lady!

242
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:42,083
Why did you throw it away like that?

243
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,353
It is quite expensive. How unfortunate indeed.

244
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:47,993
A ring from a worthless man is merely nothing but a rubbish.

245
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,233
Then you could have given it to me.

246
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,673
It looks expensive.

247
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:56,033
I might be able to sell it for a lot of money.

248
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:58,453
What did you just say?

249
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:01,148
Oh…

250
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:02,828
nothing, my lady.

251
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,313
I am so happy.

252
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,473
It would be better if Princess Anin,

253
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:20,553
also knew about this.

254
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:25,023
That all her efforts and hard work have now paid off.

255
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:28,793
The princess had tried to persuade that woman…

256
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,873
to reveal the truth to everyone.

257
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:37,734
She was willing to do anything for you, my lady.

258
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:39,993
It was not until last night

259
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:42,153
that she finally gave up

260
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:43,993
and fled to Hua Hin.

261
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:47,833
Because she did not want to see you marry someone else.

262
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,505
Please eat something, Your Highness.

263
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:28,353
You haven’t eaten anything since this morning.

264
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,633
I don't have any appetite.

265
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,753
Knowing that by now…

266
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,873
she might already be in Kueakiat’s arms…

267
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,173
makes my heart even more wrenching.

268
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,793
Who is calling?

269
00:22:28,086 --> 00:22:29,763
Is she not answering the call, Your Highness?

270
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,359
Perhaps they are not home.

271
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,673
Should we try calling her again, Your Highness?

272
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:43,913
Please go freshen up yourself first, Your Highness.

273
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,033
Then we can have dinner.

274
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:53,633
I'll answer it.

275
00:22:58,993 --> 00:22:59,793
Hello?

276
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:01,993
Is that you, Anin?

277
00:23:03,678 --> 00:23:04,798
I have been calling you so many times.

278
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,673
Hello, Brother.

279
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:09,913
Is there anything urgent?

280
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,313
The wedding has been cancelled.

281
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,593
Can you say it again?

282
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:28,993
Is it true?

283
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,473
I will leave for home tomorrow at dawn.

284
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,310
What happened, Your Highness?

285
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,873
The wedding has been cancelled.

286
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:45,914
Lady Pin does not need to marry Kueakiat anymore.

287
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,393
Is it certain, Your Highness?

288
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:49,553
Yes.

289
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:20,973
I have given myself to you, and only you.

290
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:29,165
What about you, who do you belong to?

291
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,633
I certainly belong to you.

292
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:36,713
Why did you ask me,

293
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:38,753
when you already knew the answer so well?

294
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,540
Then, can you prove it to me again tonight?

295
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:10,233
Tonight,

296
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,993
I shall let the stars witness our love.

297
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,593
Please wait for me, Pin.

298
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:32,584
Tomorrow, I will finally return to your arms.

299
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:47,273
Anin, please come back to me soon.

300
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:50,633
This time,

301
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,998
This time, I shall never let go of your hands ever again.

302
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:10,033
My lady.

303
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,633
My lady.

304
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:24,146
My lady.

305
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:26,467
My lady.

306
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:30,283
My lady.

307
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:46,725
Hey.

308
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:49,633
Have you seen Lady Pin?

309
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:50,713
No.

310
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:55,393
Hey.

311
00:26:56,443 --> 00:26:57,843
Have you seen Lady Pin?

312
00:26:58,235 --> 00:26:59,155
No.

313
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,605
Lady Pin!

314
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:17,513
My lady!

315
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,590
My lady!

316
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,742
My lady!

317
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,094
My lady! My lady!

318
00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:29,632
My lady!

319
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:31,369
Be careful, my lady.

320
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,559
Slowly, my lady.

321
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,290
My lady.

322
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:38,549
My lady, why did you sleep over here?

323
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:43,358
I came to wait for the princess.

324
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,433
So that I would be the first

325
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:47,594
to see her when she returns.

326
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:52,713
Don't tell me you have slept here all night long.

327
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:56,491
You..

328
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,500
better get inside, my lady.

329
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,251
You are boiling hot with fever.

330
00:28:00,673 --> 00:28:01,753
Please, my lady.

331
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,513
Let’s go inside. I will help.

332
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:07,509
Be careful, my lady.

333
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:33,313
Please have some,

334
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:37,073
boiled rice, my lady, So that you can take some pills.

335
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:40,193
No.

336
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:43,153
I will wait for the princess.

337
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:47,007
Hua Hin is not that far.

338
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,079
Why has she not arrived yet?

339
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,280
She must have forgotten me completely.

340
00:28:57,674 --> 00:28:58,914
Of course not, my lady.

341
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,241
You can go out, Prik.

342
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:02,984
I’m going to rest.

343
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:06,553
Please eat,

344
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:09,033
something first, my lady.

345
00:29:09,193 --> 00:29:11,793
Otherwise, how will you get better?

346
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,490
Should the princess return…

347
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:15,515
Please leave.

348
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,053
Should I feel hungry,

349
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:24,993
I will eat it.

350
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:37,896
Yes, my lady.

351
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,824
She refuses to eat anything, not even the medicine, Your Highness.

352
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,217
She wants to wait for the princess to return.

353
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:13,882
She must have been waiting out here all night.

354
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,425
That is why she has caught a cold, Your Highness.

355
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:26,991
How I wish I could just make the princess appear right now.

356
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:37,359
You are driving too fast, Your Highness!

357
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:39,434
Should we ask the driver to take your place?

358
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:42,421
No, I’m quite restless. I want to drive it myself.

359
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:47,614
But you are driving too fast. It’s dangerous, Your Highness.

360
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:49,757
I want to be with her as fast as I can.

361
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:01,233
Your Highness! Watch out!

362
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:04,489
Has the princess arrived?

363
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:07,489
Not yet, my lady.

364
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,063
My lady!

365
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:47,673
The Loyal Pin

366
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,729
The Loyal Pin

367
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,209
Your Highness! Watch out!

368
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,249
Anin!

369
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:21,009
My lady,

370
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,769
- it’s already dark…
- Has the princess arrived?

371
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:26,554
Not yet, my lady.

372
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:28,129
Has she called?

373
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:30,153
No, my lady.

374
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,849
Where are you going, my lady?

375
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:37,569
My lady.

376
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:38,889
My lady.

377
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:40,449
Where are you going, my lady?

378
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:41,369
My lady.

379
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:43,209
Please wait for me and Prik, my lady!

380
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,729
Have you finally come back to me?

381
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:42,009
Yes.

382
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:44,289
I am not dreaming, am I?

383
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:47,489
No, you are not dreaming.

384
00:34:10,689 --> 00:34:12,689
Then, what took you so long?

385
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,474
My car broke down on the way here.

386
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:22,289
But I was so restless that I took a train back home instead.

387
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:29,849
I thought you would never come back to me again.

388
00:34:36,689 --> 00:34:38,449
Why would you say that?

389
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:41,353
Because in the past few months,

390
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,449
you had convinced me to believe in that way.

391
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,769
Can you please forgive me?

392
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:58,769
A person like me

393
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:01,649
who is so foolishly in love with you…

394
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:05,449
does not in fact have much of a choice.

395
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:09,729
Do I not have the right to be angry at all?

396
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:18,633
Please do not forget that

397
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:21,385
I also have a heart.

398
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:31,452
Is that why

399
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:36,601
you told me to stay out of your sight?

400
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:41,529
I had to do it.

401
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:44,418
It hurt so much.

402
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:46,411
So unbearable.

403
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:49,171
It hurt

404
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:53,449
when you treated me as if I were your affair.

405
00:35:56,773 --> 00:35:57,573
It hurt

406
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:01,569
when you agreed to let him move in…

407
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,049
just because you still wanted to see me every day.

408
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:13,689
Has it never occurred to you…

409
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:17,631
how I would feel if I had to see you

410
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:20,969
living with him every single day?

411
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:26,702
I am sorry.

412
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:30,649
It had never occurred to me.

413
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,050
It was very selfish of me.

414
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:42,969
Can you please forgive me?

415
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,650
I have long forgiven you.

416
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,809
But I’m still hurt.

417
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:04,809
Then,

418
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:08,441
I shall do everything to make it up to you.

419
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,339
How so?

420
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,129
By agreeing with everything that you wish to do.

421
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,140
And by never choose the path

422
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:31,705
that will separate both of us…

423
00:37:33,722 --> 00:37:36,442
and force us to walk a different path.

424
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:42,889
Do you mean every word you said?

425
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:46,811
Yes.

426
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:11,169
Princess Patt told me that you are sick.

427
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:14,521
Princess Patt?

428
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:16,209
Yes.

429
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,129
Your Highness, is Lady…

430
00:38:23,129 --> 00:38:24,689
I have a favor to ask.

431
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:28,009
Can you please go and look after Lady Pin for me, Princess?

432
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,020
Is she not well?

433
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:31,209
Since the wedding day,

434
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,889
she has fallen sick and refused to eat anything.

435
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:37,129
And I feel too ashamed to face her myself.

436
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,929
But if it is you, I am sure she would be very pleased.

437
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:44,369
Princess Patt was waiting for me at the front palace.

438
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:46,809
She was there to inform me herself.

439
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:51,424
If Princess Pattamika did ask you to do that, Your Highness…

440
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:52,649
then I believe

441
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:55,849
she is no longer against you being together with Lady Pin.

442
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:03,419
Shall we celebrate this good news with boiled rice, Your Highness?

443
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:05,209
My lady has fallen sick

444
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,809
because she was waiting for you to return from Hua Hin.

445
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:11,609
She had been waiting at the Pine Palace all night

446
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,329
and still has not eaten anything, Your Highness.

447
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:19,769
Is that true?

448
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:27,289
Yes.

449
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,169
Please open your mouth.

450
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:51,369
I thought you said you would do as I wish.

451
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:55,375
I will take one bite…

452
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:00,489
only if you answer me a question.

453
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,212
Ask away then.

454
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,751
Was the sea in Hua Hin

455
00:40:11,129 --> 00:40:13,409
very fair this time?

456
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:19,871
Well, not so fair.

457
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,479
But quite clear indeed.

458
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:35,089
Now,

459
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:36,929
open your mouth.

460
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:43,409
You should keep your promise.

461
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:46,449
You told me you would take one bite

462
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,329
if I answered your question.

463
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:53,749
There.

464
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:56,929
Is it good?

465
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:03,843
So, what is the next question?

466
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:11,037
The night that Lady Uangfah came to stay here,

467
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:14,249
where did she sleep?

468
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,449
In the guest room, of course.

469
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:27,569
Now, another bite.

470
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:32,409
Do you want more?

471
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:44,769
You’re eating now, my lady?

472
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:47,689
I told you to eat something so that you will gain,

473
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:49,649
some strength to wait for the princess.

474
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:04,129
Yes, Your Highness.

475
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:07,289
Let’s go.

476
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:08,129
What?

477
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:09,089
Let’s go.

478
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:14,129
Why are you so clueless?

479
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:15,849
I thought you said you knew her well.

480
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,769
Oh, then are we no longer needed?

481
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,049
Trust me, Lady Pin is sure to recover quickly,

482
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:22,329
with the princess by her side.

483
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,329
Awww. Oh!

484
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,169
Is everything going well?

485
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,329
Yes, Your Highness.

486
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:31,129
I have prepared everything exactly as you said.

487
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:47,649
Let’s get yourself clean up a little so that

488
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:50,409
you will feel more comfortable when you rest.

489
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,569
Please don’t bother, Anin.

490
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:55,729
I can do it myself.

491
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:58,649
It’s not a bother at all.

492
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:00,409
Let me do it for you.

493
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:03,249
Please don’t move.

494
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:57,209
What are you doing?

495
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:00,569
I am checking your fever.

496
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:04,649
Is this how you check for a fever?

497
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:06,649
Yes.

498
00:44:09,092 --> 00:44:12,132
What if I am not sick anymore.

499
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:15,362
Would you still check for my fever?

500
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:17,689
Yes.

501
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:21,674
I am not quite sure if you are fully recovered.

502
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:25,169
How will you do it?

503
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:32,729
First, I must unravel every part of you.

504
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,546
I love you, Anin.

505
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:55,129
I love you too.

506
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:37,329
Pin! You are still sick.

507
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,780
Finally, the physical check-up is done.

508
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:15,742
It certainly took quite some time.

509
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,449
Please don't say that.

510
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:23,889
I’m so embarrassed.

511
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,569
Fine, I won’t tease you anymore.

512
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:36,891
Let’s go to bed, shall we?

513
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:39,849
You might fall sick again

514
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:41,369
if you keep staying out here.

515
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:45,988
I do not want to sleep yet.

516
00:46:48,228 --> 00:46:50,068
How I’m afraid that when I wake up,

517
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,260
I would find that it were all just a dream.

518
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:58,474
Like how I used to keep having bad dreams.

519
00:47:01,164 --> 00:47:05,804
How I’m scared that I will never see you again.

520
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:09,889
I am not going anywhere.

521
00:47:11,197 --> 00:47:12,917
I promise.

522
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:16,130
When you open your eyes,

523
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:18,729
I will be right here holding you in my arms.

524
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,660
If you say so,

525
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:30,223
then I believe you.

526
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:40,407
By the way, when you said you would,

527
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:42,729
go to England and never return…

528
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:46,249
I am not going.

529
00:47:48,434 --> 00:47:50,594
Having you in my arms like this,

530
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:52,781
I shall never go anywhere again.

531
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,334
You must be mad at me

532
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,420
for never doing anything to fight for you.

533
00:48:05,931 --> 00:48:07,691
Not at all.

534
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:11,386
Now that I had time to ponder,

535
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,090
I have realized that

536
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:17,049
each of us has our own reason for what we did.

537
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:21,452
You were fighting in your own way.

538
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,450
As a lover,

539
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:29,929
you chose to sacrifice your happiness for me.

540
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:35,739
As a niece, you chose to be grateful and fulfill your aunt's request.

541
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,249
But from now on,

542
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:48,369
please know that…

543
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:53,541
I shall never choose a path,

544
00:48:55,383 --> 00:48:57,343
that will make us stay part.

545
00:49:01,769 --> 00:49:03,249
I promise.

546
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:34,969
Are you going to tell your father about you and Lady Pin?

547
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:36,689
I am deeply in love with the person

548
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:39,209
I am not able to marry.

549
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:40,489
Who is that

550
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:42,169
person you love?

551
00:50:14,649 --> 00:50:17,169
The Loyal Pin

552
00:50:21,673 --> 00:50:24,353
The Loyal Pin

553
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:40,633
What matter has brought,

554
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:41,953
you here, Princess?

555
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:45,153
I would like to apologize to you.

556
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:47,713
And I would also like to ask for your advice.

557
00:50:48,487 --> 00:50:51,567
Apologize for what?

558
00:50:52,518 --> 00:50:54,118
For being rude and behaving badly

559
00:50:54,273 --> 00:50:56,673
towards you on that day.

560
00:50:57,288 --> 00:51:00,105
I was stubborn and blinded by my own reason.

561
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,780
I did not care what other people might think.

562
00:51:03,233 --> 00:51:05,273
It was very selfish of me.

563
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:10,087
Can you please forgive me?

564
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:15,593
But in my opinion, you were brave and honest.

565
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:18,873
All through my life, I have yet found any woman

566
00:51:18,873 --> 00:51:21,473
who is as honest to her feelings as you do.

567
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:26,833
However,

568
00:51:27,193 --> 00:51:28,833
I should have never displayed such ill manners towards you.

569
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:32,048
You did not.

570
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:33,613
Because in the end,

571
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:37,543
every single word you said had turned out to be true.

572
00:51:38,364 --> 00:51:40,204
It was I who was so stubborn that

573
00:51:40,288 --> 00:51:42,728
I almost ended up having such a horrid man

574
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:44,113
as my nephew-in-law.

575
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:47,233
Your Highness.

576
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:50,993
How dare he asked for my niece’s hand in marriage

577
00:51:50,993 --> 00:51:52,833
when he already has a wife who is also pregnant?

578
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:54,805
I feel so angry

579
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:58,273
how I used to believe that he was a very decent man.

580
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,262
Please don’t blame yourself.

581
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:04,784
I know you would always try to make the best choice there is.

582
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:09,015
In my opinion, Lady Pin is very fortunate,

583
00:52:09,273 --> 00:52:11,113
to have escaped a marriage with that man.

584
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:13,353
The more witnesses there were during the incident,

585
00:52:13,353 --> 00:52:15,433
the better it is for Lady Pin.

586
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,633
Because then, no one shall have the reason

587
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:21,353
to accuse her of abandoning him unfairly.

588
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:30,033
I am sorry for ignoring your objection
and not heeding your advice, Princess.

589
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,953
Please kindly accept my sincere apology.

590
00:52:39,033 --> 00:52:41,473
You do not have to apologize at all.

591
00:52:43,313 --> 00:52:46,833
You said you also want my advice.

592
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:48,353
May I ask what it is?

593
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:53,052
I’d like to ask for your approval…

594
00:52:55,274 --> 00:52:57,794
on my relationship with Lady Pin.

595
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:59,233
Will you approve of us?

596
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,748
Lady Pin loves and respects you immensely.

597
00:53:07,906 --> 00:53:10,506
It is our wish to keep seeing each other under your approval.

598
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,019
We do not want to do it behind your back like before.

599
00:53:13,964 --> 00:53:17,004
I promise that I will never bring any shame to your name.

600
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,020
The storm has already passed.

601
00:53:26,924 --> 00:53:28,484
I do not have any problem with your request.

602
00:53:37,835 --> 00:53:39,155
Thank you.

603
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:50,436
You seem to have something on your mind still.

604
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:55,699
I am only worried

605
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,660
how His Highness would react,

606
00:53:58,525 --> 00:53:59,885
if he found out about this?

607
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,619
Please leave that problem to me.

608
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:15,033
What did you say?

609
00:54:16,648 --> 00:54:17,808
You want to tell your father

610
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,793
about you and Lady Pin?

611
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:21,453
Yes,

612
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:23,513
I want to be honest to him.

613
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:25,753
I want to let him know that I am deeply in love

614
00:54:25,753 --> 00:54:27,313
with Lady Pin and never wish to marry anyone.

615
00:54:30,313 --> 00:54:31,273
I am begging you.

616
00:54:32,073 --> 00:54:34,113
Can you please not tell him?

617
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:37,257
I’m afraid he might find it very upsetting.

618
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,753
But I want to be honest with myself.

619
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,233
And I do not want to keep hiding such an important thing

620
00:54:44,593 --> 00:54:46,833
from Father whom I very much love and respect.

621
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:50,233
I’m afraid

622
00:54:50,593 --> 00:54:52,593
I won’t be able to stop you then.

623
00:54:54,993 --> 00:54:56,393
However the consequences might be,

624
00:54:57,913 --> 00:54:59,953
I am willing to accept it.

625
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,113
If possible,

626
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:11,553
can I go talk to him with you?

627
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:14,633
I want to be there for you.

628
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:17,513
Just by hearing that already

629
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:19,393
made me feel so happy.

630
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:22,033
But this time,

631
00:55:23,344 --> 00:55:25,664
let me go talk to him alone first.

632
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,784
Please wait for me here.

633
00:55:32,553 --> 00:55:33,153
But I…

634
00:55:33,153 --> 00:55:35,313
Did you not promise to let me do as I wish?

635
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:43,513
Fine.

636
00:55:47,393 --> 00:55:48,673
But from now on,

637
00:55:50,073 --> 00:55:51,953
no matter what you would decide to do…

638
00:55:53,873 --> 00:55:55,593
or however good or bad

639
00:55:57,113 --> 00:55:58,633
the consequences might be,

640
00:56:01,993 --> 00:56:03,593
please remember…

641
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:06,953
that I will always be here

642
00:56:09,073 --> 00:56:10,633
and will never let go of your hands.

643
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,233
Please wait for me here.

644
00:56:25,153 --> 00:56:26,593
It will not be long.

645
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:47,273
Anin.

646
00:56:49,793 --> 00:56:51,833
You hardly came to visit me here.

647
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:54,433
What would you like to talk to me?

648
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:58,233
I have something important…

649
00:56:58,233 --> 00:57:00,713
that I wish to have an approval from you, Father.

650
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,033
Please say it. What is it that you wish for?

651
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,153
I’d like to stay single for the rest of my life.

652
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:18,753
What do you mean?

653
00:57:18,753 --> 00:57:19,953
I do not understand.

654
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:25,039
It means I will never marry anyone, Father.

655
00:57:33,793 --> 00:57:34,953
Is there a reason?

656
00:57:36,593 --> 00:57:37,833
I only have..

657
00:57:38,633 --> 00:57:39,913
one reason.

658
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:42,713
I am deeply in love with,

659
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:45,353
the person I am not able to marry.

660
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:49,833
That is why I only wish to stay by my lover’s side

661
00:57:50,273 --> 00:57:52,433
and grow old together without having a wedding.

662
00:57:58,113 --> 00:57:58,913
Who is that

663
00:57:59,953 --> 00:58:00,753
person you love?

664
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,553
It’s Lady Pilanthita.

665
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:36,913
If your father does not approve of your relationship with Lady Pin...

666
00:58:37,553 --> 00:58:39,673
what would you do?

667
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:42,433
I will move out of the palace

668
00:58:44,073 --> 00:58:46,393
And go to England with Lady Pin.

669
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:49,793
Are you going to talk to His Highness about you and the princess

670
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:52,913
I want to do something for her.

671
00:58:55,693 --> 00:58:56,893
How dare you!

672
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:59,793
And you still have the audacity to ask for my approval.

673
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:04,229
Your Highness.

674
00:59:16,713 --> 00:59:23,153
Nobody might know what it is…

675
00:59:23,433 --> 00:59:32,753
...that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you.

676
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:38,993
Nobody might agree with our love

677
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:47,993
But please be patient and always…

678
00:59:47,993 --> 00:59:55,433
...wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite…

679
00:59:55,433 --> 01:00:01,153
...as we have promised each other that we’d wait…

680
01:00:01,793 --> 01:00:08,793
Until that day

681
01:00:09,593 --> 01:00:20,953
Until that time I will hold you in my arms

682
01:00:20,953 --> 01:00:23,393
Kissing you through the night

683
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:33,633
Can you wait for me, my baby?

684
01:00:37,193 --> 01:00:40,673
The Loyal Pin
