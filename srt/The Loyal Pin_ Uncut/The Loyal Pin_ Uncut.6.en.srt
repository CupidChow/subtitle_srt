1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,133
Why did you not come to see me in the past few days?

2
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:05,960
You already have many people visiting you.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,813
They all love you and find you very endearing.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,186
Princess Anin has already left to Phrae since this afternoon, my lady.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,773
Being this inquisitive, do you perhaps start to feel possessive of me?

6
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,706
Yes, I do.

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,280
Princess Dararai gave me these golden and silver hairpins.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,053
I’d like us to have matching hairpins.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,600
Can you truly be mine tonight?

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,893
you may do anything as you wish to it, Your Highness.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,066
Please stop, Your Highness.

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
Why?

13
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,866
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,066
I just…

15
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,426
couldn’t catch my breath.

16
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,226
How adorable of you.

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,893
I promise I’ll be very gentle.

18
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,060
The Loyal Pin

19
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:46,786
Why are you up so early?

20
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:52,986
I’m afraid Princess Patt might be looking for me, Your Highness.

21
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:57,346
But I still want to hold you like this.

22
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:01,586
You have held me all night already.

23
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,853
Is it not enough?

24
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,786
I can hold you like this for the rest of my life.

25
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,413
You are such a sweet talker.

26
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:22,453
Sweet or not, you should know better than anyone else.

27
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:37,880
Stop it.

28
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,640
Can you not go back yet?

29
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,973
I’m afraid I must.

30
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:49,746
Please go back to sleep, Your Highness.

31
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,893
You travelled a long way yesterday.

32
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,053
And you hardly…

33
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,933
I hardly what?

34
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:10,200
You hardly slept last night.

35
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,786
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

36
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,493
I will come to see you later.

37
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,960
Yes.

38
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,520
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

39
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,520
I’m here to clean the glass door, my lady.

40
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,586
I couldn’t see it clearly, but the noise was quite loud and clear.

41
00:13:23,026 --> 00:13:26,386
(Squeaking sound)

42
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,186
(Squeaking sound)

43
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:29,906
Just like that, my lady.

44
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:36,960
Speaking of which…

45
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,133
may I ask what matter has brought you to see
the princess in her bedroom since dawn, my lady?

46
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,426
Umm

47
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,760
Well…

48
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:48,266
I…

49
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,346
Umm…I…

50
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:54,746
I’m afraid it does not concern you, Prik.

51
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,240
- Your shirt is misbuttoned, my lady.
- Where?!

52
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,120
There’s nothing wrong, Prik!

53
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,813
Ah, my eyes are probably failing, my lady.

54
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,760
I barely had any sleep last night because of the squeaking noise.

55
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,626
(Squeaking sound)

56
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,306
(Squeaking sound)

57
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
Lady Pin.

58
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:27,840
I’m planning to go for a honeymoon in England.

59
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:31,333
Does Anin have to return to England earlier than scheduled, Your Highness?

60
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,466
She might be sulking when she hears it.

61
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,133
I will tell her myself.

62
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,180
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

63
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:05,268
The Loyal Pin

64
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:15,981
Lady Pin.

65
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:24,514
Where have you been?

66
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:28,288
I slept at the Pine Palace last night, Your Highness.

67
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:38,741
I do not have any issues with you being close to Princess Anin.

68
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:43,914
But make sure to be very considerate of the princess and her family.

69
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:48,714
Do not forget that we are, nonetheless, living under their roof.

70
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:51,461
Yes, Your Highness.

71
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,768
Go and freshen up yourself first.

72
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,621
You also have to prepare breakfast for Princess Anin, don’t you?

73
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:02,048
Yes, Your Highness.

74
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,634
Your dimples are so adorable.

75
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:40,981
I have always dreamt…

76
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:47,181
that one day I would get to place my kiss on your dimples.

77
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:07,221
Unlike me, I wish I could devour you and keep all of you for myself.

78
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,754
I love you, Anin.

79
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:31,834
I love you too.

80
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:40,794
From now on, you are mine and I am yours.

81
00:19:26,368 --> 00:19:27,181
Prik.

82
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:30,021
When did you come in?

83
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:34,021
I came in…

84
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:44,034
since when you have started rolling over in bed…

85
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,408
like that, Your Highness.

86
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:52,168
Well, I’m happy.

87
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:57,354
How completely different from the day before, Your Highness.

88
00:19:58,234 --> 00:19:59,821
Congratulations, my princess.

89
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:05,901
Both of you now officially belong to each other.

90
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,288
I’m hungry now.

91
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,568
Then, I will find something for you to eat, Your Highness.

92
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:17,968
Would you like a honeymoon toast?

93
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:22,221
What a clever idea.

94
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:24,218
Thank you, Your Highness.

95
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,101
Thank you.

96
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:50,768
You’re welcome.

97
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,941
Good morning, Your Highness. Would you like coffee or tea?

98
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,274
Coffee as usual please.

99
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,901
Seeing her taking such good care of you…

100
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:08,594
has also made me want to get married too.

101
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,648
Just do it then. What are you waiting for?

102
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:13,074
For the bride to appear.

103
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:17,581
Thank you.

104
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,674
It has been a while since your wedding,

105
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,861
do you not have any plans for your honeymoon?

106
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,288
We plan to have our honeymoon in England,

107
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:32,808
since I must accompany Anin…

108
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:35,341
when she returns there anyway.

109
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:37,728
We are working on our plan.

110
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,541
When will you leave?

111
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,434
Soon.

112
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:49,821
Does that mean Anin have to return to England earlier than scheduled, Your Highness?

113
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:55,194
Yes. I’m afraid she might be sulking when she hears it.

114
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,314
I will tell her myself.

115
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:20,661
My princess, your breakfast is ready.

116
00:22:22,848 --> 00:22:26,434
But it’s not a honeymoon toast that you’d like to have, Your Highness.

117
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:30,568
Just soft-boiled eggs to boost up your energy.

118
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:40,594
Prik.

119
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:41,328
Yes, Your Highness?

120
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:44,968
Where is Lady Pin? I miss her so much.

121
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:49,154
Aww, you have only been parted for a few hours, Your Highness.

122
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:52,421
It felt like a year to me already.

123
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:58,128
Lady Pin is helping Princess Patt with the work, Your Highness.

124
00:22:58,941 --> 00:22:59,928
What work?

125
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,994
A lot of work.

126
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:04,888
Where is she now?

127
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:14,228
Washing clothes with fragrant ingredients.

128
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:18,034
Put water to boil then add roasted Fenugreek.

129
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:23,188
Roasted Fenugreek

130
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:34,714
Followed by Alyxia (reinwardtii Blume).

131
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:38,668
Alyxia (reinwardtii Blume)

132
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:47,508
And pandan leaves.

133
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:09,594
It smells wonderful, Your Highness.

134
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:15,234
Now, use a cheesecloth to strain the herbal water.

135
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,288
Then wash the clothes in it.

136
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:13,668
[Miss you so much]

137
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:26,834
Pin.

138
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,381
Pin.

139
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:36,061
Anin, what are you doing here?

140
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:40,514
Aren’t you finished yet?

141
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:42,261
I miss you so much already.

142
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,114
Not yet.

143
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,754
What else do you have to do?

144
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,808
A lot indeed, Your Highness.

145
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:58,088
Will you have time to miss me then?

146
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:16,421
I miss you all the time.

147
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:48,234
🎵A drop of diamond twinkling in the sky🎵

148
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:56,834
🎵Has it fallen down from heaven?🎵

149
00:26:57,154 --> 00:27:04,028
🎵Now that it has fallen🎵

150
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:10,948
🎵Please don’t leave the world in tears🎵

151
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:19,208
🎵A drop of diamond sparkling vividly in the sky🎵

152
00:27:19,408 --> 00:27:26,221
🎵Yet, it is far out of one’s reach🎵

153
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:34,794
🎵When a drop of diamond falling from above🎵

154
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:42,108
🎵The sky and earth are shaken🎵

155
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:50,288
🎵The stars are also in sorrow🎵

156
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:57,714
🎵And could not hold back their tears🎵

157
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:05,868
🎵I reach out for a drop of diamond🎵

158
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:13,141
🎵Carelessly loving and yearning for it🎵

159
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:21,341
🎵A drop of diamond always shining brightly🎵

160
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:29,028
🎵Even when amongst the darkness🎵

161
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:41,621
I wonder what has gotten into our princess and made her willing to help with the chores today.

162
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,594
Perhaps, the sky might be tumbling down today.

163
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:50,061
But I’m afraid she would be meddling with your work rather than helping.

164
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:55,608
Still, with an extra pair of hands, we can have our work done faster.

165
00:28:57,114 --> 00:28:59,674
Or slower than usual?

166
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:19,008
Anin, please drink some water first.

167
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:25,034
I’m hungry, Pin.

168
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:33,781
What would you like to eat?

169
00:29:35,448 --> 00:29:39,741
Anything that can give me much enough energy for tonight.

170
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:44,981
What are you saying? Someone might overhear it.

171
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:47,608
There is no one around here.

172
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,034
So, what would you like to eat?

173
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,968
Can I eat you?

174
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:16,274
🎵Nobody might know what it is…🎵

175
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:26,141
🎵…that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you🎵

176
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:32,248
🎵Nobody might agree with our love,🎵

177
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:38,781
🎵But please be patient and always…🎵

178
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,861
🎵wait for…🎵

179
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:46,514
Your kiss is so sweet.

180
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,154
Anin.

181
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,661
Not there.

182
00:31:18,154 --> 00:31:19,181
Why not?

183
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:06,528
Anin.

184
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:12,514
I’m bored of it.

185
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:09,208
There is someone to see Lady Pin, Your Highness.

186
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:11,354
Who?

187
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:12,888
Master Kuea, Your Highness.

188
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:38,308
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

189
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:45,399
The Loyal Pin

190
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:09,352
Thank you.

191
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,739
What did His Highness Prince would like to talk to you about, Your Highness?

192
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:32,885
It’s about Anin.

193
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:39,192
Father is worried about the potential suitor who would be courting Anin.

194
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,072
Why is His Highness worried?

195
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:46,032
He still cannot see anyone who is suitable for the princess.

196
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:50,325
Those with the same rank and nobility…

197
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:53,179
are already engaged or married.

198
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:59,925
Then, can Princess Anin follow in Princess Patt’s footsteps and stay unmarried?

199
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:04,992
That would be quite unlikely, Lady Pin.

200
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:08,925
As for my case, it is not unusual that I am still single.

201
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:12,192
For I had been taken into the palace since when I was young.

202
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:19,085
But Savettavarit is a very famous, wealthy, and well-respectable family.

203
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:21,712
Princess Anin will eventually have to get married.

204
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:30,019
You will also have to get married as well, Lady Pin.

205
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:32,339
I already have some prospects in mind.

206
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,952
There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere.

207
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:54,899
What do you have there?

208
00:36:55,485 --> 00:36:59,339
Prince Arnon bought me some cookies from the western shop. I’d like you to try them.

209
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:07,539
My princess would never try them until you feed it to her, my lady.

210
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:09,819
You talk too much, Prik.

211
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:11,752
My apology, Your Highness.

212
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:15,165
I’d leave both of you alone then.

213
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:20,659
Try it. They are really good.

214
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:37,592
What are you doing?

215
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:42,365
It’s your lips. They look so alluring.

216
00:37:46,672 --> 00:37:48,299
The crumbs are all over your mouth.

217
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:04,325
Anin, we are in the garden not your bedroom.

218
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,445
No one can see us.

219
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:12,165
Ahem, ahem!

220
00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:18,512
But I can see you, Your Highness.

221
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:21,859
What is blocking your throat, Prik?

222
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:23,659
Why did you return so quickly?

223
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:26,152
There is nothing in my throat, Your Highness.

224
00:38:26,149 --> 00:38:29,899
But there is someone to see Lady Pin.

225
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:31,979
Who?

226
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:37,565
Master Kuea, Your Highness. He is waiting in the parlour at the Lotus Palace.

227
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:49,405
Tell him to come and have tea with me at the front palace.

228
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:52,632
Why would you do that, Your Highness? Why don’t you…

229
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:53,859
Just do as I said.

230
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:57,085
Yes, Your Highness.

231
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:17,885
Have some tea with us, Master Kuea. Please sit down.

232
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:19,879
Thank you, Your Highness.

233
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:24,085
Let me pour the tea for you.

234
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:43,565
I believe this is still during working hours.

235
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:46,645
Why are you able to visit us at this time of the day?

236
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,045
Umm

237
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:59,125
I only wish to have a conversation
with Lady Pin for a short while, Your Highness.

238
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:03,445
Please say it then. Lady Pin is also here.

239
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:10,885
But…

240
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:12,019
But what?

241
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:15,419
Or is it something that you must tell her in private?

242
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,152
No, Your Highness.

243
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:21,432
Then please state your matter. What is it?

244
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:32,339
I’d like to invite Lady Pin to attend a gala dinner
which will be held at the Ministry next week, Your Highness.

245
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:36,672
A gala dinner? Is it one with a dancing section…

246
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:40,925
where most couples on the floor are either lovers or married couples?

247
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:49,885
What is your relationship with Lady Pin?
How dare you ask her to attend such an event?

248
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:54,619
That is not how I meant, Your Highness.

249
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:59,632
I only thought that perhaps she might want to attend the party with me.

250
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:07,459
Do you want to go to the party, Lady Pin?

251
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:14,685
No, Your Highness.

252
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,859
I never said I wanted to.

253
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:26,072
She just refused. Is that clear, Master Kuea?

254
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:30,339
Do you have anything else to talk to her?

255
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:33,872
No, Your Highness.

256
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,899
Then, please go back to work.

257
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:38,592
Are you not working at the same place as Prince Arnon?

258
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:40,219
Yes, Your Highness.

259
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:42,872
My brother has been summoned to the Ministry since early morning.

260
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:45,112
Probably because of a very urgent matter.

261
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:50,659
How come his close companion still has time to roam around like this?

262
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,365
My apology, Your Highness.

263
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,019
Please forgive me.

264
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,152
I will return to work at once, Your Highness.

265
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:35,672
Oh, hello.

266
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:45,459
Eat it, Prik.

267
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:47,765
Thank you, Your Highness.

268
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:53,005
There you are, Your Highness.

269
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,299
Pranot.

270
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:02,792
That one just left, and this one suddenly appears. What a day it is.

271
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,325
What brought you here today?

272
00:43:05,632 --> 00:43:08,512
I miss you, Your Highness. So, I came by for a visit.

273
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:19,845
Let’s have some snacks.

274
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:25,139
Thank you, Your Highness.

275
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:32,992
I met Master Kuea on my way in. He looked so grumpy.

276
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:36,392
He skipped work to ask Lady Pin out.

277
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:40,259
So, our princess decided to teach him a lesson.

278
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:42,992
I did not do anything.

279
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:46,365
I see. That’s why.

280
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:51,779
Actually, I came to see you because I’d like to know when you will return to England…

281
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,979
so that I can fix my return date to be on the same day, Your Highness.

282
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:58,005
It’s still a long way before our semester will begin. Why so hurry?

283
00:43:58,245 --> 00:44:00,139
Has Prince Anan not told you yet, Your Highness?

284
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:02,445
That you must return earlier than scheduled.

285
00:44:16,592 --> 00:44:20,365
Pranot told me that I must return to England earlier than scheduled. Is it true, Brother?

286
00:44:22,352 --> 00:44:23,432
So, he already told you.

287
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:24,512
Yes.

288
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:29,325
I will accompany you to England and take this opportunity to have my honeymoon with Lady Parawatee.

289
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:31,272
I was planning to tell you this evening.

290
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:36,445
I honestly wanted to adhere to your schedule at first.

291
00:44:37,312 --> 00:44:40,432
But I have some matters to attend to over there, so I decided to move up the schedule.

292
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:44,312
When do I have to leave?

293
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:46,405
Next week.

294
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:07,379
Has Prince Anan not told you yet, Your Highness? That you must return earlier than scheduled.

295
00:46:08,845 --> 00:46:11,059
I don’t want you to go.

296
00:46:27,419 --> 00:46:32,645
I thought you said you would teach me to play tennis during your university holidays,

297
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:35,792
so that I can finally wear a proper outfit like the others.

298
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,379
Why must you suddenly return to England, Your Highness?

299
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:42,445
I did not choose to do this, Prik.

300
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:50,592
At least, please postpone it a little later until it is past Lady Pin’s birthday, Your Highness.

301
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:56,659
She must be heartbroken.

302
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:06,405
I must start buying all the mangoes and other fruits in the market for her to carve to relieve her sadness.

303
00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:02,259
Unlike last time, the princess will only be gone for just a while, and she will return soon.

304
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:04,899
Please don’t look so sad, Lady Pin.

305
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:10,299
Yes, Your Highness.

306
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:16,459
I have something to talk to you.

307
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:18,539
Please follow me to my room.

308
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,512
Yes, Your Highness.

309
00:48:34,565 --> 00:48:35,592
Come and sit here.

310
00:48:46,419 --> 00:48:48,165
What would you like to talk to me about, Your Highness?

311
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:15,085
Princess Alisa said that this is her favourite set of ruby accessories.

312
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:17,619
She would like to give it to you, Lady Pin.

313
00:49:18,272 --> 00:49:21,432
They are too precious. I cannot accept it.

314
00:49:22,552 --> 00:49:26,325
Just take it. The princess would like to give it to you.

315
00:49:58,112 --> 00:49:59,165
How very lovely.

316
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:06,419
Why did Princess Alisa give me this gift, Your Highness?

317
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:10,779
It is for your birthday, Lady Pin.

318
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:21,392
I still do not understand. Why must Her Highness give me such a precious gift?

319
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:25,552
Regrading that, I’m afraid you must go and ask Princess Anin.

320
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:28,525
One more thing,

321
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:31,792
you do not have to help with the chores during these days.

322
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:35,725
Let Koi handle them. Meanwhile, you can stay at the Pine Palace.

323
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:36,752
Yes?

324
00:50:38,152 --> 00:50:43,885
It would be very kind of you to please allow Lady Pin to come and stay with me…

325
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:47,992
at the Pine Palace during these days before I must return to England.

326
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:53,072
If that will not be an imposition to you, then I would happily agree with it.

327
00:50:54,045 --> 00:50:55,272
Thank you, Your Highness.

328
00:50:57,459 --> 00:50:59,752
You should go and stay with Princess Anin while you still can.

329
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:03,552
She will return to England soon.

330
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:08,272
Yes, Your Highness.

331
00:51:31,765 --> 00:51:32,765
Pin!

332
00:51:32,792 --> 00:51:34,232
- Lady Pin!    /    - Pin!

333
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:34,979
My lady!

334
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:36,005
Go and get help.

335
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:36,579
Yes, Your Highness.

336
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:37,459
Pin!

337
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,565
Anybody, please help!

338
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:40,485
Pin!

339
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,559
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

340
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:10,669
The Loyal Pin

341
00:52:35,262 --> 00:52:36,302
Anin?

342
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:47,529
Anin?

343
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:49,729
Happy Birthday in advance, Pin.

344
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:08,222
You’re acting like the westerners again.

345
00:53:09,475 --> 00:53:12,849
You must make a wish, then blow out the candles too.

346
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,289
I wish you a lot of joy and happiness.

347
00:53:33,822 --> 00:53:36,142
It’s still many days until my birthday though.

348
00:53:36,929 --> 00:53:38,595
But I want to celebrate it today.

349
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:44,475
Where did you buy this cake? It looks quite crumpled.

350
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,489
From Anin’s shop.

351
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:56,622
Her Highness made this cake herself.
She also cooked dinner for you, my lady.

352
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:02,155
Her culinary skills had left the kitchen in a complete disaster, my lady.

353
00:54:35,009 --> 00:54:36,702
Should I add more flour, Your Highness?

354
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:38,395
Here you go.

355
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:44,849
Oh!

356
00:54:47,915 --> 00:54:48,782
Anin.

357
00:54:50,395 --> 00:54:51,382
What are you doing?

358
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:53,369
Why is it such a mess in here?

359
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:57,782
- Prik.    /    - Yes, Your Highness?

360
00:54:57,779 --> 00:54:58,675
Let’s continue.

361
00:54:58,702 --> 00:54:59,635
- More.    /    - Yes, Your Highness.

362
00:54:59,902 --> 00:55:01,475
I’ll pour it from the top.

363
00:55:08,502 --> 00:55:14,129
Prince Anan offered to order a fancy cake from the western shop but the princess just refused.

364
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:16,929
She wanted to bake it for you by herself, my lady.

365
00:55:18,302 --> 00:55:18,995
Prik.

366
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:20,622
Yes, Your Highness?

367
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:21,755
Get out.

368
00:55:22,715 --> 00:55:23,749
To where, Your Highness?

369
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:25,329
Anywhere.

370
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,822
Aren’t you going to let me celebrate it with you too, Your Highness?

371
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:31,129
I also helped you make the cake.

372
00:55:35,155 --> 00:55:37,102
I want to be alone with Lady Pin.

373
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:40,769
Yes, Your Highness.

374
00:56:21,675 --> 00:56:24,835
Although the cake might look quite ugly because I made it for the first time,

375
00:56:25,155 --> 00:56:26,822
but other things still taste delicious, are they not?

376
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:31,755
Thank you, Your Highness.

377
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:45,049
Why did Princess Alisa give me such a precious gift, Your Highness?

378
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:49,102
Because you are her daughter-in-law.

379
00:56:50,462 --> 00:56:52,995
Anin, stop teasing me.

380
00:56:55,102 --> 00:56:56,982
Because Mother finds you very endearing.

381
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,169
Did you tell her about my birthday?

382
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:10,982
Yes.

383
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:16,795
What about you? What gift do you want from me for your birthday?

384
00:57:26,942 --> 00:57:32,809
Just wake up early to make merits and give alms to the monks with me, Your Highness.

385
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:44,142
Is that a bother to you?

386
00:57:44,675 --> 00:57:45,555
Umm

387
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:52,129
Can it be another day?

388
00:57:54,089 --> 00:57:57,609
I’m afraid I won’t be able to stay until your birthday.

389
00:57:59,782 --> 00:58:02,969
I must return to England by the end of this week.

390
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:09,075
Try this, Lady pin.

391
01:00:17,942 --> 01:00:19,422
I’m full, Your Highness.

392
01:00:22,729 --> 01:00:25,422
You barely ate a spoonful. Are you full already?

393
01:00:26,902 --> 01:00:28,369
Do you have no appetite?

394
01:00:30,102 --> 01:00:30,942
Yes, Your Highness.

395
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,289
I’m not hungry at all.

396
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:40,262
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

397
01:01:24,635 --> 01:01:26,795
She has been picking on her food for many days now.

398
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:30,115
If this still continues, she would surely faint and fall sick soon.

399
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:32,595
Really?

400
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:35,795
Your Highness.

401
01:01:39,622 --> 01:01:43,809
Since Lady Pin knew that you must return to England soon, she has been in great dismay.

402
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:45,862
She hardly ate anything, Your Highness.

403
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,489
I’ll go talk to her.

404
01:01:50,195 --> 01:01:51,049
Yes, Your Highness.

405
01:01:55,635 --> 01:01:56,249
Oh!

406
01:01:56,995 --> 01:01:57,822
Pin.

407
01:02:00,169 --> 01:02:01,049
Anin.

408
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:04,782
I heard you hardly eat anything these days.

409
01:02:05,982 --> 01:02:07,542
You’re looking so pale.

410
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:11,662
If anything happens to you, how would I live?

411
01:02:16,142 --> 01:02:17,702
I’m fine, Your Highness.

412
01:02:24,689 --> 01:02:25,555
Pin!

413
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:27,155
- My lady!    /    - Pin!

414
01:02:27,149 --> 01:02:28,035
Lady Pin!

415
01:02:28,169 --> 01:02:29,582
- Pin.    /    - Lady Pin.

416
01:02:29,782 --> 01:02:31,395
Prik, go and get help.

417
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:32,022
Yes, Your Highness.

418
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:32,849
Pin.

419
01:02:33,062 --> 01:02:34,955
Anybody, please help!

420
01:02:34,949 --> 01:02:35,889
Pin.

421
01:02:40,982 --> 01:02:41,729
Pin.

422
01:02:42,742 --> 01:02:44,969
What did you say? What happened to Lady Pin?

423
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:47,169
Lady Pin fainted and passed out, Your Highness.

424
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:48,515
Where is she now?

425
01:02:48,509 --> 01:02:51,262
At the Pine Palace, Your Highness. Princess Anin is taking care of her.

426
01:03:16,995 --> 01:03:17,942
Your Highness.

427
01:03:21,782 --> 01:03:23,049
How are you feeling?

428
01:03:24,102 --> 01:03:26,222
Why did you faint?

429
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:34,902
I was dreadfully in shock when I heard that you collapsed.

430
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:37,435
I was worried you might be injured.

431
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:48,195
My deepest apology for causing you to worry about me, Your Highness.

432
01:04:20,782 --> 01:04:24,182
Lady Pin kept insisting that she would stay here at the Pine Palace.

433
01:04:25,089 --> 01:04:28,582
I’m afraid I must leave her in your care this time, Princess.

434
01:04:29,275 --> 01:04:31,475
Please do not worry, Your Highness.

435
01:04:32,182 --> 01:04:36,155
She already took her pills. I believe she will get better soon.

436
01:04:36,889 --> 01:04:38,622
Please rest assured that I will take good care of her.

437
01:04:40,195 --> 01:04:43,475
Thank you, Princess. Please look after her for me.

438
01:04:44,169 --> 01:04:45,009
Yes, Your Highness.

439
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:37,889
I’m sorry.

440
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:41,422
You have fallen sick because of me.

441
01:07:09,435 --> 01:07:11,089
It was all my fault.

442
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:15,529
I kept avoiding to tell her the return date.

443
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,902
It must be very hard for her, Your Highness.

444
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:25,515
Lady Pin had been waiting for 5 years to see you again.

445
01:07:26,129 --> 01:07:31,302
You both have just started to spend time together, but suddenly you must return to England.

446
01:07:35,315 --> 01:07:37,075
But it won’t be long this time, Prik.

447
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:40,635
Just almost 2 years.

448
01:07:46,102 --> 01:07:51,489
Two years are long enough for someone who is waiting in agony.

449
01:07:52,182 --> 01:07:56,075
Now that your relationship has developed,

450
01:07:56,502 --> 01:08:01,902
her awaiting for your return will surely be much more suffering, Your Highness.

451
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:13,129
If I were able to write my own destiny,

452
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:17,155
I would have never chosen to leave, Prik.

453
01:08:54,022 --> 01:08:55,089
Anin?

454
01:09:17,142 --> 01:09:18,062
My lady.

455
01:09:19,049 --> 01:09:20,142
You are awake.

456
01:09:21,595 --> 01:09:22,835
Where is Princess Anin?

457
01:09:24,782 --> 01:09:25,409
Um

458
01:09:28,022 --> 01:09:28,662
Hm

459
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:32,195
What is it, Prik?

460
01:09:33,142 --> 01:09:33,862
Oh

461
01:09:35,902 --> 01:09:37,182
Nothing, my lady.

462
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:40,022
It’s just…

463
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:44,795
Princess Anin…

464
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,889
has already left for England this morning, my lady.

465
01:09:53,115 --> 01:09:55,369
You had stayed in bed for many days…

466
01:09:56,702 --> 01:09:59,795
that it is finally her return date, my lady.

467
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:38,669
The Loyal Pin

468
01:10:39,262 --> 01:10:40,542
Your letter has arrived, my lady!

469
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:43,875
(Dear Pin, my everything)

470
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:49,755
(This kiss might be as faint as the breeze…)

471
01:10:49,969 --> 01:10:52,329
(for it has travelled a long way across the sea.)

472
01:10:54,715 --> 01:10:58,529
Do you know what the name ‘Anilaphat’ means, Lady Pin?

473
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:03,955
It means a beautiful wind, Your Highness.

474
01:11:08,982 --> 01:11:11,729
Please endure it for a little longer, my lady.

475
01:11:12,755 --> 01:11:15,329
I will be waiting for the wind to return.

476
01:11:21,889 --> 01:11:28,022
🎵Nobody might know what it is…🎵

477
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:37,889
🎵…that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you.🎵

478
01:11:37,889 --> 01:11:44,069
🎵Nobody might agree with our love,🎵

479
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:50,502
🎵But please be patient and always…🎵

480
01:11:50,899 --> 01:12:00,529
🎵…wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite…🎵

481
01:12:00,559 --> 01:12:06,309
🎵…as we have promised each other that we’d wait…🎵

482
01:12:06,829 --> 01:12:13,662
🎵…until that day🎵

483
01:12:14,809 --> 01:12:26,155
🎵Until that day I will hold you in my arms,🎵

484
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:38,429
🎵Kissing you through the night. Can you wait for me, my baby?🎵

485
