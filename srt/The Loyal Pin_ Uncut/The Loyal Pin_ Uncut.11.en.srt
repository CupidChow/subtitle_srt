1
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:35,001
The Loyal Pin

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,584
Why are you wearing it on your ring finger?

3
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:46,215
Please don’t worry. I’ll find a way to fix this problem for you.

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,548
You’re not giving me this ring for free, are you, Your Highness?

5
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,743
This is odd.

6
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,266
The princess even gave you such a valuable gift.

7
00:01:57,266 --> 00:02:01,185
It is not unusual at all. Anin has always been quite peculiar since young.

8
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:05,028
You already know about Lady Pin and I, don’t you, Brother?

9
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:08,838
Miss Aon would like to see you, Your Highness.

10
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,788
What is it?

11
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:15,259
If you do not break up with Lady Pin, I will tell everyone about you and her.

12
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:28,408
Your father would never agree with this.

13
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,727
Then, please do as you like.

14
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:46,699
I’m afraid I won’t be able to stop you.

15
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:51,178
But please know that no matter what you do,

16
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:56,627
even if you tell the world about us and tear us apart…

17
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,736
I will never love you.

18
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:16,572
Why can’t it be me?

19
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,746
After all this time, don’t you ever love me at all?

20
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,211
Please don’t do this, Miss Aon.

21
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,596
Please.

22
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,315
I’m sorry.

23
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:18,574
I do love and care for you, but only as a friend.

24
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,844
But the love I have for Lady Pin…

25
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,535
is much deeper and longer than you can imagine.

26
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:47,302
Even the end of the world can never destroy this love I have for her.

27
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,541
Do you love her that much, Your Highness?

28
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,655
I know I cannot stop you from telling anyone.

29
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:17,150
But can you please not destroy the love between me and Lady Pin?

30
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:20,080
I’m begging you.

31
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,256
Are we going to the Chao Fah Palace?

32
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:57,297
Yes, we must attend Lord Muang-Rahm’s welcome ceremony on behalf of our father.

33
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:04,840
Lord Muang-Rahm has just returned from the United States after his master graduation.

34
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,165
Who is this Lord Muang-Rahm?

35
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:18,170
M.R. Muang-Rahm Sirirumpar, the son of His Serene Highness Prince Manfah.

36
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,559
He is the nephew of His Highness Prince and the daughter of Prince Rangsri, the prince from Lanna.

37
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,360
I have only heard of Prince Manfah. I have never heard of Lord Muang-Rahm, Your Highness.

38
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,600
Perhaps, because he had always been studying abroad.

39
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:35,809
That’s why.

40
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:43,023
After the graduation, Prince Manfah immediately prepares an engagement
for Lord Muang-Rahm and Lady Uang Fah.

41
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,829
There must surely be a wedding anytime soon.

42
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:51,076
Will Lady Uang agree with this sudden marriage, Your Highness?

43
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:56,884
I do not like Lord Muang-Rahm in a romantic way. Why must I marry him?

44
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:01,150
[Her Serene Highness Princess Dararai]
He is a perfect match for you, dear.

45
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:08,112
If you are to marry a royal heir from Siam, you must leave this palace and be away from me.

46
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:15,230
Even though Lord Muang-Rahm is partially descended from Siam’s royal family, his homeland is still in Lanna.

47
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:19,915
I have no interest in wherever his homeland is.

48
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:22,360
Never mind.

49
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,085
But you must perform a welcome dance for the Duke of Rham at the banquet.

50
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,016
Go prepare yourself.

51
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:36,031
The Savettawarit family will also attend the ceremony.

52
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:40,272
Is Princess Anin also coming?

53
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,597
I want you to accompany me to attend Lord Muang-Rahm’s banquet at the Chao Fah Palace.

54
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,520
Once you are done, go prepare yourself.

55
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,000
Must I go too, Your Highness?

56
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:02,751
Of course.

57
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,511
The princes and princess are also going.

58
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,846
Can I not go, Your Highness?

59
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,925
Why not?

60
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,369
Go see the world outside and meet new people.

61
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,478
Many princes will also attend this event.

62
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,488
Perhaps, you might be able to find anyone you are interested in…

63
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:26,352
and would like to marry him.

64
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,126
Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:38,456
You want me to go to Prae with you?

66
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,883
Yes.

67
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:43,044
Prince Arnon has asked me to attend Lord Muang-Rahm’s welcome ceremony with him.

68
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:48,251
But I’m afraid it might look inappropriate if I go alone with him. So, I also want you to come along.

69
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,392
Who else is going?

70
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,000
Everyone, from what I have heard.

71
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,143
They must attend the ceremony on behalf of His Highness Prince and Princess Alisa.

72
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,715
Please come with me. It would be fun.

73
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,134
If you refuse, our mother surely will never allow me to go.

74
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,369
Please, Aon.

75
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:18,762
Please come with me.

76
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,136
Please…

77
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,027
Come with me, please.

78
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:26,480
Fine, I’ll go with you.

79
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:28,656
Thank you.

80
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:31,491
Do you want more ice cream? It’s my treat.

81
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:33,609
No, thank you.

82
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:44,966
What? Is Miss Aon also going, Your Highness?

83
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:46,702
Yes.

84
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:49,049
And Lady Uang will also be there.

85
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:52,519
Wouldn’t it be such a chaos, Your Highness?

86
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:58,048
Lady Pin will surely be displeased, Your Highness.

87
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:01,252
I heard she will also attend.

88
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:06,315
Then, should I give you some medicine for a headache beforehand?

89
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,250
I’ll go prepare it for you, Your Highness.

90
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,028
You’re only making me feel more stressful.

91
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:15,328
I was just being honest, Your Highness.

92
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:20,038
I only wish that you would be fully prepared.

93
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:27,805
Please do not forget, Your Highness, that Miss Aon has already found out about you and Lady Pin.

94
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:32,740
That’s why you must help keep Miss Aon and Lady Uang away from me.

95
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,675
So that Lady Pin won’t be jealous.

96
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,271
Wouldn’t it be easier to keep Lady Pin away instead, Your Highness?

97
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,878
No. Lady Pin must stay with me.

98
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:46,988
ไม่รู้หล่ะ อย่างไรเสียเราก็ฝากเปียดู
- No matter what, you must help me.

99
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:49,838
Yes, Your Highness.

100
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,675
I will do my best to keep them away from you.

101
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:57,961
But I cannot promise you whether I will succeed or not, Your Highness.

102
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:13,110
Please take the medicine, Your Highness.

103
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:19,642
Are you here to see Uangfah?

104
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,792
Is she home, Your Highness?

105
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:25,837
Who is that girl, Nanmuang? She looks so sweet and lovely.

106
00:11:25,837 --> 00:11:27,577
Quite different from other dancers.

107
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:54,360
The Loyal Pin

108
00:11:54,409 --> 00:12:01,214
The Loyal Pin

109
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,053
Thank you very much indeed…

110
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:08,931
for agreeing to stay at my palace.

111
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:11,801
It is us who came to trouble you.

112
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:17,228
Please have some refreshment first.

113
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:21,148
I already have my servants to prepare the guest rooms for you.

114
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:23,836
They will lead you the way.

115
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:27,948
I have only prepared 5 guest rooms, Your Highness.

116
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:33,068
Have I not told you that Miss Aon and Miss On are also coming?

117
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,647
Go arrange it quickly.

118
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,163
Yes, Your Highness.

119
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:40,585
Well, I can stay in the same room with Lady Pin.

120
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:53,319
She can stay with me, Princess. Please don’t let it bother you.

121
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:59,007
Not a bother at all. I am not quite familiar with this place, so I do not want to sleep alone.

122
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:01,919
This way, you can have the entire bed for yourself too.

123
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,878
You’re probably scared of ghosts.

124
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,557
She is often like this when she must sleep somewhere unfamiliar.

125
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:13,272
Oh, there are no ghosts here.

126
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:18,967
But if you are afraid, then let Lady Pin stay with you.

127
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:23,989
I’m suddenly scared of ghosts too.

128
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:28,666
Can you let Miss On stay with me tonight?

129
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,359
Absolutely not, Prince Arnon.

130
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,770
How could you say something inappropriate like that?

131
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,303
You are so unfair.

132
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:39,649
Let’s have some refreshment first.

133
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,513
Come.

134
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,667
Princess.

135
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,356
Here, my dear.

136
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:21,721
Should you need anything, please let me know, Your Highness.

137
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,109
Thank you.

138
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:48,414
What are you doing? Don’t forget that it is still daytime.

139
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,988
What are you thinking? Why must it always be about that?

140
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:57,414
I’m only feeling a little cold.

141
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:03,412
So be it then. But don’t let me see you hug me or kiss me.

142
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,591
I was just teasing you.

143
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,544
Don’t try to act innocent.

144
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:19,392
I couldn’t believe myself when I heard you asked your aunt if I could stay with you tonight.

145
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:25,742
If you ever wish for something, what you must do is act upon it…

146
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:28,307
so that you’d have what you wish for. Am I right?

147
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:38,625
I truly respect you for never hesitate to act upon your own feelings.

148
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:41,147
Unlike me.

149
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:55,970
All I have been doing is just being honest with my own feelings.

150
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,401
Please remember…

151
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:05,089
if there is anything that I can do for both of us…

152
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,095
I will always do it.

153
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:32,962
Please have some Roselle juice.

154
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,039
Everyone.

155
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:42,304
Princess Dararai has arranged the cars to take us around the town.

156
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:44,367
Does anyone want to join us?

157
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,698
Yes, Your Highness.

158
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,357
You also want to go, don’t you?

159
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,172
Yes.

160
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:55,377
Aon and I will go with you then.

161
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:59,530
What about Anin and Lady Pin? Would you like to come too?

162
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:04,606
I’d rather not, Brother.

163
00:18:04,606 --> 00:18:09,099
I’m not feeling quite well. I might just be taking a walk with Lady Pin around the palace.

164
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,290
Then, may I volunteer to give you a tour around our palace, Your Highness?

165
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,881
Thank you for the offer, Lady Uang. But I’d rather not bother you.

166
00:18:21,306 --> 00:18:23,725
It’s not a bother at all.

167
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:34,227
Then, please kindly give us a tour around your palace, Lady Uang.

168
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,692
Can I go too, my lady?

169
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:43,212
Yes.

170
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:45,491
Very well then.

171
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,664
Prince Anan, Miss On, Miss Aon, Lady Watee, and I will go look around the city.

172
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:53,517
As for you, please behave yourself while you are here.

173
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:54,722
Yes.

174
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:20,013
Tin Jok Sarong

175
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,920
This is the famous ‘Tin Jok’ Sarong of Lanna’s Royal Court.

176
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,667
It is specially threaded with gold silk…

177
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,730
and is considered as one of the finest Sarong.

178
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:04,698
So beautiful.

179
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:09,922
This Sarong is weaved entirely with silk.

180
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:13,850
Both the fabric and the pattern on the Sarong…

181
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,807
are laced with expensive gold and silver purl…

182
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:23,149
which can only be acquired by Lanna ladies of high rank.

183
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:28,302
Can I try weaving it?

184
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:31,003
Are you sure, Your Highness?

185
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,759
What if you break their machine?

186
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:43,341
Can I try it, Lady Uang?

187
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:49,736
Yes, Your Highness.

188
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:14,327
🎵 Nobody has ever made my heart… 🎵

189
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:24,398
🎵 …so fluttering like this. I never know why, every time that you are near 🎵

190
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:29,355
🎵 My day and night seem to last forever 🎵

191
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:32,327
🎵 I just want to know what you’d say 🎵

192
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:36,103
🎵 If I want you to be that someone. What would you say? 🎵

193
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:44,744
🎵  You might doubt it but I want you to trust this person who is very honest and never waiver 🎵

194
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:48,081
🎵 Please listen to these words just for a little while 🎵

195
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:53,517
🎵 I’d like to give this love to you and only you 🎵

196
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:58,914
🎵 No matter how long it’d be, my heart will never change🎵

197
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:02,389
🎵 Although many people might be passing by… 🎵

198
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:08,216
🎵 …but my heart will always stay true to our promise 🎵

199
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:13,629
🎵 Even though we must be far apart, no matter for how long 🎵

200
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:19,015
🎵 The only thing that will never change is our heart 🎵

201
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:25,093
🎵 Please trust in me. Look at me and listen to my words 🎵

202
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:29,231
🎵 From now on… 🎵

203
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,981
🎵 my life has only you / You make my whole world stop! 🎵

204
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:35,230
🎵 Again and again. Oh my heart, every time when I see you 🎵

205
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,138
🎵 I can never control it. Because it’s shouting ‘Only you, My Honey’ inside 🎵

206
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,605
🎵 Whispering into your ears that ‘I Love You’ 🎵

207
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:50,172
🎵 One more time so that you’d know how sincere I am 🎵

208
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:53,175
🎵 I just want to know what you’d say 🎵

209
00:22:53,175 --> 00:22:56,639
🎵 If I want you to be that someone. What would you say? 🎵

210
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:05,520
🎵 You might doubt it but I want you to trust this person who is very honest and never waiver 🎵

211
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,071
🎵 Please listen to these words just for a little while 🎵

212
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:14,425
🎵 I’d like to give this love to you and only you 🎵

213
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:19,739
🎵 No matter how long it’d be, my heart will never change 🎵

214
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:23,133
🎵 Although many people might be passing by… 🎵

215
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:29,172
🎵 …but my heart will always stay true to our promise 🎵

216
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:34,577
🎵 Even though we must be far apart, no matter for how long 🎵

217
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:40,037
🎵 The only thing that will never change is our heart 🎵

218
00:23:40,037 --> 00:23:45,862
🎵 Please trust in me. Look at me and listen to my words 🎵

219
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:52,670
🎵 From now on, my life has only you 🎵

220
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:14,865
🎵 I’d like to give this love to you and only you 🎵

221
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:20,416
🎵 No matter how long it’d be, my heart will never change 🎵

222
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,687
🎵 Although many people might be passing by… 🎵

223
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:29,979
🎵 …but my heart will always stay true to our promise 🎵

224
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:35,151
🎵 Even though we must be far apart, no matter for how long 🎵

225
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:40,622
🎵 The only thing that will never change is our heart 🎵

226
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:46,614
🎵 Please trust in me. Look at me and listen to my words 🎵

227
00:24:46,614 --> 00:24:53,321
🎵 From now on, my life has only you 🎵

228
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:08,872
The weather is so nice, my lady.

229
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,316
Please have some snacks first.

230
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,371
Thank you, Lady Uang.

231
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:23,321
I will be practising the traditional Peacock Dance…

232
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,578
to perform at the ceremony tomorrow.

233
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:28,186
If Your Highness and Lady Pin would like to stay for the rehearsal,

234
00:25:28,186 --> 00:25:30,318
you are very welcome.

235
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:33,804
Would you like to see it?

236
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,449
Yes.

237
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,982
Then, let’s go after we finish eating this.

238
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,626
Let’s take a break.

239
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:09,202
It’s so beautiful, Lady Uang.

240
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:11,209
Thank you, Your Highness.

241
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:16,650
You used to do this dance when you were in school, didn’t you?

242
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,098
I remember it.

243
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:20,199
Is that true?

244
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,369
Yes.

245
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:25,983
Would you like to join us then?

246
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:29,387
Please say yes, my lady. I want to see it.

247
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:34,573
Very well.

248
00:27:35,198 --> 00:27:38,961
But I have not done it for quite some time. I barely remember the dance.

249
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:41,766
Don’t worry, I’ll teach you.

250
00:27:42,817 --> 00:27:44,129
Yes.

251
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,238
I can do it too, my lady.

252
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:59,764
[ M.R. Muang-Rahm ]

253
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:16,284
Are you here to see Uangfah?

254
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:18,164
Is she home, Your Highness?

255
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,525
Yes.

256
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:23,400
She is probably giving the princess from Bangkok a tour around the palace.

257
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,060
I’ll ask the servant to get her.

258
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,638
Please don’t bother, Your Highness.

259
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:29,953
I should better go see her myself.

260
00:28:29,953 --> 00:28:32,812
Please go on then.

261
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,357
Who is that girl, Nanmuang? Do you know her?

262
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:08,195
She is Princess Anilaphat, the youngest daughter of Princess Alisa.

263
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:11,677
I met her once at Prince Jakkham’s funeral, my lord.

264
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:15,947
She is such a beauty.

265
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,129
So elegant as if she came out from a fairy tale.

266
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,316
I heard that she is His Highness Prince and Princess Alisa’s favourite child.

267
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,593
She went to study abroad since young.

268
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:29,688
She only returned home not long ago.

269
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,126
And who is that lovely lady over there?

270
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:48,232
Well…I am not sure, my lord.

271
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:51,284
Probably one of the dancers who will perform with Lady Uang.

272
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:57,073
She looks so sweet. Quite different from other dancers.

273
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:01,393
Please be careful, my lord.

274
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:04,923
Your father has already arranged your engagement with Lady Uangfah.

275
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:09,603
I know, Nanmuang. My heart belongs to no one else but Lady Uang.

276
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:15,348
I only appreciate the beauty of lovely ladies at times, like what most gentlemen do.

277
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:38,195
Good afternoon.

278
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:44,478
Are you new here? I have never seen you before.

279
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,173
So lovely. What is your name?

280
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,149
Wait.

281
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:07,215
Thank you.

282
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:08,966
Pin.

283
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:50,209
The Loyal Pin

284
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:57,105
The Loyal Pin

285
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,370
Good afternoon.

286
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:21,495
Are you new here? I have never seen you before.

287
00:32:26,284 --> 00:32:29,502
So lovely. What is your name?

288
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:33,770
Wait.

289
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:39,237
Where are you from?

290
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,616
Would you like to perform at my palace tonight? You can name the amount.

291
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:46,206
No.

292
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:54,654
Why not? I said I can pay as much as you want.

293
00:32:55,783 --> 00:32:57,759
Please let me go.

294
00:32:58,197 --> 00:32:59,620
Let me go.

295
00:33:01,072 --> 00:33:02,284
Please let go.

296
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,357
Is there something wrong?

297
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,984
What is it, Lady Pin?

298
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,284
Lady Pin?

299
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:20,559
This is Lady Pin, Princess Pattamika’s niece.

300
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,767
And this is Princess Anilaphat.

301
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:29,481
It was nothing.

302
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:33,535
This gentleman mistook me for a dancer…

303
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:36,103
And was trying to court me.

304
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:42,028
That is not true. It was just a misunderstanding.

305
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:43,333
Was it?

306
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:52,716
I must leave for home now. Please excuse me.

307
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:06,913
I think we should tell our family about this. We should not ignore it.

308
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,254
I agree, my lady. Don’t let him get away with it.

309
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:14,284
Please don’t. I do not want to make it a big concern.

310
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:19,407
It would only create a misunderstanding between Lady Uang’s family and his family.

311
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:24,111
Are you sure?

312
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,029
Yes.

313
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:33,305
I’m more worried about Lady Uang. She must be engaged to a man like him.

314
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:55,564
There you are, Lady Pin.

315
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,275
I have been waiting for you.

316
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:01,175
Why would you like to see me, Your Highness?

317
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:04,620
I will spend a night at my friend’s palace.

318
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,095
I’d like you to come with me.

319
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:12,643
You’d like me to go with you?

320
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:17,310
Are you busy with anything?

321
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:20,543
No, Your Highness.

322
00:35:40,684 --> 00:35:43,203
Are you still awake, Your Highness?

323
00:35:49,195 --> 00:35:51,164
What is it, Lady Uang?

324
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:55,816
You said this morning that you did not want to sleep alone.

325
00:35:55,816 --> 00:36:01,023
Since Lady Pin is away, I’m afraid you might not be able to sleep.

326
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:03,615
Yes.

327
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:07,613
Would you like me to stay with you?

328
00:36:10,263 --> 00:36:11,692
Please don’t worry.

329
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:16,707
Pia will stay with me tonight. Thank you for your concern though.

330
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:21,661
Have I done anything to upset you lately?

331
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:32,148
Why did you say that?

332
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:37,403
I couldn’t help thinking that…

333
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:44,045
you seem to have been avoiding me since Hua Hin trip.

334
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:45,957
Am I right?

335
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,342
I wasn’t trying to avoid you, Lady Uang.

336
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:57,267
There were so many activities for me to enjoy there.

337
00:36:58,304 --> 00:37:03,406
Nonetheless, I’d say you were avoiding me.

338
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:11,236
Or was I being too obvious?

339
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:16,058
Too obvious about what?

340
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,015
That I am deeply enamoured with you.

341
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,884
I know…

342
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:35,713
that it was very obvious.

343
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:43,552
But I couldn’t restrain myself as much,

344
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:50,727
for the feeling I have for you is so overwhelming…

345
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:55,059
that it is impossible to have it kept inside.

346
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,618
I am truly sorry.

347
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:32,856
Lady Uang, Lord Muang-Rahm would like to see you, my lady.

348
00:38:34,677 --> 00:38:37,100
Why is it you who come to inform me?

349
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:39,900
Where are all the servants in my palace?

350
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,095
Why must they ask you to come and inform me?

351
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:45,492
Please don’t say that, my lady.

352
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:50,909
I just happened to be near the front gate when Lor Muang-Rahm came.

353
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:52,681
Is that so?

354
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:54,363
Yes, my lady.

355
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:04,636
Tongnuan, go and invite him in. I will be there shortly.

356
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,664
Yes, Lady Uang.

357
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:10,664
Pia.

358
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:11,954
Yes, my lady?

359
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:15,942
Are you free? Would you like to accompany me?

360
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:25,950
Are you sure, my lady? Wouldn’t Lord Muang-Rahm wish to talk to you in private?

361
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:30,354
Please come with me. I do not want to go alone.

362
00:39:30,354 --> 00:39:34,503
Yesterday, you already witnessed what kind of person he is.

363
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:38,518
Yes, my lady.

364
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:42,472
He probably has a guilty conscience about what he did yesterday.

365
00:39:42,472 --> 00:39:45,909
That’s why he came to test the water today, my lady.

366
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:53,646
Please have some jasmine tea.

367
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:08,259
This jasmine tea has such a pleasant taste and smell.

368
00:40:09,388 --> 00:40:14,804
Princess Alisa had asked Prince Anantawut to give it to my mother.

369
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:19,420
Oh, that’s right. I never knew before…

370
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,827
that Princess Dararai is closely related to a well-known family like Savettawarit.

371
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:29,337
From our short encounter yesterday, the princess’s beauty is truly mesmerizing.

372
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:34,766
Yes, indeed.

373
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:37,741
Yet, her beauty can never be compared to yours.

374
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:41,969
Of course not, Lord Joi.

375
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,069
Lord Joi?

376
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,396
It’s his nickname.

377
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:02,502
You are such a sweet talker.

378
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:07,994
I believe many Western girls must be lining up for you when you were abroad.

379
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:12,256
Not at all. I hardly compliment anyone.

380
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:17,189
In my eyes, you are much more beautiful than those Western girls.

381
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:21,199
Those girls are quite rough and unrefined.

382
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,343
They are not as sweet and gentle as a Lanna lady like you.

383
00:41:28,731 --> 00:41:30,457
(Sigh)

384
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:32,508
(Clearing the throat)

385
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:42,315
Are you coming back for good this time, Lord Joi?

386
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:45,291
Or are you planning to further your study abroad after this?

387
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:48,321
I am back for good.

388
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:51,891
From now on, I will only stay here in Prae.

389
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:58,062
Will you also work in the law field since you graduated in law?

390
00:41:58,062 --> 00:41:59,331
Yes.

391
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,554
I might work with the government.

392
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:05,194
Father is considering the options for me.

393
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,649
Yes.

394
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:12,638
Do you have a plan to get marry anytime soon?

395
00:42:15,173 --> 00:42:19,892
I’m afraid it would not be anytime soon. I’m still not ready.

396
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:27,204
That is...understandable.

397
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,726
I will wait for you.

398
00:42:33,574 --> 00:42:37,347
See you tonight then, my lord.

399
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,586
Mother has arranged this ceremony especially for you.

400
00:42:40,955 --> 00:42:45,312
Please excuse me then. I must go prepare for the ceremony tonight.

401
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:55,091
Would you like more tea, Lord Joi?

402
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:56,817
Lord Muang-Rahm.

403
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:03,141
Please excuse me, my lord.

404
00:43:18,235 --> 00:43:19,838
Miss Aon.

405
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,608
Wait. Please wait.

406
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:40,705
Why were you walking away?

407
00:43:41,005 --> 00:43:43,507
Are you still mad at me about earlier?

408
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:45,909
No, Your Highness.

409
00:43:46,923 --> 00:43:49,159
I truly understand you.

410
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:55,961
If I had done anything to make you feel uncomfortable,

411
00:43:57,044 --> 00:43:59,470
please kindly accept my sincere apology, Your Highness.

412
00:44:05,439 --> 00:44:11,004
Actually, I must apologize to you too.

413
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:17,244
For not being able to accept your sincere feelings for me.

414
00:44:18,581 --> 00:44:20,582
You did not do anything wrong, Your Highness.

415
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:23,734
It is me who does not know my own place.

416
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:28,198
But please don’t worry, Your Highness.

417
00:44:29,442 --> 00:44:32,284
I am trying my best to get over you.

418
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:45,216
Then, please know…

419
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:48,271
that no matter what happens,

420
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:51,821
you will always be my very dear friend.

421
00:44:58,297 --> 00:44:59,469
Yes, Your Highness.

422
00:45:00,736 --> 00:45:06,372
About you and Lady Pin, please rest assured…

423
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:10,474
I will keep it a secret from everyone, Your Highness.

424
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:13,441
Thank you!

425
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,083
Pin!

426
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:48,399
Pin!

427
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:51,570
Pin!

428
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:55,563
Please don’t misunderstand it.

429
00:45:57,545 --> 00:45:59,974
Pin.

430
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:04,833
Miss Aon and I were holding hands as friends.

431
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:06,282
Yes.

432
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:11,702
You are upset.

433
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:20,890
I am not.

434
00:46:23,586 --> 00:46:26,612
I heard the entire conversation between you and Miss Aon.

435
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:31,241
You scared me. I was afraid you would misunderstand it.

436
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:35,127
It was fortunate that I heard you talking to her from the beginning.

437
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,670
If I had been there a little later and only saw you and her holding hands like that…

438
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:44,362
I would have been fainted from jealousy.

439
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:49,006
Were you jealous?

440
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:55,220
Lady Uang.

441
00:46:56,418 --> 00:47:00,632
Mother has asked me to bring you and Lady Pin these traditional costumes.

442
00:47:03,443 --> 00:47:05,310
Traditional costumes?

443
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:13,304
Yes, Your Highness. Mother would like the guests from Bangkok
to attend the ceremony in these traditional costumes tonight.

444
00:47:13,304 --> 00:47:16,239
She has prepared the costumes for all the guests beforehand.

445
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:33,204
They are beautiful.

446
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:38,916
I will see you tonight at the banquet.

447
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,834
Yes.

448
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:02,284
Give me your hand, Anin.

449
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,021
Please wear this charm of mine.

450
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:09,736
And I promise to find a better ring that deserves to be on your ring finger.

451
00:48:40,044 --> 00:48:47,004
The Loyal Pin

452
00:48:47,063 --> 00:48:53,920
The Loyal Pin

453
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:24,191
Looking at you in this Lanna costume almost takes my breath away.

454
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:26,940
Am I that beautiful?

455
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,727
Yes.

456
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,323
Please let me put a pin in your hair.

457
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:37,292
Yes.

458
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,828
You look stunning.

459
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:32,158
Let me do it for you too.

460
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,718
You also look so captivating that my heart almost skips a beat.

461
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:42,597
Your sweet-looking face goes perfectly well with this Lanna costume.

462
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:52,472
You said as if, in your own mind, all the Lanna ladies are strikingly beautiful.

463
00:51:57,095 --> 00:52:00,491
Why would you say that?

464
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:09,999
I did not stay with you last night. Were you being a good girl?

465
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:13,783
Pia told me that Lady Uang came to see you in the middle of the night.

466
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:17,230
Pia saw us?

467
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,515
Why did she not come to rescue me then?

468
00:52:20,294 --> 00:52:22,908
Please don’t change the subject.

469
00:52:27,168 --> 00:52:29,952
Don’t worry. I’m always your good girl.

470
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:35,330
But Lady Uang might not be likewise.

471
00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:38,472
How so?

472
00:52:40,134 --> 00:52:48,616
Since that day when I saw you at Prince Anan’s wedding,

473
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:54,459
Every moment of my every thought…

474
00:52:55,082 --> 00:52:59,435
whether at night or while I’m awake…

475
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:04,344
has been filled with only you.

476
00:53:07,565 --> 00:53:11,063
I know we can never be together…

477
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:19,503
for we are not only close relatives…

478
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:27,169
but we are also both women.

479
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:42,704
Not to mention that Mother has already planned on my marriage with Lord Muang-Rahm.

480
00:53:51,457 --> 00:53:56,555
Nonetheless, I still wish you to know…

481
00:54:01,594 --> 00:54:04,508
that from now on…

482
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:11,479
however my life would change,

483
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:20,839
or whoever might take possession of my body,

484
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:28,308
but my heart…

485
00:54:32,204 --> 00:54:37,603
will always belong to you.

486
00:55:17,784 --> 00:55:21,709
Please stop. I couldn’t listen to it any longer.

487
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:26,425
Are you mad at me?

488
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:30,633
Why should I be mad at you?

489
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:34,724
I was the one who insisted that you should tell me.

490
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,036
So…

491
00:55:38,412 --> 00:55:41,151
What was your reply to her?

492
00:55:42,865 --> 00:55:47,218
She didn’t ask me anything. So, I didn’t say anything either.

493
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:57,303
At least, you should have let her know that you did not feel the same.

494
00:55:57,874 --> 00:56:02,539
She was crying so hard that I did not dare to utter a word.

495
00:56:05,968 --> 00:56:10,503
You must be consoling her then.

496
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:15,190
I admit that I did console her.

497
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,158
But it wasn’t that long.

498
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,861
I’m going to punish you.

499
00:56:31,082 --> 00:56:33,458
For what?

500
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:39,489
For not being clear to her how you feel about her.

501
00:56:39,749 --> 00:56:42,969
Blaming her for not asking is such a lame excuse.

502
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:59,221
How will you punish me then?

503
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:04,548
Will it be the same punishment as that night after my welcome party?

504
00:57:34,392 --> 00:57:36,558
If it is…

505
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:42,714
then please go on and punish me.

506
00:57:44,766 --> 00:57:46,376
Anin.

507
00:57:48,922 --> 00:57:50,942
Stop it.

508
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,250
Am I looking good today?

509
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,769
Very handsome indeed.

510
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:13,803
Wow, my dear Anin.

511
00:58:13,803 --> 00:58:15,477
Wow.

512
00:58:17,063 --> 00:58:19,648
My favourite niece is looking very lovely today.

513
00:58:19,648 --> 00:58:23,388
I never thought that you would be this beautiful.

514
00:58:23,726 --> 00:58:25,058
Thank you.

515
00:58:28,643 --> 00:58:33,025
Is this the pin I gave you last time?

516
00:58:33,285 --> 00:58:37,279
It looks perfect on you.

517
00:58:38,344 --> 00:58:41,368
You are making me feel so flattered.

518
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:44,321
I would be floating anytime soon.

519
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:51,878
If you wish to see her a little less pretty, you should ask her to do the traditional dancing.

520
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:57,376
I could clearly picture a monkey show, Brother.

521
00:58:57,844 --> 00:59:03,100
By sitting there without doing anything, you already look much gracious than doing such dance.

522
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:08,022
But today, both Anin and Lady Pin are looking very stunning in these Lanna white contumes.

523
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:10,626
I agree, Prince Arnon.

524
00:59:16,574 --> 00:59:22,067
Is the pin on Lady Pin’s hair the one I also gave you last time?

525
00:59:32,093 --> 00:59:34,425
Yes, it is.

526
00:59:34,425 --> 00:59:38,714
I lent her the pin so that it would match with her Lanna costume.

527
00:59:38,895 --> 00:59:41,237
Oh, that’s why.

528
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,590
You are also looking very lovely, dear.

529
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,894
Thank you, Your Highness.

530
00:59:48,972 --> 00:59:50,811
Lady Uang.

531
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:56,114
We have a problem. Kamhorm, the dancer who must be performing with you has suddenly fallen sick.

532
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:58,399
She won’t be able to perform tonight, my lady.

533
00:59:58,399 --> 00:59:59,368
Really?

534
00:59:59,368 --> 01:00:00,433
Yes, my lady.

535
01:04:08,073 --> 01:04:09,915
Pin.

536
01:04:13,629 --> 01:04:17,181
Pia said you want to see me. What is it?

537
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,223
Give me your hand, Anin.

538
01:04:42,638 --> 01:04:45,154
Please wear this charm of mine.

539
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:55,325
Why did you put in on my right hand?

540
01:04:57,117 --> 01:05:00,888
I don’t want to put you in an awkward situation when someone asks you about it.

541
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:07,238
Yet, I still wish to express my possession of you.

542
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:29,063
How I wish I could tell the whole world about us.

543
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:33,541
That you belong to me and only me.

544
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:46,021
What if I wish to put it on my ring finger…

545
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:48,001
will you allow it?

546
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:53,680
Please wait until I can save up enough money.

547
01:05:54,277 --> 01:05:59,196
And I promise to find a better ring that deserves to be on your ring finger.

548
01:06:08,157 --> 01:06:10,437
I will be waiting.

549
01:06:11,242 --> 01:06:15,483
No matter for how long, I will always be waiting.

550
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:53,059
The Loyal Pin

551
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:58,940
Just as I thought. Lady Pin and Princess Anin are seeing each other.

552
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,974
Am I right, Prik?

553
01:08:02,823 --> 01:08:05,559
Why would you like to see me, Your Highness?

554
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:13,033
From now on, the Pine Palace is a forbidden place for you.

555
01:08:13,968 --> 01:08:17,063
I would surely die.

556
01:08:17,063 --> 01:08:20,850
What urgent matter has brought you to come all the way here, Princess?

557
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,378
I am here to see Lady Pin.

558
01:08:22,378 --> 01:08:25,526
I have asked Lady Pin to go on an errand with Master Kuea.

559
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,884
I will never give you to anyone.

560
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:33,753
You are mine and only mine.

561
01:09:54,583 --> 01:10:04,877
The Loyal Pin

562
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:14,903
IDOLFACTORY
