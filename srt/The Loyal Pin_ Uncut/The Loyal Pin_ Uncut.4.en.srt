1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,066
I do miss Prik, but only as a friend.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,800
But with you, it’s more than that.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,546
From now on, I’d be able to see her every day.

4
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:17,573
I will try to win over her heart and make her fall for me.

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:22,653
My apology, Your Highness. I did not know that you have a guest.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,960
The scent of these flowers is so sweet.

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,506
But the scent from your cheeks…

8
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,400
are much sweeter.

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,586
(Sigh)

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,040
(Heart beating)

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,413
(Heart beating)

12
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:57,626
(Heart beating)

13
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:58,933
(Heart beating)

14
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:00,226
(Heart beating)

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,573
(Heart beating)

16
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,986
(Heart beating)

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
- Oh!   /   - Oh!

18
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:32,053
What are you doing here, my lady?

19
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:36,480
Koi, can you bring me some mangoes? I want to carve them.

20
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:38,266
Yes, my lady.

21
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,660
The Loyal Pin

22
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,266
What did you tease Lady Pin today, Your Highness?

23
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,480
She looked quite bewildered when I saw her rushing back into the Lotus Palace.

24
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:50,560
She even asked the servants to prepare some mangoes for her.

25
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,386
I just gave her a peck on the cheek.

26
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:55,413
Did I frighten her that much?

27
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,133
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,826
Do you think it would make her heart sway for a little?

29
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,293
You had even gone that far.

30
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,920
She must surely feel something, Your Highness.

31
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,186
What should I do to know how she feels?

32
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:23,986
You must prove it, Your Highness.

33
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,413
How?

34
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,826
Make her jealous, Your Highness.

35
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:36,413
If she is jealous, that means she has feelings for you.

36
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
Your tea, my lady.

37
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,826
Did you enjoy spending time in Yaowarat yesterday?

38
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,866
Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:11,733
The food and desserts there are very delicious.

40
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,760
Then please try these desserts too.

41
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,133
Tell me if they are as good as the desserts in Yaowarat.

42
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,146
Hmm…

43
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:47,866
Oh, isn’t that Princess Anin and Lady Uangfah?

44
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:53,893
Please not too much, Your Highness. I’m afraid I won’t be able to finish them.

45
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:33,600
They look so beautiful together like those angels in the fairy tale, my lady.

46
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:50,400
Lady Uangfah is so pretty.

47
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:54,773
Her face is angelic. And her manner is very gracious.

48
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,706
She is truly a lady. Umm…

49
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:10,586
My lady is also very gorgeous.

50
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:14,213
An indeed lovely and gracious woman you are, my lady.

51
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,986
Really?

52
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:20,013
Princess Anin is also strikingly beautiful.

53
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:23,333
You look dazzling together like a painting, my lady.

54
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,493
Seems like both of your angles are now coming our way.

55
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:49,386
Hello, Lady Pin. Are you carving mangoes?

56
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:53,906
Yes, Your Highness.

57
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,133
Hello, Lady Pin.

58
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:59,026
Hello, Lady Uang.

59
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:02,453
Do you have anything for us to nibble on?

60
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,640
I made ‘Chor Muang*’ for you, Your Highness.
(*Flower-shaped Dumpling filled with Minced Chicken)

61
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:10,920
Koi, can you go and bring them the snack?

62
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,186
Yes, my lady.

63
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,293
I brought Lady Uang here…

64
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:23,506
because I had often told her how the snacks at the Lotus Palace are very delicious utterly to my liking.

65
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:25,946
Is that so, Your Highness?

66
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,346
Yes, Lady Pin. Princess couldn’t stop telling me how wonderful they are.

67
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,213
That is true, my lady.

68
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

69
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,586
Prik.

70
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,860
[Chor Muang - Flower-shaped Dumpling filled with Minced Chicken]

71
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:11,226
They look so tasty.

72
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:13,813
Yes, indeed.

73
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:15,893
Did you make them yourself, Lady Pin?

74
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,040
Yes, Koi also helped me make them.

75
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,040
Please enjoy them, Your Highness.

76
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,013
Absolutely.

77
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:35,893
It’s hot. Please be careful, Your Highness.

78
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:49,253
Your cooking is always amazing.

79
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:58,826
It’s a pity I only made a small serving.

80
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:02,040
I didn’t know you would be coming, Your Highness.

81
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,280
Nor did I know that you would also be accompanied by your guest.

82
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:14,973
Then, shall we help you make more of them?

83
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:18,053
So that I could learn how to make it too, Lady Pin.

84
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,640
- I’m afraid I won’t…
- That’s great!

85
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:24,653
Can you teach us how to make them?

86
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:26,706
Your Highness.

87
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:32,640
Thank you.

88
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:48,146
Please be gentle, or else the flower shape might be ruined.

89
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,626
Now, they are ready for serving.

90
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,813
They look so savoury.

91
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:23,960
Prik, go and fetch me a plate.

92
00:12:24,573 --> 00:12:25,373
Yes, Your Highness.

93
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,226
Here it is, Your Highness.

94
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,520
Thank you.

95
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,240
What happened to your hand?

96
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,826
- The steam probably…
- Let me fix the wound for you.

97
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:56,866
Yes, Your Highness.

98
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,666
Prik, go and fetch me the aloe vera.

99
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,733
Yes, my lady.

100
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,853
Let’s go and sit down first, Lady Uang.

101
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,346
Yes, Your Highness.

102
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:18,906
Were you jealous when you saw me with Lady Uang?

103
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,866
No, Your Highness.

104
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,933
Look into my eyes and tell me again…

105
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:26,680
that you weren’t jealous.

106
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,060
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

107
00:13:56,757 --> 00:14:01,157
The Loyal Pin

108
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,323
Does it hurt?

109
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:22,230
No, Your Highness. You are very gentle.

110
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,163
Do you feel better?

111
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,843
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:20,963
These are Chor Muang snacks that we made earlier,
in case you might want to take them back home too.

113
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,043
Thank you, Lady Pin.

114
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,603
If you are feeling better, I’d like to excuse myself to attend to other matters in the kitchen.

115
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:06,070
Is something bothering you?

116
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:08,243
No, Your Highness.

117
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,497
Has Lady Uang left?

118
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,083
You seem to be quite concerned about her.

119
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:17,430
Why didn’t you see her off until she is home?

120
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,750
Were you upset when you saw me with Lady Uang?

121
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:29,030
Not at all. I’m perfectly fine with it.

122
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:38,417
If not upset, then perhaps…

123
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,177
Were you jealous?

124
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:50,417
Why would I be jealous?

125
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:12,990
Look into my eyes and tell me again…

126
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:16,777
that you weren’t jealous.

127
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:19,270
I’d to know whether you are lying through your teeth.

128
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:23,123
I’m not lying.

129
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:32,030
Are you sure?

130
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:43,750
Yes, Your Highness.

131
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:58,123
Excuse me, Lady Pin.

132
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,550
What is it, Koi?

133
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,257
Master Kuea has come to see you, my lady.

134
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,270
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

135
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:37,577
She didn’t seem to be jealous.

136
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:39,750
And that Master Kuea just came at a very wrong moment.

137
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,643
But from what I had observed, Lady Pin seemed to be quite jealous, Your Highness.

138
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,857
But I’m not sure whether it was in a platonic or romantic way.

139
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:54,057
Do you think so?

140
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,617
Yes, Your Highness.

141
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:59,897
As for Master Kuea, he always picks the hellish timing in everything, Your Highness.

142
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,777
Hellish timing?

143
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:07,870
As in the worst timing, Your Highness.

144
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,537
I heard those servants in the kitchen often said it.

145
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,083
Or might Lady Pin have feelings for Master Kuea?

146
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:18,870
Impossible, Your Highness. I am absolutely sure about this.

147
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,377
How dare he try to take away Lady Pin from me.

148
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,590
I must teach him a lesson.

149
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:36,537
What did you say?

150
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:38,190
A tennis match?

151
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:39,763
Yes, Brother.

152
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,363
The tennis court in our palace has been left deserted for such a long time.

153
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,203
Now that I am home, I’d like to arrange something fun for us.

154
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,617
So, I came up with this idea of a tennis match.

155
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:56,577
I am thinking of inviting Lady Uang and Lady Pin to join us too.

156
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,923
Both of you should also invite your friends. It would be fun with more people.

157
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,297
Interesting.

158
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:08,563
Brother, why don’t you invite Master Kuea too?

159
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,003
Isn’t he a regular visitor at our palace?

160
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,577
Oh, that one will certainly come as long as Lady Pin is there.

161
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:20,563
All is settled then.

162
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:22,870
Yes, Brother.

163
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:25,137
Checkmate.

164
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:34,750
I’m not going. I’m not good at playing tennis.

165
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:39,857
But Her Highness insists that you must join her this time,
otherwise someone will be missing a partner.

166
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:41,950
Who else are coming?

167
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:56,003
There are Prince Anan, Prince Arnon, Lady Parawatee,
Lady Uangfah, and a friend of His Highness, my lady.

168
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,550
A friend of His Highness? Who is it?

169
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,737
I do not know, my lady.

170
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,137
I hope it’s not Master Kuea.

171
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,043
Just go, Lady Pin. You should go out sometimes.

172
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:22,350
Or else people might be saying that I only wish to keep you inside the palace.

173
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:25,817
I will make Som Choon* (fruits in syrup dessert) as a refreshment too.

174
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:31,977
Yes, Your Highness.

175
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:56,430
Prik.

176
00:21:57,923 --> 00:21:58,923
Let me have a look.

177
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,937
Turn around.

178
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:24,123
You look so lovely in this outfit.

179
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,643
I was right to bring them back for you from England.

180
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:30,390
Thank you, your Highness.

181
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:36,617
But I’m afraid I do not know how to play tennis.

182
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,950
Who said I would let you play?

183
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,817
Oh.

184
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:46,203
You will be the ball girl today.

185
00:22:51,017 --> 00:22:54,897
If you want to play, I promise I will teach you next time.

186
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,803
Thank you, Your Highness.

187
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,523
Let’s go.

188
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,537
Today, I will finally get to know Kuea,

189
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,670
my archenemy.

190
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:25,897
Anin, this is my friend, Kueakiat. You can call him Kuea.

191
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,137
Hello. I have heard a lot about you.

192
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,123
Finally, we meet.

193
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,590
What have you heard about me, Your Highness?

194
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:44,043
Surprise, Your Highness!

195
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:47,203
Pranot! I miss you so much!

196
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:48,857
I miss you too, Your Highness.

197
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:52,350
Pranot, this is Lady Pin.

198
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:57,110
Lady Pin, this is Pranot. He is my brothers’ friend at the university.

199
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,510
Hello.

200
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:04,097
Hello, Lady Pin. The princess often told me about you. We finally met today.

201
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,443
He is my best friend in England. To keep me company.

202
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:11,083
That’s right, Your Highness.

203
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:14,963
Please behave, Pranot.

204
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,657
She is my sister, don’t you ever forget that.

205
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:21,697
My apology, Your Highness.

206
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:29,043
It seems that Prince Arnon is quite possessive of his little sister.

207
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,297
Probably more possessive than you, Your Highness.

208
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:37,390
- He is just pretending, Watee.
- Brother.

209
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:42,203
He is well aware that Pranot only thinks of Anin as his big boss.

210
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:45,483
And that Pranot will never try to be otherwise. Am I right, Pranot?

211
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,257
Absolutely right, Your Highness.

212
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:50,177
Princess Anin is like my big boss.

213
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:54,710
I only wish to stay by her side as her loyal sidekick, Your Highness.

214
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:02,097
It’s quite late. Shall we begin then?

215
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:05,497
How should we divide the team? Have you thought about it, Arnon?

216
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:07,443
Yes, Your Highness.

217
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:09,897
We will pair up between a guy and a girl.

218
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:11,897
Those who can play well must be on a different team.

219
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,977
Surely, you must pair up with Lady Watee.

220
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:16,097
Anin will be with Pranot.

221
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:23,497
Kueakiat will be with Lady Pin.

222
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:28,070
As for me, I will pair up with Lady Uang.

223
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:30,617
The match will be divided into 2 rounds.

224
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:33,137
In the first round, all 4 teams will play against their opponents.

225
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:38,163
The winners from the first round will play against each other in the last round.

226
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,123
Then, shall we let Prik choose who would be playing first?

227
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,203
But wouldn’t she be biased and take your side?

228
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:56,550
Never mind then. Prik does not know how well we can play anyway.

229
00:25:56,657 --> 00:26:00,043
It’s probably best to let her decide.

230
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:03,710
Which teams will you choose to play first, Prik?

231
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:20,923
I’d like to have Princess Anin playing against Lady Pin, Your Highness.

232
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,950
Okay, let’s do that.

233
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:27,550
I will be the umpire for this game.

234
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:29,963
Come, let’s begin.

235
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:34,363
Thank you.

236
00:26:45,617 --> 00:26:46,763
Please, Lady Pin.

237
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,923
Please don’t go easy on me.

238
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,603
I will do my best, Your Highness.

239
00:26:58,523 --> 00:26:59,270
Ouch!

240
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:02,897
- A point for Anin.

241
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:25,997
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

242
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,090
The Loyal Pin

243
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,670
Please don’t go easy on me.

244
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,590
I will do my best, Your Highness.

245
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:03,683
Anin will serve first.

246
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:14,683
Ouch!

247
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:17,856
An ace. A point for Anin.

248
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,190
A point for Anin.

249
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:32,350
A point for Anin.

250
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:34,576
Ouch!

251
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,376
A point for Anin.

252
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,110
A point for Anin.

253
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:06,616
Anin looks so serious as if she were playing for a world championship.

254
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,870
But I’m not sure if we can call it a team play, Your Highness.

255
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:14,323
Since Lady Pin hasn’t yet had a chance to hit the ball even once.

256
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,616
You are right.

257
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:21,043
If Anin is going to be this serious,

258
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,830
will anyone still want to play against her next time?

259
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,656
I, for one, will certainly refuse, Your Highness.

260
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:44,136
Ouch!

261
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,963
Game, set, match! Anin and Pranot won!

262
00:29:52,176 --> 00:29:53,176
Ouch!

263
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:58,510
Are you all right, Master Kuea?

264
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:00,736
I’m in so much pain, Lady Pin.

265
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:36,576
A face towel, Your Highness.

266
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,710
Thank you, Lady Uang.

267
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,203
Please beat my brother in this game.

268
00:30:45,283 --> 00:30:48,296
Let’s just hope I can hit the ball forward first, Your Highness.

269
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:58,616
I will be the umpire in this game, Your Highness.

270
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:03,336
It will surely be an interesting battle between siblings.

271
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:06,270
You are so done.

272
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:36,616
Game, set, match! Prince Arnon and Lady Uang won in this game, Your Highness.

273
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,550
Game, set, match! Anin and Pranot won!

274
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:01,963
How did I do earlier?

275
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:04,216
Did I play well?

276
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,590
Yes.

277
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,710
If I hadn’t slipped,

278
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,283
I could have easily returned the shot.

279
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:11,390
Yes.

280
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,576
Master Kuea.

281
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:19,176
I want to sit here. Please go sit somewhere else.

282
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,470
My apology, Your Highness.

283
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:34,896
Thank you.

284
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:37,816
Have some water, Your Highness.

285
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,963
Thank you.

286
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:47,083
Anin, if you’re going to be so serious in the game and defeated everyone like this,

287
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,750
I’m afraid no one would want to play against you next time.

288
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,243
I thought everyone was going easy on me this time.

289
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,203
Of course, not.

290
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:02,936
Perhaps, someone might want to have a rematch to win back the game.

291
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,123
Am I right, Master Kuea?

292
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,936
I’m afraid I must practise harder and improve my skills…

293
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:14,843
before I could play against you, Your Highness.

294
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:30,110
[Som Choon – an aromatic dessert of sweet and sour fruits in syrup]
Wow, how fortunate I am to get to try Princess Patt’s dessert today.

295
00:33:47,123 --> 00:33:48,216
Wonderful.

296
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,923
It also makes you feel fresh.

297
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,683
I love it too, Your Highness.

298
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:57,390
I’ve heard that the fruits in syrup dessert made by Lady Pin is also second to none.

299
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,563
That’s what I’ve heard too.

300
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

301
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,150
I’d like to try your dessert for once, Lady Pin.

302
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,390
Should you have some time to make it again,

303
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,243
can I have a chance to try it too?

304
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,470
Please don’t waste your time looking forward to it, Master Kuea.

305
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,643
I only make it on rare occasions.

306
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,790
Although I might make it for Princess Patt at times,

307
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,496
but that is only once in a while.

308
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:34,136
That’s very unfortunate, Master Kuea.

309
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,976
I’d like to try her fruits in syrup too.

310
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:41,883
It’s been quite some time since I last had it. How I wish to try it again.

311
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:49,803
If you’d like to have it, I will make it for you tomorrow, Your Highness.

312
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:52,523
Thank you.

313
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:12,243
From what I have been observing during these days,

314
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:14,150
I am absolutely certain…

315
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,336
that Lady Pin surely has feelings for you, Your Highness.

316
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,216
Is that so?

317
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,603
Yes, Your Highness.

318
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:28,443
Lady Pin was clearly jealous today when she saw you with Lady Uang and Mr. Pranot.

319
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:37,576
Water, Your Highness.

320
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,163
Thank you, Lady Uang.

321
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,563
Pranot, you’re doing it wrong.

322
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,896
How should I do it, Your Highness?

323
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,403
Please excuse me, Lady Uang.

324
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,536
Like this.

325
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:23,203
Hold it like this.

326
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,910
Look at the ball and bend your knees.

327
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:28,603
Not too much.

328
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:35,070
I saw it with my own eyes, Your Highness.
I am absolutely sure she was jealous.

329
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,950
But Lady Pin is probably too stubborn to admit it, Your Highness.

330
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,190
Then, should I just confront her and tell her how I feel?

331
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:47,190
Well, it’s quite hard to tell for now, Your Highness.

332
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:51,790
We should rather wait and see how Lady Pin might react further.

333
00:36:52,696 --> 00:36:57,136
Or perhaps, you might have to find some time alone together, Your Highness.

334
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,723
How could that be possible?

335
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,096
She must go back and forth between the Lotus Palace and the Pine Palace.

336
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,710
And she also has to take care of Princess Patt.

337
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:14,070
But I heard that Princess Pattamika is going to attend her friend’s wedding in Kanchanaburi…

338
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,990
and will be away for one or two nights, Your Highness.

339
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,416
Two nights?

340
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:21,736
Yes, Your Highness.

341
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,283
Do you have a plan, Your Highness?

342
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,883
Why do you want Prik to accompany me to Kanchanaburi, Princess?

343
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,323
Why should she not go with you then?

344
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,443
Without Prik here, will you not be quite troubled?

345
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:58,243
Your Pine Palace does not have any servant but Prik.

346
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,310
If she were to accompany me, who would be taking care of you?

347
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,670
I can take care of myself, Your Highness.

348
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:10,670
Moreover, you will only be away for just a few days.

349
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:15,083
Of all the people in the Pine Palace, Prik seems to be the most available person.

350
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:18,990
She has also never been outside the palace.

351
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:22,243
I’d like her to see the world behind the palace walls sometimes.

352
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:29,470
What a genius you are, Your Highness. My deepest gratitude for your kindness.

353
00:38:29,496 --> 00:38:32,883
Because of Your Highness, I can finally go outside and see the world.

354
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:40,336
Yes, you’d get to see the world while
I’d get to stay with Lady Pin without someone as a third wheel.

355
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:45,416
Hopefully, Lady Pin will not ruin our plan…

356
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,376
when she hears about this, Your Highness.

357
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,430
Anin.

358
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:59,750
Is it true that you told Prik to accompany Princess Patt to Kanchanaburi?

359
00:38:59,776 --> 00:39:01,136
You cannot do that, Your Highness.

360
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:11,430
(Crying sound)
Why not, my lady?

361
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,176
(Crying sound)
Since when I was born, I have never been to anywhere outside this palace.

362
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,496
This is the first time in my life.

363
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,163
Will you not allow me to go, Lady Pin?

364
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:29,080
(Crying sound)
You are too cruel, my lady.

365
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:43,630
Prik!

366
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:53,376
Look how sad she is, running away while also crying like that.

367
00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:55,456
Poor her.

368
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:58,936
She must be very disappointed if she could not go.

369
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:06,256
If you let her go, who will take care of you then?

370
00:40:07,563 --> 00:40:09,256
I can take care of myself.

371
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:12,976
Do not forget that I am a student abroad.

372
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,043
There is not even a single maid there with me.

373
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:22,310
I do not wish for anyone to wait on me hand and foot.

374
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,630
I only wish for you to care for me.

375
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:34,536
But I am usually not with you day and night.

376
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,443
That is very easy.

377
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:42,683
Come and stay with me all night then.

378
00:40:56,643 --> 00:40:59,910
Only you in my life is much more than enough.

379
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,363
What are you doing, Anin?

380
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:27,090
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

381
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:34,187
The Loyal Pin

382
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,860
Have a safe trip, Your Highness.

383
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:05,247
Please look after the palace and Princess Anin for me.

384
00:42:05,287 --> 00:42:06,060
Yes, Your Highness.

385
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:21,073
Please take care of my princess for me, my lady.

386
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,260
Good luck.

387
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:28,540
I’ll buy some snacks for you guys.

388
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,113
What do we have for supper?

389
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,900
Fruits in syrup, Your Highness.

390
00:43:09,273 --> 00:43:13,407
You mentioned the day before that you would like to have it. So, I made it for you.

391
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:17,807
Don’t you see?

392
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:22,420
Having only you in my life is much more than enough.

393
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:24,900
Are you sure?

394
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,407
I’m warning you.

395
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,313
Don’t ever let me hear you demanding for someone else except me.

396
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:42,027
(Rain falling)

397
00:43:43,193 --> 00:43:47,420
It’s still raining. I do not want you to walk back to the Lotus Palace at this time.

398
00:43:48,313 --> 00:43:49,647
But I must go back to prepare dinner for…

399
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,647
(Thunder sound)

400
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,833
It’s all right now.

401
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:14,287
I should have known you are still frightened by a thunder.

402
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:17,367
Just like when you were young.

403
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:27,180
Please help my parents!

404
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:31,167
(Thunder sound)
Screammm

405
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:34,787
(Thunder sound)

406
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:38,740
I found them! This way!

407
00:44:47,287 --> 00:44:49,047
Father!

408
00:44:50,913 --> 00:44:52,567
Mother!

409
00:44:53,993 --> 00:44:55,713
Father!

410
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:59,553
Mother!

411
00:44:59,547 --> 00:45:01,420
Father!

412
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,113
(Thunder sound)

413
00:45:07,753 --> 00:45:09,580
Father!

414
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,577
(Thunder sound)

415
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:18,553
(Thunder sound)

416
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:25,847
Please don’t be afraid.

417
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,167
I am right here. I will never leave you.

418
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:46,113
It seems you might have to stay here for quite a while.

419
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,287
But I must go back to prepare dinner for you.

420
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:09,407
I will wait until the rain lets up.

421
00:46:31,007 --> 00:46:34,553
Seems like your mind is only occupied with the thought of feeding me.

422
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,993
Please take some rest today. If you are hungry,

423
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,793
I will cook for you instead.

424
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:47,473
Do you know how to cook?

425
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,020
Yes.

426
00:46:52,073 --> 00:46:54,500
Are you feeling better now?

427
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:59,193
Yes, much better.

428
00:47:01,047 --> 00:47:02,500
Very well.

429
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:06,420
Then, please stay here for a while. Don’t leave just yet.

430
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:48,833
(Thunder sound)

431
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:50,327
Are you awake?

432
00:47:59,993 --> 00:48:01,953
Dinner is ready.

433
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:04,873
Please go freshen up then we can eat.

434
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:11,567
I’m sorry, Your Highness.

435
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,060
Why did you say that?

436
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,180
I fell asleep…

437
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:21,260
and became a burden to you.

438
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,460
Not a burden at all.

439
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:30,367
It’s still raining hard. I will never let you walk back to the Lotus Palace in this rain.

440
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:34,287
I also told you that I would cook for you.

441
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:37,980
Please allow me to show you my cooking skills.

442
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:43,967
Let’s go.

443
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,420
I made them all for you.

444
00:49:29,447 --> 00:49:30,780
They look amazing.

445
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:35,447
Please try them.

446
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:01,447
It’s very delicious.

447
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,740
I’m a good cook, aren’t I?

448
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:36,620
Not too much please, Anin. Or else I would be too full to walk back home.

449
00:50:38,407 --> 00:50:41,593
Then…just stay here with me.

450
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,980
It’s quite late and the rain still hasn’t let up.

451
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,460
Please don’t walk back to the Lotus Palace in the rain. Just stay here with me.

452
00:50:58,087 --> 00:50:59,553
Where would I sleep then?

453
00:51:00,113 --> 00:51:02,007
In the guest bedroom, of course.

454
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:04,567
It’s such a nice bedroom.

455
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:06,980
No one has ever slept there.

456
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:13,913
I’m afraid I can’t. You should rather keep it for your guests.

457
00:51:15,927 --> 00:51:18,473
Please, Pin.

458
00:51:19,487 --> 00:51:23,873
It’s raining. I’m scared.

459
00:51:26,993 --> 00:51:28,167
What are you scared of?

460
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,047
Ever since I have known you, I have never seen you scared of anything.

461
00:51:42,793 --> 00:51:44,487
(Thunder sound)

462
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:45,580
I’m scared of ghosts.

463
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,593
Wasn’t it you who pretended to be a ghost and spooked other people?

464
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,740
I wasn’t scared back then, but I am now.

465
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,087
Please, Pin. Please.

466
00:52:06,553 --> 00:52:07,780
Please stay here with me.

467
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:13,507
I’m honestly scared.

468
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,607
Please.

469
00:52:17,647 --> 00:52:19,660
But I didn’t bring any spare clothes with me.

470
00:52:21,487 --> 00:52:24,153
Does this mean you are staying?

471
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,147
I’ll go prepare the pyjamas for you then.

472
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,140
Are you feeling sleepy?

473
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:23,900
No.

474
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,073
You are spending a night with me. How could I sleep?

475
00:53:28,513 --> 00:53:31,273
I’d rather stay up all night talking to you.

476
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,060
What else do you want to talk about?

477
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:39,847
We have been talking and spending time together all day long today.

478
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:43,393
Perhaps only in your dream.

479
00:53:43,713 --> 00:53:45,887
You spent almost the entire day sleeping.

480
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,260
What about you, are you feeling sleepy?

481
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:15,207
No. I’m afraid I had already slept a lot just like you said.

482
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:20,087
Let’s sit here for a while then.

483
00:54:22,113 --> 00:54:22,847
Yes.

484
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,553
Pranot!

485
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,073
- Yes, Your Highness?    /    - Stop it.

486
00:54:55,473 --> 00:54:56,820
Is there something wrong?

487
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,727
I was told that Mr. Pranot is a friend of Prince Arnon.

488
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:08,420
How come he is very close to you?

489
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:13,127
Does he only think of you as a friend?

490
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:19,260
Haven’t I already told you? Brother has asked him to take care of me when I’m there.

491
00:55:19,393 --> 00:55:21,473
He is like a brother to me.

492
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,113
Really?

493
00:55:24,967 --> 00:55:27,687
Yes. Why would I lie to you?

494
00:55:31,553 --> 00:55:34,900
I saw him kissing you the other day.

495
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:38,687
Kissing?

496
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:40,247
Where?

497
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:41,953
When was it?

498
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:44,177
Why couldn’t I recall it?

499
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,433
He kissed the back of your hand…

500
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:54,767
before he’d say goodbye on the day when we were playing tennis.

501
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:00,367
You mean, the hand kiss?

502
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:08,327
Why are you laughing? I don’t see anything funny about it.

503
00:56:09,927 --> 00:56:12,553
Pranot loves to tease me that I am a princess.

504
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:17,620
So, he often pretends to greet me like how the westerners greet their princesses.

505
00:56:22,273 --> 00:56:26,140
Nevertheless, a kiss is still a kiss.

506
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:30,687
That is not true at all.

507
00:56:31,793 --> 00:56:35,087
There are, in fact, many kinds of kisses, each with a different meaning.

508
00:57:05,913 --> 00:57:07,313
What are you doing?

509
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:11,900
I’m going to demonstrate it to you.

510
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:20,353
This is called a hand kiss. It’s often used when you wish to honour the other person.

511
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,913
This is called…

512
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,247
a butterfly kiss.

513
00:57:41,113 --> 00:57:42,780
You use it when you adore…

514
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:45,247
a baby or a little kid.

515
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:14,420
This…

516
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:18,553
is a lip kiss.

517
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:21,393
You use it for expressing love.

518
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,607
And this…

519
00:58:58,287 --> 00:59:00,300
is a French kiss.

520
00:59:01,727 --> 00:59:06,593
You use it to express desire between lovers.

521
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,387
The Loyal Pin

522
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,673
There was a phone call from Princess Dararai.

523
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,153
She said Prince Jakkham has already passed away.

524
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,460
Father no longer waited for me.

525
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,753
Princess Dararai has given these golden and silver pins to me.

526
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,887
I’d love both of us to have matching pins.

527
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:30,060
Can you truly be mine tonight?

528
01:00:30,687 --> 01:00:33,073
Everything that I already gave to you,

529
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:38,620
you may do as you wish to it, Your Highness.

530
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:52,300
