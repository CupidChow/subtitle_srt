1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:01,248
Miss Aon!

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,376
Help! Miss Aon is drowning!

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,736
- Help!    /    - Miss Aon!

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,840
Princess Anin was very worried. She even gave you CPR herself.

5
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:14,176
But it was still an indirect kiss anyhow.

6
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:16,576
A kiss must be like this.

7
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:23,680
After everyone is asleep tonight, can you do me a favor?

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,360
Can you please accept this ring as a promise that portrays all my feelings for you?

9
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:31,040
Yes.

10
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:35,152
Please excuse me then.

11
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:50,512
How I wish we didn’t have to return so early.
I’d love to stay there for a month, Your Highness.

12
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:52,864
Is that so?

13
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:57,024
Then shall I tell my brother to send you to stay at our palace there?

14
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,552
Please don’t, Your Highness.

15
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,408
Hua Hin wouldn’t be a lovely place to stay without you, my princess.

16
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:05,104
Hmm

17
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,736
You are such a sweet talker.

18
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:11,696
Just like when Her Highness is with you, my lady.

19
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:15,760
You two are talking too much.

20
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:21,264
You may go now. I want to be alone with Lady Pin.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,928
I’ll put the bags in your room then, Your Highness.

22
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:27,408
I’ll bring you some water, Your Highness.

23
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:45,936
I first thought this trip to Hua Hin would be like a honeymoon for us.

24
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:49,344
Unfortunately, so many things happened.

25
00:01:56,304 --> 00:02:00,608
I promise to arrange another trip for you.

26
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,808
There will be only two of us this time.

27
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:08,592
How could that be possible?

28
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:12,160
We need a driver somehow.

29
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,768
Oh, that’s right.

30
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,248
You want to learn how to drive?

31
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,240
Yes.

32
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,240
Can you teach me, Brother?

33
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,056
Well…I can.

34
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:52,240
But why would you drive it yourself? We have many drivers here at the palace.

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,384
It doesn’t hurt to know how to do it.

36
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,392
Can you please teach me?

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,248
Please…

38
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:03,040
Pleaseee…

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,400
Please.

40
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:13,440
Fine.

41
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:15,440
I will teach you.

42
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:17,440
Thank you, Brother.

43
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:22,144
What is it?

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,224
Let’s start by giving me a piggyback ride first.

45
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:28,048
- You’re not that small anymore, Anin. / - Let’s go!

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,980
Where to? Let’s go!

47
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,384
Where’s next?

48
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,784
Do you want to swim?

49
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,500
The Loyal Pin

50
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,504
Please excuse me then.

51
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,584
Does she already have a lover?

52
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:50,608
Here you go.

53
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:01,312
Come in.

54
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:05,920
Oh, hello Kuea.

55
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:08,336
Please sit down.

56
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,544
Is there anything you’d like to talk to me?

57
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
I just want to express my sincere gratitude
to Your Highness for helping me about Lady Pin.

58
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:24,980
Oh, about that?

59
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:29,744
How is it going then? Does she seem to develop any feelings for you?

60
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:35,920
Not at all, Your Highness.

61
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:38,944
Oh, really?

62
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,216
Perhaps, Lady Pin might already have someone
she loves or even someone she is already engaged with.

63
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,880
She always refuses to give me a chance, Your Highness.

64
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:53,712
I am not sure whether she already has someone she loves or not.

65
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,392
But I am certain that she is still not engaged to anyone.

66
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,960
If she is, I must know.

67
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:08,032
Then, I am quite relieved to hear that.

68
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:15,328
But it is also possible that Princess Pattamika might already agree on Lady Pin’s engagement without telling my mother.

69
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,056
Then, I wouldn’t know about it.

70
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,888
Let me see.

71
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,024
Try to be more gentle. You’re ruining the fruit.

72
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,528
Yes, Your Highness.

73
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:04,896
Your Highness, Master Kuea has come to see you.

74
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,744
Me?

75
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,176
Do you mean Lady Pin?

76
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:15,504
I asked him twice and he insisted that he would like to see you, Princess Pattamika.

77
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,232
He is now waiting at the parlour.

78
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:39,024
What brought you here to see me?

79
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,696
Lately, you seemed to visit here only while I was away.

80
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:43,408
That was not what I intended at all, Your Highness.

81
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:47,168
It was just a coincidence that I came to visit while you were away.

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
I was just teasing. Please don’t take it seriously.

83
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:55,120
Your Highness.

84
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,600
These are souvenirs from Hua Hin.

85
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:00,064
Thank you.

86
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,256
Seeing that you are paying me a visit
during these hours which you should have been busy working,

87
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:12,240
I suppose it must be something very urgent.

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,624
And it is not just to bring me these souvenirs.

89
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,648
Am I correct?

90
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,240
I can never hide anything from you, Your Highness.

91
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:23,040
What is it then?

92
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:29,376
I am here to ask you about Lady Pin, Your Highness.

93
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:31,664
I’d like to know…

94
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:34,960
if Lady Pin is already engaged to anyone, Your Highness.

95
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,456
Of course not.

96
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,576
Why are you asking?

97
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:49,472
I…I just saw…

98
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,512
You saw what?

99
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:05,376
I saw a diamond ring on her ring finger, Your Highness.

100
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,232
If that is true, then how come I have never seen it before?

101
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:17,264
Never have I, Your Highness.

102
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:20,352
Not until before we said goodbye in Hua Hin.

103
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:27,808
I didn’t see her wearing any ring before she left to Hua Hin.

104
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:31,872
That is why I’d like to know for certain if she is still available, Your Highness.

105
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:36,336
You can be certain that she is not engaged to anyone yet.

106
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,480
If she is, I must be the first one to know.

107
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,400
About the ring, please do not take it seriously just yet.

108
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,928
It might only be one of her favourite accessories.

109
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:52,400
And so, she would like to wear it on her ring finger.

110
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:58,576
I do hope it would be as you said, Your Highness.

111
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,328
I saw a diamond ring on her ring finger, Your Highness.

112
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,456
The ring you are wearing, did you buy it from Hua Hin?

113
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,300
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

114
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:57,395
The Loyal Pin

115
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:33,231
Did you enjoy your time in Hua Hin, Lady Pin?

116
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:35,791
Very much, Your Highness.

117
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:41,199
I went for a walk on the beach, rode a horse, and ate a lot of seafood.

118
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,727
Horse riding?

119
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,255
Why did you do something so extreme?

120
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:51,807
What if you fell off? It surely wouldn’t worth
the little fun you had gained from riding it.

121
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,687
I will be more careful next time, Your Highness.

122
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:04,911
That ring you are wearing, did you buy it from Hua Hin?

123
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,415
Well…I…

124
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:17,967
Answer me, Lady Pin.

125
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:21,503
Where did you get that ring from?

126
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:27,375
Princess Anin gave it to me, Your Highness.

127
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:33,887
Gave it to you? For what occasion?

128
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,463
Not for any special occasion, Your Highness.

129
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,503
She only wished to give me this ring.

130
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:47,519
Just like how Princess Alisa wished to give me
those ruby and diamond accessories.

131
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:54,671
Princess Alisa gave them to you because it was almost your birthday, Lady Pin.

132
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:57,343
It was not without a special occasion.

133
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:05,103
Do you really think Princess Anin would give you this valuable gift without any specific reason?

134
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,327
I do not know, Your Highness.

135
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,135
I could tell just by one glance at it how valuable that ring is.

136
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:21,567
Why did you accept it so easily without asking for a reason?

137
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:32,175
I was afraid to refuse a gift from the elder one. You used to tell me…

138
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:36,687
that Princess Anin is in fact my youngest aunt.

139
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,471
Then, that would explain it.

140
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:54,367
But why did you choose to wear it on your ring finger?

141
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,735
Do you know the meaning of it?

142
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:01,919
Yes, Your Highness.

143
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:05,695
Then, why are you still wearing it like that?

144
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,879
Remove that ring and give it to me right now!

145
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,687
Her Highness is quite frail and delicate.

146
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:20,143
If she coughs, let her sip the syrup and she will feel better.

147
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:35,855
Go closer to her.

148
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,511
What is your name?

149
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:12,047
My name is Pattamika, Your Highness.

150
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:14,383
A beautiful name it is.

151
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,943
Thank you, Your Highness.

152
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,071
Please let me see your face, Patt.

153
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:29,871
Talk to me properly. Don’t just talk to my feet.

154
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,263
My apology, Your Highness.

155
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:05,855
From now on, you are my personal attendant.

156
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:09,887
You shall arrange what I wish for.

157
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:13,583
Always accompany me.

158
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:17,039
And read me books.

159
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:21,135
After I fall asleep, you may return to your room.

160
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:25,967
Or if you wish, you may sleep next to my bed.

161
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:28,959
Yes, Your Highness.

162
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:37,999
Love is like a disease that can make a man blind.

163
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:44,143
Neither knowing nor seeing any obstacles ahead.

164
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:50,543
Love is like a young and wild bull that is being confined.

165
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:56,831
Soon, it will try to break away and refuse to be kept in.

166
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:04,703
Even when it is tied, it would strongly strain its bond.

167
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:12,527
Becoming more violent in restrain, it fears no hurt.

168
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:25,583
What is your thought on this poem?

169
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:37,455
I was wondering whether the power of love is in fact as extreme and ferocious…

170
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:39,839
as it is said in the poem, Your Highness.

171
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,687
If you had ever experienced it,

172
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:47,967
you would have never said that.

173
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:57,951
Love is so ferocious it imprisons you with emptiness.

174
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:03,359
It will always remain uncertain all through your life.

175
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:11,439
Then, love surely is very dangerous.

176
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,975
What makes it even more dangerous is…

177
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:27,407
Come a little closer. I will tell you about it.

178
00:21:29,743 --> 00:21:30,655
Yes, Your Highness.

179
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:51,935
Give me your hand.

180
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:32,751
Why would you give me such a valuable gift, Your Highness?

181
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,767
What makes it even more dangerous…

182
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:45,967
is that love often happens without rhyme or reason.

183
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,247
Do you understand what I was trying to say?

184
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:20,927
Your Highness.

185
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:37,119
Your Highness.

186
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,319
Your Highness!

187
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:13,183
Your Highness!

188
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:26,975
Your Highness!

189
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,495
Your Highness!

190
00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:20,079
Pin.

191
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:25,759
Pin.

192
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,471
Yes?

193
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:32,511
A penny for your thought. Is something bothering you?

194
00:27:52,735 --> 00:27:56,063
Princess Patt is suspicious of the ring you gave me.

195
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,303
Is she?

196
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,959
If this ring has caused you to be in a difficult situation,

197
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:18,959
you can remove it or put it on your right hand instead.

198
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,055
No. You gave this ring to me.

199
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:34,671
Whether dead or alive, I will never remove it from my finger.

200
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:39,711
Then don’t remove it.

201
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:43,007
Please don’t worry.

202
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:48,303
I will help you find a way out for this problem.

203
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,855
What are you going to do?

204
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,631
I truly wish to tie the knot with her, Your Highness.

205
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,111
Please don’t worry. I will try to help as much as I can.

206
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:47,275
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

207
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:54,383
The Loyal Pin

208
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:18,747
My mother just came back from our house on the farm, so I came bearing these gifts for you.

209
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:20,779
Thank you.

210
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:27,307
About Lady Pin, I’d like to know how you feel about her.

211
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,579
Can you please tell me?

212
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,003
I truly wish to tie the knot with her, Your Highness.

213
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:38,011
What is her reaction towards your approach?

214
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:43,979
She…does not seem to like me that much, Your Highness.

215
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:52,011
Lady Pin is quite stubborn. You are indeed a fine young man without any flaw.

216
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:55,515
But I do not want to force anyone about this.

217
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:00,779
I understand, Your Highness.

218
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,659
I will try to help as much as I can.

219
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:05,867
Please do not worry.

220
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:11,403
Thank you, Your Highness.

221
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,755
Which one do you like?

222
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,315
Will you give it to me, Your Highness?

223
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:39,579
Yes.

224
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:44,363
Wow, this one is beautiful.

225
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,543
This one too.

226
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:58,667
I’ll have this one, Your Highness. It’s so big.

227
00:32:00,827 --> 00:32:03,355
Clever choice indeed. It’s very noticeable.

228
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:11,339
Surely, you are not giving it to me for free, are you, Your Highness?

229
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:15,291
Yes, I have something important for you to do.

230
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:25,339
You don’t have to worry about Princess Patt getting suspicious about the ring anymore.

231
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:29,003
What did you do?

232
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:31,675
I already asked Prik to take care of it.

233
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:35,019
Prik is so smart. She probably finished carrying out the plan by now.

234
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:37,675
What plan?

235
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:59,579
Oh, let me bring it to her.

236
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,499
Please let me help, Your Highness.

237
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:12,347
Yes.

238
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:35,691
Is that your ring, Prik?

239
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:44,411
Yes, Your Highness. Princess Anin gave it to me. It is so lovely.

240
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:47,611
Why do you wear it on your ring finger then?

241
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:49,819
Do you know the meaning of it?

242
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:56,315
Yes, Your Highness. But the princess insisted I must put it on this finger…

243
00:33:56,459 --> 00:34:00,283
so that none of the men will try to pursue me.

244
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:02,683
And that I can stay with her until I get old.

245
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:05,547
Is that so?

246
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:09,483
Yes, Your Highness. Lady Pin also got one too.

247
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:19,787
How odd. She even gave you such a valuable gift.

248
00:34:21,403 --> 00:34:23,899
I never saw you wearing it before the trip to Hua Hin though.

249
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:26,843
When did she give it to you?

250
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,163
It is not unusual at all, Princess.

251
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,379
Anin has always been unpredictable since she was young.

252
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:38,683
She probably feels possessive of her people.

253
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,819
She is afraid her favourite lackey would leave her to get married.

254
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:45,963
So, the princess is afraid of losing her favorite maid.

255
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,283
Is that correct, Prik?

256
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:52,043
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,155
Princess!

258
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:15,931
Your Highness.

259
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:19,515
How did it go? Did she believe you?

260
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:23,659
Of course, you can count on me, Your Highness.

261
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:26,107
Hmmmm

262
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,515
Did she not find it suspicious at all?

263
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:33,403
She did at first, Your Highness.

264
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:36,075
But fortunately, Prince Anan had come to my rescue.

265
00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:39,515
So, Princess Pattimika finally believed it, Your Highness.

266
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:44,587
My brother came to your rescue?

267
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:46,123
Yes, Your Highness.

268
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:22,411
What is it?

269
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:40,507
Are you going to come in?

270
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:58,923
Is there anything you want to talk to me?

271
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:08,635
You already knew about me and Lady Pin, didn’t you?

272
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,131
About what?

273
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:19,003
Prik told me you had saved her from answering Princess Patt about the ring.

274
00:37:30,011 --> 00:37:31,131
Yes?

275
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:50,987
Then, why did you not say anything or try to stop me?

276
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:56,155
Because I know I could never stop you.

277
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:04,331
It’s love. How can you stop it?

278
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,811
I truly understand and never wish to stop you.

279
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:16,459
But I am quite worried.

280
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,595
I’m worried what will happen after this.

281
00:38:28,315 --> 00:38:33,819
Are you fully aware that not everyone will agree with you?

282
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,059
Yes, I am.

283
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:48,139
I know that not everyone will be open-minded like you.

284
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:56,427
I will try my best to sort it out.

285
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:27,995
You should start preparing for your master’s degree now.

286
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:33,691
Stop seeing Lady Pin for a while, so that Princess Patt would feel less suspicious.

287
00:39:49,147 --> 00:39:53,323
Thank you for your understanding, Brother.

288
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:14,059
(Message in the letter)
I might not be able to see you that often from now on.

289
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:16,283
I must prepare for my master’s degree.

290
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,643
This will also make Princess Patt pay less attention to our relationship.

291
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:23,483
I truly hope you will understand. Please be patient and wait for me.

292
00:42:46,103 --> 00:42:50,343
(Many days later)

293
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:04,779
Has Lady Pin not gone to see Princess Anin lately?

294
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:09,835
Yes, Your Highness. She sometimes went to deliver supper.

295
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,331
But she has not seen the princess for many weeks now.

296
00:43:14,955 --> 00:43:17,659
The princess must be busy preparing for her master’s degree.

297
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:21,579
Yes, Your Highness. I do not understand why she would do that though.

298
00:43:21,595 --> 00:43:23,771
She must eventually get married anyway.

299
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:29,531
This is a modern world now. Whether a lady or a man,
one must place an importance on the education.

300
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:31,867
So that no one can take advantage on you.

301
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:33,963
Yes, Your Highness.

302
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:07,227
My lady.

303
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,571
Are you bringing supper for the princess, my lady?

304
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:27,275
Is the princess going to be late again today?

305
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:29,883
Yes, my lady.

306
00:44:39,899 --> 00:44:43,755
Then, I’m afraid my dumplings would be left untouched as usual.

307
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:50,187
I will take care of them, my lady.

308
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:57,083
Eat as much as you want. It is better than throwing it away.

309
00:44:57,899 --> 00:45:01,435
It seems the person whom I made it for is not going to eat it.

310
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:05,083
Are you upset, my lady?

311
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:10,747
We live under the same roof, but I have not seen her face for weeks.

312
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:15,083
When she came to say goodbye, I did not think she would be this busy.

313
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:17,339
Nor did I think we must be parted for this long.

314
00:45:19,163 --> 00:45:22,747
A little distance would make you miss each other more, my lady.

315
00:45:22,907 --> 00:45:27,243
Princess Patt will also feel less suspicious of you and the princess too.

316
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:33,899
Never mind then. You are sure to take your master’s side in the end. I’m leaving.

317
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:56,891
What a luck indeed, Prik.

318
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:03,035
What are you eating?

319
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:12,107
I’m also hunger. Let me have some too.

320
00:46:12,475 --> 00:46:14,043
I’m so famished.

321
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:21,659
My apology, Your Highness.

322
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:23,771
There are only 3 or 4 dumplings left.

323
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:26,811
I was eating quite fast earlier, Your Highness.

324
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,851
Delicious.

325
00:46:41,227 --> 00:46:42,331
Do you want it?

326
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,323
Here, eat it.

327
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:56,683
Your Highness! Don’t you know it is a sin to torture someone with hunger?

328
00:46:58,267 --> 00:46:59,515
But I’m hungry.

329
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,555
The dumplings are utterly to my liking.

330
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:07,435
I believe Lady Pin made them herself for me as usual.

331
00:47:08,473 --> 00:47:12,059
That is clearly without a doubt, isn’t it, Your Highness?

332
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:16,491
You are so engrossed in your studies that you come home late every day.

333
00:47:16,507 --> 00:47:21,771
So, I have been very fortunate to finish all Lady Pin’s food for you in the past days, Your Highness.

334
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,315
Is she not mad at me then?

335
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:26,747
Of course, she is.

336
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:29,179
She complaints every day…

337
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:33,131
that, “She always come home late.”

338
00:47:33,123 --> 00:47:38,971
“I would surely die of hunger if I must wait for her return to have supper together.”

339
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:40,667
That is what she said, Your Highness.

340
00:47:42,635 --> 00:47:45,211
Now I know why I never saw her…

341
00:47:45,243 --> 00:47:47,203
whenever I came home.

342
00:47:47,203 --> 00:47:49,067
Nor did I get to have even a bite of my supper.

343
00:47:49,307 --> 00:47:50,539
You ate it all.

344
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:53,355
Don’t you know that I went to bed with my growling stomach every night?

345
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:56,315
Please mercy me, Your Highness.

346
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:58,043
I don’t want you to die.

347
00:47:58,043 --> 00:47:59,227
Are you worried about me, Your Highness?

348
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:01,211
I need you to do something for me.

349
00:48:01,203 --> 00:48:06,251
I knew it! Just say it, Your Highness.

350
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:11,103
Whether it is underwater or among the fire, I will do it for you.

351
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:12,059
Good.

352
00:48:18,571 --> 00:48:20,363
Please forgive me, my lady.

354
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:12,177
The Loyal Pin

355
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:28,285
Who is it?

356
00:49:28,653 --> 00:49:30,189
It’s Prik, my lady.

357
00:49:44,717 --> 00:49:47,517
A letter for you from Princess Anin, my lady.

358
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:56,173
I am home.

359
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:58,333
I haven’t seen you for many days.

360
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:34,061
Please give this to your princess.

361
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:39,661
Yes, my lady. I guess I must be marching back and forth several times tonight.

362
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:58,765
Is that a letter for me from Lady Pin?

363
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:01,469
You are a genius, Your Highness.

364
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,653
It’s good that you are back.

365
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:12,397
But does it have anything to do with me?

366
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:36,861
Prik.

367
00:51:37,293 --> 00:51:38,109
Yes, Your Highness.

368
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:40,541
Give this letter to Lady Pin.

369
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:44,797
There, I knew it.

370
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:46,301
What did you say?

371
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:48,797
Nothing, Your Highness.

372
00:52:00,893 --> 00:52:02,077
Again?

373
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:06,173
Yes, my lady. I’m afraid it would be like this all night.

374
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:08,167
She is acting like a child.

375
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,597
Here it is, my lady.

376
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:16,909
Of course, it does.

377
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:22,605
I miss you so much that my heart aches.

378
00:52:28,237 --> 00:52:29,741
Why are you smiling, my lady?

379
00:52:30,893 --> 00:52:33,565
You can go back now. It’s late. I’m going to rest.

380
00:52:35,581 --> 00:52:37,645
Do you not have a reply letter for the princess, my lady?

381
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:39,405
No.

382
00:52:41,213 --> 00:52:42,349
Are you sure?

383
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,141
Yes. Now, go.

384
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:48,605
What a relief. Now I don’t have to keep walking back and forth all night long.

385
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,037
Did she not give you any letter?

386
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:05,885
No, Your Highness.

387
00:53:06,397 --> 00:53:07,309
Why?

388
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:09,981
I don’t know, Your Highness.

389
00:53:19,565 --> 00:53:22,605
Let’s do this then.

390
00:53:24,093 --> 00:53:29,725
If you strictly follow my order, I am certain
that I will receive not just a letter this time.

391
00:53:35,741 --> 00:53:36,621
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:08,877
It’s really you.

393
00:54:09,725 --> 00:54:13,933
I haven’t seen you for many days. Don’t make such a grumpy face.

394
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:15,997
Please come in.

395
00:54:15,997 --> 00:54:17,389
I’m mad at you.

396
00:54:19,773 --> 00:54:20,653
You are?

397
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:24,813
I am seriously mad at you this time.

398
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:30,045
Is it because I often come home late these days?

399
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:32,957
That too. But that’s not all.

400
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:42,269
Is she not giving up yet?

401
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:45,405
No, my lady.

402
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:48,685
Where is the letter then?

403
00:54:50,397 --> 00:54:53,325
Please forgive me, my lady.

404
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:55,405
Her Highness has asked me to deliver this to you.

405
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:11,149
I’m angry because you asked Prik to kiss me on the cheek.

406
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,229
I didn’t ask her to kiss you.

407
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:17,181
I asked her to give you a kiss for me.

408
00:55:17,373 --> 00:55:21,629
That is unacceptable too. My cheeks are only reserved for you.

409
00:55:21,629 --> 00:55:25,421
I’m really mad at you for asking her to do that to me.

410
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:34,349
Then, what could I do to make it up to you?

411
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:49,869
Or do you want to ask Prik to kiss me back so that we will be even?

412
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:52,541
Anin!

413
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:55,373
I’m sorry.

414
00:55:57,085 --> 00:56:02,637
Apart from me, you must never let anyone touch your cheeks.

415
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:17,485
If I keep kissing on the same spot that Prik kissed you,

416
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:19,901
will you forgive me?

417
00:56:25,229 --> 00:56:30,365
If you keep doing that, I might forgive you.

418
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,061
But…

419
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,357
But what?

420
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:46,909
But if tonight, you do more than just kissing…

421
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:54,445
Perhaps, I might forgive you much sooner.

422
00:56:57,773 --> 00:57:01,341
Then, let’s not waste our time here.

423
01:00:02,877 --> 01:00:05,645
You are quite reckless, Your Highness.

424
01:00:06,701 --> 01:00:07,853
How reckless?

425
01:00:10,061 --> 01:00:12,589
You asked Lady Pin to stay here with you all night.

426
01:00:12,605 --> 01:00:16,349
If Princess Pattamika found out that Lady Pin did not stay at the Lotus Palace last night…

427
01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:18,557
wouldn’t she feel more suspicious, Your Highness?

428
01:00:20,269 --> 01:00:21,821
Oh, she wouldn’t.

429
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:24,573
My brother already helped talking to her last time, didn’t he?

430
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:30,253
It’s very fortunate that the one who found out is Prince Anan…

431
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:32,189
who is open-minded and doesn’t seem to mind it.

432
01:00:32,365 --> 01:00:36,861
But if someone else with an ill wish has found out,
you will surely be in trouble, Your Highness.

433
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,597
I know. I will be more careful next time.

434
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:47,933
What is it?

435
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:50,909
Your Highness, Miss Aon has requested for your audience.

436
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:11,709
Miss Aon.

437
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:19,261
Why would you like to see me?

438
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:27,981
Your Highness. You probably know that I have had feelings for you since high school.

439
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:33,517
Have we not talked about this already?

440
01:01:34,621 --> 01:01:35,661
Yes, Your Highness.

441
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:39,597
I had tried to forget you and move on.

442
01:01:41,229 --> 01:01:48,109
But after Hua Hin trip, I could never remove you from my mind even for a minute.

443
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:56,685
I already told you that we can never love each other like that.

444
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,509
If my relationship with you is a taboo,

445
01:02:03,277 --> 01:02:06,237
then your relationship with Lady Pin will also end up the same, Your Highness.

446
01:02:12,077 --> 01:02:14,029
You knew about me and Lady Pin?

447
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:16,941
Yes, Your Highness.

448
01:02:50,189 --> 01:02:54,541
If you don’t break up with her, I will tell everyone about it.

449
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:09,737
The Loyal Pin

450
01:03:09,737 --> 01:03:14,617
I want you to accompany me to attend the Duke of Rahm’s banquet at the Chao Fah Palace.

451
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,469
I have prepared only 5 rooms for the guests, Your Highness.

452
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:20,737
Then, l can stay in the same room with Lady Pin.

453
01:03:20,909 --> 01:03:24,349
She can stay with me, Princess. Please don’t let it bother you.

454
01:03:24,377 --> 01:03:27,805
You said this morning that you did not want to sleep alone.

455
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:31,497
Since Lady Pin is not here, would you like me to stay with you instead?

456
01:03:31,497 --> 01:03:34,697
Please stop, Anin. I cannot hear it any longer.

457
01:03:34,957 --> 01:03:37,117
You are not mad at me, are you?

458
01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:40,109
Are you here to see Uangfah?

459
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,725
Is she home, Your Highness?

460
01:03:42,013 --> 01:03:44,093
Are you new here? What is your name?

461
01:03:45,469 --> 01:03:46,221
Wait.

462
01:03:46,217 --> 01:03:47,549
Is there a problem here?

463
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:59,297
🎵Nobody might know what it is…🎵

464
01:03:59,597 --> 01:04:08,909
🎵…that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you.🎵

465
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:15,101
🎵Nobody might agree with our love,🎵

466
01:04:15,277 --> 01:04:21,533
🎵But please be patient and always…🎵

467
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:31,629
🎵…wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite…🎵

468
01:04:31,629 --> 01:04:37,217
🎵…as we have promised each other that we’d wait…🎵

469
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:45,501
🎵…until that day🎵

470
01:04:45,837 --> 01:04:57,213
🎵Until that day I will hold you in my arms,🎵

471
01:04:57,207 --> 01:04:59,645
🎵Kissing you through the night.🎵

472
01:04:59,661 --> 01:05:09,937
🎵Can you wait for me, my baby?🎵

473
