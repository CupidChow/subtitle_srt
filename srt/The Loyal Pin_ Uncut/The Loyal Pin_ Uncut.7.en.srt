1
00:00:00,785 --> 00:00:02,640
I love you.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,432
I love you too.

3
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:06,743
Lady Pin.

4
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:08,040
Where have you been?

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,942
I stayed over at the Pine Palace last night, Your Highness.

6
00:00:10,942 --> 00:00:15,951
Savettawarit is a well-known family. Princess Anin must eventually get married one day.

7
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:17,310
Pin!

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,629
My lady! / - Pin!

9
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:20,010
Lady Pin!

10
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:25,601
Where is Princess Anin?

11
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:30,767
She has already left for England this morning, my lady.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,552
You had stayed in bed for many days…

13
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:40,329
that it is finally her return date, my lady.

14
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,271
Anin?

15
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:55,993
Anin.

16
00:00:57,488 --> 00:00:59,054
What’s wrong?

17
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,949
You haven’t left me yet, have you?

18
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:23,891
I’m still here. I’m not going anywhere.

19
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,933
Please don’t cry.

20
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:51,106
Do you still have a headache?

21
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:59,316
Being close to you…

22
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,497
I feel much better now.

23
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:25,574
I’m sorry for making you worried.

24
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,587
Please don’t blame yourself.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,148
I know you have tried your best to cope with it.

26
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,946
Then…

27
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:39,087
can you…

28
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,668
stay here with me tonight?

29
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,139
Yes. I will stay here and care for you all night.

30
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:54,271
But for now, you must try to eat something first.

31
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,890
The Loyal Pin

32
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,880
Please have some congee so that you can take your medicine.

33
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,400
I will only eat it if you feed me.

34
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,678
Of course, what would you like me to feed you with?

35
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:06,606
If you are not afraid that you’d catch a cold from me, then please do as you like.

36
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,706
Let’s use the spoon then.

37
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,517
What are you doing?

38
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,280
Wiping your mouth.

39
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,000
You had some congee on your lips.

40
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:44,970
Anin.

41
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:52,345
You no longer have a fever.

42
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,076
Was that how you checked my fever?

43
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,353
Yes.

44
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:07,935
Or do you want me to check it another way?

45
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:22,290
Lady Pin, are you feeling better?

46
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:27,623
Sitting outside like this, you might catch a cold again.

47
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,920
I feel much better now, Your Highness.

48
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,335
I’m glad to hear that.

49
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:37,005
Why are you not with Princess Anin today?

50
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,879
She will leave for England tomorrow.

51
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,195
The princess is spending time with her parents, Your Highness.

52
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:48,474
They probably want to spend as much time with their daughter before she goes away.

53
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,594
Your Highness.

54
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:06,537
Would you mind if I’d like to stay at the Pine Palace tonight?

55
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:09,834
I want to help the princess pack her luggage.

56
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:13,471
Please go. I wouldn’t mind at all.

57
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:16,596
You and her will be parted for another year or two.

58
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:18,728
Go and spend time with her while you can.

59
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:23,391
I have prepared all the necessary belongings you might need, Your Highness.

60
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,214
Yes.

61
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:35,018
I have also prepared an overcoat for you to put on when you arrive at the airport there.

62
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:37,871
All the medicines have been packed.

63
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:43,244
I can take care of myself. Please don’t worry, Pin.

64
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,843
How could I not?

65
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:54,040
I worry about you because I love you.

66
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,228
But I love you more.

67
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:05,226
Could you not let me love you more for just once?

68
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:07,903
Very well then.

69
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:43,498
I made this myself…with all my heart.

70
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:48,960
Please use it for your pillow.

71
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:54,791
So that every night, you would feel as if I were near.

72
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:07,827
It’s beautiful.

73
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:11,121
It seems I would be dreaming of you every night.

74
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,654
I heard Mr. Pranot say the other day that your charm has captivated many people’s hearts.

75
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:44,225
Whether Thai or foreigners, they are all trying to pursue you persistently.

76
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:46,829
I’m very worried.

77
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,222
Your charm is not so bad either.

78
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:55,459
Hopefully, you won’t be married to Master Kuea when I return from England.

79
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,428
I have already made myself clear to everyone.

80
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,000
What about you?

81
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,686
This time…

82
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:14,321
you must tell everyone that you are already taken.

83
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:17,768
Let me think about it.

84
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:27,800
Perhaps, I should leave my marks all over your body…

85
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:35,807
so that you won’t be naughty with anyone else while you are there.

86
00:10:39,353 --> 00:10:41,341
What are you waiting for?

87
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:08,133
Are you finally leaving today, my princess?

88
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:19,115
Is this meal the last meal that I could prepare for you, Your Highness?

89
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,376
Prik.

90
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:24,760
I’m not dying. I’m going there to study.

91
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,540
And it will only be just a while.

92
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,994
But I’m sad, Your Highness.

93
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,128
If I am this sad,

94
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,848
I cannot imagine how terrible Lady Pin might feel.

95
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,794
Will she not come to see you off, Your Highness?

96
00:12:57,794 --> 00:13:00,657
I have not seen her since this morning.

97
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:11,299
She already told me she would not come to see me off.

98
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:15,133
She does not want to see me leave.

99
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:39,370
Why are you still awake?

100
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:50,591
I’m afraid I’m not strong enough to see you off tomorrow.

101
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,817
I don’t want to see you leave.

102
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,179
Pin.

103
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:11,345
Tonight will be the last night that I can stay close to you.

104
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,692
I don’t want to close my eyes.

105
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:22,563
I want to keep looking at you like this.

106
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,751
How I wish you’d never have to leave.

107
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,274
I don’t want you to leave.

108
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:49,889
It won’t be long.

109
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,483
Soon, I will come back to you.

110
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,811
Please wait for me.

111
00:15:24,496 --> 00:15:25,774
Let’s go.

112
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,927
Yes.

113
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,848
Do you know Miss Aon too, Lady Pin?

114
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:43,537
Even from afar, I could tell that she is smitten with you and likes you more than friends.

115
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:45,751
Please don’t pretend you don’t know it.

116
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,480
The Loyal Pin

117
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:15,454
The Loyal Pin

118
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:31,315
[1 week later]

119
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:44,318
Do you know what the name ‘Anilaphat’ means, Lady Pin?

120
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:54,619
It means a beautiful wind, Your Highness.

121
00:18:56,939 --> 00:19:00,929
Have you ever seen the wind standing still at one place?

122
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,210
Never, Your Highness.

123
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:08,529
Then please don’t be sad.

124
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:14,068
Soon, the wind will return and start to blow in this direction again.

125
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:23,483
I will wait for the wind to return.

126
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:26,774
May this wind carry my thought to you, Anin.

127
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:59,158
I must return home tomorrow. Please take good care of yourself.

128
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:02,431
Surely, it must be lonely without you.

129
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:07,464
Oh, you will never be lonely, Princess. You have a lot of friends here.

130
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,078
Please look after her for me, Pranot.

131
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,915
Don’t worry, Your Highness. I will take very good care of her.

132
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:24,419
Although, I’m afraid Her Highness already has plenty of people who would like to take care her.

133
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,982
I never want anyone to take care of me.

134
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:30,551
I only want to get them out of my sight.

135
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:34,996
Who is it? Who dares to bother you, Anin?

136
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:37,261
Hundreds of them, Your Highness.

137
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:43,380
Tell me their names. I will get rid of them for you.

138
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,950
It would be very kind of you to do me such a favour, Brother.

139
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:17,161
Please allow me to sit with you, Your Highness.

140
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:24,818
I haven’t seen you for quite a while. How I really miss you.

141
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:32,333
Your Highness.

142
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:38,166
Do you know what qualifications one should have to call themselves suitable enough for Princess Anin?

143
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:45,474
(여자와 동등하거나 그 이상에 있어야죠.)
They should be equal to or higher position than her.

144
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:51,547
If she has to leave her position in order to marry them, I cannot accept it.

145
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:55,645
So, don’t mess with her. Get out!

146
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:06,829
Thank you.

147
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,809
Is that all?

148
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:19,164
Are there still any men, whether Asian or Westerners, who wish to pursue you, my dear sister?

149
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,070
There are, Your Highness.

150
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,161
What?

151
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:24,111
There are more?

152
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:26,244
Why are there so many of them?

153
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,053
Those are not so hard to handle.

154
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:32,805
How do you handle them?

155
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:38,827
Although they like me, they never dare to bother me.

156
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:41,227
All I have to do is ignore them.

157
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,629
Hearing that made me worried how I would face Father when I go back.

158
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:49,007
Perhaps,

159
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:53,448
you are not interested in anyone yet, are you?

160
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:57,376
Not at all. Please don’t worry.

161
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:04,517
I have always known that you are very charming and attractive.

162
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:07,804
But I never thought it would be this much.

163
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,067
Good.

164
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:18,035
You once said you wish to have a daughter like Princess Anin.
Maybe you would want to reconsider it, Your Highness.

165
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:25,821
If I were to have a daughter like Anin, I must have been suffering from strokes almost every single day.

166
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,420
Prince Anan has gotten rid of most of them for you.

167
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:40,849
But there is still another one.

168
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,640
What do you mean?

169
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,347
It’s Miss Aon Arisara, the ambassador’s daughter – your childhood friend, Your Highness.

170
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:50,610
This one is quite tough to handle.

171
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,428
But she never says she likes me.

172
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:59,138
Even from afar, I could tell that she is smitten with you and likes you more than friends.

173
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:01,329
Please don’t pretend you don’t know it.

174
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:05,393
But you haven’t told anyone yet that I am here, have you?

175
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:06,911
I’d like to have some time to myself.

176
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:08,286
Princess!

177
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:15,596
Miss Aon Arisara.

178
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,987
I’m afraid it’s too late.

179
00:25:17,987 --> 00:25:20,006
Goodbye, Your Highness.

180
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:38,059
Please don’t worry, my lady.

181
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:45,824
I heard Prince Anan said that Mr. Pranot and Miss Aon, the ambassador daughter,
are taking great care of the princess while she is there.

182
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,503
I beg your pardon?

183
00:25:48,973 --> 00:25:51,852
Miss Aon is also in England?

184
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:54,689
Do you know her too, my lady?

185
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:59,901
Of course, I know her well.

186
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:03,547
She used to study in the same school as the princess and me.

187
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:11,229
I was very lonely while you were away, Your Highness.

188
00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:14,289
You were?

189
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:15,776
Yes.

190
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:19,009
I miss you very dearly.

191
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:24,283
What brings you here to see me today?

192
00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:30,708
I’d like to invite you to have dinner and stay over at my place this Saturday, Your Highness.

193
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:37,456
I just came back from Thailand and had a lot of Thai food there.

194
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:39,764
I’m afraid I must turn you down this time.

195
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:44,529
I’ll let my mother know you cannot come, Your Highness.

196
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:51,847
Why are you worried that Miss Aon is with the princess, my lady?

197
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:03,352
Miss Aon has become besotted with the princess since when we were in school.

198
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:08,058
And she always gets what she wants.

199
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,794
She never gives up easily.

200
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,632
Then, can I stay over tonight, Your Highness?

201
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:20,869
I have not seen you for a while. There are many things I’d like to tell you.

202
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:25,609
Yes.

203
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,860
Have this, Your Highness.

204
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:38,049
Will she be safe then, my lady?

205
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:40,609
I don’t know.

206
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,529
Miss Aon.

207
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:54,074
Miss Aon!

208
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:57,875
Can you please accept my love for you, Your Highness?

209
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,561
Let me go!

210
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,357
I have loved you for so long. Have you never known, Your Highness?

211
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:07,286
Let go!

212
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,724
Princess!

213
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:10,908
Your Highness.

214
00:28:10,908 --> 00:28:12,286
Your Highness.

215
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:18,051
Why are you doing this?

216
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,901
Because I love you.

217
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,444
I love you so much.

218
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:24,684
I have always loved you.

219
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,627
But we cannot love each other like that.

220
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:36,627
Also, I only see you as a friend. I never think of you more than that.

221
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:44,177
If you still want to be my friend, don’t ever do this again.

222
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,907
My lady.

223
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:16,809
Master Kuea is here to see you.

224
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,014
Again?

225
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:22,685
Please tell him I am studying.

226
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:31,428
If you refuse to see him again, I’m afraid Princess Pattamika might be upset, my lady.

227
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:34,706
She seems to be very fond of him.

228
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:41,829
Then please tell him to wait. I’ll be with him shortly.

229
00:29:42,036 --> 00:29:43,192
Yes, my lady.

230
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:03,637
Prik.

231
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,809
Hasn’t Lady Pin arrived yet?

232
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,641
Well, she is…

233
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,210
Lady Pin.

234
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:16,637
Were you busy studying?

235
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:18,329
Yes.

236
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:25,731
Why would you like to see me?

237
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:28,317
Well…

238
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:34,986
Please excuse me for being straightforward this time.

239
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,030
Yes.

240
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,401
Since you almost graduate from the university…

241
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:46,301
I’d have my father come to propose for your marriage after your graduation.

242
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:55,368
Propose me?

243
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:57,107
Yes.

244
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,283
My father asked me about my lover.

245
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:06,930
He probably wants me to get married soon.

246
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:12,182
So, I rushed here to tell you beforehand.

247
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:22,423
Do you know how I wish I could start a family with you by tomorrow or any day soon.

248
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:28,449
I’m afraid you have misunderstood something, Master Kuea.

249
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:31,524
What is it?

250
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:40,332
Should there be any sign that led you to mistake my hospitality for something else,

251
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,824
I truly apologise for it.

252
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,993
You don’t have to apologise.

253
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:49,066
You might not love me now.

254
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:51,845
But you might love me once we get married.

255
00:31:57,657 --> 00:32:01,272
Let me be straightforward then.

256
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:07,369
I do not like you, and I never will.

257
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:14,863
From now on, I do not want to see or talk to you again.

258
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:21,303
Please kindly remove yourself from my sight and never return.

259
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:38,806
Dear Pin, my everything.

260
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:05,889
The Loyal Pin

261
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:12,913
The Loyal Pin

262
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:22,650
[Many months later]

263
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,027
Here it is, my lady.

264
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,083
Is this all?

265
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:47,457
Yes, my lady. If you wish to receive more letters…

266
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:52,038
perhaps you should tell the princess to write to you more often.

267
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:56,863
Your princess will be smiling with triumph then.

268
00:33:57,366 --> 00:34:02,290
Oh, has she not won over your heart already, my lady?

269
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,171
Both your heart and your…

270
00:34:04,171 --> 00:34:04,842
Prik.

271
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:06,878
My apology, my lady.

272
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:13,307
What a bad mouth I have. Slap, slap, slap.

273
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:15,462
Do you need a hand?

274
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,620
No, my lady.

275
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,262
You are free to go now.

276
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:25,256
You’re dismissing me as if I were your dog.

277
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:28,162
I guess you do not want a parcel from me then.

278
00:34:28,162 --> 00:34:30,881
A parcel? Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

279
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:39,525
Well, you didn’t ask about it, my lady.

280
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:44,759
Do you really want me to be upset with you?

281
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:48,722
Give me the parcel.

282
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:53,403
Hmm, should I give it to you?

283
00:34:53,403 --> 00:34:59,665
If I do, will I be fortunate enough to eat something delicious, my lady?

284
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:02,830
Just tell me what you want to eat.

285
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,828
I will find some time to make it for you.

286
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:09,070
How fortunate I am, my lady.

287
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,716
Here you go.

288
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:16,790
Please don’t forget your promise, my lady.

289
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:30,634
[ 🎵 Nobody might know what it is… 🎵 ]

290
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:40,162
[ 🎵 ...that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you. 🎵 ]

291
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:46,429
[ 🎵 Nobody might agree with our love, 🎵 ]

292
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:52,668
[ 🎵 But please be patient and always… 🎵 ]

293
00:35:52,668 --> 00:36:02,728
[ 🎵 ...wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite … 🎵 ]

294
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:08,680
[ 🎵 ...as we have promised each other that we’d wait… 🎵 ]

295
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:16,441
[ 🎵 ...until that day 🎵 ]

296
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:21,625
[ 🎵 ...until that time 🎵 ]

297
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:26,158
Dear Pin, my everything.

298
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:30,097
First of all,

299
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:34,242
please accept the caress of my lips…

300
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:42,730
on your left cheek, right cheek, and your forehead.

301
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,629
Just like how we used to do.

302
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:11,046
These kisses might be as faint as the breeze…

303
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,872
for they have travelled a long way across the sea.

304
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:18,293
But they are full of love and longing…

305
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:22,975
that I have for you in every breath that I take.

306
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:34,350
I still miss you night and day, whether in my sleep or while I’m awake.

307
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:40,531
I’m always looking forward to seeing you, even if it is only in my dream.

308
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,642
If any night I hadn’t dreamt of you,

309
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:50,468
I would feel empty and hollow inside.

310
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,653
And couldn’t help blaming the destiny…

311
00:37:54,653 --> 00:38:00,619
for not allowing me to see you even in my dream.

312
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:08,563
I believe it is almost time for your graduation ceremony.

313
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:14,136
How unfortunate of me that I am unable to be there to congratulate you.

314
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:20,369
I could only wish that this gift I gave you would serve as my presence.

315
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:24,066
Please wear them and always keep them close.

316
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:27,080
I had them made especially for you.

317
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,598
On the back of the right stopper is an engrave of the letter P.

318
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:37,663
While on the left is an engrave of the letter A.

319
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:42,420
By now you should have been assured…

320
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,180
how I wish that we will always be together.

321
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,625
Please wear this pair of earrings on the day of your graduation ceremony.

322
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:59,966
So that I can also be a part of your celebration.

323
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:02,983
Can you do that for me?

324
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:05,815
As for the second gift,

325
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:12,067
I gave it to you to symbolize that…

326
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:16,359
you now have reached another step in life.

327
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:27,018
My dear Anin, I never wish you to please me with any valuable gifts.

328
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:31,309
All I want is for you to return to my arms.

329
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:38,173
Another year that I must wait for you seems like an eternity.

330
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:43,645
Every day, I will come into your bedroom…

331
00:39:44,055 --> 00:39:47,038
to lighten the weight of your absence in my heart.

332
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:53,676
I will imagine that you were still here.

333
00:39:53,676 --> 00:40:00,935
Being in your room has warmed me from within…

334
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:04,230
as if you were always here with me.

335
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:28,003
The weather there must be very cold by now, so I made this scarf for you.

336
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:34,246
I made it with my own hands, and with all the love…

337
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:37,246
that I have for you.

338
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:43,680
I truly hope that this scarf will keep you warm…

339
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:51,652
as if I were there to embrace you.

340
00:41:07,158 --> 00:41:10,199
[Many months later]

341
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,105
It has been almost a year now.

342
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,943
I am finally accepted to work as a translator for academic articles…

343
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:20,566
and young-adult fiction at Sailom publishing company.

344
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:24,948
The company is owned by Miss Pakaphan, Princess Patt’s friend.

345
00:41:25,558 --> 00:41:28,961
Miss Pakaphan agrees to let me work remotely from the palace…

346
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:32,396
as long as I can submit my work on time.

347
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:39,780
I also asked Thanit to apply for a proofreading job at this company.

348
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,023
He is the only friend that is still unemployed.

349
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:48,923
But please don’t worry. Although I am well aware that he has feelings for me,

350
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,767
I always ignore it and act oblivious.

351
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:55,346
Aren’t you going to change your mind and come to work full-time here?

352
00:41:55,346 --> 00:42:01,789
Why should I do that? Everything is already perfect as it is.

353
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:05,609
I know you would say that.

354
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,682
Then why did you even ask?

355
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:11,107
Why do you want me to work full-time here?

356
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,949
So that you would be my colleague.

357
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,620
Without you, the place feels quite empty and lonely.

358
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:23,780
Then please enjoy being lonely. I’m leaving now.

359
00:42:28,274 --> 00:42:29,928
Who is that, Your Highness?

360
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:34,590
Miss Orn, Ornnida Sawadhipat, an eldest daughter of His Excellency Thai ambassador in England.

361
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:38,448
I am only a Kasidit. I can never compare to them.

362
00:42:55,863 --> 00:43:00,398
The Loyal Pin

363
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:07,257
The Loyal Pin

364
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,800
(Car horn)

365
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:32,435
Whose car is this, Your Highness? Where is your driver?

366
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:37,817
I drove it myself. And this car is yours, Lady Pin.

367
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:40,640
My car?

368
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:45,683
Yes. I bought it for you since you must travel to the publishing company very often.

369
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:49,311
Now, you can go to work in this new car.

370
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:55,325
Why did you give me such a valuable gift, Your Highness?

371
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:01,069
You just graduated and started working.

372
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:03,440
It would be ignorant of me not to give you any gift.

373
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:14,576
The kindness that you always have for me is already much more than I could ever repay.

374
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:22,998
I love you like my own daughter.

375
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,534
I will always want the best of everything for you.

376
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,716
Thank you, Your Highness.

377
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:57,312
Who is that, Your Highness?

378
00:44:57,312 --> 00:45:00,161
That is Prince Arnon’s soon-to-be fiancée.

379
00:45:00,161 --> 00:45:02,449
Her name is Miss Orn – Ornnida Sawadhipat.

380
00:45:03,877 --> 00:45:07,264
She is the eldest daughter of His Excellency Thai ambassador in England.

381
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:15,339
Then she must be an older sister of Miss Aon, a close friend of Princess Anin.

382
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:20,297
She is probably here to discuss about the engagement which will be held soon.

383
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:45,520
Prik, do you perhaps know that Miss Orn – an older sister of Miss Aon – is going to be engaged with Prince Arnon?

384
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,013
Yes, my lady.

385
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:53,476
This means the princess and Miss Aon will become relatives.

386
00:45:53,959 --> 00:46:03,802
You are not fond of Miss Aon in the same way that you are not fond of Lady Uangfah, are you, my lady?

387
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:10,459
Savettawarit and Sawadhipat will soon become relatives.

388
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:15,707
The Darawan family is also her close relative as well.

389
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:19,843
I am only a Kasidit, a family of a lower ranking.

390
00:46:20,346 --> 00:46:23,017
I can never compare to them.

391
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:32,280
There is nothing wrong with being a Kasidit, my lady.

392
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:38,061
You speak as if you barely knew my princess.

393
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:42,081
For Princess Anilaphat,

394
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:50,079
Pilanthita Kasidit is incomparable and more precious than anyone in this world.

395
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:52,489
Do you think so?

396
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:59,263
Certainly, my lady. Her Highness only has eyes for you.

397
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:05,004
You are also a sweet talker like your master, Prik.

398
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:17,812
A good servant should know what her master wants. No one knows Princess Anin better than I do.

399
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:24,268
I miss her so much, Prik.

400
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:50,164
Your letters, my lady!

401
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:33,922
It’s been many months already, Prik.

402
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:38,126
Why has she stopped sending me letters?

403
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:44,994
She also did not come to attend Prince Arnon and Miss On’s engagement reception.

404
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:49,531
Her Highness will graduate in just a few more months.

405
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:54,893
She might want to return after her graduation, my lady.

406
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,598
Maybe.

407
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:01,423
Unless…

408
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,212
Unless what?

409
00:49:06,574 --> 00:49:12,010
Unless the princess has graduated earlier than expected, my lady.

410
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:18,889
If that is the case, she must have written to me already.

411
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:24,926
Please be patient, my lady. It’s only a few more months.

412
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:30,181
I know, Prik. I crossed off the calendar every day.

413
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:04,110
Come and eat it with me.

414
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:27,958
Happy Birthday!

415
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:48,249
I miss you so much, Anin.

416
00:51:13,252 --> 00:51:16,231
I miss you so much too.

417
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:42,676
[ 🎵 You are a diamond of the rarest kind 🎵 ]

418
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:49,888
[ 🎵 As sweet as the summer wild honey 🎵 ]

419
00:51:49,888 --> 00:51:57,599
[ 🎵 A drop of diamond twinkling in the sky 🎵 ]

420
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:05,557
[ 🎵 Has it fallen down from heaven? 🎵 ]

421
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:09,189
The Loyal Pin

422
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:11,819
Have you thought about what you want to do next?

423
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:12,539
Not yet.

424
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:17,099
Ha! Are you planning to be mischievous and spend all your time with Lady Pin?

425
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:21,385
From now on, we will be together forever.

426
00:52:21,385 --> 00:52:25,937
Are you sure that we will not be parted again?

427
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:28,864
Yes, I promise you.

428
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:34,267
Do you see, Prik? None of them are being genuine to the princess.

429
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:39,685
Tonight, you must be punished.

430
00:52:39,685 --> 00:52:41,752
How so?

431
00:54:12,356 --> 00:54:20,557
The Loyal Pin
