1
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:34,955
The Loyal Pin

2
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,194
You must marry Kueakiat.

3
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,459
Please have a look around first.

4
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,237
Yes.

5
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,690
I heard you have been grounded. So, I came to check on you.

6
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,647
Where did you go, Your Highness?

7
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:58,779
I went to discuss about your engagement with Kueakiat.

8
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:01,262
Why must you rush it?

9
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:03,496
What do you mean, Anin?

10
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,641
What I meant is…

11
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:12,097
should there be anyone who deserves to be with Lady Pin, that person is me.

12
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,618
Not Kueakiat.

13
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,176
What…

14
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,887
What is happening?

15
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:26,795
What is happening?

16
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:30,449
What is it? Anyone, please tell me.

17
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:34,648
Mother, please calm down.

18
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,297
I will try to talk to her.

19
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:40,980
Anin.

20
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:42,583
Anin.

21
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:50,448
It is time that you must give up.

22
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,220
How could I do that, Brother?

23
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:59,937
Do you expect me to stay quiet and watch someone else
taking what is mine away in despair?

24
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,106
But…

25
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:05,417
But Lady Pin is a lady just like you.

26
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,560
I do not see a way how you would live together…

27
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,538
as a marriage couple.

28
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:45,448
I do not need a marriage to put you to shame, Mother.

29
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:51,011
I only wish to stay with Lady Pin and grow old together.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,515
But you are a princess. One day, you must marry someone who is also from a royal family.

31
00:04:00,788 --> 00:04:04,562
Your father is looking for a suitable man for you.

32
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,534
In that case…

33
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,143
I will give up my title.

34
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,209
So that I can put an end to it.

35
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:26,920
Anin.

36
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,680
Anin! Did you know what you were saying?

37
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:38,290
Your Highness.

38
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:42,000
Please don’t say that.

39
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:46,029
Please don’t sacrifice yourself for me.

40
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:48,994
No.

41
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:52,279
We will go and live somewhere else together.

42
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:03,912
In that case…

43
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:12,925
I will marry him.

44
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:17,192
I will marry Master Kuea, Your Highness.

45
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,266
What are you saying?

46
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,626
Pin.

47
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:44,407
Don’t force yourself to act against your own will.

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,008
Please don’t sacrifice yourself for me.

49
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:58,812
No matter what, I will marry Master Kuea.

50
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:38,967
Anin!

51
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,657
Anin!

52
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:42,558
Anin!

53
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:49,306
Anin!

54
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:33,383
My lady!

55
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:36,823
She has gained consciousness, Your Highness.

56
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,711
How are you feeling?

57
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,121
Are you able to walk back to the Lotus Palace?

58
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,518
Please let me help, my lady.

59
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:23,947
Let me help you, my lady.

60
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,398
How is Anin?

61
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:50,860
She has been sitting like this for a while, Your Highness.

62
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:54,472
Let me take care of it.

63
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:55,920
Yes, Your Highness.

64
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:22,110
There you are. I have been looking everywhere for you.

65
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:29,473
Where else could I go?

66
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:39,432
I could only go as far as the wall of this palace would allow me to.

67
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:46,849
I’m sorry…

68
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:51,686
for unable to protect you earlier.

69
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,951
Please don’t blame yourself.

70
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:23,713
You did protect me but in your own way.

71
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,299
You are so kind.

72
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:33,289
But more than that…

73
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:39,698
you are the bravest person I have ever known.

74
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,846
What good would it do to be brave?

75
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:52,099
For in the end, Lady Pin will marry someone else.

76
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,612
She said that because she wanted to protect you.

77
00:12:03,068 --> 00:12:07,863
Protect me or my royal title?

78
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:17,800
I’m an outsider but I could still clearly see it.

79
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:23,490
That Lady Pin loves you more than she loves herself.

80
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:30,006
I used to think like that too.

81
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,351
But I am not quite certain now.

82
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,861
How is Mother?

83
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,207
Not so good.

84
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,615
She is sleeping at the moment.

85
00:12:56,188 --> 00:12:58,600
I am such an ungrateful child.

86
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:41,823
Anin.

87
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:59,592
Please forgive me, Mother. I was very rude to you earlier.

88
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:03,700
I would never be angry at you.

89
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,656
But please do not say that you will give up your title in front of me again.

90
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:09,825
Can you promise me, dear?

91
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:21,463
I almost stopped breathing when I heard you said that.

92
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:27,474
Do you not know that you are the apple of my and your father’s eyes?

93
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,880
I do know, Mother.

94
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:43,130
Should you and Father wish me to do anything,

95
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:49,040
however difficult it is, I am always willing to do it.

96
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:54,519
Even when you wanted me to go live abroad since when I was young…

97
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:57,208
I also did it for you.

98
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:03,795
But when I asked you to please grant me this one wish,

99
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:08,376
how come you could not give it to me?

100
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:16,152
Then, I do not see if my royal title would be of any use.

101
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:20,625
For I can never reach out and acquire whatever it is that I wish for.

102
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,959
But your wish is somehow unacceptable, dear.

103
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:35,274
How unacceptable?

104
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,100
Do you think it is so easy, Mother…

105
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,863
to finally find someone that I truly love?

106
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:51,551
Of course not.

107
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:55,347
But I do not see a way how it would be possible.

108
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:01,722
Please give up on her, dear.

109
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:24,917
I will give up on this love, only when you can find someone I truly love…

110
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:30,878
who is also of the same or higher rank.

111
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:41,022
Only then that I will allow myself to completely erase her from my heart.

112
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:50,357
Otherwise, never expect me to waste my time

113
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:54,907
and marry anyone for the rest of my life.

114
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:11,805
Will Lady Pin remove that ring during the engagement ceremony?

115
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:15,124
I do not want to remove it, Your Highness.

116
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,280
The Loyal Pin

117
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:50,220
The Loyal Pin

118
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,393
My lady.

119
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:25,979
Where are you going, my lady?

120
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,977
You are still looking quite pale.

121
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:29,835
My lady!

122
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,178
Whom are you looking for?

123
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,318
How is Princess Patt?

124
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:55,327
Did she also pass out like Mother?

125
00:18:55,946 --> 00:19:00,983
No. She was calm and well-composed more than any of us…

126
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,661
amidst Mother’s request for an inhaler…

127
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:08,634
and Lady Pin’s devastating cry of despair.

128
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,794
Was she crying that hard?

129
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:16,861
You should know…

130
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,335
that after you left that room,

131
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:24,437
Lady Pin kept crying until she fainted.

132
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,125
Is that so?

133
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,088
Yes.

134
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:34,313
I had to carry her to the sofa.

135
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:38,175
Princess Patt had to stay by her side to take care of her.

136
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:48,891
If you are this worried,

137
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,055
you should go and check on her.

138
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,335
I’d rather not.

139
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:55,699
Anin.

140
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,670
You already decided to marry Kueakiat.

141
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:08,526
Why would you come here again?

142
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:20,424
I did it because of you, Anin. I do not want you to give up your title for me.

143
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,826
I do not care about the title.

144
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:30,244
Please don’t be mad at me.

145
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,965
How could I not?

146
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:44,215
I have done everything I could to fight for our love.

147
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:48,935
But you just gave up on it so easily.

148
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:53,898
How can you still call it love?

149
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,957
It’s all my fault.

150
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:10,624
Can you please forgive me?

151
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:22,751
I am human just like you.

152
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,187
I have a heart, all flesh and blood.

153
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:29,162
I can feel pain as much as you do.

154
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:39,916
Then, please don’t endure the pain for me anymore.

155
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,575
Please understand why I must do this.

156
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:47,260
Understand it?

157
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:08,607
Please don’t go.

158
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,822
Let me go.

159
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,993
No.

160
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,307
I do not want to see your face ever again.

161
00:25:23,518 --> 00:25:25,854
What on earth is going on?

162
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:35,416
I agree. Prik, must Lady Pin really marry Master Kuea?

163
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:43,970
I guess so. How is the princess doing?

164
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:49,626
Terrible. Only confines herself in the room and cries.

165
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:53,112
How is Lady Pin doing?

166
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:56,732
Quite like the princess.

167
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:02,676
What should we do then?

168
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,527
Let it be.

169
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,591
Anin.

170
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,767
I thought you said you would go back to the Pine Palace.
Why did you come back?

171
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:47,455
From this day forward, I will be staying here with you, Mother.

172
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:53,510
Really? I am so glad to hear that.

173
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,385
Come and sleep in my room then.

174
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:59,228
I will ask Prik to pack all your necessary belongings and bring them here.

175
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:00,959
Yes, Mother.

176
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:06,957
Let’s have dinner together today.

177
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:10,718
I will have our servants prepare the food you like.

178
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:12,655
Yes, Mother.

179
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,441
Father.

180
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:37,638
You came home quite late today.

181
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:44,191
I took Miss Orn to attend to business and dropped her off afterwards
like what most lovers often do, Father.

182
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:49,776
How lucky that everyone is present for dinner today.

183
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:51,275
Anin is also here.

184
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:54,531
There must be pleasant news to celebrate today, mustn’t it?

185
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:02,756
I believe the rumour about Lady Pin must be true then.

186
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:11,438
What rumour, Your Highness?

187
00:28:11,438 --> 00:28:15,525
About Lady Pin going to marry Kueakiat, of course.

188
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,232
Is that true, Your Highness?

189
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:19,175
Yes.

190
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:22,821
Kueakiat has been boasting about it to everyone in the ministry…

191
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:24,703
that he will get married soon.

192
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:30,180
Yes, Princess Patt already informed me today.

193
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,601
If Lady Pin is to get married, Anin will surely be very lonely.

194
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,615
Perhaps, you should also get married too.

195
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:49,658
I never wish to do that.

196
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:58,432
I am full. Please excuse me then.

197
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:03,913
Anin.

198
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,797
Why is she upset so easily today, Brother?

199
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:14,131
She is not feeling well today.

200
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:24,567
It is not something serious. Let’s eat.

201
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,068
Yes, Mother.

202
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:45,578
Please eat something, Your Highness.

203
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,335
Just leave it.

204
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:08,314
I have also brought you your personal belongings from the Pine Palace.

205
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:12,514
How long do you plan to stay here, Your Highness?

206
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:18,965
Maybe until the engagement ceremony at the Lotus Palace is done.

207
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,815
I do not want to see her with someone else.

208
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,557
Nor do I want to see her face.

209
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,992
Prik.

210
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,617
Why are you crying? It should be me who cries.

211
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:10,283
My heart aches for you, my princess. I can feel your pain.

212
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:14,487
Oh dear.

213
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,154
My princess.

214
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:24,817
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

215
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,775
It was all because of me.

216
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,468
[1 Week later]

217
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:44,095
Is it true that His Highness has allowed us to arrange the engagement at the front palace, Your Highness?

218
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:45,399
Yes

219
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,969
How very kind of him.

220
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:53,926
But will Princess Anin who is now staying at the front palace agree with this, Your Highness?

221
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:59,074
His Highness still does not know about Anin and Lady Pin.

222
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,845
I also do not know how to tell him.

223
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:12,278
Please worry not, my dear.

224
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,960
This is Anin’s problem which she must cope with it herself.

225
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:20,994
Please kindly accept my sincere apology, Your Highness.

226
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:25,248
My niece has put your family name to disgrace.

227
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:33,369
There is no need to apologize. It is the nature of love that can never be forced or confined.

228
00:32:34,632 --> 00:32:36,015
Yes, Your Highness.

229
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:44,740
I have informed all the servants and instructed them on how to prepare for the engagement ceremony.

230
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,710
Should you need anything, do feel free to let me know.

231
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,841
Thank you, Your Highness.

232
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:04,691
Regarding the engagement, His Highness has kindly allowed us
to arrange the ceremony at the front palace.

233
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:07,801
His Highness is surely very caring towards Lady Pin.

234
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:18,001
Will you also remove that ring on your ring finger during the engagement ceremony?

235
00:33:27,957 --> 00:33:30,915
Lady Pin has kept this ring on her finger for quite a while.

236
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:33,649
I’m afraid she might not want to remove it.

237
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:42,085
I do not want to remove it, Your Highness.

238
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:51,398
So, am I to put another ring on your ring finger, Lady Pin?

239
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:03,452
Yes, let’s do that.

240
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:06,666
I believe it is not something unusual at all.

241
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:15,554
In fact, it looks quite fashionable to me like what the Westerners often do.

242
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:25,224
Then, let’s not go against her will, Your Highness.

243
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:30,587
How embarrassing it is…

244
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:38,275
that my ring seems to be of very little value and elegance when compared to her own ring.

245
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:43,085
Then I’m afraid it must be your duty…

246
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:47,511
to find a better ring to replace the one on her finger.

247
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:54,646
Or else, I’m afraid it shall be as we have agreed.

248
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,736
In that case…

249
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:11,652
I shall let her keep wearing that ring during our engagement ceremony, Your Highness.

250
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:15,320
Very well then.

251
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:18,327
Just put your ring over her own on the same finger.

252
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:23,153
Let’s not force her to go against her will and remove it.

253
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,614
Yes, Your Highness.

254
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:39,585
Thank you, Your Highness, for not forcing me to do it.

255
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:45,247
แค่หญิงปิ่นทำตามที่อาขอ เรื่องอื่นอาก็ยินดีตามใจหญิงปิ่น
- You already agreed to do as I requested. For other things else, I am willing to let you do as you like.

256
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:46,998
Thank you, Your Highness.

257
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:54,376
Must the engagement ceremony be arranged at the front palace, Your Highness?

258
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:58,027
Yes, it is upon His Highness’s request.

259
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:01,186
We must make our preparations there.

260
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:07,342
I understand if you would find it discomforting.

261
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:09,819
I will take care of it for you.

262
00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:16,560
Not at all, Your Highness. I can be there.

263
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,087
When is the engagement ceremony?

264
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:37,420
This Sunday, Your Highness.

265
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:15,615
The Loyal Pin

266
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:22,563
The Loyal Pin

267
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:51,967
Your Highness, have you been informed that Lady Pin’s engagement
will be arranged at the front palace?

268
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,908
Here?

269
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,145
Yes, Your Highness. It is upon your father’s request.

270
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:15,735
Suddenly, I feel that this Savettawarit grand palace…

271
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:19,314
no longer has any space left for me to stand.

272
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:28,920
Why don’t you go and stay at the Pine Palace during this time, Your Highness?

273
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:36,469
I can’t do that, Prik. Mother has been coming to sleep with me every night lately.

274
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,998
She barely lets me stay far from her sight.

275
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:43,898
Should we start building the South Palace then, Your Highness?

276
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,734
His Highness has intended to have it built for you anyway.

277
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:53,375
If Kueakiat is to come and live at the Lotus Palace after the wedding,

278
00:38:54,664 --> 00:39:00,031
I’m afraid I won’t be able to stay at the Pine Palace for I couldn’t bear seeing them together.

279
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,628
I’d rather give the Pine Palace to you.

280
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:12,865
Oh, I don’t want it, Your Highness. I will only stay wherever you stay.

281
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:21,232
Thank you, Prik, for not leaving me.

282
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:28,054
But I’m afraid it won’t be anytime soon. I have yet come up with the design.

283
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:34,587
No hurry at all, Your Highness. I can wait.

284
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:45,081
When is the engagement ceremony? Have they set the date?

285
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,387
Well…

286
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,640
When is it?

287
00:39:56,896 --> 00:40:01,613
It’s this approaching Sunday, Your Highness.

288
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:23,566
Anin, come down now!

289
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:27,112
Or else, I will go tell Princess Patt.

290
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:09,846
You can place it inside.

291
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:16,503
Please add some pink flowers for me.

292
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:20,359
Put those chairs on the left.

293
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:24,122
Do separate the trays after cleaning them.

294
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:25,156
Yes, Your Highness.

295
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:37,839
You have locked yourself up here for many days already, Your Highness.

296
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:46,781
I do not want to see Lady Pin.

297
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:51,648
Where is she?

298
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:55,572
She is arranging flowers downstairs, Your Highness.

299
00:43:59,826 --> 00:44:02,183
If I were still a little kid…

300
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,172
who kept doing mischievous things with Prik,

301
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:11,588
I would have tied a bed sheet around the bed post…

302
00:44:11,975 --> 00:44:15,027
and go downstairs through the window.

303
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:23,841
So that I would not have to walk past the parlour.

304
00:44:25,216 --> 00:44:27,665
You can just go downstairs normally…

305
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:32,056
without looking her way, Your Highness.

306
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:38,858
I could never pretend that she was not here, Prik.

307
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:43,187
For all my life, this pair of eyes…

308
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:47,108
has always been drawn towards that person.

309
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:52,959
My poor princess.

310
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,334
As long as that person is still down there,

311
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,247
I will only stay up here.

312
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:14,765
Then, I will go bring you something to eat, Your Highness.

313
00:45:17,429 --> 00:45:19,323
I’m not hunger at all.

314
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:25,171
But you did not eat anything this morning, Your Highness.

315
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:27,665
And yesterday evening too.

316
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:36,560
I do not have any appetite, Prik.

317
00:45:43,522 --> 00:45:46,471
Please eat something, Your Highness.

318
00:46:29,898 --> 00:46:33,676
Pia, where are you going?

319
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:38,804
I am going to bring some snacks for Princess Anin, Your Highness.

320
00:46:39,126 --> 00:46:43,269
Shouldn’t you bring her a meal rather than snacks at this hour?

321
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,252
The princess only wishes to have some snacks, Your Highness.

322
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,287
She said she could barely eat anything lately.

323
00:46:53,629 --> 00:47:01,492
Then please ask her if she wishes to eat anything in particular, I shall make it for her myself.

324
00:47:01,492 --> 00:47:02,681
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:18,983
Loving someone whom you are not allowed to love is very painful indeed.

326
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:23,457
I used to be like that too.

327
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:31,984
But as time goes by, you will become stronger. Trust me.

328
00:49:41,264 --> 00:49:47,078
Please let it out. No one shall call you weak for crying.

329
00:49:53,405 --> 00:49:55,095
It’s all right, Anin.

330
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:56,889
Everything will be all right.

331
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:02,395
I lost to Kueakiat.

332
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:10,535
Why would you say that?

333
00:50:11,223 --> 00:50:13,642
You are superior to him in every way.

334
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:20,506
Because he is a man.

335
00:50:20,506 --> 00:50:22,738
That is why I lost to him.

336
00:50:29,622 --> 00:50:33,940
How can that make him better than you?

337
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:38,842
As long as Lady Pin’s heart still belongs to you,

338
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:42,377
you will forever be better than him.

339
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,437
What good would it do to have won over her heart?

340
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:53,194
When in the end, she will be with someone else.

341
00:51:14,394 --> 00:51:19,427
I give you this silver pin in hopes that it will reunite and be together with the golden pin…

342
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:22,875
like how they used to be.

343
00:51:54,398 --> 00:52:01,225
The Loyal Pin

344
00:52:01,275 --> 00:52:08,154
The Loyal Pin

345
00:52:43,113 --> 00:52:44,593
How gorgeous.

346
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:49,052
There they are.

347
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,974
Thank you, everyone.

348
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:53,618
Thank you.

349
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:02,854
You look stunningly beautiful today.

350
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:08,184
Please wait a moment. It is almost time.

351
00:53:10,514 --> 00:53:12,127
Father.

352
00:53:26,297 --> 00:53:28,139
Good morning, everyone.

353
00:53:28,934 --> 00:53:30,825
Thank you for your attendance.

354
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,539
Prince Kobkiat.

355
00:53:35,923 --> 00:53:37,275
Your Highness.

356
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:40,927
Congratulations, Kueakiat.

357
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,106
Yes, Your Highness.

358
00:53:45,668 --> 00:53:48,683
Please have a seat first.

359
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,158
Please come inside.

360
00:54:03,951 --> 00:54:05,678
Where is Anin?

361
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,967
Why is she still not here?

362
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,955
It seems she is not feeling quite well, Your Highness.

363
00:54:15,832 --> 00:54:22,666
But she is obliged to attend. She is in fact Lady Pin’s youngest aunt.

364
00:54:22,995 --> 00:54:25,610
Similar to how you and your brother are her uncle.

365
00:54:27,392 --> 00:54:29,749
She should also attend the ceremony.

366
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:33,691
I will have someone to fetch her right now, Your Highness.

367
00:54:34,157 --> 00:54:35,204
Pia.

368
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:36,574
Yes, Your Highness.

369
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:47,003
Go tell Anin to come down.

370
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:49,020
Yes, Your Highness.

371
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:54,300
Please have a seat.

372
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:21,732
His Highness has requested for your presence at the ceremony, my princess.

373
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:27,820
But if you do not wish to attend, I can tell His Highness that you are very sick, Your Highness.

374
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:34,655
No need. I am going.

375
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:50,898
Congratulations to both of you.

376
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:56,031
May you love each other and stay together until a ripe old age.

377
00:55:56,223 --> 00:55:59,126
May your couple life be filled with only happiness.

378
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:05,664
For better or for worse, please never let go of each other’s hand.

379
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:11,277
Support each other and always forgive each other.

380
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:13,966
May you have a long-lasting love.

381
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:31,648
The two of you will now become one.

382
00:56:31,648 --> 00:56:39,451
Please build your family with love, understanding, and kindness.

383
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:47,100
Always be caring and never let go of each other’s hand. May you both grow old together.

384
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,493
Please look after her for me.

385
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,504
May you both find happiness in your couple life.

386
00:56:56,504 --> 00:57:03,629
Be rational and address the problems together. May you love each other until a ripe old age.

387
00:57:04,122 --> 00:57:08,524
Most importantly, may you have a baby soon.

388
00:57:18,842 --> 00:57:21,668
Why is Anin still not coming down?

389
00:57:27,396 --> 00:57:29,217
There she is, Your Highness.

390
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:34,195
Can you please accept this ring as a promise that portrays all my feelings for you?

391
00:58:34,908 --> 00:58:36,575
Yes.

392
00:58:37,617 --> 00:58:44,445
I will accept all your feelings and keep them with me forever.

393
01:00:26,246 --> 01:00:28,797
I give you this silver pin…

394
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:34,469
in hopes that it will reunite and be together with the golden pin…

395
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,696
like how they used to be.

396
01:00:50,724 --> 01:00:53,889
For Lady Pin,

397
01:00:56,548 --> 01:01:02,707
I wish you to be happy in love.

398
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:30,326
As for Master Kuea,

399
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:35,817
all I could say is…

400
01:01:49,715 --> 01:01:51,764
know your place.

401
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:15,467
My sincere gratitude to you, Your Highness.

402
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:18,973
For kindly allowed Lady Pin and I to arrange her engagement at your palace.

403
01:02:18,973 --> 01:02:22,548
Not to mention this feast you have arranged as a celebration for her.

404
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:28,221
It is nothing at all. I also adore her like my own children.

405
01:02:28,221 --> 01:02:30,626
She has lived with us since when she was very little.

406
01:02:34,134 --> 01:02:37,729
His Highness loves Lady Pin as if she were his own daughter.

407
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:40,383
Please do not worry, dear.

408
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:46,111
You are correct. This is such an opportune moment to celebrate for her.

409
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:04,048
Cheers

410
01:03:04,733 --> 01:03:06,379
Cheers, Your Highness.

411
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,466
Please enjoy your meal.

412
01:03:32,096 --> 01:03:33,883
Congratulations, Kueakiat.

413
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:37,275
When is the wedding then? Have you set the date?

414
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:40,824
Yes, Your Highness.

415
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,994
It will be in the middle of next month.

416
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:51,129
Kueakiat seems overly happy today.

417
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:54,931
I find it quite annoying to look at.

418
01:03:56,384 --> 01:03:57,772
Your Highness.

419
01:03:58,485 --> 01:04:01,581
Please don’t tease him, Your Highness.

420
01:04:01,581 --> 01:04:05,723
Look, he is blushing all red now.

421
01:04:09,505 --> 01:04:12,056
Everything seems to happen so fast.

422
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:16,567
Be it the engagement or the wedding. It is not even a month apart.

423
01:04:17,746 --> 01:04:20,983
But if you include the time since I started to court her,

424
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:24,050
I would say it is not fast at all, Lady Uang.

425
01:04:24,872 --> 01:04:29,182
It felt rather too long for me.

426
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:36,795
Does this mean Lady Pin must move out of the palace soon?

427
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:47,624
I’m afraid not. Princess Patt is still very fond of Lady Pin.

428
01:04:48,035 --> 01:04:51,051
So, we agree that I will move in to stay with her instead.

429
01:05:01,521 --> 01:05:03,262
I’m sorry.

430
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:08,654
My limbs are a little weak. Perhaps because I’m not feeling quite well today.

431
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,907
Is it serious, Anin?

432
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:18,142
Do you want to take some medicine and go to rest?

433
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,751
It’s just a little headache. I can make do with it, Brother.

434
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:35,531
Then may I stay with you at the Pine Palace tonight?

435
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:40,094
So that I can take care of you if you have a high fever.

436
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,306
What a good idea indeed.

437
01:05:49,786 --> 01:05:51,459
Thank you.

438
01:05:56,365 --> 01:05:57,717
Prik.

439
01:05:58,183 --> 01:06:00,301
Go prepare a room for Lady Uang.

440
01:06:03,974 --> 01:06:05,066
Yes, Your Highness.

441
01:06:25,593 --> 01:06:26,625
Cheers to Kueakiat.

442
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:28,377
Cheers, Your Highness.

443
01:06:38,901 --> 01:06:48,228
It’s been a while since I last visited here. The place is still enchantingly beautiful as usual.

444
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:55,432
You are as sweet as ever. Please have some tea first.

445
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,777
Yes.

446
01:07:13,056 --> 01:07:15,362
Thank you.

447
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:30,887
How are you doing? Have you been well?

448
01:07:37,465 --> 01:07:40,315
Physically, yes.

449
01:07:40,781 --> 01:07:46,035
But mentally, I’m afraid it is not good at all.

450
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:54,057
Seeing that Lady Pin is also forced to have her engagement
so suddenly even makes me feel worse.

451
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:57,898
It somehow reminds me of my own fate.

452
01:07:59,734 --> 01:08:02,889
Has Lord Muang-Rahm been pressing you about it?

453
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:06,744
Not at all.

454
01:08:07,402 --> 01:08:13,669
It is rather my mother who keeps pressing me about the engagement date.

455
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:20,820
How burdensome it is to be born as a woman.

456
01:08:21,999 --> 01:08:25,838
We never have the right to choose.

457
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:34,311
But sometimes even when you do,

458
01:08:34,695 --> 01:08:38,910
the other party might not also feel the same.

459
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:48,650
Like you and Lady Pin?

460
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:54,876
You know?

461
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:10,378
My eyes are glued to you, dear.

462
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,666
Why wouldn’t I know…

463
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:22,487
that you are also falling deep into the endless hollow of pain…

464
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:30,296
just like I am.

465
01:09:47,919 --> 01:09:50,892
Is this what I am destined to face?

466
01:09:54,044 --> 01:09:57,179
Why would you say that?

467
01:10:01,975 --> 01:10:08,774
Then why am I feeling this unbearable pain…

468
01:10:09,678 --> 01:10:14,480
as if my heart has been torn into thousands of pieces?

469
01:10:19,275 --> 01:10:21,747
I could not think of any reason…

470
01:10:22,926 --> 01:10:29,812
except that it is my unfortunate fate, and karma for making you shed so many tears for me.

471
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:39,754
I have never blamed you for that.

472
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:49,482
I only wish you to be happy in love.

473
01:10:55,155 --> 01:11:01,173
Please never give up for I also will never give up on my own fate.

474
01:11:03,037 --> 01:11:11,808
I know that you are not the kind of person who would give up so easily.

475
01:11:16,549 --> 01:11:21,597
I am in fact very weak.

476
01:11:23,378 --> 01:11:30,437
I find myself inferior to every man in this world.

477
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:46,921
I am in fact…

478
01:11:49,936 --> 01:11:54,533
unable to be with the person I love the most.

479
01:12:04,345 --> 01:12:07,541
My dear cousin.

480
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:14,806
Please do not blame yourself like this.

481
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:24,200
The pain and agony you have felt,

482
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:30,867
I can clearly feel them this time.

483
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:32,198
The Loyal Pin

484
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:34,368
Is the princess going to Prae again?

485
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,584
Yes, my lady.

486
01:13:35,584 --> 01:13:38,331
Can you please not go?

487
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:45,089
I want to escape from this place, so that I won’t have to see you with Kueakiat.

488
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:50,170
You saw Kueakiat with another woman?

489
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:53,883
I must find a way to make him admit it in front of Princess Patt.

490
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:58,890
But things have already gone out of our control.
I’m afraid we won’t be able to fix anything.

491
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:03,529
Then, I wish you…

492
01:14:05,968 --> 01:14:08,817
to live happily with him.

493
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:43,380
The Loyal Pin

494
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:53,395
IDOLFACTORY
