1
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,320
The Loyal Pin

2
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
That’s enough! Stop lying!

3
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,040
I will beat this unwanted child to death in front of his own father!

4
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,520
That’s our child.

5
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,800
This marriage…

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
shall be considered as a void.

7
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,760
Don’t bother paying attention to them, Pattamika.

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,320
Please remember…

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
that I will always be here…

10
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,760
and will never let go of your hands

11
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,640
I am deeply in love with the person I am not able to marry.

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,920
Who is that person you love?

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Lady Pinlanthita, Father.

14
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
Lady Pin?

15
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,720
But isn’t she also a lady like you?

16
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,640
I do not understand what you are asking for.

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,960
And no matter how I look at it,

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,840
I could not see how it would be possible.

19
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,520
That is why…

20
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,960
I am here to beg for your permission…

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,920
to let me continue living my life as it is…

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,560
where I will stay single for the rest of my life.

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,920
Are you certain that the love you have for Lady Pin…

24
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,960
is one between lovers?

25
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
Yes, Father.

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,520
Then, why did Lady Pin accept the engagement proposal from Kueakiat?

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,000
She does not want me to give up my royal title.

28
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,480
I already told Mother…

29
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,080
that if she does not let me stay with Lady Pin,

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
I will give up my royal title.

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
And we will run away together.

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Your mother already knew?

33
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,560
So, I’m the last one to know then.

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,520
Prince Arnon still doesn’t know about it, Father.

35
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,640
What will you do if I refuse?

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,920
My life as a princess is somehow like a pretty bird in a fine cage.

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,720
I shall never let anyone force me…

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,360
to cage up my heart within that imprisonment ever again.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
There is a saying…

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,000
that it is impossible for one to always get what they want.

41
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,520
What makes you think that you will be an exemption?

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,280
It is because I am your daughter.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,800
My life is, in fact, my own. I alone can live it.

44
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
What do you mean?

45
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,960
should I prefer to live my life as I wish and disappear

46
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,400
from your life and our family,

47
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,120
I could have certainly done it.

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
However, I am still your daughter.

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Should I plan to take any course of action,

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
I still wish to have your permission or approval first.

51
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,160
Are you perhaps threatening me?

52
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
Not at all, Father.

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,000
I am only explaining to you about my process of thinking.

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,040
Is staying with the person you love the most important thing in your life?

55
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Not entirely true, Father.

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Should that be the case,

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,080
I would have chosen to run away to England with Lady Pin.

58
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
Yet in fact, I do love my family as much.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,640
Whether it is you, whom I admire and worship above all.

60
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Or Mother, whom I never wish to be away from her.

61
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,040
And both of my brothers also.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,440
I do not wish to arrange a proper marriage

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
to put you and our family to shame.

64
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,240
All I wish is to stay quietly by her side…

65
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,400
and grow old together at the Pine Palace.

66
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,840
People would only see us as best companions who prefer a solitary life.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,600
That is all I want.

68
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,320
Can you please allow me to do that, Father?

69
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,800
Does this mean if I am to refuse,

70
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,000
you will choose to leave this palace?

71
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
Yes.

72
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
What did His Highness say?

73
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
I have told him everything.

74
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,200
Now, it is up to him to decide.

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,080
Father.

76
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,440
I’d like to talk to you… / If it is about Anin,

77
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
just leave.

78
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,520
I do not want to talk about it right now.

79
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,560
What did your father say?

80
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,840
Where is Father?

81
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,800
He only stays in his room and still has not come out.

82
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,120
Let’s sit down and eat.

83
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,920
He is right.

84
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,680
The table is full of your favourite dishes today.

85
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,440
Let’s eat together, Anin.

86
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,360
Pia, serve the rice.

87
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Yes, Your Highness.

88
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,280
Sit down, dear.

89
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,920
Yes, Mother.

90
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,960
Since that day the princess went to talk to His Highness,

91
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,760
he has been quiet and never left his room to eat anything, Your Highness.

92
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,200
What did Princess Alisa do then?

93
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,520
What else could she do, Your Highness?

94
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,720
She could only let it be.

95
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,840
His Highness did not even allow Prince Anan to see him, Your Highness.

96
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,680
He must be very furious.

97
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,520
This is such a serious issue for our palace.

98
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,240
It also has never happened before.

99
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,600
He must be pondering hard over it.

100
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,840
If your father does not approve of your relationship with Lady Pin,

101
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,720
what will you do?

102
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,760
I plan to leave this palace…

103
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,560
and move to England with Lady Pin.

104
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,440
Are you aware of the consequences you will face with such decision?

105
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Living in England will not be as easy and comfortable

106
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,520
as a life here in our palace, dear.

107
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,840
How will you survive then?

108
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,520
Yes, Mother. I am well aware of it.

109
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,840
Lady Pin and I will try to find a job and build our family there.

110
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,240
Please don’t worry, Mother.

111
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,280
Of course, I must be worried. I am your mother after all.

112
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,480
But if it is your happiness,

113
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,280
and you have deeply reflected upon it,

114
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,400
I will not stop you.

115
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,680
I only want you to know…

116
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,440
that I will always be here,

117
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,320
and I will always worry about you and care for you.

118
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Have you told your aunt about your plan

119
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,480
to take Lady Pin to live in England with you?

120
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Not yet, Mother.

121
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,680
Your aunt loves Lady Pin very dearly.

122
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,120
Will she let you take her niece away from her?

123
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,640
I am worried about that too.

124
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Why would you like to see me, Your Highness?

125
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
You were quite unwell recently. Are you fully recovered?

126
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,960
Yes, Your Highness.

127
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,000
I’d like to apologize to you.

128
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,720
Apologize about what, Your Highness?

129
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,200
For forcing you upon marriage…

130
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,120
and putting you in distress.

131
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,640
Can you forgive me?

132
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,440
I understand that you love me more than anyone.

133
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,120
And everything that you do…

134
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,960
is all because you wish me to have the best in life.

135
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
I have never felt mad or angry with you, Your Highness.

136
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,920
But my well-wish almost destroyed the rest of your life.

137
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,840
Without you,

138
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,280
there would never be me today.

139
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,480
Your Highness.

140
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,720
Princess Alisa would like to request for your presence.

141
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,360
Please come in.

142
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,200
Have a seat, dear.

143
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,720
These are for you and Lady Pin.

144
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Why would you give us these precious gifts, Your Highness?

145
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,480
Lady Pin and I have not done any merits or virtue to deserve such gifts.

146
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,880
I only wish to do it merely for my own satisfaction.

147
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,360
But…

148
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,960
There is no but.

149
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,000
Inside these boxes are beautifully crafted ancient diamond jewellery.

150
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,160
I’d like to give them to Lady Pin.

151
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,640
And this box…

152
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,760
is for you.

153
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,320
By giving me and Lady Pin such invaluable gifts,

154
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,720
are you perhaps expecting anything in return, Your Highness?

155
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,960
Please only keep in mind that…

156
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,480
what I am doing is the most justifiable and appropriate thing to do.

157
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
What did you just say?

158
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
You are going to move to England with Lady Pin?

159
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
Yes.

160
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,280
That is why I’d like to ask for your permission first.

161
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,680
What did His Highness say about this?

162
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I told Father that I will not be married for the rest of my life.

163
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,480
For I only wish to spend my life with Lady Pin,

164
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
the woman I have always been in love with.

165
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,920
But Father still has not said anything yet.

166
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,160
So, I believe this is perhaps the only way…

167
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,280
that would allow me to be with Lady Pin.

168
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,200
Now, I understand…

169
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,840
why Princess Alisa has given me those precious gifts earlier.

170
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,000
She must have predicted it.

171
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,320
Did Mother do that?

172
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,760
I haven’t a clue before.

173
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,120
Your mother must have known…

174
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,440
that you would come to talk to me about Lady Pin.

175
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,160
Mother is so kind to me.

176
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,560
As for your request,

177
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,520
please allow me some time to ponder over it.

178
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,360
I believe His Highness must not be very pleased

179
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,560
with your decision to move away to England.

180
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,840
I’d like to suggest you to try talking to your father again.

181
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,880
You want to talk to His Highness about the princess?

182
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes, Your Highness.

183
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,240
I don’t want to see Princess Anin having a dispute with her father.

184
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,440
The Loyal Pin

185
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,706
The Loyal Pin

186
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,586
Princess Alisa has asked me to give these sets of jewellery to you.

187
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,226
To me, Your Highness?

188
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:33,666
These gifts somehow imply that Her Highness has granted you her approval…

189
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:36,986
and would like to propose you for Princess Anin.

190
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,026
As for your plan to move to England,

191
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,506
if I were to speak honestly,

192
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,706
I do not wish you to live that far away.

193
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:53,826
But since you are happy to do it,

194
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:57,106
I will not stop you.

195
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:02,586
Thank you, Your Highness.

196
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:07,306
I only wish you would reconsider it again…

197
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,866
whether this is the best option there is.

198
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:19,266
By moving away so suddenly despite His Highness’s disagreement,

199
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:21,706
deep down,

200
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:26,946
are you certain that you and the princess would find happiness there?

201
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:14,506
What should I do, Brother?

202
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:27,026
I don’t want to leave this palace.

203
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:30,426
But with this situation,

204
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,266
I’m afraid I do not have any choice.

205
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,586
Someday

206
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:48,066
I’m sure Father will understand you.

207
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:53,186
I will try to talk to him for you.

208
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:58,146
Please don’t be sad.

209
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:35,466
You want to talk to His Highness about the princess?

210
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:37,266
Yes, Your Highness.

211
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:41,826
I don’t want to see Princess Anin having a dispute with her father.

212
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:45,066
I want to do something and stand up for the princess.

213
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:48,386
What if His Highness gets even more furious?

214
00:26:50,786 --> 00:26:53,066
Whatever will be will be, Your Highness.

215
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:54,946
But I will not run away.

216
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:57,146
Nor will I stay silent.

217
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:16,986
From now on, no matter what you decide to do…

218
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:26,946
I will always stand by you and support you.

219
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:01,306
Wait.

220
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,746
Where is His Highness at the moment?

221
00:28:04,746 --> 00:28:06,186
In the study room, my lady.

222
00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:10,026
Are you bringing this to him?

223
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:10,986
Yes, my lady.

224
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:15,906
Let me do it.

225
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:36,586
Your Highness.

226
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:38,466
I am here to see Lady Pin.

227
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,306
She went to see your father.

228
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:19,546
You are here to talk about Anin, aren’t you?

229
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,146
Yes, Your Highness.

230
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:30,826
Just say it then.

231
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:36,946
I’d like to apologize…

232
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:41,346
for causing you such a displeasure and irritation, Your Highness.

233
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:48,146
I am fully aware that I am just a commoner.

234
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:51,946
And that I have been presumptuous.

235
00:29:53,106 --> 00:29:54,466
But you still do it.

236
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:07,266
But the princess and I truly love each other, Your Highness.

237
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:19,266
So what? Hasn’t your wish already been fulfilled?

238
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,266
Why are you telling me this?

239
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:28,586
The princess is a straightforward person.

240
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:31,306
She is very honest with her feeling.

241
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:35,586
That is why she has decided to go away.

242
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:41,706
On the outside, she might look strong and determined.

243
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:49,866
But in fact, she is devastated inside.

244
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:57,546
For she loves you…

245
00:30:58,186 --> 00:31:00,146
and her family more than anything.

246
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:09,986
Must she take this choice, the princess will surely be in so much pain.

247
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:19,826
I do not want your decision

248
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,906
to create more scars in her heart, Your Highness.

249
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:31,786
Are you saying it is my fault?

250
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:38,346
I am here to beg for your mercy.

251
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:47,386
Please don’t forbid us from loving each other, Your Highness.

252
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:52,106
The princess and I

253
00:31:52,946 --> 00:31:55,866
only wish to stay by each other’s side to take care of each other…

254
00:31:56,746 --> 00:31:58,866
and grow old together as companions.

255
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,706
I promise…

256
00:32:03,146 --> 00:32:06,266
that we will not do anything to tarnish your name and reputation.

257
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,586
Can you please give us your approval, Your Highness?

258
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:16,146
How dare you!

259
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:20,466
Not only you blame it on me.

260
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:24,186
You even have the audacity to ask for my approval.

261
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,866
Why didn’t you tell me first?

262
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:23,346
I’m sorry.

263
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,466
I wanted to do something for you too.

264
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,546
I sincerely love her.

265
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:41,106
I do not wish to see the person I love living the rest of her life in distress.

266
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:47,546
If you wish to punish me,

267
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,186
I am willing to accept it, Your Highness.

268
00:33:55,226 --> 00:33:58,386
Fine, you said so yourself.

269
00:34:01,426 --> 00:34:04,146
I will never lose Anin to anyone.

270
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:08,226
She must stay here with me.

271
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:55,266
Are you really going to let Anin go, Your Highness?

272
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:57,586
Do you not love her anymore?

273
00:34:57,866 --> 00:35:00,386
Why must you put her in such a difficult situation?

274
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:05,626
I will never let her live outside this palace.

275
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:08,666
She must stay here with me.

276
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,026
What about Lady Pin, Your Highness?

277
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:15,226
If Lady Pin is a problem,

278
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:16,866
then I will put an end to it.

279
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:32,146
Isn’t that a car from the front palace, my lady?

280
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:34,146
Why is it here at the Lotus Palace?

281
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:38,186
Please don’t! Don’t do it, please!

282
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:41,146
Please don’t take them away! Please!

283
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,626
Your Highness!

284
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:43,786
Please don’t take them away!

285
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,066
What is happening, Your Highness?

286
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:52,906
Are those my bags?

287
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:54,906
His Highness has ordered you

288
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:57,386
to move out of the Lotus Palace immediately.

289
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:06,466
Move out of this palace immediately?

290
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,306
Please come with me, my lady.

291
00:36:14,746 --> 00:36:15,786
Please, my lady.

292
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:21,066
Your Highness!

293
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:22,266
Lady Pin!

294
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:25,426
Can you not take her now?

295
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:27,146
Let me talk to His Highness first.

296
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:28,626
I’m afraid not. It is time.

297
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:29,626
Please get in the car, my lady.

298
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:30,946
Your Highness!

299
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:34,346
Can I at least say goodbye to her first?

300
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:35,906
No, my lady.

301
00:36:36,306 --> 00:36:37,226
His Highness has forbidden it.

302
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:39,226
Where are you taking her?

303
00:36:39,546 --> 00:36:41,346
We are not allowed to tell you, Your Highness.

304
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:43,746
Your Highness!

305
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:45,866
Where are you taking her?

306
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:47,706
Lady Pin!

307
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:48,586
Your Highness!

308
00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:49,906
Lady Pin!

309
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:50,986
Lady Pin!

310
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:52,826
Lady Pin!

311
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:54,226
Your Highness!

312
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:56,066
Lady Pin!

313
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:00,106
Don’t you worry, dear!

314
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:02,346
I will go talk to His Highness for you!

315
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,106
Your Highness!

316
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:10,746
Lady Pin!

317
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:13,746
My lady!

318
00:37:14,186 --> 00:37:15,426
My lady!

319
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,106
Where are you taking me?

320
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:26,986
Can you tell me where you are taking me?

321
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:37,266
Are you aware that this relationship is against our moral and tradition?

322
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:39,226
Are you aware of the consequences of this choice of yours?

323
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:42,626
Where am I? Please tell me.

324
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:04,026
The Loyal Pin

325
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:11,402
The Loyal Pin

326
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:46,402
Ouch!

327
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,042
Ouch!

328
00:38:52,602 --> 00:38:55,482
Where am I? Please tell me.

329
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:58,002
Where am I?

330
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:00,882
Please tell me.

331
00:42:33,722 --> 00:42:35,682
What is happening, Anin?

332
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:39,602
Why am I here?

333
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:48,962
Because this is our home.

334
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,082
What do you mean?

335
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:09,082
I come to beg you for one last time.

336
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:12,242
Please have sympathy for me.

337
00:43:13,282 --> 00:43:14,922
May I ask you then.

338
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:19,082
Are you certain you will not change your mind later on…

339
00:43:20,402 --> 00:43:24,082
if one day you happen to meet the man you are interested in?

340
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,762
I have fallen in love with Lady Pin since when I was 14.

341
00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:31,602
And I will always love her for the rest of my life.

342
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:34,242
Anin.

343
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:39,842
Are you aware that this relationship is against our moral and tradition?

344
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:43,562
No one has ever accepted or done it before.

345
00:43:44,682 --> 00:43:48,762
Are you aware of the consequences of this choice of yours?

346
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:52,642
I am, Father.

347
00:43:54,002 --> 00:43:56,322
It might not be acceptable in our society today.

348
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:01,962
But in the future, I truly believe that this kind of love…

349
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:04,122
will be accepted widely.

350
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:07,362
Our world will be more open and of equality.

351
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:10,402
Whether men or women,

352
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:16,122
all of us shall have freedom to portray ourselves and our love.

353
00:44:16,442 --> 00:44:18,442
And become whatever it is that we want to be.

354
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:24,002
Most importantly, marriage shall be acceptable…

355
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:27,402
both socially and legally regardless of our gender.

356
00:44:29,562 --> 00:44:32,922
I truly believe that love is far beyond definition.

357
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:36,962
It shall not be restricted only between a man and a woman.

358
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:41,402
Just like the love I have for Lady Pin.

359
00:44:42,202 --> 00:44:46,282
I have never considered anything else but her heart.

360
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:49,202
And even until now, the love I have for her…

361
00:44:49,202 --> 00:44:50,882
has never changed.

362
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:54,722
No matter what hardship I might face in the future,

363
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,042
I will not be afraid.

364
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:01,842
For I am surrounded by the people who love me dearly…

365
00:45:02,882 --> 00:45:04,202
like you,

366
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:07,122
Mother,

367
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:09,922
both of my brothers,

368
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,322
and Lady Pin.

369
00:45:15,642 --> 00:45:19,042
That is all I ever need in my life.

370
00:45:32,802 --> 00:45:33,962
Father.

371
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:35,202
I’d like to talk to you about…

372
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:36,002
About Anin?

373
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:45,562
Do you know how bold and daring your sister is?

374
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:48,562
I do, Father.

375
00:45:50,002 --> 00:45:52,722
And you still wish to talk to me for her?

376
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:57,802
But Father, am I right to understand that deep down…

377
00:45:57,802 --> 00:46:00,282
you have never intended to find a man for her?

378
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:04,202
Were you to do that,

379
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,122
you would not have waited for this long.

380
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,842
Don’t you try to outsmart me.

381
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:17,162
I only have yet found a man who deserves to be with Anin.

382
00:46:19,802 --> 00:46:21,282
If such a man does not exist now,

383
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:25,082
wouldn’t it be impossible to find one in the future?

384
00:46:27,362 --> 00:46:29,802
If Anin wishes to marry without giving up her royal title,

385
00:46:30,682 --> 00:46:33,282
she must marry a Serene Highness Prince or one with a higher rank.

386
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,282
Among those of suitable ranks,

387
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:40,682
I still do not see anyone who deserves to be with Anin.

388
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:49,282
I have always been of this opinion…

389
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:52,402
that no such a man deserves to be with Anin.

390
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:57,002
It could be because I am very fond of her.

391
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:01,602
What if it is a lady, Father?

392
00:47:03,802 --> 00:47:06,962
Does a lady deserve to be with Anin?

393
00:47:15,162 --> 00:47:16,282
You are right.

394
00:47:19,082 --> 00:47:20,722
How odd.

395
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,642
When I picture my Anin with any man,

396
00:47:25,922 --> 00:47:29,322
I often find those men inferior to her.

397
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:36,322
Yet,

398
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:41,522
when I picture her with Lady Pin,

399
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:47,482
I do not find anything wrong with it.

400
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:54,562
As if it is the right place for both of them.

401
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,162
Then, can you please not force her to act against her own will?

402
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,042
My marriage was also arranged out of conventionality.

403
00:48:12,602 --> 00:48:15,962
And I am not able to be with the woman I truly love.

404
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:22,362
So, I do not want my only sister…

405
00:48:24,482 --> 00:48:27,042
to have the same fate as I do.

406
00:48:30,922 --> 00:48:33,202
But what Anin wants

407
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,962
is beyond what anyone could haver ever done for her.

408
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,602
You do know how much I love her.

409
00:48:41,682 --> 00:48:45,962
No matter what she wishes for, be it a star or the moon,

410
00:48:46,362 --> 00:48:48,602
I am willing to get it for her.

411
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,162
But this time, what she wants…

412
00:48:55,162 --> 00:48:58,202
is the simplest thing ever.

413
00:49:01,682 --> 00:49:05,442
She only wishes to be with the person she loves.

414
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:08,202
And grow old together with her.

415
00:49:11,642 --> 00:49:14,402
How come you cannot not give it to her now, Father?

416
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,562
She must stay here with me.

417
00:49:26,282 --> 00:49:28,562
What about Lady Pin, Your Highness?

418
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:30,802
If Lady Pin is a problem,

419
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:32,602
then I will put an end to it.

420
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:38,242
What are you going to do, Your Highness?

421
00:49:46,802 --> 00:49:49,162
I will go talk to Pattamika and make a proper proposal…

422
00:49:49,162 --> 00:49:52,002
so that Lady Pin and Anin can finally live together.

423
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:00,442
What do you mean, Your Highness?

424
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,602
What made you change your mind?

425
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:11,322
Well, since Anin, Lady Pin, Anan, and even you…

426
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:15,042
all came marching in and try to persuade me,

427
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:17,162
if I still remain silent…

428
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:21,362
I’m afraid everyone in this palace might also come and try to persuade me too.

429
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:45,522
Why are you giving me all these valuable gifts again, Your Highness?

430
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:53,082
We’d like to make a proposal…

431
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:57,802
And ask you to allow Lady Pin to move to the Pine Palace and stay with Anin permanently.

432
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:08,202
What made you give in to this idea so easily, Your Highness?

433
00:51:11,522 --> 00:51:13,722
As long as Anin will stay,

434
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:19,202
whatever she wishes for, I am more than willing to give it to her.

435
00:51:21,602 --> 00:51:24,322
As a matter of fact, Father is worrying…

436
00:51:24,762 --> 00:51:27,642
that he still could not find anyone suitable for Anin.

437
00:51:29,122 --> 00:51:33,562
In his view, none of the men deserves to be with her.

438
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:38,962
Anin’s request was perfectly in accordance with his intention.

439
00:51:39,242 --> 00:51:42,242
So, he agreed to grant her his approval…

440
00:51:42,242 --> 00:51:45,122
for not going to live her life in marriage.

441
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:48,442
As long as you are not against the idea,

442
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:50,722
every other thing should be fine.

443
00:51:55,042 --> 00:52:00,002
What about you, Your Highness? Will you agree with the proposal?

444
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,202
Your father has already said so.

445
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:06,242
What else could I say?

446
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:16,442
But I’m afraid I cannot allow Lady Pin to move to the Pine Place permanently.

447
00:52:24,202 --> 00:52:26,202
But then…

448
00:52:27,762 --> 00:52:30,762
I can only allow Lady Pin to mainly stay there.

449
00:52:31,402 --> 00:52:35,882
However, she must come to visit the Lotus Palace at times.

450
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:42,122
My heart will never be at peace if I must see all of Lady Pin’s belongings…

451
00:52:42,122 --> 00:52:44,202
being moved out of the room where she has been staying

452
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,442
since when she was a little girl.

453
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:19,922
This has already been very kind of you.

454
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,642
There is one more thing…

455
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:30,682
that I’d like to ask from you, Princess.

456
00:53:32,522 --> 00:53:34,242
What is it?

457
00:53:38,442 --> 00:53:43,722
Please take care of Lady Pin better than how I have taken care of her.

458
00:53:47,362 --> 00:53:53,562
That is the only thing I would like to ask from you.

459
00:53:57,242 --> 00:53:58,482
Yes.

460
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:05,442
I promise that I will always take good care of her…

461
00:54:06,882 --> 00:54:09,322
for as long as I am still breathing.

462
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:54,922
Father has already agreed with Princess Patt about us.

463
00:54:56,522 --> 00:54:59,082
So, this is like our first night after the wedding.

464
00:55:05,162 --> 00:55:07,922
What about your father’s order to have me moved out of the Lotus Palace?

465
00:55:09,162 --> 00:55:11,282
So that you can live with me instead.

466
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:14,162
Were you fooling me?

467
00:55:17,922 --> 00:55:20,722
I just did not have a chance to tell you first.

468
00:55:24,122 --> 00:55:30,362
Does this mean Princess Patt, Prik, and Pia also knew?

469
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:35,402
Your Highness!

470
00:55:37,162 --> 00:55:37,922
Lady Pin!

471
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:39,242
Lady Pin!

472
00:55:40,002 --> 00:55:40,882
Lady Pin!

473
00:55:41,322 --> 00:55:42,202
Your Highness!

474
00:55:42,962 --> 00:55:43,882
Lady Pin!

475
00:55:45,162 --> 00:55:46,042
Lady Pin!

476
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:48,122
Don’t you worry, dear!

477
00:55:48,602 --> 00:55:50,522
I will go talk to His Highness for you!

478
00:55:51,162 --> 00:55:52,282
Lady Pin!

479
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:54,362
Your Highness!

480
00:55:57,082 --> 00:55:57,762
Lady Pin!

481
00:55:58,042 --> 00:55:59,002
Lady Pin!

482
00:56:03,202 --> 00:56:04,522
Lady Pin!

483
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:06,282
Ha Ha Ha...

484
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:09,202
Lady Pin!

485
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:16,482
How was it?

486
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:18,722
Did I completely fool her?

487
00:56:21,482 --> 00:56:24,762
I never thought you would be this good, Your Highness.

488
00:56:25,922 --> 00:56:28,522
I have never done anything like this before.

489
00:56:28,522 --> 00:56:31,442
If it weren’t for His Highness, I wouldn’t have done it.

490
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:35,722
Those tears were pretty.

491
00:56:35,722 --> 00:56:37,002
Weren’t they?

492
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:42,042
So, everyone is in this charade together?

493
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:45,082
They just wanted to surprise you.

494
00:56:47,482 --> 00:56:50,842
Do you know how scared and fretful I was?

495
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,442
You don’t have to worry about it anymore.

496
00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:04,082
Let’s go take a look at our room.

497
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,242
Lady Pin must be quite petrified.

498
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:18,402
Father has set up such a big stage play this time.

499
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,842
It was because Anin said she wanted to surprise Lady Pin.

500
00:57:22,202 --> 00:57:24,762
I thought it would be fun, so I decided to join her.

501
00:57:26,162 --> 00:57:29,282
Now I know whom Anin is taking after.

502
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:33,802
Everyone had to play their role according to your script, Your Highness.

503
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,802
I still could not believe that you would change your mind so easily

504
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:41,242
and granted them your approval, Your Highness.

505
00:57:41,242 --> 00:57:43,522
It is because Lady Pin is your niece.

506
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:47,162
I trust you wholeheartedly that you have brought her up well.

507
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:49,762
That is why I also trust Lady Pin…

508
00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:52,002
to take care of Anin until they grow old together.

509
00:57:55,642 --> 00:57:58,802
Father is in fact not against what Anin is.

510
00:57:58,802 --> 00:58:01,282
He only worries about her social status.

511
00:58:02,202 --> 00:58:03,442
Yes.

512
00:58:03,562 --> 00:58:04,722
Because in the end,

513
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:08,202
no matter what she is, she will always be my daughter.

514
00:58:08,522 --> 00:58:09,962
And I love her so much

515
00:58:09,962 --> 00:58:12,362
that I could never force her to do anything against her will.

516
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:15,082
Am I correct to say that

517
00:58:15,082 --> 00:58:18,482
you are completely enamoured with your daughter, Father?

518
00:58:20,322 --> 00:58:22,322
I love you all the same.

519
00:58:22,522 --> 00:58:25,242
Let’s celebrate. Cheers!

520
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:31,762
Let’s unwrap Lady Pin’s gift next.

521
00:58:32,282 --> 00:58:34,402
It seems Prince Anan’s gift

522
00:58:34,402 --> 00:58:37,122
might even look inferior when compared to Lady Pin’s.

523
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:58,802
The Loyal Pin

524
00:59:03,217 --> 00:59:06,337
The Loyal Pin

525
00:59:39,537 --> 00:59:41,137
What are you doing?

526
00:59:41,137 --> 00:59:42,617
Why are you smiling so gleefully?

527
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:47,177
I’m trying to find a place to put this picture of yours.

528
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:49,417
Should it be that corner…

529
00:59:49,737 --> 00:59:50,897
Or this corner?

530
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:54,137
You can put it anywhere you like.

531
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,417
I do not like to look my own picture though.

532
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:01,297
But I do.

533
01:00:03,777 --> 01:00:06,897
You’re smiling sheepishly. It’s adorable.

534
01:00:16,257 --> 01:00:18,857
Who would be grinning from ear to ear like you?

535
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,337
I never know that you have also kept this picture of mine.

536
01:00:39,337 --> 01:00:41,457
Why should I not keep it?

537
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:45,017
Why do you keep it?

538
01:00:48,097 --> 01:00:50,097
I already told you.

539
01:00:51,697 --> 01:00:58,497
That I was able to go through those time
while waiting for you by looking at your picture.

540
01:01:00,497 --> 01:01:02,497
I was able to put myself to sleep…

541
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:07,177
because of seeing your face in the picture.

542
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:09,377
From now on,

543
01:01:11,697 --> 01:01:14,097
you can go to sleep with me in your arms every night.

544
01:01:15,057 --> 01:01:16,137
Isn’t it good?

545
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:23,057
It’s a dream that I never dared to dream.

546
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,697
A person like me, sleeping by your side every night.

547
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:35,617
And growing old with you.

548
01:01:38,057 --> 01:01:40,337
However unreal it might seem to you,

549
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:44,417
it is happening right in front of you now.

550
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,497
Do you know…

551
01:01:50,297 --> 01:01:54,657
that tonight is our first night after we are officially together?

552
01:01:58,217 --> 01:01:59,817
How so?

553
01:02:00,497 --> 01:02:06,417
Because tonight is the first night that we will start a family together…

554
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:14,737
under approval and acceptance from Father, Mother, and our aunt.

555
01:02:35,857 --> 01:02:41,857
Then, shall we start our first night now?

556
01:09:37,857 --> 01:09:40,657
Do you like the gift that I gave you?

557
01:09:41,737 --> 01:09:42,857
Very much, Brother.

558
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:45,097
It is exactly what I am looking for.

559
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:50,537
Anin, if you keep unwrapping the gifts in front of everyone like this,

560
01:09:50,537 --> 01:09:53,377
wouldn’t my gift look so cheap comparing to our brother’s gift?

561
01:09:56,777 --> 01:10:00,697
That’s good. So that next year you’ll buy me a better gift.

562
01:10:17,017 --> 01:10:20,537
Let’s unwrap Lady Pin’s gift next.

563
01:11:42,217 --> 01:11:44,337
It seems Prince Anan’s gift

564
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:47,057
might even look inferior when compared to Lady Pin’s.

565
01:11:54,577 --> 01:12:00,497
Can you put this ring on my finger in front of everyone?

566
01:12:06,777 --> 01:12:07,857
Let’s do that.

567
01:12:08,617 --> 01:12:10,097
So that I can be your witness.

568
01:12:14,617 --> 01:12:20,737
Do it! Do it! Do it!

569
01:12:32,737 --> 01:12:34,737
As I have given you my promise,

570
01:12:36,497 --> 01:12:42,017
should one day I find a ring that deserves to be on your finger…

571
01:12:44,937 --> 01:12:49,137
I will put in on your finger to make you completely mine.

572
01:12:55,377 --> 01:12:57,737
Can you please accept this ring…

573
01:12:58,497 --> 01:13:01,297
and become mine for the rest of our lives?

574
01:13:10,657 --> 01:13:11,937
I have in fact…

575
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:18,657
given my heart and soul to you since the very first day we met.

576
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:44,417
And this…

577
01:14:44,937 --> 01:14:46,937
is a gift from me.

578
01:14:50,297 --> 01:14:52,417
I baked it myself especially for you, Princess.

579
01:14:54,017 --> 01:14:56,057
Prik and I also helped too, Your Highness.

580
01:14:56,057 --> 01:14:57,217
Yes, Your Highness.

581
01:15:00,297 --> 01:15:02,257
It is my sincere gratitude, Your Highness.

582
01:15:04,857 --> 01:15:06,217
1 2 3.

583
01:15:10,497 --> 01:15:11,857
Please let me help, Your Highness.

584
01:15:29,737 --> 01:15:31,697
Let’s cut the cake together.

585
01:15:33,657 --> 01:15:35,537
I’d like to share my happiness,

586
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:37,777
all the good things,

587
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,017
and my everything in life with you.

588
01:15:44,577 --> 01:15:45,337
Yes.

589
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:51,257
I am also willing to share my happiness…

590
01:15:52,217 --> 01:15:54,697
and my everything with you for the rest of my life.

591
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:02,657
I am 3 months pregnant now, Your Highness.

592
01:17:04,097 --> 01:17:05,097
Is it true?

593
01:17:05,297 --> 01:17:06,617
Is it true?

594
01:17:28,537 --> 01:17:31,257
The Loyal Pin

595
01:17:35,553 --> 01:17:38,313
The Loyal Pin

596
01:17:46,393 --> 01:17:50,313
[5 years later]

597
01:18:01,913 --> 01:18:04,633
After His Highness and Princess Pattamika

598
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:08,553
had granted approval for me to stay with Anin at the Pine Palace,

599
01:18:09,473 --> 01:18:12,593
Lady Parawatee had brought another good news

600
01:18:12,593 --> 01:18:15,553
to our Savettawarit Palace with her pregnancy.

601
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:21,833
I am 3 months pregnant now, Your Highness.

602
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:24,273
Is it true?

603
01:18:24,473 --> 01:18:25,793
Is it true?

604
01:18:30,393 --> 01:18:31,993
Am I going to be an aunt now?

605
01:18:34,233 --> 01:18:35,713
Congratulations, Brother.

606
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:41,433
Everyone’s hearts were full of joy especially for Prince Anantawut…

607
01:18:41,953 --> 01:18:44,233
for he had always wished to have a daughter

608
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:48,233
like Princess Anilaphat, his sister.

609
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:52,593
Can you hear me?

610
01:18:53,153 --> 01:18:55,073
[5 years later]

611
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:59,473
Eventually, Prince Anan’s dream has finally come true.

612
01:18:59,793 --> 01:19:02,513
Lady Parawatee gave birth to a daughter

613
01:19:02,513 --> 01:19:05,593
who looked exactly like her Aunt Anilaphat.

614
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,353
It was as if they were created by the same hands of God.

615
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:14,513
Aunt Anin, please wait for me!

616
01:19:18,313 --> 01:19:21,793
Quit playing now, both of you.

617
01:19:39,993 --> 01:19:41,273
Please don’t!

618
01:19:42,313 --> 01:19:48,193
Prince Anan has named his daughter ‘Alinrada’ to match with Anilaphat.

619
01:19:48,193 --> 01:19:52,793
This little princess is so fond of her aunt than she is of her own mother.

620
01:20:09,673 --> 01:20:12,353
Try to be more gentle.

621
01:20:12,713 --> 01:20:14,433
You are ruining the fruits.

622
01:20:17,153 --> 01:20:18,153
Let me show you who to do it.

623
01:20:18,633 --> 01:20:22,993
Princess Patt is still busy with all the chores as usual.

624
01:20:22,993 --> 01:20:27,993
The only difference is…she seems to be less strict.

625
01:20:28,353 --> 01:20:30,393
Perhaps, it is because the princess and I

626
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:32,473
have broken so many rules and traditions

627
01:20:32,473 --> 01:20:35,073
that she can finally let everything be.

628
01:20:37,993 --> 01:20:39,433
Remove this part first.

629
01:20:40,073 --> 01:20:42,233
Hold it near the end.

630
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:49,793
Please wait for me, Princess! / Princess Alin!

631
01:20:49,873 --> 01:20:51,513
As for Prik and Pia,

632
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,633
they are now Alin's minions

633
01:20:53,633 --> 01:20:56,033
who must keep running after their new master all day.

634
01:20:56,033 --> 01:20:58,873
Princess Alin! I’m tired already!

635
01:20:58,873 --> 01:21:00,193
Please wait, Your Highness!

636
01:21:00,393 --> 01:21:01,313
Serve you right!

637
01:21:01,313 --> 01:21:03,793
You had to run around after Princess Anin when she was young.

638
01:21:03,793 --> 01:21:06,353
And now you must do the same with Lady Alin.

639
01:21:06,353 --> 01:21:07,473
Just you wait, Pia.

640
01:21:07,913 --> 01:21:11,633
Please wait, Your Highness! / Wait for me, Your Highness!

641
01:21:12,233 --> 01:21:13,633
Your Highness!

642
01:21:16,673 --> 01:21:20,113
As for Lady Uang, she sent us a letter

643
01:21:20,473 --> 01:21:23,993
telling us how our story has given her courage

644
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:27,913
to refuse a marriage with Lord Muang-Rahm.

645
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:35,593
And we have heard that Kueakiat is now a father of two children.

646
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:45,593
Anin is now teaching full-time at the university upon her father’s advice.

647
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:46,753
Anin.

648
01:21:47,713 --> 01:21:48,393
Yes?

649
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:50,553
Here is your lunch.

650
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:53,993
Thank you.

651
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:56,473
I’m leaving then.

652
01:21:58,913 --> 01:22:00,793
Did you forget something?

653
01:22:09,993 --> 01:22:10,993
I’m leaving then.

654
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:11,993
Yes.

655
01:22:12,873 --> 01:22:19,433
Apart from the translation work, my main job is to take care of Anin,

656
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:23,913
sending her off to work in the morning and wait for her to return home.

657
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:29,193
My princess, please eat something first.

658
01:22:29,193 --> 01:22:32,673
I must also babysit my little princess niece

659
01:22:32,673 --> 01:22:36,193
who is always waiting eagerly for her aunt to return from work.

660
01:22:36,433 --> 01:22:38,433
I’m full now. /  Already?

661
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:42,273
Knock, knock, knock.

662
01:22:42,553 --> 01:22:44,513
Aunty is back.

663
01:22:49,353 --> 01:22:50,793
Hello, my dear.

664
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:52,473
I miss you so much.

665
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:57,913
I have been waiting for so long today.

666
01:22:59,713 --> 01:23:01,233
What would you like to play?

667
01:23:02,513 --> 01:23:09,233
A family of three. I want Aunty to be the father.

668
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:12,113
And Aunt Pin, the mother.

669
01:23:12,513 --> 01:23:15,793
Do you still have to role play it, my princess?

670
01:23:15,793 --> 01:23:18,673
You already look like a family of three.

671
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,513
What else do you want to play?

672
01:23:26,153 --> 01:23:27,473
What else do you want to play?

673
01:23:27,473 --> 01:23:28,953
Riding horse send to city.

674
01:23:28,953 --> 01:23:29,633
I see.

675
01:23:30,313 --> 01:23:31,353
Yes.

676
01:23:31,353 --> 01:23:32,393
Shall we?

677
01:23:32,673 --> 01:23:36,073
Okay. Can I please have your bag?

678
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:41,393
Let’s go.

679
01:23:42,153 --> 01:23:44,153
1 2 3

680
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:48,393
Go! Go chase Prik.

681
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:50,593
Me again, Your Highness?

682
01:23:55,313 --> 01:23:56,433
I’m so scared, Your Highness.

683
01:23:56,673 --> 01:23:58,873
It’s my turn to chase you now.

684
01:24:02,273 --> 01:24:04,313
I’m going to bite you, Princess!

685
01:24:11,153 --> 01:24:12,393
Is it fun?

686
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:15,793
Hold me tight.

687
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:36,033
What are you doing ?

688
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:38,433
I’m not going to tell you.

689
01:24:43,673 --> 01:24:48,033
I believe it is time to change the name of this Pine Palace

690
01:24:48,033 --> 01:24:49,713
to Pin Palace instead.

691
01:24:51,633 --> 01:24:53,473
Why would you say that?

692
01:24:54,273 --> 01:24:59,273
Because you have been taken care of the palace so well.

693
01:24:59,273 --> 01:25:02,313
You seem to love it much more than I do.

694
01:25:03,113 --> 01:25:06,393
So, maybe we should change the name of this palace…

695
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,753
to Pin Palace instead. Do you agree?

696
01:25:12,753 --> 01:25:14,633
I like the old name better.

697
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:22,233
You drew a picture of this Pine Palace since when you were little.

698
01:25:22,713 --> 01:25:24,273
I can still remember it vividly.

699
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:27,513
What did I draw?

700
01:25:29,393 --> 01:25:31,833
You drew a small house…

701
01:25:32,473 --> 01:25:34,633
surrounded by many pine trees.

702
01:25:35,353 --> 01:25:37,433
Then you told me it was the house of your dream.

703
01:25:40,713 --> 01:25:41,713
Look.

704
01:25:46,673 --> 01:25:48,433
This is the house of my dream.

705
01:25:51,393 --> 01:25:53,993
But it is much smaller than the front palace.

706
01:25:54,713 --> 01:25:57,833
I prefer it small and cozy.

707
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:00,513
Wherever I look, we will always see each other.

708
01:26:02,113 --> 01:26:03,553
It’s very dreamy.

709
01:26:05,433 --> 01:26:08,473
I will build it next to the Lotus Palace.

710
01:26:08,673 --> 01:26:10,993
So that you can always see me.

711
01:26:12,073 --> 01:26:14,433
Who would want to see you all the time?

712
01:26:15,393 --> 01:26:17,753
But if one day I do have a house of my own,

713
01:26:19,913 --> 01:26:22,313
I will ask you to live there with me.

714
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:29,793
I promise.

715
01:26:55,113 --> 01:26:56,193
At first,

716
01:26:57,633 --> 01:26:59,593
I did not understand the meaning of it.

717
01:27:01,753 --> 01:27:04,913
Until I finally had a chance to live with you at the Pine Palace.

718
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:10,553
It was only then that I came to realize its true meaning.

719
01:27:12,953 --> 01:27:17,553
A house that no matter where I look,

720
01:27:17,953 --> 01:27:20,393
I will always see you right next to me.

721
01:27:24,993 --> 01:27:26,553
Such house is indeed warm and cozy.

722
01:27:30,713 --> 01:27:32,113
I love you, Anin.

723
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:40,673
I love you too.

724
01:27:42,393 --> 01:27:44,433
And I want you to know that…

725
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:51,393
for as long as I live, you will always be loved.

726
01:27:59,873 --> 01:28:05,753
🎵I compare you to a beautiful diamond🎵

727
01:28:07,393 --> 01:28:10,913
🎵You’re as sweet as five-month honey🎵

728
01:28:10,913 --> 01:28:12,233
Come.
🎵You’re as sweet as five-month honey🎵

729
01:28:12,233 --> 01:28:13,513
Let me read your diary.
🎵You’re as sweet as five-month honey🎵

730
01:28:14,433 --> 01:28:15,473
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

731
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:16,913
No.
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

732
01:28:16,913 --> 01:28:17,473
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

733
01:28:17,473 --> 01:28:17,993
Let me see.
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

734
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:18,273
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

735
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:20,273
No, you can’t.
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

736
01:28:20,273 --> 01:28:20,473
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

737
01:28:20,473 --> 01:28:20,913
Let me see.
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

738
01:28:20,913 --> 01:28:21,353
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

739
01:28:21,353 --> 01:28:22,233
No.
🎵Drops of diamonds twinkle in the sky🎵

740
01:28:22,233 --> 01:28:22,353
🎵Did they come from the sky or what?🎵

741
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:23,193
a little.
🎵Did they come from the sky or what?🎵

742
01:28:23,193 --> 01:28:23,993
No.
🎵Did they come from the sky or what?🎵

743
01:28:23,993 --> 01:28:29,953
🎵Did they come from the sky or what?🎵

744
01:28:30,753 --> 01:28:36,113
🎵The drops are here, don’t be unhappy🎵

745
01:28:36,113 --> 01:28:37,793
No.
🎵The drops are here, don’t be unhappy🎵

746
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:41,873
🎵Let people all over the world cry🎵

747
01:28:41,873 --> 01:28:43,313
No.
🎵Let people all over the world cry🎵

748
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:44,273
🎵Let people all over the world cry🎵

749
01:28:45,393 --> 01:28:52,153
🎵Drops of diamonds glitter cheerfully🎵

750
01:28:53,193 --> 01:28:59,273
🎵Too far away to touch🎵

751
01:29:01,673 --> 01:29:07,353
🎵Though when the diamonds drop from the sky🎵

752
01:29:08,513 --> 01:29:15,713
🎵They fall, and the sky is shaken🎵

753
01:29:16,273 --> 01:29:22,513
🎵The stars are sad gems🎵

754
01:29:23,513 --> 01:29:31,873
🎵They won’t hold back the sad tears🎵

755
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:39,353
🎵I reach out for the drops of diamonds🎵

756
01:29:40,313 --> 01:29:46,433
🎵Carelessly loving and dreaming🎵

757
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:54,513
🎵Drops of diamonds drop from bright dust🎵

758
01:29:55,153 --> 01:30:01,673
🎵Like they’re in darkness🎵

759
01:30:30,953 --> 01:30:37,393
🎵I reach out for the drops of diamonds🎵

760
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:45,313
🎵Carelessly loving and dreaming🎵

761
01:30:45,313 --> 01:30:52,713
🎵Drops of diamonds drop from bright dust🎵

762
01:30:53,073 --> 01:31:00,473
🎵Like they’re in darkness🎵

763
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:11,833
🎵Like they’re in darkness🎵

764
