1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:02,880
His Highness has already set the departure date for Princess Anin.

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:05,426
When will she leave, Your Highness?

3
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:06,880
In two weeks.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,960
You once asked me whether I’d feel lonely if you were away.

5
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:16,960
Yes, I would.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,533
Let’s spend the rest of our time together as best as we can.

7
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,386
Your Highness!

8
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,453
Anin!

9
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:41,480
Mother.

10
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:43,973
Anin.

11
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,780
Anin.

12
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,120
My dear.

13
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:56,013
When did you come back? How come I didn’t know?

14
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:58,226
I told Brother to keep it a secret.

15
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,173
So that you’d be surprised.

16
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:05,586
I miss you, Mother.

17
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,720
I miss everyone too.

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,786
So much.

19
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,020
The Loyal Pin

20
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,173
Princess Anin only came back to attend Prince Anan’s engagement and wedding reception.

21
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,400
She didn’t return permanently

22
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,373
Don’t be so overjoyed or else you’ll be disappointed, Prik.

23
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:20,613
Will she only be staying for a few days then, Your Highness?

24
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,986
Probably a few months.

25
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,706
It’s during her end-of-semester holiday before moving up to the next college year.

26
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,360
What a coincidence, Your Highness.

27
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:37,253
That her university holidays are during the same time as Prince Anan’s wedding.

28
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,253
Not a coincidence at all.

29
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:44,613
It is simply Prince Anan’s intention to have his sister also attending his wedding.

30
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:46,520
That’s why he decided to choose this time of the year.

31
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,586
His Highness surely loves and adores his little sister.

32
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:57,093
He loves Princess Anin as if she were his own daughter.

33
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,573
They are probably having a look around the Pine Palace at the moment.

34
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,106
It’s so beautiful.

35
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,620
Do you like it?

36
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,453
Yes.

37
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,100
Let’s go.

38
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,340
Do you think she’ll like it, Brother?

39
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,906
I’m curious too. She has gone up for quite a while.

40
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:29,906
There she is.

41
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,720
What do you think? Do you like it?

42
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:37,573
Is it similar to your design?

43
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:41,013
Very much, Brother.  Exactly what I have designed.

44
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,770
I can’t believe you had it built this fast.

45
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,280
Of course, it was fast. Our big brother was pressing on the workers day and night…

46
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,320
in order to have it built in time to welcome his beloved sister.

47
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:56,546
He paid more attention to this construction than his marriage house.

48
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,613
Is that so, Brother?

49
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,160
Yes, it is.

50
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,013
Whether it’s the Pine Palace or your ticket to return home, he had them all taken care of.

51
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:12,200
Our father often teases him whether you are actually Father’s or his daughter.

52
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,940
Thank you, Father.

53
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,613
- Hm?   /    - I mean..

54
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:18,773
Brother.

55
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,700
So, do you like it?

56
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,260
Mhm.

57
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,970
Hmm

58
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,946
What do you like the most?

59
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:26,500
Let’s go upstairs.

60
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,170
- Upstairs?     \     - Mhm.

61
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,180
Let’s go.

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,066
Hey, wait for me too.

63
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:32,986
Let’s go, Anin.

64
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:38,160
Did you already know that Princess Anin would come to attend the wedding, Your Highness?

65
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:42,186
Prince Anan just told me a few days ago.

66
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:47,226
Then how come Princess Alisa didn’t know about it?

67
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,866
Her children wanted to keep it a secret from her.

68
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,933
They wanted to amaze her.

69
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:59,293
Is that what the westerners call a ‘supply’, Your Highness?

70
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,973
A surprise, Prik.

71
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:04,640
Oh, surprise.

72
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:07,466
She is surely something, isn’t she?

73
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,893
My princess has taught me well, Your Highness.

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,200
Your Highness.

75
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,773
Princess Anin has requested for your audience.

76
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:29,053
Oh, she came?

77
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,893
A souvenir from England, Your Highness. I bought it as a gift for you.

78
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:03,440
Thank you for thinking of me, Princess.

79
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:07,786
It was very impudent of me earlier in the reception room.

80
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:11,320
Mother couldn’t let go of me…

81
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:14,440
so I wasn’t able to greet you properly.

82
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,080
Or even spared a second to say hello to Lady Pin and Prik.

83
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,933
Not a problem at all, Your Highness.

84
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:24,520
Don’t worry.

85
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,506
Your mother has been eagerly looking forward to your return.

86
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:33,040
She must be overwhelmed with joy to see you.

87
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,080
May I borrow Lady Pin and Prik to roam around the Pine Palace today, Your Highness?

88
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,213
Of course, Your Highness!

89
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:47,706
You don’t have to ask for my permission, Princess.

90
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,960
Why don’t you just ask her?

91
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,720
Do you want to go, Lady Pin?

92
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
I would love to, Your Highness.า

93
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,760
So would I, Your Highness.

94
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,333
You didn’t even wait for my permission, Prik.

95
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:19,280
You have to stay behind and make sure the preparation is done first.

96
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:23,880
Can you leave Prik with me for a while? I will let her follow afterwards.

97
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,773
Yes, Your Highness.

98
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,773
I bought a lot of things for you, Pin. There are snacks and also scarfs.

99
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:38,853
Aren’t they pretty?

100
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,520
What happened?

101
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:54,826
Ever since I visited you at the Lotus Palace, you have been looking at me as if I were someone else.

102
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,586
It’s probably because I haven’t seen you for a long time.ะ

103
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,200
Anin in my memory is still a sweet little girl.

104
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,826
But this Anin in front of me…is now a beautiful lady.

105
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:15,626
It makes me feel as if you were a stranger.

106
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:19,040
You are no longer that little Anin in my memory.

107
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:24,000
Is that so?

108
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:27,520
I understood.

109
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,640
Did I upset you?

110
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,160
No.

111
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:39,906
I just feel sorry for taking that little Anin away from you.

112
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,640
Please don’t say that.

113
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,266
I’m also not that little girl you used to know.

114
00:10:57,706 --> 00:10:59,520
But I think otherwise.

115
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:05,333
The moment I first saw you, I was very happy.

116
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,360
I was overwhelmed to see you again.

117
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,426
I wish I could hug you right then and there.

118
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:16,853
Anin.

119
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:24,920
Whether it’s young Pin, or Lady Pin in those letters you wrote to me,

120
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:28,106
or even the beautiful lady who is right in front of me now;

121
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,706
I love them all.

122
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:36,786
In what way?

123
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,226
As in…

124
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:46,733
Is that you, Prik?

125
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:52,386
What are you doing, being sneaky over there?

126
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:54,053
Why don’t you come in?

127
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:57,066
Can I go in, Your Highness?

128
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,200
You’re already at the door, why would you ask?

129
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,613
Come in. I have something for you too.

130
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,920
My princess!

131
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,960
Oh, my princess!

132
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:14,360
I miss you so much, Your Highness.

133
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:16,413
I miss you too.

134
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:19,093
But you have to let me go first. I can’t breathe.

135
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,360
My apology, Your Highness.

136
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:29,960
Ever since you went away, my life has been so dull, Your Highness.

137
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,610
The same goes for me. Life over there is so lonely. I don’t have any sidekicks at all.

138
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:41,266
Certainly, Your Highness. All over this land, I’m afraid I’m the only one who is always loyal to you.

139
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:45,680
That is true. I only have you.

140
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:48,346
What about you? Have you got yourself a boyfriend?

141
00:12:48,386 --> 00:12:50,693
Of course not, Your Highness.

142
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,840
Really?

143
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:53,306
Yes, Your Highness.

144
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:56,653
- I’d like to have someone at times…
- Mhm.

145
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,813
But when I come to think about it, I’d rather not.

146
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,053
Men are so annoying, Your Highness.

147
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,466
You are absolutely right.

148
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,840
Aww, my princess.

149
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
Now that you have Prik to take care of you.

150
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:19,546
I’ll go prepare the bedroom for you, Your Highness.

151
00:13:23,306 --> 00:13:25,253
My dear princess.

152
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,746
What a beauty you are.

153
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:32,720
Prik.

154
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:34,986
It’s for you.

155
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,253
Wow.

156
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:39,773
Enjoy it. I’ll go talk to Lady Pin first.

157
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:42,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

158
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,600
Is there something wrong?

159
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,413
Why are you looking so sullen? Did Prik say anything to upset you?

160
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,906
Please forget it. It’s not that important.

161
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,560
It’s certainly is.

162
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:24,933
Seeing you being like this always gives me a sinking feeling.

163
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,106
I want to see you smile.

164
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,733
You look so pretty when you smile.

165
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,120
Why don’t you ask Prik to smile for you then?

166
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,840
You surely miss each other so badly.

167
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,600
I see. Is that what upsets you?

168
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,306
Please wait.

169
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,586
I do miss Prik.

170
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:53,200
I heard that.

171
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:56,400
You have mentioned it a lot of times already.

172
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:01,000
I miss Prik, but only as a friend.

173
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,680
But with you…

174
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,440
It’s much more than that.

175
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,866
What do you mean?

176
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:27,533
I don’t understand.

177
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:34,240
I miss you, so much that I couldn’t put into words.

178
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,520
I only know that during those days and nights while I was waiting for your letters,น

179
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:44,893
it had felt so long and excruciating.

180
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:52,240
But when I was able to read just a short line from your letter,

181
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,853
I was delighted.

182
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,080
Every day, I was eagerly looking forward to your letter.

183
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,346
I kept asking myself that…

184
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,733
if my heart keeps yearning for someone all the time…

185
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:14,093
whether in my sleep or while I’m awake,

186
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:23,120
can I still call it an affection?

187
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,493
Until I have finally found an answer.

188
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:31,893
For me, it is more than just an affection.

189
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:37,866
It’s a burning desire.

190
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,946
What are you trying to imply? I do not understand.

191
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,466
You might not know the meaning of it today.

192
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,466
One day, I will make you understand the true meaning of those words.

193
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:14,813
Lady Pin is so hot.

194
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:20,146
I must try to get closer to her and win over her heart soon.

195
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:48,600
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

196
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:55,632
The Loyal Pin

197
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:15,655
I’m afraid Lady Pin doesn’t truly believe that you are yearning for her, Your Highness.

198
00:18:16,116 --> 00:18:18,996
Perhaps, she might think you were joking.

199
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:28,850
Do you think I had frightened her by saying that?

200
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,326
I don’t know, Your Highness.

201
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,210
But if someone tells me that they have a burning desire for me,

202
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:38,668
I’d think they’re not right in their heads.

203
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:40,508
Prik.

204
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:45,014
I’m truly sorry, Your Highness.

205
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,216
You were going too fast, Your Highness.

206
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:51,616
You threw yourself at her just on the very first day that you arrived.

207
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,700
I don’t have much time. I must hurry and do everything while I can.

208
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,115
Prik.

209
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:13,255
Yes, Your Highness?

210
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:14,442
Come and sit here.

211
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:16,406
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:21,650
I bought this for you.

213
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:23,891
You can ask for more if you like it.

214
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:36,652
Are you bribing me with this snack?

215
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:38,625
What do you want to know, Your Highness?

216
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,319
Clever.

217
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,588
Whom are you taking after this cleverness?

218
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:46,623
Your Highness, of course.

219
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:54,232
Then tell me the names of those bees who are swarming around my flower.

220
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,959
There are a lot of them, Your Highness.

221
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:02,294
Lady Pin.

222
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,595
I brought you the drink and snack that you like.

223
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,870
(Prik's voice: The first one is Thanit, her university close friend whom I can tell at first glance…)

224
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,716
(Prik's voice: that he has fallen head over heels with Lady Pin but is too afraid to let her know.)

225
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,319
(Prik's voice: And my lady is completely oblivious to it.)

226
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:21,172
An unfaithful close friend.

227
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:22,432
Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:24,833
But that’s not all.

229
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,619
Huh?

230
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:31,110
- (Prik's voice: The second one is a young magnate,)
- Thank you.

231
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,490
(Prik's voice: an older brother of Miss Sunee, Lady Pin’s close friend. His name is Kawin.)

232
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,580
(Prik's voice: He often gives my lady a ride home…)

233
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,860
(Prik's voice: but never has enough courage to come inside to greet Princess Patt.)

234
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:45,643
(Prik's voice: Not to mention a bunch of those guys at the university who are after her.)

235
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:50,013
(Prik's voice: I knew about this because I often overheard Miss Sunee talking)

236
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,627
(Prik's voice: when she came to study with Lady Pin at the palace.)

237
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,557
(Prik's voice: Lastly, your no.1 enemy – Master Kueakiat Kankuea.)

238
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:07,217
(Prik's voice: He is Prince Arnon’s comrade, and also the son of Prince Kiat – Princess Patt’s close friend.)

239
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:09,945
(Prik's voice: Master Kuea approaches Lady Pin through Princess Patt and Prince Arnon.)

240
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:12,988
(Prik's voice: So, he can often come and go at his will.)

241
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,921
(Prik's voice: He is always full of excuses to see Lady Pin.)

242
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:22,197
Lady Pin is so hot.

243
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:27,379
So hot? Does that mean popular, Your Highness?

244
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:28,637
You’re so smart.

245
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:34,095
Indeed, Your Highness. I’m afraid I can’t deny it.

246
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,850
It’s this Kueakiat who has made me unable to sleep for many nights.

247
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,926
You should be worried, Your Highness.

248
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:46,144
He is smart, handsome, and also comes from a noble family.

249
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:49,201
He is also very polite to everyone.

250
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:52,501
He is well-spoken and very charming with words, Your Highness.

251
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,166
Whose side are you on, Prik?

252
00:21:56,228 --> 00:21:58,175
Your Highness, of course.

253
00:21:58,872 --> 00:22:00,605
Then tell me,

254
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:05,339
between a son of a prince, and a princess like me, who has a higher rank?

255
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:08,252
A princess, Your Highness.

256
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:11,088
Is he considered of a higher nobility than I am?

257
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:13,030
No, Your Highness.

258
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:16,532
Between him and I, who is prettier?

259
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:22,642
Oh, in all my life, I still haven’t found anyone who is as beautiful as you, Your Highness.

260
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,713
Never compliment him in front of me again.

261
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:29,285
Yes, Your Highness.

262
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:39,345
Being apart from Lady Pin this time…

263
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:44,170
has made me realised my true feeling for her.

264
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,850
But I still do not know how she feels.

265
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:54,508
Yes, Your Highness. It seems very hard to tell how she feels.

266
00:22:55,935 --> 00:23:00,841
I must try to get closer to her and win over her heart soon.

267
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:28,823
For me, it is not just an affection. It’s a burning desire.

268
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,827
Desire.

269
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,819
Desire.

270
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,983
There you are, Lady Pin.

271
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,117
Are you all right?

272
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,130
Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:23:54,414 --> 00:23:56,401
Why are you looking for me, Your Highness?

274
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,636
During these days, you don’t have to help me with all the chores at the Lotus Palace.

275
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:02,686
I’d like you to take care of something for me.

276
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:06,681
What is it, Your Highness?

277
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:11,286
I was away for so long. How I really miss your delicious food.

278
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,850
Then, shall I prepare the food for you every day, Princess?

279
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:16,556
Please don’t, Your Highness.

280
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,903
I wouldn’t want to bother you with the cooking every day.

281
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:28,736
Is it possible to have Lady Pin prepare it for me every day instead?

282
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,903
Her cooking is almost as similar as yours.

283
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:33,078
Of course.

284
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:36,888
I have been thinking that I’d ask Lady Pin…

285
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:41,661
to help taking care of you while you’re staying at the Pine Palace.

286
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:44,614
Thank you, Your Highness.

287
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:49,645
So, I’d like to ask you for a favour.

288
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:54,402
If Princess Anin finds herself in need of anything, please help take care of it for me.

289
00:24:54,652 --> 00:24:56,372
Especially for her food.

290
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:59,121
I’ll leave this matter to you then, Lady Pin.

291
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:00,722
Well…

292
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:04,312
Must it be me, Your Highness?

293
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:05,659
Yes.

294
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:09,956
Aren’t you her closest companion, Lady Pin?

295
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,121
Or do you not wish to do it?

296
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:19,705
What is it?

297
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:21,682
Is there anything that you concern?

298
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:27,183
No, Your Highness.

299
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:41,638
Oh, you are very cunning…Oops, I mean very clever, Your Highness.

300
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:44,628
You have made use of your authority at the right time.

301
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:48,868
From now on, I can be with Lady Pin every day.

302
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:51,436
And I will do everything to make her fall for me.

303
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:52,819
Yes, Your Highness.

304
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,660
Oh, there they are, Your Highness.

305
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,086
Where is Lady Pin?

306
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,441
In the kitchen, Your Highness.

307
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,757
Why didn’t she come to see me?

308
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:32,113
Is my lady trying to avoid you, Your Highness?

309
00:26:51,992 --> 00:26:53,272
Are they not to her liking?

310
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:56,353
Or does the food there taste better?

311
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,303
Your Highness said that…

312
00:27:00,557 --> 00:27:05,063
“The food is delicious, but I’m so sick of the western food.”

313
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:07,655
What would she like to eat then?

314
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,219
Your Highness said that…

315
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,566
“Let Lady Pin come and ask me herself.”

316
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,267
Here I am, Your Highness.

317
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,521
Are you avoiding me?

318
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,251
No, I’m not.

319
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:45,281
What would you like to eat, Your Highness?

320
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,279
You.

321
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:48,099
Pardon?

322
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,270
No…I mean…

323
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:57,921
I wanted to ask whether you are sure that you are not avoiding me.

324
00:27:59,038 --> 00:27:59,931
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:08,343
Then, why didn’t you come and stay next to me?

326
00:28:10,113 --> 00:28:12,326
Why didn’t you bring me food by yourself…

327
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,157
and give me company?

328
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:18,472
You do know how lonely I feel.

329
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,040
I’m willing to comply to your wish, Your Highness.

330
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:39,570
But can you tell me first what it is that you would like to eat?

331
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:41,410
So that I can prepare it for you.

332
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,503
I’d like a rice porridge with lots of fried garlic and coriander.

333
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:53,815
Would you prefer it with shrimp, pork, fish, or chicken?

334
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:55,486
Shrimp, please.

335
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:57,276
Very well.

336
00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:01,490
Make it two, please.

337
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:06,628
Yes, Your Highness.

338
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:27,956
Here it is, a rice porridge with shrimp and lots of fried garlic and coriander

339
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:02,721
Your food is always my favorite.

340
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,433
Wait.

341
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:14,379
Please sit with me.

342
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,819
I ordered it for you too.

343
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:20,348
Isn’t this your favourite dish?

344
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:28,335
Did you want to please me by asking me to prepare the food that I like?

345
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:31,665
Maybe.

346
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:36,859
Please enjoy your food. I have other matters to take care of.

347
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,641
Please excuse me, Your Highness.

348
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:40,833
Wait.

349
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,846
What about my afternoon treat?

350
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:50,957
What would you like to have? I will prepare it for you.

351
00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:56,503
Fish puff made by Lady Pin.

352
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,503
Would you like them steamed or fried?

353
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:05,356
I’ll have them…steamed, please.

354
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:08,162
Very well.

355
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:23,289
(Steamed Fish Puff)

356
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:27,281
Steamed puff with fish filling, Your Highness. I made them myself.

357
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:32,734
Can you feed it to me?

358
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,610
Pardon?

359
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:39,457
I have to use both of my hands to open the textbook.

360
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:41,737
You certainly are imperious with your demands.

361
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:25,194
That’s my finger, Princess.

362
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:31,139
This fish puff is very delicious.

363
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:33,219
Can I have another bite?

364
00:32:54,652 --> 00:32:56,479
I beg your pardon, Your Highness?

365
00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:00,553
Princess Anin has requested for a massage and a body scrub?

366
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:03,859
Please don’t do that.

367
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:26,692
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

368
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:33,742
The Loyal Pin

369
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,786
How about this one? Is it pretty?

370
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:09,659
Pin.

371
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,012
What are you staring at?

372
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:18,652
Well…you…you left one button open, Your Highness.

373
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,786
The neckline is too low.

374
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:23,909
Hmm, too low?

375
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,266
Yes.

376
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:30,253
What about this?

377
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:38,699
I said the neckline was too low, why did you unbutton it further?

378
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:42,740
This way, that neckline earlier wouldn’t be considered too low.

379
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,933
How very tricky of you.

380
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,406
I saw you kept staring at it.

381
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:52,092
So, I made it easier for you to look at.

382
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,512
Should I undo another button?

383
00:34:58,506 --> 00:34:59,439
Pin.

384
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,786
I’ll leave you alone then.

385
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,386
I beg your pardon, Your Highness?

386
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:12,932
Princess Anin has requested for a massage and a facial scrub?

387
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:17,553
Yes, please take care of it for me, will you?

388
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,486
What about Prik, Your Highness?

389
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
Her Highness does not wish any servant to touch her bare skin.

390
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:26,799
She’s probably embarrassed.

391
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:32,067
The only person who is allowed to touch her bare skin is you, Lady Pin.

392
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:41,851
How will you know where to scrub if you are looking the other way?

393
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:43,878
You should look at me.

394
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,059
Yes, Your Highness.

395
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:05,451
Look with your eyes wide open, Pin.

396
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:12,379
What are you doing?

397
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,626
You said earlier that you felt as if I were a stranger.

398
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:22,299
I’m trying to make you feel more familiar with me.

399
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:25,726
So that you will finally understand the meaning of ‘a burning desire’.

400
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,626
I’m leaving then.

401
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:36,002
If you leave, I will pull down the blanket further.

402
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:39,387
Please don’t do that!

403
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:46,232
If you keep teasing me like this,

404
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,933
I will not come to visit you anymore.

405
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,131
Who said I was teasi ng?

406
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:17,247
I am serious.

407
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,598
Very serious.

408
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,251
Are you not feeling well, my lady? Why are you flushing all red?

409
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:53,504
Your princess has been awfully naughty after she came back.

410
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,052
How naughty, my lady?

411
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:03,191
She often made my heart pounding and skipping a beat.

412
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:05,238
Skipping a beat, my lady?

413
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,560
Never mind.

414
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:11,979
Please tell your princess that
I won’t be able to be her chaperone from tomorrow on.

415
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:14,253
Why, my lady?

416
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:16,735
I have something to take care of at the university.

417
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,412
I’ll stay away from her for a while.

418
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:23,559
Did she really say…

419
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,974
that she is busy and must be at the university?

420
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:29,174
Yes, Your Highness. What would you like me to tell Lady Pin then?

421
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:36,826
Tell her not to worry. She doesn’t have to take care of me anymore.

422
00:40:38,173 --> 00:40:39,000
Yes, Your Highness.

423
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,880
Did she not complain at all?

424
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:45,092
No, my lady.

425
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:49,019
Did she just agree so easily?

426
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:55,486
Yes, my lady. Her Highness said
you shouldn’t worry and please feel free to do as you like.

427
00:40:57,852 --> 00:41:03,332
What a relief. Now I can have some time to be with myself.

428
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:28,565
At least, I do not have to see her today.

429
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,633
I’m coming with you.

430
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:54,893
I thought you said I could feel free to do as I like.

431
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,972
But I didn’t say that I would leave you alone.

432
00:41:59,714 --> 00:42:02,762
You also said that I didn’t have to take care of you anymore.

433
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:06,042
That’s right. From now on, I will take care of you instead.

434
00:42:06,972 --> 00:42:10,202
But I have a report to finish.
I won’t be able to join you in your mischievous deeds.

435
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:14,155
Princess Patt already gave me her approval.
Go and ask her if you don’t believe me.

436
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:19,638
Let’s go, Perm!

437
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,140
Sunee, don’t you think something is a bit off with this sentence?

438
00:42:54,432 --> 00:42:56,192
Yeah, I think it’s not correct.

439
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:04,652
Hey, don’t you think it feels a little eerie today?

440
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,680
Yeah, it’s giving me goosebumps.

441
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:33,206
Lady Pin.

442
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,967
If you are unable to stay to finish the report with us,

443
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:38,480
we wouldn’t mind if you’ll go home first.

444
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:42,979
That’s right. Please don’t worry, we can handle it.

445
00:43:45,138 --> 00:43:46,205
Don’t worry.

446
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:48,469
Just ignore me and do what you must do.

447
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:55,559
Please don’t say that, Your Highness. I assure you that we wouldn’t mind at all.

448
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,172
Yes, please leave it to us, Your Highness.

449
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:10,166
Thank you then. Please cover her part too.

450
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:11,452
Let’s go, Pin.

451
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,167
Hold on, Anin.

452
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:14,587
Come, let’s go.

453
00:44:39,392 --> 00:44:40,326
Pin.

454
00:44:41,592 --> 00:44:42,526
Are you mad at me?

455
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:45,779
When will you stop bothering me with your mischievous deeds?

456
00:44:46,072 --> 00:44:47,592
I have work to do, Your Highness.

457
00:44:47,912 --> 00:44:49,819
I’m lonely. I don’t have any friends here.

458
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:52,211
I just want to know what you usually do in your daily life.

459
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:54,706
But I’m not free today.

460
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:02,139
I just want to spend as much time with you as possible before I have to go back.

461
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:07,652
But if it bothers you so much, or makes you feel weary…

462
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:10,248
I’m sorry.

463
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:35,282
Anin, do you remember Lady Uangfah?

464
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:36,722
Do you like it?

465
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:41,387
I never expected you to blossom into such a beauty, Your Highness.

466
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:04,882
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

467
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:11,920
The Loyal Pin

468
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:50,753
I heard that Lady Uangfah, a daughter of Princess Dararai…

469
00:46:50,846 --> 00:46:53,646
will pay a visit to Princess Alisa at the main palace today.

470
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,300
Why did you mention about it all of a sudden, Koi?

471
00:46:58,126 --> 00:47:01,633
I saw you keep looking for Princess Anin, my lady.

472
00:47:06,086 --> 00:47:08,900
Am I that obvious?

473
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,513
Yes, my lady.

474
00:47:10,673 --> 00:47:14,486
Your neck is so long like a giraffe right now.

475
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,540
Does Princess Anin have to stay at the main palace to welcome her cousin?

476
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:26,940
Is that why she cannot come to the Lotus Palace today?

477
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:29,233
Yes, my lady.

478
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,060
The weather here is quite hot.

479
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:43,500
Yes.

480
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,886
Oh, there she is. Please come here.

481
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:10,020
Do you remember Lady Uangfah?

482
00:48:10,673 --> 00:48:11,966
I certainly do.

483
00:48:12,113 --> 00:48:14,326
A daughter of Princess Dararai.

484
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:17,726
Do you remember her, Lady Uang?

485
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,726
My little princess that I remember was very naughty and unladylike.

486
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,326
I never expected you to blossom into such a beauty, Your Highness.

487
00:48:29,646 --> 00:48:31,286
Is that a compliment?

488
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,726
Yes.

489
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:35,593
I agree with you, Lady Uang.

490
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:38,540
When she was little, she was very naughty like a monkey.

491
00:48:38,793 --> 00:48:45,833
Mother told me that the Pine Palace built from your design is truly captivating.

492
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,966
Would you mind giving me a tour around your palace, Your Highness?

493
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,806
My pleasure, Lady Uang.

494
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,086
I’ll leave her in your care then.

495
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:56,366
Yes, Brother.

496
00:49:06,593 --> 00:49:07,580
Please come in.

497
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,313
Your palace looks so wonderful.

498
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:22,713
Very warm and cosy, Your Highness.

499
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:26,766
Do you like it?

500
00:49:28,406 --> 00:49:29,686
Yes, Your Highness.

501
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,380
Although Father’s palace is staying is grand and elegant,

502
00:49:34,526 --> 00:49:40,206
it does not feel as pleasant and homelike.

503
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,860
But from an architect’s point of view, that palace is undeniably striking and irreplaceable.

504
00:49:47,473 --> 00:49:50,660
That’s because you’re studying architecture, Your Highness.

505
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:56,300
Nevertheless, I still think that your father’s palace is stunningly beautiful.

506
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:20,193
This is an English tea that I brought from London.

507
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:22,660
Please try it, Lady Uang.

508
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,513
Thank you, Your Highness.

509
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:36,900
It’s delightful, Your Highenss.

510
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,980
Really?

511
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,566
Yes.

512
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:44,500
Perhaps, it’s because you made it for me, Your Highness.

513
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,366
Now, you’re flattering me, Lady Uang.

514
00:50:49,353 --> 00:50:52,566
You said as if I had coated my words with honey.

515
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:56,540
The tea is indeed very delicious, Your Highness.

516
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,046
How is your father doing lately?

517
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,580
Father’s health has been ailing for quite some time, Your Highness.

518
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,820
It got even worse the day before the ceremony.

519
00:51:12,193 --> 00:51:16,406
I’m afraid Mother won’t be able to attend Prince Anan’s wedding

520
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,126
for she must stay by Father’s side.

521
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:24,140
Ever since I returned, I have yet to find an opportunity to pay respect to your parents.

522
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,620
I must find some time to visit them.

523
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,953
Should you ever find time to visit there,

524
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,353
I’d like to take you around, Your Highness.

525
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,926
Thank you, Lady Uang.

526
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:36,100
My pleasure, Your Highness.

527
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,886
Anin, I’ve brought you…

528
00:51:46,993 --> 00:51:48,646
My apology, Your Highness.

529
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,513
I did not know that you have a guest. I will return some other time.

530
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,833
Please stay, Lady Pin.

531
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:05,540
Lady Uang, this is Lady Pin.

532
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:08,820
Lady Pin, this is Lady Uang.

533
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,446
Good morning, Lady Uang.

534
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:16,766
Good morning. I have only heard how beautiful the Pine Palace is,

535
00:52:17,073 --> 00:52:19,953
so I asked Her Highness if I could have a look at her palace, Lady Pin.

536
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:21,950
Yes.

537
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,926
I’m afraid it’s time for me to leave.

538
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,420
Princess Alisa has invited me to go to Yaowarat with her this evening.

539
00:52:31,793 --> 00:52:37,766
Now I know why Mother didn’t ask me to go anywhere with her today.

540
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,006
She already has her favourite niece to go out with her.

541
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,553
Goodbye, Your Highness. I will see you later.

542
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:14,820
Yes.

543
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,566
Goodbye, Lady Pin.

544
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,940
Goodbye, Lady Uang.

545
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,673
It seems you still do not wish to part way with her.

546
00:53:44,966 --> 00:53:46,900
Why don’t you go to Yaowarat with her too?

547
00:53:52,593 --> 00:53:54,206
Who said I wanted to go to Yaowarat?

548
00:53:55,126 --> 00:53:56,740
I only wish to stay with you.

549
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:58,860
I don’t want to go anywhere else.

550
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:00,820
Are you sure?

551
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:04,513
It hasn’t been long since you returned,

552
00:54:04,766 --> 00:54:07,953
but your palace seems to be welcoming a lot of guests already.

553
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:11,473
That’s not true at all.

554
00:54:12,033 --> 00:54:16,286
The only guest I have welcomed so far is Lady Uang who is my cousin.

555
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,380
What do you have there?

556
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,966
Did you make them for me as an apology for yesterday?

557
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,313
Certainly not.

558
00:54:43,086 --> 00:54:46,433
I just remember how you love the scent of cork tree flowers.

559
00:54:48,153 --> 00:54:49,940
So, I made them as a garland for you.

560
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:54,486
You can put them in your bedroom for a pleasant and sweet aroma.

561
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,726
How very lovely.

562
00:55:08,553 --> 00:55:10,286
Can I put it here?

563
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,206
I already gave it to you.

564
00:55:14,073 --> 00:55:17,940
You may do anything as you wish to it, Your Highness.

565
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,620
Hmm, really?

566
00:55:24,526 --> 00:55:25,566
Then…

567
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:46,513
Can I put it here?

568
00:55:48,286 --> 00:55:49,673
You are very naughty.

569
00:55:59,246 --> 00:56:04,553
How come the flower garland on your hair looks prettier than the others?

570
00:56:07,273 --> 00:56:09,313
I made them all the same.

571
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,700
If one looks pretty, the rest must be too.

572
00:56:17,913 --> 00:56:18,780
Is that so?

573
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,593
But in my eyes,

574
00:56:28,273 --> 00:56:31,820
as long as you have it on you…

575
00:56:33,286 --> 00:56:38,086
everything seems to look lovelier than ever.

576
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,700
The scent of these flowers is so sweet.

577
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:09,633
But the scent from your cheeks…

578
00:57:13,153 --> 00:57:14,566
are much sweeter.

579
00:57:40,593 --> 00:57:42,620
What should I do to know how she feels?

580
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,353
Make her jealous, Your Highness.

581
00:57:44,913 --> 00:57:47,153
If Lady Pin is jealous,

582
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,566
that means she also has feelings for you.

583
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,873
Are you jealous when you see me with Lady Uang?

584
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:54,713
No, Your Highness.

585
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,713
What did you say? A tennis match?

586
00:57:57,793 --> 00:58:00,193
Why don’t you invite Master Kuea too, Brother?

587
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,460
Today, I will finally get to know Kuea,

588
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,340
my archenemy.

589
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,793
Ouch!

590
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,513
An ace!  A point for Anin.

591
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:13,593
Not too much, Anin. Or else I would be too full to walk back home.

592
00:58:14,766 --> 00:58:16,180
Just stay here with me then.

593
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:29,873
🎵Nobody might know what it is…🎵

594
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:39,753
🎵that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you.🎵

595
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:45,900
🎵Nobody might agree with our love,🎵

596
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:52,320
🎵But please be patient and always…🎵

597
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:59,780
🎵wait for that day when you and I…🎵

598
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:04,886
🎵can finally reunite as we have promised each other…🎵

599
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:16,100
🎵that we’d wait until that day.🎵

600
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:28,086
🎵Until that day I will hold you in my arms🎵

601
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:39,300
🎵kissing you through the night. Can you wait for me, my baby?🎵

602
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,520
