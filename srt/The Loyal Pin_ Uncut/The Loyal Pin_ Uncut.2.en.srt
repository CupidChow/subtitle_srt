1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,202
I’m Anin. What’s your name?

2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:05,384
Pilanthita, Your Highness.

3
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:08,534
You don’t have to use royal terms with me.

4
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:10,235
We are friends now.

5
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:16,760
Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to survive those lonely and miserable time.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,419
I will never leave you. I don’t want you to be lonely.

7
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:22,648
I’m thinking of sending Anin to study in England.

8
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:26,315
Father wants me to go study abroad?

9
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:33,646
You must be so lonely when Princess Anin is away, Lady Pin.

10
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:44,247
In the next 2 months?

11
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,346
Yes.

12
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:13,128
Is there something wrong, Lady Pin?

13
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:17,771
Is it already certain that Princess Anin will go to study abroad?

14
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:24,860
Yes. You must feel neglected for not getting this opportunity too.

15
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:35,222
Please don’t be. Although you cannot go abroad, I promise to support you until you graduate from a university.

16
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:39,657
I didn’t feel neglected, Your Highness.

17
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,085
I’m only sad because Princess and I will be apart for a long time.

18
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:27,328
The Loyal Pin

19
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:32,149
I’m still a juvenile, Brother. Why do I have to go study somewhere so far away?

20
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:35,097
Being there while you’re still young will give you an advantage.

21
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,724
But I don’t want to go.

22
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:50,270
Anin, you should never let an opportunity passes by when it comes your way.

23
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,998
But if it’s something that I do not want, can you still call it an opportunity?

24
00:03:57,765 --> 00:04:04,567
There you go, you and your endless questions. You’re truly one of a kind.

25
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:09,020
But this is good. It means you are perfect for studying abroad.

26
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,786
Do I have to study abroad just because I like to ask questions?

27
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,121
Why can I not study here in my home country?

28
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:22,136
Because the world is so wide.

29
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,056
It is full of wonders. You can ask questions and learn as many things as you like.

30
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:29,261
Just like how you’re questioning me now.

31
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:37,288
Our country is, in fact, not considered underdeveloped.

32
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:40,999
We, however, often hesitate…

33
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:44,409
and are afraid to ask questions.

34
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:49,164
More awfully, we are afraid to know the answers.

35
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:55,390
If you insist to further your study here, you might eventually stop asking questions too.

36
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:17,697
My princess, do you no longer want to stay with me?

37
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,251
It won’t be long. I will return soon.

38
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:28,214
But without you, how can I live, Your Highness?

39
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:33,741
I told Father to send you to stay with Lady Pin.

40
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:35,705
That way, she wouldn’t feel lonely,

41
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:38,038
and you will have someone to look after you.

42
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,152
You mean, to protect me, Your Highness?

43
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,539
Yes.

44
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:48,112
While I’m away, you must take care of Lady Pin for me.

45
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:51,222
You have my words, Your Highness. I will take extremely good care of her…

46
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:54,956
and will never let even an insect come near her.

47
00:05:54,956 --> 00:06:00,153
I have a lot of preparations to make during these days, so I might not be able to go see Lady Pin that often.

48
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:02,048
She probably feels quite lonely.

49
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:06,989
She sure does, Your Highness. Perhaps, my lady is now weeping…

50
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:11,871
and carves all the mangoes in the Lotus Palace to relieve her sadness.

51
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:21,713
That’s plausible. She always carves mangoes when she is sad or upset.

52
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:42,535
Pin, when will you stop carving mangoes?

53
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:46,087
You’ve been doing this since early morning. All the mangoes in this palace are almost gone.

54
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:52,040
I feel ashamed for failing Princess Patt with my exam result.

55
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,424
Then should we go do something else?

56
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:05,474
Let’s go to Yaowarat and eat something there. Or anything that would make you feel better.

57
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:08,640
No, Your Highness.

58
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:11,560
I’m going to carve the mango.

59
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:14,641
It helps me concentrate.

60
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:20,306
When I can concentrate, my mind will be calm and wisdom will arise.

61
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,520
Only then can my worries and sadness be washed away.

62
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,640
All the maids in the Lotus Palace must be so busy preparing mangoes for Lady Pin, Your Highness.

63
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:41,096
Prik, I’m worried about her.

64
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:45,230
You should go and stay with her now, so that she wouldn’t feel lonely.

65
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,857
That’s very clever of you, Your Highness.

66
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,515
Wait.

67
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:50,680
Yes, Your Highness?

68
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,117
Tell Lady Pin that I will go see her myself when I’m done with all the preparations.

69
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,497
Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,901
Koi! Koi!

71
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:21,592
Are these mangoes for Lady Pin?

72
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:29,147
Yes, she has been carving mangoes all day all night since she knew about Princess Anin.

73
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:33,804
Hmm…that’s not a lot though. This means Lady Pin is not that sad.

74
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,582
What do you mean? Look that way.

75
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,784
Oh my goodness!

76
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,251
Aren’t you going to help?

77
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,407
Wait for me too.

78
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,485
Did Princess tell you to stay with me?

79
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:58,440
Yes, my lady. Her Highness also said that she might be busy making preparations during these days,

80
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,491
so she might not be able to go to school with you. Please don’t wait for her, my lady.

81
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,112
She will not go to school with me?

82
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,962
Yes, my lady.

83
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:24,000
This means, I won’t be able to see her during these days.

84
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:32,402
But Her Highness said that she would come see you whenever she can, my lady.

85
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:05,965
Are the documents ready?

86
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,389
Yes. / - Good.

87
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,491
Let’s go take a photo, then we can go to the embassy later on.

88
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,615
Please have some of these Steamed Rice Dumplings, Your Highness.

89
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,573
You ate very little this morning.

90
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:55,813
To think that Anin will leave me soon, I have lost all my appetite.

91
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,996
Is Princess Anin doing well, Your Highness?

92
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:04,913
It’s been many days since I have last seen her.

93
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,552
She has to get everything ready before travelling abroad,

94
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:13,814
so she is out with her brother almost every day.

95
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:18,689
We’re living in the same house but I hardly see her face.

96
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,446
Princess Anin must be very busy.

97
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:36,240
Please don’t be sad, Your Highness.

98
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,128
It’s for the princess’ own good.

99
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:32,014
My lady.

100
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,939
Please don’t cry.

101
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:41,079
Look at me. I love Princess Anin so much that I can die for her.

102
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:43,390
But I still don’t cry.

103
00:13:43,902 --> 00:13:47,883
We should feel happy for Her Highness, my lady.

104
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:56,960
Won’t you feel sad or lonely when Princess Anin is away?

105
00:13:57,472 --> 00:13:59,706
Of course, I will feel lonely, my lady.

106
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,938
But Her Highness will soon return.

107
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:13,262
By soon, do you know how long it would be?

108
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:19,112
Hmm…maybe a year, my lady.

109
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,910
No, not a year.

110
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,461
7 years.

111
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,694
7 years?

112
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,174
7 years, my lady?

113
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,806
That’s almost half of my life.

114
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:58,128
How will I live then? What should I do, my lady?

115
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:07,120
So, you did not know that Princess Anin will be away for a long time.

116
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,895
It’s all right.

117
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:44,602
[Sobbing]

118
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:03,391
[Sobbing]

119
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,438
Your Highness!

120
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,341
What’s wrong, Prik?

121
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,268
I want to hug you while I still can, Your Highness.

122
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:34,615
So that I won’t miss you when you are away.

123
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:35,530
Let go of me first.

124
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,211
No, I won’t!

125
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:45,249
Lady Pin just told me that you will be away for 7 years.

126
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:46,873
Yes.

127
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:53,732
How is she doing?

128
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:58,854
Since she knew that you have to go abroad,

129
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:02,784
she has been looking so sad and miserable, Your Highness.

130
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:07,752
She looks more and more lifeless every day. She usually doesn’t talk much…

131
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:14,188
but now she hardly utter a word to anyone, Your Highness.

132
00:17:14,905 --> 00:17:16,902
Is it that bad?

133
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:19,967
Yes,Your Highness.

134
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:27,098
No one at the Lotus Palace dares to mention about you going abroad.

135
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:30,208
Tell me more about it.

136
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:41,626
When Princess Anin is away, our palace will surely feel so quiet.

137
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:45,037
Yes, I will miss her so much.

138
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:48,478
- Shh!!
- Mhm, when Her Highness is around…

139
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,238
I’m so sorry, my lady. I will never mention about Princess Anin going abroad…

140
00:17:58,238 --> 00:18:01,665
If anyone ever mentions about Princess Anin going abroad,

141
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:08,629
Lady Pin will suddenly cover her ears, and quickly walk the other way, Your Highness.

142
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:14,627
How is Lady Pin doing?

143
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,322
Has she carved out every mango in this palace?

144
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,093
Even mangoes will not do, Prik.

145
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:24,357
There, she even went on to carving papayas.

146
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,783
My poor Lady Pin. She must be feeling so sad that she has to carve a papaya.

147
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:41,095
That’s not all, Your Highness.

148
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:44,002
What is it?

149
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,432
One day, Princess Patt accidentally slipped out…

150
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:53,959
that the date for your departure has already been set, Your Highness.

151
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:56,984
His Highness has already set the departure date for Princess Anin.

152
00:18:57,522 --> 00:18:59,934
Have you heard about it, Lady Pin?

153
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:01,965
Not yet, Your Highness.

154
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:06,436
When will she leave?

155
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:09,736
In two weeks.

156
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:18,039
Lady Pin was almost in tears after she heard it, Your Highness.

157
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,460
How did you know she went crying in her room?

158
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:45,603
I was eavesdropping on her bedroom door, Your Highness.

159
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,921
Prying as usual.

160
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:54,195
Lady Pin was crying so hard that my heart ached for her.

161
00:19:54,195 --> 00:20:02,635
I almost gathered up my sarong and ran here to tell you to change your mind, Your Highness.

162
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,908
Is that so?

163
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:09,651
Yes, Your Highness. Lady Pin was weeping her heart out.

164
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,164
I must go and console her then.

165
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,234
You’re smiling!

166
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,334
Am I pretty?

167
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:51,960
The Loyal Pin

168
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:58,838
The Loyal Pin

169
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:43,022
You’re smiling!

170
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,673
Anin.

171
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,841
Haven’t seen you for a while. How I really miss you.

172
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:53,424
Well, you’ve been very busy. You barely have time to play around.

173
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,396
That is true.

174
00:21:56,944 --> 00:22:01,055
It was too tedious. I had to run around doing this and that.

175
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,765
I’m so weary and exhausted.

176
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:11,620
You haven’t been away yet, but it’s already impossible for me to see you that often.

177
00:22:13,177 --> 00:22:15,513
I’m no longer busy, though.

178
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:20,068
From now on, I’d cling on to you until you get bored of me.

179
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:24,517
Who could be bored of you, Your Highness?

180
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:30,128
Very well, can you make me Salak in syrup then?

181
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,460
I’ve been craving so badly for your dessert.

182
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,752
Let’s go, shall we?

183
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:46,020
Your Highness.

184
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,863
Your Highness.

185
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:50,407
Can I take the kite down now?

186
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,069
Why aren’t you eating?

187
00:23:10,976 --> 00:23:15,377
My lady has lost her appetite lately. She is in sorrow.

188
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:21,333
Please eat a little more, Your Highness.

189
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,536
Why? Why have you lost your appetite?

190
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:32,260
Because she still couldn’t accept the fact that you have to go away, Your Highness.

191
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:33,820
Prik.

192
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,125
Yes, Your Highness?

193
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:36,857
Can you do me a favour?

194
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:38,127
Please name it, Your Highness.

195
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:43,243
Can you go away and leave us alone for a while?

196
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,818
Your wish is my command, Your Highness.

197
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:53,980
Let me take this away for you, my lady.

198
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,905
Is there something wrong?

199
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:37,052
Why did you refuse to answer me?

200
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,761
Your eyes are so red.

201
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:49,860
If one day I have to be away, will you feel lonely?

202
00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:00,970
Do you remember when you asked me whether I’d be lonely if you have to go away?

203
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,144
I have only come to realize the answer today.

204
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:08,334
Yes, I will be lonely.

205
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:40,046
I never want you to stay far away from me.

206
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:52,714
Please cry no more.

207
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,260
Let’s spend the rest of our time together…as best as we can.

208
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:09,474
After seven days, when the sky is finally painted with an afternoon light,

209
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:15,627
the golden royal urn is lifted onto the bier.

210
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:18,150
Together with Her Majesty the Queen…

211
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:28,489
and other young royal grandchildren,

212
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:33,934
each holding an incense stick, with a candle and flowers, for paying homage.

213
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,388
Adding a variety of incense…

214
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:45,590
making the air filled with aromatic fragrance.

215
00:27:53,263 --> 00:27:56,324
Looking at the burning flame,

216
00:27:56,324 --> 00:28:01,421
her heart is mourning for…

217
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:19,452
I’m very fortunate to be able to attend the Loy Krathong festival with Your Highness this year…

218
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:22,225
before you must be travelling abroad.

219
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,402
Where shall we float our Krathong this time?

220
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,415
Prik.

221
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:12,226
Anin!

222
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:15,901
Stop fooling around, Your Highness. Come and help me make the Krathong.

223
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:20,787
Please don’t, Your Highness! Don’t!

224
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:21,817
BANG!

225
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,294
Please look after my parents for me.

226
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,760
You’re giving me a headache, Your Highness.

227
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:34,260
I’m tired of giving you a lecture. Come help me make the Krathong, Your Highness.

228
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,538
I want to keep hearing your voice while I still can.

229
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:52,221
I won’t be hearing it for a very long time.

230
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:59,100
I would really miss arguing with you.

231
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,297
You look so beautiful.

232
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:35,095
Please don’t change the subject, Your Highness. Help me make the Krathong.

233
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:48,721
Pin, am I pretty?

234
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:14,309
Come, come. A beautiful Krathong for only 2 baht. Come and get it.

235
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:18,156
Come this way for a beautiful Krathong for only 2 baht.

236
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:21,059
A beautiful Krathong for 2 baht only.

237
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:24,049
A lot of people come to the festival this year.

238
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,269
Yes.

239
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:29,007
Do you want a Krathong? It’s for 2 baht only.

240
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,510
What is it, Pin?

241
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:45,700
I think I saw an acquaintance of Princess Patt.

242
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,429
Then let’s go somewhere else.

243
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:50,354
Yes.

244
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:11,474
Let’s float our Krathong here.

245
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:15,660
You’ll be safe from all the eyes and ears of Princess Patt’s acquaintance.

246
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:22,126
Did I disappoint you for bringing you to float our Krathong here instead of a big river?

247
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:28,928
Not at all. As long as I’m with you, any place is good for me.

248
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:35,720
This place is also not crowded. So, it feels as if there were only two of us here.

249
00:32:37,408 --> 00:32:39,489
Why didn’t we just do it in the palace?

250
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:43,288
So that we don’t have to sneak out like this.

251
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,152
I want to cherish every wonderful moment with you…

252
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:52,212
before we will part ways.

253
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:59,393
Let’s float our Krathong.

254
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,399
Yes.

255
00:33:40,328 --> 00:33:48,414
From now on while I’m away, I wish you’d only find good things in life.

256
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:55,873
It would be many years after this until we can float our Krathong together again.

257
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:58,657
Just a few years.

258
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:03,982
Not a few at all. It’s 7 years.

259
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:10,215
I will study hard and try to come back before that.

260
00:34:24,444 --> 00:34:25,912
Yes.

261
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:35,472
Did I make you cry again?

262
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:41,615
You always cry every time you see my face.

263
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:50,671
How do you know I wasn’t crying when I didn’t see your face?

264
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:55,644
You didn’t make me cry, Your Highness.

265
00:34:55,644 --> 00:34:58,335
I just couldn’t hold back the tears.

266
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:11,052
I promise that I will write to you every day.

267
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:46,173
My lady! You have a letter from Princess Anin.

268
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:49,062
Oh, look at those smiles you have there, my lady.

269
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:13,420
The Loyal Pin

270
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:20,272
The Loyal Pin

271
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:54,976
How I wish you didn’t have to go.

272
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:57,997
You must write to me often, my dear.

273
00:36:58,654 --> 00:36:59,696
Yes, Mother.

274
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,188
We should be going, Mother.

275
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:36,212
Goodbye, Mother. Please take good care of yourself.

276
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:39,000
Yes, dear.

277
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:45,408
Take care of yourself too.

278
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,672
Goodbye, Your Highness.

279
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:03,534
Have a safe journey, Princess.

280
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,224
My lady!!

281
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:16,294
My lady, where are you?

282
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:18,007
I’m here.

283
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:20,063
Oh, there you are, my lady.

284
00:40:20,063 --> 00:40:23,615
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

285
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:25,177
Why are you looking for me?

286
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:28,876
A letter from Princess Anin, my lady.

287
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:37,222
Enough with your teasing. Give me the letter.

288
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:40,752
Oh, look at those smiles you have there, my lady.

289
00:40:40,752 --> 00:40:44,454
I know better than anyone how a letter from Princess Anin…

290
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:48,442
can brighten your soul and brings so much joy to you.

291
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:52,226
Last time when the letter came a bit late,

292
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:57,961
you looked so glum and gloomy that I didn’t dare to say a word, my lady.

293
00:40:58,504 --> 00:41:00,657
You seem to be very chattery today, Prik.

294
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,213
This one is yours.

295
00:41:24,961 --> 00:41:31,320
I…miss…you…so…much.

296
00:41:33,382 --> 00:41:36,561
My lady, aren’t you going to read your letter?

297
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,772
I’d rather read it when you’re not around. Bye.

298
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:45,425
Aww, my lady. You’re having it so bad.

299
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:30,103
Autumn is approaching but the weather here is still as cold as ever.

300
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:36,399
How fortunate that today is Sunday, so I can lay in bed until late in the morning.

301
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:44,160
I have something funny to tell you too.

302
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,992
I slipped and fell on the walkway today, with both of my legs pointing upwards.

303
00:42:48,992 --> 00:42:52,979
My friends were laughing so hard, especially for Emma.

304
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:02,941
Emma couldn’t stop laughing.

305
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:05,759
Fortunately, I wasn’t one who would be embarrassed so easily.

306
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:10,287
Although a little discomposed, I didn’t feel embarrassed.

307
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:19,333
Today, I went to the art exhibition at the museum on a school field trip.

308
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,572
I enjoyed it very much.

309
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:25,506
I’m thinking of pursuing my study in fine arts.

310
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:31,933
But I’d also love to design my own house. So, architecture is also an interesting choice.

311
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:35,759
What do you think I should study?

312
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:43,195
It’s probably almost at the end of rainy season there, and winter is soon to come.

313
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:47,911
The frogs must be croaking so loud all night that you can hardly sleep.

314
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:51,833
It’s been a while since I have last heard the frogs croaking during the rain.

315
00:43:52,218 --> 00:43:54,527
Rainy season here is dull and miserable.

316
00:43:54,527 --> 00:44:00,571
People don’t seem to be so jolly like those frogs in our country.

317
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:05,568
I have been here for quite some time, but I still couldn’t get used to it.

318
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:13,317
I miss home. I miss Father, Mother, Brothers, and Prik.

319
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:21,441
Most of all, I miss this person whom I long for so terribly that often makes me cry.

320
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,646
I miss you, Pin.

321
00:44:57,209 --> 00:45:02,799
It’s raining here every night. I could barely put myself to sleep.

322
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:05,854
I miss you every night.

323
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:19,437
It is always cold there. Please take good care of yourself and make sure you are always warm.

324
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:22,683
I don’t want you to fall sick.

325
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,439
Did you get any bruises from falling down?

326
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:30,664
Has anyone applied a soothing balm for you?

327
00:46:31,344 --> 00:46:34,587
I’m afraid I won’t be able to advise you on your choice of study.

328
00:46:34,587 --> 00:46:38,350
For I know that you will finally come to recognise…

329
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,838
what it is that your heart truly wants.

330
00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:53,950
I have carefully kept all of your diary postcards in a casket.

331
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:59,770
And I still cross out the calendar every day, counting down to the day you will return.

332
00:47:09,537 --> 00:47:14,942
There is not even a minute that I wouldn’t think of you.

333
00:47:32,028 --> 00:47:34,674
I miss you so dearly.

334
00:47:35,263 --> 00:47:42,298
How is life at the university? Have you found another best friend instead of me?

335
00:47:46,808 --> 00:47:51,005
I have been studying in the Faculty of Arts for almost a year now.

336
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:53,885
The world outside our palace is surprisingly amazing.

337
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:59,424
I have made a lot of friends. The closest ones are Sunee and Thanit.

338
00:47:59,424 --> 00:48:05,285
But don’t you worry. You will always be the most important friend of mine.

339
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:09,422
Lady Pin, we’ve been looking for you everywhere.

340
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:14,265
Are you writing to the princess again?

341
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:15,622
Yes.

342
00:48:21,854 --> 00:48:24,458
Why are you looking for me?

343
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,999
We want to know if you want to go out for an ice-cream.

344
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:30,470
We have no other classes this afternoon. And it will be too boring to go home early.

345
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:33,188
My older brother, Kawin, is coming to pick me up today.

346
00:48:33,188 --> 00:48:35,909
So, I’d ask him to treat us to an ice-cream.

347
00:48:36,317 --> 00:48:38,795
Hey, do you really want an ice-cream,

348
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:41,336
or do you actually want to be a matchmaker for your brother?

349
00:48:42,265 --> 00:48:44,801
Please ignore him, Lady Pin.

350
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:47,546
Sunee.

351
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:50,078
Oh, there he comes.

352
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:53,316
Hello, Lady Pin.

353
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,628
Hello.

354
00:48:57,237 --> 00:48:59,934
I’m afraid I have to turn down your offer, Sunee.

355
00:48:59,934 --> 00:49:03,461
I have to go back to the palace, or else Princess Patt might be worried.

356
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:05,758
That’s too bad.

357
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:14,995
Never mind then. Can I give you a ride back to the palace instead, Lady Pin?

358
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:20,721
Yes.

359
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:23,767
I’m leaving then.

360
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:26,759
This way, please.

361
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:56,966
Please.

362
00:49:56,966 --> 00:49:58,581
Thank you.

363
00:50:03,816 --> 00:50:06,398
Do you want to come in and greet my aunt first?

364
00:50:07,984 --> 00:50:11,213
I’d rather not.

365
00:50:11,213 --> 00:50:13,071
Maybe some other days.

366
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:16,241
Yes.

367
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:20,550
My brother is afraid of Princess Patt.

368
00:50:22,635 --> 00:50:24,573
I’ll see you on Monday then, Lady Pin.

369
00:50:24,573 --> 00:50:25,447
Yes.

370
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:38,091
Until next time, Lady Pin.

371
00:50:38,386 --> 00:50:39,526
Yes.

372
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:03,507
My lady, Master Kueakiat is waiting for you in the living room.

373
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:05,359
Master Kuea again?

374
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,492
Yes, my lady.

375
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:12,688
How very popular you are, my lady. One man is dropping you off while another is waiting inside.

376
00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:13,847
Prik.

377
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:16,910
I’m only stating the fact, my lady.

378
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:20,585
I do not wish it to be like this too.

379
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:23,809
I could have refused him at once if he were my friend.

380
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:27,976
But this is Master Kuea. How could I do that?

381
00:51:27,976 --> 00:51:31,639
You’re right, my lady. Master Kueakiat is very smart…

382
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:36,675
to approach you through Princess Patt and Prince Arnon.

383
00:51:36,675 --> 00:51:41,282
Since he is a friend of Prince Arnon, I couldn’t just refuse him at once.

384
00:51:44,092 --> 00:51:48,256
Prik, please come with me. You must help me.

385
00:51:48,256 --> 00:51:51,878
Don’t worry, my lady. I will protect you at all cost.

386
00:51:51,878 --> 00:51:53,192
Come.

387
00:51:55,707 --> 00:51:58,717
Please lead the way, my lady. I will follow.

388
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,828
Hello, Master Kuea.

389
00:52:09,828 --> 00:52:14,503
Our palace will soon arrange an engagement reception for Prince Anant and Lady Paravatee.

390
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:36,961
The Loyal Pin

391
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:43,905
The Loyal Pin

392
00:53:05,937 --> 00:53:07,756
Hello, Master Kuea.

393
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:10,386
Hello, Lady Pin.

394
00:53:24,209 --> 00:53:26,617
Seeing how often you can visit the Lotus Palace,

395
00:53:26,617 --> 00:53:30,935
it seems there isn’t a lot of government work that concerns you at the moment.

396
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:35,893
Please don’t say that, Lady Pin.

397
00:53:36,058 --> 00:53:40,251
I just want to deliver my mother’s dessert to Princess Patt.

398
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,839
Now that the dessert is delivered, I’m afraid you no longer have to stay.

399
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:50,332
Please don’t be so cruel, Lady Pin. I only wish to have a conversation with you just for a while.

400
00:53:50,332 --> 00:53:54,303
I promise it won’t be long. Then I will leave and go back to my work.

401
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:58,724
Then please tell me your matter.

402
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:01,009
Yes.

403
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,900
Prik, can I ask you to…

404
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,899
Prik, come here.

405
00:54:17,614 --> 00:54:18,988
Stay here.

406
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:21,120
Yes, my lady.

407
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:25,732
Should you have any errand, please ask Koi instead.

408
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:32,769
Never mind then. I wonder if you are available tonight, Lady Pin.

409
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,986
I’d like to invite to have dinner outside the palace.

410
00:54:34,986 --> 00:54:40,454
I’m afraid she can’t, my lord. Princess Patt has already prepared dinner for her.

411
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:42,787
What about tomorrow?

412
00:54:42,787 --> 00:54:47,779
I’m afraid that’s impossible too, my lord. She must go to work at the main palace tomorrow.

413
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:48,624
What about…

414
00:54:48,624 --> 00:54:50,547
I’m very busy during these days.

415
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:55,975
I have my responsibility in the palace, not to mention that an examination is approaching.

416
00:54:55,975 --> 00:54:58,871
I must prepare for the examination.

417
00:55:01,447 --> 00:55:02,449
I understand.

418
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:06,460
Then I shall wait until you finish your examination.

419
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,903
Yes.

420
00:55:12,325 --> 00:55:14,286
Would you like to try my mother’s dessert?

421
00:55:32,197 --> 00:55:34,275
I really miss you, Mother.

422
00:55:35,656 --> 00:55:37,988
I really miss you too, my dear.

423
00:55:37,988 --> 00:55:41,612
Are you doing well? How is your study?

424
00:55:41,612 --> 00:55:44,265
Yes, I’m doing very well, Mother. Studying is fun.

425
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:47,695
Brother often asks his friend to help take care of me.

426
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:52,572
I’m worried some westerner guys might try to pursue her.

427
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:55,319
She is much likeable here.

428
00:55:56,535 --> 00:55:57,577
Who is it?

429
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:00,528
It’s Pranot, Prince Arnon’s friend.

430
00:56:01,009 --> 00:56:03,185
I first expected him to look after her for me.

431
00:56:03,638 --> 00:56:07,664
But now it seems he has already become her sidekick.

432
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,717
[Laughter]

433
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:13,084
That’s good. This means your sister won’t be lonely.

434
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:16,483
Anin, I have brought a lot of things for you.

435
00:56:16,812 --> 00:56:20,174
There are also letters from Prik and Lady Pin.

436
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,608
Thank you, Mother. Is everyone doing well?

437
00:56:23,608 --> 00:56:29,971
Yes. Your father wants to know if you’d like anything in particular for your graduation gift.

438
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:35,481
Will Father give me anything at all?

439
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:41,971
Look at you, saying as if what you want is very hard to acquire.

440
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:47,137
Well, you could say that it’s hard.

441
00:56:47,729 --> 00:56:49,419
Or you could say it’s quite easy too.

442
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:58,762
Apart from the moon and the star, your father and brother will do anything to get it for you.

443
00:56:58,762 --> 00:57:03,250
How they really love and pamper you, my dear.

444
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:09,801
Even if it’s the moon or the star, I shall get it for you.

445
00:57:12,419 --> 00:57:17,126
Well, if you say so, then I’m afraid I must ask for something more valuable than the moon and the star.

446
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:18,724
So that you can prove your words.

447
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,187
There she goes.

448
00:57:37,305 --> 00:57:40,547
My dear princess, I miss you so much.

449
00:57:40,547 --> 00:57:43,555
Please come back as soon as you can, Your Highness.

450
00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:49,609
Or else I’m afraid it might be too late. The enemies are striking mercilessly.

451
00:57:55,895 --> 00:58:00,914
Wait until I return home. I will take back what is mine.

452
00:58:27,043 --> 00:58:35,140
May I ask if you know what His Highness Prince plans to construct on that land next to our Lotus Palace, Your Highness?

453
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,449
Oh, I thought you already knew.

454
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,891
I’m afraid not, Your Highness.

455
00:58:42,828 --> 00:58:48,277
His Highness is building a palace for Princess Anilaphat as her graduation gift.

456
00:58:48,277 --> 00:58:52,063
She will stay there when she returns from England.

457
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:54,719
A palace, Your Highness?

458
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,534
The princess wishes to have a small palace built next to the Lotus Palace,

459
00:58:58,534 --> 00:59:01,696
surrounded by tall and wide pine trees.

460
00:59:01,696 --> 00:59:04,828
She will call it the Pine Palace.

461
00:59:09,156 --> 00:59:11,402
The Pine Palace, Your Highness?

462
00:59:15,998 --> 00:59:19,871
Princess Anin always think differently as usual.

463
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:24,501
Yes. The design of the palace itself is elegant and luxurious.

464
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:29,693
But its size is too small, not quite rightful for her title as a Serene Highness Princess.

465
00:59:29,693 --> 00:59:33,070
I wonder why she wishes to stay in such a tiny place.

466
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,810
Not to mention that it will be quite far away from the main palace.

467
00:59:39,685 --> 00:59:40,999
Pin.

468
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:45,551
Look.

469
00:59:48,828 --> 00:59:51,153
This is my dream house.

470
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:56,707
But this is much smaller than the main palace.

471
00:59:57,013 --> 01:00:03,403
I think it’s warm and cosy. This way, we will never be far from each other’s sight.

472
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,165
Sounds so dreamy.

473
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:13,403
I want to have it built next to the Lotus Palace, so that you can always see me.

474
01:00:14,372 --> 01:00:17,162
Who said I wish to see you forever?

475
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:20,613
Should one day I have a home of my own,

476
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,592
I’d ask you to stay there with me.

477
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,496
I promise.

478
01:00:57,662 --> 01:00:59,479
A penny for your thoughts, Lady Pin.

479
01:01:01,272 --> 01:01:03,422
I was just thinking about the princess, Your Highness.

480
01:01:03,422 --> 01:01:08,492
She has always been unpredictable since when she was young.

481
01:01:09,049 --> 01:01:12,707
You’re right. She has always been different.

482
01:01:13,009 --> 01:01:13,981
Yes, Your Highness.

483
01:01:19,154 --> 01:01:22,744
Our palace will soon hold a big event.

484
01:01:22,744 --> 01:01:27,365
It’s an engagement reception for Prince Anan and Lady Parawatee.

485
01:01:28,025 --> 01:01:32,433
Really, Your Highness? I’m so pleased for the prince.

486
01:01:32,948 --> 01:01:35,012
We shall do our best with the arrangement to honour the prince.

487
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:36,798
You must help me prepare for it, Lady Pin.

488
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:37,841
Yes, Your Highness.

489
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:01,418
Make sure there isn’t even a speck of dust.

490
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:05,228
Put it over there.

491
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:09,925
Make sure you clean it.

492
01:02:10,543 --> 01:02:13,260
Give me those flowers.

493
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:39,367
Your Highness, I’d like to discuss with you about the refreshments.

494
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:40,921
Please comet this way, Your Highness.

495
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:11,686
Prik, put this on the table outside.

496
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:12,833
Yes, my lady.

497
01:03:26,395 --> 01:03:28,082
Your Highness!

498
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:50,561
The Loyal Pin

499
01:03:51,056 --> 01:03:52,068
Anin!

500
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:54,020
I miss you, Mother.

501
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,919
I miss everyone too.

502
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,785
So much.

503
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:01,449
This is your Pine Palace. What do you think?

504
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:02,966
It’s so beautiful!

505
01:04:03,905 --> 01:04:10,609
Lady Pin is so hot. I must find a way to get closer to her and win over her heart.

506
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,378
I beg your pardon, Your Highness?

507
01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:17,601
Princess Anin would like to have a bath and a facial scrub.

508
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:22,819
Are you mad at me, Pin?

509
01:04:22,819 --> 01:04:24,365
I’m sorry.

510
01:05:56,622 --> 01:06:02,589
The Loyal Pin
