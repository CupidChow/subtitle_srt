1
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,020
The Loyal Pin

2
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,616
I have prepared only 5 rooms for the guests, Your Highness.

3
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,944
I can stay in the same room with Lady Pin.

4
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:45,552
I will spend a night at my friend’s palace. I’d like you to come with me.

5
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:50,224
I did not stay with you last night. Were you being a good girl?

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,968
Don’t worry. I’m always your good girl. But Lady Uang might not be likewise.

7
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,448
Is the pin on Lady Pin’s hair the one I also gave you last time?

8
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:07,408
Please wait until I can save up enough money.

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,728
And I promise to find a better ring that deserves to be on your ring finger.

10
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,088
No matter for how long, I will always wait for you.

11
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,136
Your hands look so pretty.

12
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,488
So is your ring.

13
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,616
Who gave it to you?

14
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,224
I’m not sure. Perhaps it’s someone around here.

15
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,328
Is it?

16
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:13,856
I thought it was from your fiancé.

17
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:24,432
That person is more than just a fiancé.

18
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,808
How so?

19
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:31,504
She is also my best friend.

20
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:33,904
She is my everything.

21
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:38,656
And most importantly, she owns both my body and my soul.

22
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:43,248
Is that so?

23
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:44,336
Yes.

24
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:52,800
Anin.

25
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,400
Go tell Prik to come see me at the parlour.

26
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:27,936
Yes, Your Highness.

27
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:03,776
I’d like you to help choose some of these for Princess Anin.

28
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:07,984
For my princess, Your Highness?

29
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:11,440
May I ask for what occasion, so that I can make the best decision, Your Highness?

30
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:18,976
It is only a little gift in return for her giving Lady Pin such a precious engagement ring.

31
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:28,592
Don’t look so surprised. I already knew.

32
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:38,976
Did Lady Pin tell you, Your Highness, that she…

33
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:44,112
That she and Princess Anin are seeing each other?

34
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:52,240
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:59,520
Just as I thought. Lady Pin and Princess Anin are really seeing each other.

36
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,256
Am I right, Prik?

37
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:16,272
Well, I…I thought you said…that you already knew.

38
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:19,232
I only knew about the ring.

39
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:25,120
As for their relationship, I was only certain when you answered me earlier.

40
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:30,128
Well, it’s…it’s not like that, Your Highness.

41
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,000
I meant they are seeing each other as companions, Your Highness.

42
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,032
- It is not what you think, Your Highness.
- Enough with the lying, Prik!

43
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,120
Do you think I am a fool?

44
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,688
Absolutely not, Your Highness!

45
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,952
I would never think of you like that, Your Highness!

46
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,950
- Never, Your Highness!
- I have noticed it for a while.

47
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,312
But I was not certain about it.

48
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,880
How did it happen? Tell me everything.

49
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,064
Damn!

50
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,048
What to do now? How should I tell the princess?

51
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:12,000
Damn you, Prik! Why are you such an idiot?

52
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,200
Stupid!

53
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:15,568
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

54
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:21,120
Let’s do it.

55
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:27,840
Or rather not.

56
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:34,016
But then Lady Pin will be in trouble.

57
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:36,352
I’ll tell them.

58
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:38,896
Damn!

59
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,616
Damn it! You are so dead, Prik!

60
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,260
Dead, dead, dead!

61
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,752
Jasmine tea, Your Highness.

62
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:20,208
Thank you.

63
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,088
- Prik, do you…
- No, Your Highness. I didn’t say anything. I swear I…

64
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:36,800
What’s wrong? I haven’t said anything yet.

65
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:41,392
Nothing, Your Highness.

66
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:52,704
Do you think between the real Lady Pin and the Lady Pin that I draw,

67
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:55,792
which one is prettier?

68
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,944
The real Lady Pin, of course, Your Highness.

69
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:08,560
I thought so too.

70
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:20,496
Your Highness.

71
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,320
Yes?

72
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:25,872
Er

73
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,296
Er

74
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:32,096
What is it?

75
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:42,704
Nothing, Your Highness. I just want to let you know
that your drawing of Lady Pin is absolutely beautiful.

76
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,648
Lady Pin is my happiness.

77
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:04,768
Without her, my life would have been so miserable.

78
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:37,968
Koi, can I have more rice please?

79
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,248
Yes, my lady.

80
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,352
You seem to have a good appetite today, my lady.

81
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:11,744
Are you not feeling well, Your Highness?

82
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:15,312
Why did you eat very little today?

83
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:21,232
I’m full.

84
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:27,280
If you are done with your meal, please come see me in my room.

85
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:30,112
There is something I must talk to you.

86
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,504
(Door knocking sound)

87
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,472
Please sit down.

88
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,952
Why would you like to see me, Your Highness?

89
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:42,304
Why must you wish for someone out of your reach?
Why did you not restrain yourself, Lady Pilanthita?

90
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,616
What are you talking about, Your Highness?

91
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:54,640
It is quite clear what I am talking about.
How long are you going to keep acting innocent?

92
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,408
All this time, have you seen me as a fool who is oblivious to everything?

93
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:03,824
Not at all, Your Highness.

94
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:10,656
Have I never taught you who we are and who she is?

95
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,784
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

96
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,320
But you never listen.

97
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,552
And you even let yourself fall deeply…

98
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:23,424
into such an intimate relationship.

99
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,952
How dare you, Lady Pin?

100
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:31,280
Did I not teach you well enough?

101
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,800
You didn’t do anything wrong. It is my fault.

102
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,336
I could not restrain myself for I am foolishly enamoured with Princess Anin.

103
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,352
Please don’t blame yourself, Your Highness.

104
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:58,064
And please don’t shed your tears for a sinful niece like me.

105
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,328
How could I not?

106
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,072
Do you know…

107
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:13,968
how much time and dedication I have sacrificed for raising you up?

108
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:18,224
So that you would grow up elegantly as a lady should be.

109
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,296
A lady with a moral conscience and gratitude.

110
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:25,488
But instead, you chose to accept the ring from Princess Anin.

111
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,552
And even wear it on your ring finger despite knowing the true meaning of it.

112
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,544
I am sorry, Your Highness.

113
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,264
Much worse,

114
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:50,160
you even went so far and gave her a ring to express your possession of her.

115
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,480
I am truly sorry, Your Highness.

116
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,896
Please forgive me.

117
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:07,232
I was a fool to believe that if I gave her a ring,

118
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:12,112
she would eventually become mine one day.

119
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:18,592
No matter how much you apologize, it could never undo what you have done.

120
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,264
Perhaps, it is time that I must do something to put everything back in place.

121
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:29,744
What do you mean?

122
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,664
You need to be engaged.

123
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:54,944
(Door knocking sound)

124
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,816
My lady.

125
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:34,304
I am truly sorry, my lady.

126
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,992
It is my fault.

127
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:42,512
Princess Pattaimka kept pressing me about it.

128
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:49,296
And so, I slipped out and told her everything.

129
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:52,192
I am sorry, my lady.

130
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:59,088
It’s not your fault.

131
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,816
She already knew.

132
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:08,160
She only needed you to assure her.

133
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,576
It is I who has been reckless.

134
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,504
What was her response then, my lady?

135
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:32,992
You must marry Kueakiat.

136
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,000
No, Your Highness.

137
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:39,216
Why him?

138
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:43,120
Why not?

139
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
He is my best friend’s son.

140
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:50,032
And also a close companion of Prince Arnon.

141
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:54,128
He is good-looking, well-educated, and comes from a noble family.

142
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:57,280
He is perfectly suitable for you more than anyone.

143
00:17:57,984 --> 00:17:59,728
But I do not love him.

144
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,568
Love?

145
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:04,592
Is the person you love someone you can ever wish for?

146
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:09,168
Have you forgotten who she is?

147
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:13,840
Not to mention that she is also a lady like you.

148
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,328
Your Highness.

149
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:24,128
As for Kueakiat, he might be just a prince’s son,
but he is of the same rank as you.

150
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,264
From this day on, you no longer have to take care of the food for Princess Anin.

151
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:33,260
I will have Koi do it instead.

152
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:36,288
And don’t ever go spend a night with the princess again.

153
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:43,296
From now on, the Pine Palace is a forbidden place for you,

154
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,576
Your Highness!

155
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:05,440
Please.

156
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,552
Please don’t be so cruel to me.

157
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:18,128
If I could not see her again, I would surely die.

158
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,920
Then so be it.

159
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:46,080
I also want to know if you will eventually stop breathing because of it.

160
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:57,520
I would surely die.

161
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,168
Oh, my lady.

162
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:07,264
Should I tell Princess Anin? She might be able to help you, my lady.

163
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:13,984
No, Prik. I don’t want to worry her.

164
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:19,088
My lady.

165
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,340
I am so sorry, my lady.

166
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:45,360
You cannot leave this palace without my permission.

167
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,032
Lady Pin must go on an errand for me with Kueakiat.

168
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,432
With Master Kuea?

169
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,620
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

170
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:25,727
The Loyal Pin

171
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:49,771
From now on, the Pine Palace is a forbidden place for you.

172
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,251
Lady Pin.

173
00:22:37,547 --> 00:22:38,635
Where are you going?

174
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,927
Well, I…

175
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,875
- I’m going to prepare snacks for you.
- No need.

176
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,667
You do not have to go anywhere.

177
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:55,355
You cannot leave this palace without my permission.

178
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:05,643
Yes, Your Highness.

179
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:36,139
Where is Lady Pin?

180
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:39,147
Lady Pin did not come to the kitchen today, Your Highness.

181
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,371
Has she gone out somewhere?

182
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,739
No, Your Highness. She is at the palace.

183
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:52,555
Prik.

184
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:55,691
Yes, Your Highness?

185
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:57,627
Why didn’t Lady Pin come to see me?

186
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:03,771
She is probably busy with work, Your Highness.

187
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:08,203
You better have your meal or else it might get cold, Your Highness.

188
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,627
Is Lady Pin not coming again?

189
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:35,307
Yes, Your Highness.

190
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,019
How odd.

191
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:21,835
Your Highness, shall we go drive around the city today?

192
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:30,763
No. This is unusual. Lady Pin has been too quiet today.

193
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:35,035
She might be busy with the kitchen chores, Your Highness.

194
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,467
I’ll go see her then.

195
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,131
Please wait for me, Your Highness.

196
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,675
- Pia.
- Yes, Your Highness.

197
00:25:58,091 --> 00:25:59,563
Is Lady Pin in the kitchen?

198
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:04,395
No, Your Highness. She did not come to the kitchen today.

199
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:15,371
There must be something wrong.

200
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:17,515
She has never disappeared like this.

201
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:25,547
Perhaps, she is quite busy with her work, Your Highness.

202
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:27,147
Her translation work.

203
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:31,867
In that case,

204
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:34,075
she would always tell me beforehand.

205
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:41,227
Prik.

206
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:42,491
Yes, Your Highness.

207
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:45,003
Go to that palace and find out what happened to Lady Pin.

208
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:47,755
Me, Your Highness?

209
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,003
Yes.

210
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,995
Princess Patt might find it suspicious if I go there myself.

211
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,283
She might turn her attention to me and Lady Pin again.

212
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:00,283
Yes, Your Highness.

213
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:18,939
Jeez! What should I do now?

214
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:22,619
You knew it so well.

215
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,339
What is it, Prik?

216
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,971
Does the princess wish to see Lady Pin?

217
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:45,275
No, Your Highness.

218
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:47,867
The princess was only wondering…

219
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:51,483
why Lady Pin did not come to the Pine Palace today.

220
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,803
Is that so?

221
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:55,931
Yes, Your Highness.

222
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:02,619
Should I tell her honestly, Your Highness?

223
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:03,819
No.

224
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:07,611
Tell her that Lady Pin is helping me with some errands.

225
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:12,379
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:32,299
Lady Pin is helping Princess Pattamika with some errands, Your Highness.

227
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:37,947
Really? How unusual.

228
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:41,003
Not at all, Your Highness.

229
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,763
I believe there were also times
when she did not come to see you for many days.

230
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,963
Never mind then. I will wait for a few more days.

231
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,107
Yes, Your Highness.

232
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,011
Ouch!

233
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:40,091
Let me see.

234
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:41,547
I’m fine, Your Highness.

235
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,931
It has been many days already.

236
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,979
Haven’t you heard about anything from the Lotus Palace?

237
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,259
No, Your Highness.

238
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:04,011
I’m worried. I’ll go see Lady Pin.

239
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:06,491
Please wait, Your Highness!

240
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:10,123
Please calm down, Your Highness. I will go check on her for you.

241
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,251
No need. I will go there myself.

242
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:17,067
Your Highness! Princess Pattamika might be suspicious if you do that.

243
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:18,651
I don’t care.

244
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:21,931
Your Highness!

245
00:30:25,963 --> 00:30:29,867
What urgent matter has brought you to visit here, Princess?

246
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,411
I am here to see Lady Pin.

247
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:39,531
Is there an urgent matter?

248
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:44,667
I’d like her to help translate a novel which I still couldn’t fathom.

249
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:49,067
You went to study abroad since young.

250
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,275
Why would you need her help with the translation?

251
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:55,003
There are some parts that I am not quite certain about.

252
00:30:56,155 --> 00:31:00,155
Lady Pin is busy today. She must help me with the chores.

253
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:01,899
What about in the afternoon?

254
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,907
She must go on an errand for me with Kueakiat.

255
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,507
With Master Kuea?

256
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:12,891
Yes, Lady Pin is fully occupied today.

257
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:15,819
Please return to your palace first, Princess.

258
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:17,947
I will tell Lady Pin that you came.

259
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:21,611
Yes.

260
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:45,387
I miss you so much, Anin.

261
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:08,571
Are you full? How come you ate very little?

262
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:10,715
Yes, Your Highness.

263
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:19,947
I need you to go on an errand for me this afternoon.

264
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:24,731
Yes, Your Highness.

265
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:30,699
I want you to go choose the fabric as a gift for Lady Lamom, Kueakiat’s mother.

266
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,003
Yes, Your Highness.

267
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,923
Go shower and get ready then.

268
00:32:39,403 --> 00:32:42,363
Kueakiat will come pick you up this afternoon.

269
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:45,003
Yes, Your Highness.

270
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:56,635
It was my fault…

271
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,811
for being reckless when portraying my love to you.

272
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,115
Please don’t blame yourself.

273
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:04,767
Sooner or later, people are bound to find out about us one day.

274
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:41,767
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

275
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:48,859
The Loyal Pin

276
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,279
Please look after her for me.

277
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,391
With my pleasure, Your Highness.

278
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:26,615
We will be leaving then, Your Highness.

279
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:36,839
Please, Lady Pin.

280
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,271
Be careful.

281
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:53,527
Do you like any fabric in particular?

282
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:55,111
- I’ll buy it for you.
- No.

283
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,071
Let’s just buy the gift for your mother.

284
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:41,655
This one is beautiful. I think it would suit her well.

285
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:44,471
Let’s take this one.

286
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:51,495
I will go settle the payment then.

287
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:55,671
Please have a look around while you’re waiting.

288
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:57,511
Yes.

289
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:16,391
Anin!

290
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:17,447
Pin!

291
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:34,295
I miss you so much.

292
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,663
I miss you so much too.

293
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,703
What happened?

294
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:46,231
Why did you just disappear?

295
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,335
I will tell you everything.

296
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:52,871
But first, we must get out of here.

297
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:54,455
Let’s go.

298
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,631
Come.

299
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,087
So, that’s what happened.

300
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:37,543
Yes.

301
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:41,207
That’s why Prik seems quite unsettling lately.

302
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:43,143
She was trying to hide it from me.

303
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:45,139
Please don’t blame her.

304
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:50,023
I know. Prik didn’t do anything wrong.

305
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:54,183
It was my fault for being reckless when portraying my love to you.

306
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,535
Please don’t blame yourself.

307
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,695
Sooner or later, people are bound to find out about us one day.

308
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:08,199
Pin!

309
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:31,783
(Thunder Sound)

310
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:36,503
(Raining)

311
00:40:00,935 --> 00:40:03,975
What should we do about us?

312
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:10,759
Please don’t worry.

313
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,047
I will find a way for us.

314
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,327
Yes.

315
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:19,671
I do not wish to belong to anyone else but you.

316
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,439
I will never give you to anyone.

317
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:34,599
You are mine, and mine only.

318
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,539
(Raining)

319
00:41:57,863 --> 00:41:59,559
(Thunder Sound)

320
00:43:12,183 --> 00:43:13,207
My lady.

321
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:22,167
Have you eaten, my lady?
Would you like me to prepare something for you?

322
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:23,991
I’m not hungry.

323
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:25,447
Yes, my lady.

324
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:39,127
I will arrange your engagement and marriage with Kueakiat as soon as possible.

325
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,287
Is Princess Patt talking with my mother right now?

326
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:21,419
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

327
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:28,483
The Loyal Pin

328
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,743
Why must you be so stubborn?

329
00:44:44,919 --> 00:44:46,919
Do you not love or respect me anymore?

330
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:50,183
Of course not, Your Highness.

331
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:56,039
Then, why did you disobey me and secretly meet with the princess?

332
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:01,047
Did Master Kuea tell you, Your Highness?

333
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:05,143
Stop blaming other people, Lady Pin. It is you who has done wrong.

334
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:15,399
My apology. I was just…

335
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:16,951
Say no more.

336
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:25,687
You are now grounded to stay only in your room.

337
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:28,231
Unless I say so,

338
00:45:29,031 --> 00:45:30,871
you may not leave this room!

339
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:13,847
Anin.

340
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:17,047
Pin.

341
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:22,903
What are you doing?

342
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:26,391
Why did you do such a dangerous thing like that?

343
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:28,679
Because I miss you.

344
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:33,655
I heard you are grounded.

345
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:35,815
I’m worried sick about you.

346
00:46:38,903 --> 00:46:39,783
Yes.

347
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:42,855
I am not allowed to leave this room.

348
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:47,959
You don’t have to leave this room.

349
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:50,151
I’ll come to you instead.

350
00:47:56,391 --> 00:48:00,647
Princess Pattamika has asked me to open the door and let you downstairs for breakfast, my lady.

351
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,447
Did she say I can leave the room now?

352
00:48:05,991 --> 00:48:06,935
Yes, my lady.

353
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,087
Where is she?

354
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:13,831
She has gone out since early morning, my lady.

355
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:43,623
Thank you for dropping me off. I will soon send you the good news.

356
00:48:47,527 --> 00:48:50,759
Thank you, Your Highness. I will take my leave then.

357
00:49:18,711 --> 00:49:20,375
Where have you been, Your Highness?

358
00:49:21,815 --> 00:49:23,479
I went to Kueakiat’s house.

359
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:26,423
Is there a problem?

360
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:29,767
I went to talk about your engagement with Kueakiat.

361
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:35,847
What do you mean?

362
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:41,223
I will arrange your engagement and marriage
with Kueakiat as soon as possible.

363
00:49:45,175 --> 00:49:47,479
Why such a hurry, Your Highness?

364
00:49:48,023 --> 00:49:52,119
This is the only way to make you give up on the princess.

365
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:56,407
I don’t want to marry him. I do not love him.

366
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,863
I am not asking for your permission, Lady Pin.

367
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:32,359
Mother.

368
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:35,239
Please sit down, dear.

369
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:42,167
How was the ceremony at the Chao Fah Palace?
Did everything go well?

370
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:43,479
Yes, Mother.

371
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,975
People kept asking about Father.

372
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:51,015
Your father has been very busy lately.
He must be travelling all the time.

373
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:55,399
I must also go with him. So, I am hardly home.

374
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:58,631
I need you to look after many things for me while I’m away.

375
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:01,863
Please don’t worry, Mother.

376
00:51:03,783 --> 00:51:04,663
Thank you, dear.

377
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:07,255
Let me see.

378
00:51:08,727 --> 00:51:11,527
Princess Pattimaka has requested for your audience, Your Highness.

379
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:15,623
Please invite her here.

380
00:51:15,623 --> 00:51:16,471
Yes, Your Highness.

381
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:26,743
How odd. Your aunt has never come to visit me
during the weekend before.

382
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:30,791
Perhaps, it is something important.

383
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:34,151
Um

384
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,711
Please have a seat.

385
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:46,999
Have a seat, dear.

386
00:51:47,783 --> 00:51:49,207
Thank you, Your Highness.

387
00:51:53,607 --> 00:51:57,015
Is there an urgent matter?
Why would you like to see me during this hour?

388
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:01,687
It is not something urgent, Your Highness.

389
00:52:04,615 --> 00:52:08,119
What a relief. So, what is it about?

390
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:12,567
Master Kueakiat would like to propose for an engagement with Lady Pin, Your Highness.

391
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:21,655
But the date of engagement is rather very early.

392
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:28,103
I’m afraid it might not be appropriate since we must be preparing
for His Highness’s birthday party during this time.

393
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:34,983
Oh, about that? As long as it is not on the same date and time,

394
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:39,415
I do not see any problem at all.

395
00:52:40,919 --> 00:52:44,999
It is rather wonderful that our palace will hold two delightful events consecutively.

396
00:52:46,183 --> 00:52:49,655
What a relief to hear that, Your Highness.

397
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:04,663
- What? Lady Pin is going to be engaged to…
- Shh! Not so loud!

398
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:08,631
Lady Pin is going to be engaged to Master Kuea?

399
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:12,871
Yes, Princess Pattamika is now discussing with Princess Alisa on this matter.

400
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:21,911
They are discussing about it right now?

401
00:53:22,343 --> 00:53:24,679
Yes, Your Highness. They are at the front palace.

402
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:26,323
Please hurry, Your Highness.

403
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,447
When will it be then?

404
00:53:35,991 --> 00:53:37,927
The engagement will be held next week, Your Highness.

405
00:53:37,991 --> 00:53:40,231
As for the wedding, it will soon follow.

406
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:44,439
Why are you in such a hurry, Your Highness?

407
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:53,687
They have not even gone on a date together.

408
00:53:55,671 --> 00:53:58,135
But that is not true, dear.

409
00:53:58,311 --> 00:54:02,167
I have been seeing Kueakiat coming in and out of the Lotus Palace for years now.

410
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:05,687
That is not a date, Mother.

411
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:10,119
It was merely Kueakiat’s doing to please his own satisfaction.

412
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:14,647
He only adores Lady Pin’s pretty face and her respectable family name.

413
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:15,815
Anin.

414
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:23,287
Wouldn’t this make Lady Pin look like a product…

415
00:54:23,283 --> 00:54:25,367
that any man could select to satisfy himself?

416
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:28,279
Anin!

417
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,751
Anin is possibly more familiar with the custom from the West…

418
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:38,487
where both people must take time to learn about each other before marriage.

419
00:54:39,255 --> 00:54:40,391
Most importantly,

420
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:43,815
it must be done willingly by both sides, Mother.

421
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:49,399
Let’s leave the Western custom for them Westerners.

422
00:54:49,863 --> 00:54:52,263
For us, if a man and a lady are suitable for each other…

423
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:55,159
in terms of their looks, wealth, and family names…

424
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:57,863
why wasting your time learning about each other?

425
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:01,175
Love will certainly develop after marriage.

426
00:55:02,023 --> 00:55:04,039
What if it doesn’t?

427
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:06,871
Who will be responsible for the rest of her miserable life, Mother?

428
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:12,391
Are you implying that I have chosen a horrible person for Lady Pin?

429
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,751
That is not what I meant, Your Highness.

430
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:18,791
I was only stating the fact.

431
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,391
What Lady Pin feels for Master Kuea…

432
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:27,175
is like poorly woven fabric.

433
00:55:28,183 --> 00:55:32,791
Her feeling for him is so plain and empty.

434
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:40,583
And now you are trying to dye that fabric with the colour you prefer.

435
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:47,079
But in my view, the fabric that represents Kueakiat’s feeling for Lady Pin…

436
00:55:47,255 --> 00:55:51,927
is like a fine and elegant silk with expensive value.

437
00:55:52,103 --> 00:55:54,503
Such a perfect choice for my niece.

438
00:55:55,271 --> 00:56:00,855
Then, are you able to see the fabric
which represents my feeling for Lady Pin?

439
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:24,679
The feeling I have for her…

440
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:29,575
is like fabric woven from gold and silver thread…

441
00:56:33,271 --> 00:56:35,991
with exceptionally delicate and exquisite design.

442
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:43,751
I have spent more than half of my life…

443
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:46,903
weaving it faithfully and untiringly.

444
00:56:51,351 --> 00:56:56,679
Yet, you are about to tear such precious fabric into pieces.

445
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:01,047
And even throw it on the floor…

446
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,831
and stomp on it with your own feet!

447
00:57:03,823 --> 00:57:04,663
Anin!

448
00:57:09,063 --> 00:57:10,311
Anin!

449
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:15,367
Please say no more, Your Highness.

450
00:57:19,431 --> 00:57:22,935
Anin, my dear, what did you mean by that?

451
00:57:34,695 --> 00:57:36,583
What I was trying to say is…

452
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:39,991
should there be anyone who deserves to be with Lady Pin,

453
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:48,871
that person is me, not Kueakiat.

454
00:58:11,803 --> 00:58:14,723
The Loyal Pin

455
00:58:15,335 --> 00:58:17,335
I will marry him, Your Highness.

456
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:22,759
I’m also human like Lady Pin.

457
00:58:23,319 --> 00:58:25,959
I have a heart, all flesh and blood.

458
00:58:25,953 --> 00:58:28,311
I can feel pain as much as she does.

459
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:31,815
Please try to get over her, dear.

460
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:35,063
never expect me to waste my time…

461
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:37,959
and marry anyone for the rest of my life.

462
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:44,727
I gave you this silver pin in hopes that it will reunite with the golden pin…

463
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:47,287
like how they used to be.

464
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:51,923
As for you, Master Kuea, all I can tell you is…

465
00:58:58,403 --> 00:59:04,503
🎵Nobody might know what it is…🎵

466
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:14,423
🎵…that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you.🎵

467
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:20,523
🎵Nobody might agree with our love,🎵

468
00:59:20,753 --> 00:59:27,031
🎵But please be patient and always…🎵

469
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:37,127
🎵…wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite…🎵

470
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:43,003
🎵…as we have promised each other that we’d wait…🎵

471
00:59:43,363 --> 00:59:50,743
🎵…until that day🎵

472
00:59:51,343 --> 01:00:02,711
🎵Until that day I will hold you in my arms,🎵

473
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:05,111
🎵Kissing you through the night.🎵

474
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:14,807
🎵Can you wait for me, my baby?🎵

475
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:26,803
