1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,333
I’m afraid I won’t be able to see you off tomorrow.

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,866
I don’t want to see you leave.

3
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:16,760
Even from afar, I could tell that
she is smitten with you and likes you more than friends.

4
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:19,360
Your graduation day is approaching.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,226
I’d have my father come to propose for our marriage.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,200
It’s been many months already, Prik.

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,093
Why hasn’t your princess written me anything lately?

8
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,720
I miss you, Anin.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,813
I miss you too.

10
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:54,453
Thank you both of you so much for helping me surprise
Father and Mother about my early return and graduation.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,946
Mother gave me an earful for not telling her about this.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,546
Fortunately, Mother didn’t pass out from excitement.

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,800
Who would have thought you would come back without telling her.

14
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:06,506
But she was still safe and sound.

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,466
You are naughty.

16
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:12,626
Now, please excuse me. I must go surprise Lady Pin and Prik.

17
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:16,080
Go on. Those two must be overwhelmed when they see you.

18
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:17,453
Okay.

19
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,053
Naughty monkey.

20
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:32,333
My princess!

21
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,533
It’s really you!

22
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,546
- Prik.
- You’re back, Your Highness!

23
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:38,746
I’m not dreaming, am I?

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,053
Your Highness!

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,466
Your Highness!

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,653
Your Highness!

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,893
It’s me, Prik. I am back.

28
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:53,853
My dear princess. I miss you so much, Your Highness.

29
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:57,000
The news travels so fast.

30
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:00,186
I was going to surprise you but I’m afraid I was too late.

31
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:03,666
I have eyes and ears everywhere, Your Highness.

32
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:08,013
My dear princess has returned. How could I not scent it, Your Highness.

33
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,626
You said as if you were a dog.

34
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,106
Oh.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,400
Yes, Your Highness?

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,746
Will Lady Pin know by now that I have returned?

37
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:27,680
Not yet, Your Highness. That one mostly stays either reading or busy in the kitchen.

38
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,186
Then, I’ll go give her a surprise.

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,880
Let me take you to her, Your Highness.

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,573
No need.

41
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:37,733
I want to be alone with her.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,773
Please enjoy your time then.

43
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:51,506
I will not go and bother you until tomorrow morning, Your Highness.

44
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,920
How very smart of you.

45
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:56,746
Yes, Your Highness.

46
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:57,920
I miss you, Anin.

47
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,653
I miss you too.

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,280
🎵Please be patient and…🎵

49
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:23,986
🎵...wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite…🎵

50
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:29,820
🎵...as we have promised each other that we’d wait…🎵

51
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,760
🎵…until that day🎵

52
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:49,666
🎵Until that time I will hold you in my arms🎵

53
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,040
🎵Kissing you through the night🎵

54
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:00,580
🎵Can you wait for me, my baby?🎵

55
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,213
Are you crying?

56
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:25,893
Please don’t cry, my baby.

57
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:28,813
I am right there.

58
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,506
Why did you shy away from me?

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,933
Don’t you love me anymore?

60
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:58,720
If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have counted down every single day.

61
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:05,240
Then, why are you upset?

62
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:09,640
You came back without telling me.

63
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,666
Why did you play with my feelings like this?

64
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:21,413
It was as if you did not know…

65
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:25,893
how every second that I await for your return means to me.

66
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,746
I’m sorry.

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,946
I have also been eagerly looking forward to seeing you again.

68
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:49,306
During the past few months, I had immersed myself in studying…

69
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:53,426
so that I could graduate a semester early.

70
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:58,573
I barely slept or ate.

71
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:03,213
All because I wish nothing but to see you as soon as possible.

72
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,706
You hardly slept or ate?

73
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,800
What if you fell sick?

74
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:28,800
I just wanted to see you as soon as I could.

75
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:36,773
Can you forgive me for that?

76
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,220
The Loyal Pin

77
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,586
It still annoys me every time I think about it.

78
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,800
You are behaving more and more like westerners every day. Do you know that?

79
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:01,653
Not only the habit of giving everyone a surprise,

80
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:06,280
my way of expressing love is also like that of westerners.

81
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,266
It’s still noon, Anin.

82
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:41,533
So what?

83
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,386
I miss you.

84
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,733
It’s still not dark.

85
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,653
It is now.

86
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:22,226
The door is not locked. What if someone…

87
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,106
Did you change your perfume?

88
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:25,680
Yes.

89
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:33,106
It might have a similar pleasant scent, but I don’t think it is the same one.

90
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,920
I own quite a lot of them.

91
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:41,906
But I only brought one with me when I came back last time.

92
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,253
So, you might find it unfamiliar.

93
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,680
I hope you did not change it to please anyone.

94
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,666
Or did you perhaps borrow it from someone?

95
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,533
You are overthinking.

96
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:02,653
Other than you, I never want to please anyone else.

97
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,413
I just want to be sure.

98
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:12,693
I have heard there are a lot of people who would like to court you.

99
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:28,426
I was wondering why you had never mentioned
such an important thing like that in the letters.

100
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:32,360
But I never paid attention to those people.

101
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:38,986
If I had mentioned it, it would have only made you upset and worried.

102
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:42,826
Never mind then.

103
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:52,533
But should you try to keep it a secret from me again, I would be very angry at you.

104
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:55,800
Absolutely no more.

105
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,980
Have you thought about what you would like to do next?

106
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,000
Not yet.

107
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,906
Ha! Are you planning to be mischievous and stay with Lady Pin all day long?

108
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,140
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

109
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:44,254
The Loyal Pin

110
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:03,087
Hey, what are you doing here?

111
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,474
I am here to see the princess.

112
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,794
Why? Who are you?

113
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,260
I am her personal servant.

114
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:19,074
Liar! I am her one and only personal servant!

115
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:23,234
Then how come you do not know who I am.

116
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:25,327
Has the princess never told you, Prik?

117
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,607
How do you know my name?

118
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,740
Because I am…

119
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:31,527
What’s with the ruckus?

120
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:38,994
Your Highness. Someone is trying to claim
that she is your personal servant.

121
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:44,834
This is Pia. She worked at our palace in England.

122
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,474
She took care of me and my brothers while I was there.

123
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:53,887
Prince Anan told her to follow me back home after I graduated.

124
00:16:56,954 --> 00:17:00,860
Then what about me, Your Highness?

125
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,660
Both of you are my personal servants.

126
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:12,607
This is Lady Pin, the one I often told you about.

127
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,100
Yes, Your Highness.

128
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,714
Pia knows everything about us.

129
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:27,060
Is it not only me who knows about you, Your Highness?

130
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,487
Why does she also know?

131
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,674
Both of you do.

132
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,287
Why would you like to see me?

133
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:44,314
Prince Anan would like you to have breakfast with him, Your Highness.

134
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,194
I will go back to the Lotus Palace then, Your Highness.

135
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:50,727
Let me walk you there.

136
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,154
Now, is it clear who I am?

137
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,314
Hey.

138
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,047
Hm?

139
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,740
Why is your name Pia? It’s rhymed with my name.

140
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,834
I used to have piggy tails, but I got lice so I had to cut them off.

141
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,540
My princess.

142
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,887
Hey, calm down.

143
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:41,494
You, little monkey. Why are you eating so fast?
The food won’t go anywhere.

144
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:47,034
The princess probably misses the food here.
She had been away for so long, Your Highness.

145
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,354
Is that so?

146
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:53,927
Just let her eat. She was far from home
and had to study hard for many years.

147
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,127
She even graduated half a year earlier.
Please let her do what she wants today.

148
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,607
Today? What do you mean by ‘today’?

149
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,874
I have seen you pampered her all my life.

150
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,007
You are right.

151
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,340
But our sister did a great job this time. I must pamper her a little.

152
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:15,887
Here, have this. Whom do you resemble being this smart?

153
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,260
You, of course, my brother.

154
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:23,994
Oh my god. Both of you are good at studying and also good at complimenting each other.

155
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:29,447
Have you thought about what you would like to do next?

156
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:32,527
Do you want to pursue a master’s degree, or do you want to work?

157
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:34,340
Not yet.

158
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:38,060
Or do you perhaps want to get married?

159
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:41,674
No. I will never get married.

160
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,260
But one day, you will eventually have to get married.

161
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:47,047
Yes.

162
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,034
Let me take a break first.

163
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:53,687
I’d like to sit back and relax, or go hanging around for a while first.

164
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:58,367
Ha! Are you planning to be mischievous and stay with Lady Pin all day long?

165
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,940
I know you.

166
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,687
- Lady Pin already got a job. She has to work.
- Yes

167
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:09,114
She probably doesn’t have time to play with you.

168
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,847
That doesn’t matter. At least I do have time to be with her.

169
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,554
You, little imp.

170
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,287
Eat some more. You’re as thin as a stick.

171
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,620
What is it?

172
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,207
Nothing.

173
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:08,047
Are you going to keep staring at me like this?

174
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,607
I just want to keep looking at you…

175
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,980
to compensate for those years that I couldn’t see you.

176
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,780
Wow, you look even more beautiful upclose.

177
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:32,514
Now I know why the princess was so desperate to see you when she arrived.

178
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,727
It is because you are such a beauty, my lady.

179
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,300
Anin.

180
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:12,754
You are so pretty.

181
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,540
What about me, Your Highness? Am I pretty?

182
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:24,114
No.

183
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,127
What are you doing?

184
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:46,167
Since when did you get my doll?

185
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:47,727
When you weren’t looking.

186
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:52,287
Will you keep clinging to me like this all day long?

187
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,100
Probably all day and night.

188
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,380
Don’t you have anything else to do?

189
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:03,447
I’m bored. I have nothing to do.

190
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,714
Stop it.

191
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,940
Can you kiss me?

192
00:23:24,274 --> 00:23:25,914
Jeez, what a lovey-dovey.

193
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:39,154
Here is the book that I borrowed.

194
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,620
Also, I already finished translating this book.

195
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,980
Can you please proofread it for me?

196
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,474
Sure.

197
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,674
What is it that you want to discuss with me?

198
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,687
Oh, never mind. Let’s talk about it next time.

199
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:20,154
Please go ahead. Just ignore me. Imagine I wasn’t here.

200
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,274
Who would dare to think like that, Your Highness.

201
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,260
You can leave if you are done, Lady Pin.

202
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:27,407
What I want to discuss with you is not something important.

203
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
Are you sure?

204
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:35,514
Yes.

205
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,594
Why didn’t he finish discussing the work with you?

206
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:56,020
Do you really not know? Who was it that kept pressuring him?

207
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,874
I didn’t pressure him at all.

208
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,580
Never mind.

209
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,127
I am free now. What would you like to eat?

210
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,647
Should we go to the market and find something delicious to eat?

211
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,994
Yes.

212
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:31,927
Anin.

213
00:25:38,114 --> 00:25:39,247
Do you want to eat this?

214
00:25:39,244 --> 00:25:40,100
Yes.

215
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:41,380
Can I have one please?

216
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,954
Can you eat it?

217
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,020
If you can, I also can.

218
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:50,180
Please be more careful. Don’t forget that you are a princess.

219
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,020
Is it good?

220
00:26:57,154 --> 00:26:57,927
Yes.

221
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:03,607
Your Highness.

222
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:06,274
Miss On.

223
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:10,620
Hello, Princess. Hello, Lady pin.

224
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:13,887
Hello.

225
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,980
Let me go!

226
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,234
I’ve loved you for so long.

227
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,180
Do you not know it, Your Highness?

228
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:27,554
I never think of you in that way.

229
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:38,967
Hello, Miss On.

230
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,967
Miss Aon.

231
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,687
It’s been a while. I did not know you already came back.

232
00:27:51,354 --> 00:27:55,180
Yes, Your Highness. My sister has asked me to come with her today.

233
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,140
Do you want to join us, Your Highness?

234
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:10,207
I’m afraid I can’t. I have another business to attend to. Please enjoy your day.

235
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:12,860
Yes, Your Highness.

236
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:14,260
Let’s go, Aon.

237
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,727
I was away for many years.

238
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:09,554
Everything has changed a lot.

239
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:17,434
The place might be changing as time goes by…

240
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,447
but my heart always remains the same.

241
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:29,007
So does mine.

242
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:48,314
From now on, we can finally be together forever.

243
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:52,527
We will never be parted again.

244
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:05,674
Are you sure that we will not be parted again?

245
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:07,540
Yes.

246
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,127
I will never leave your side.

247
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:14,167
I promise.

248
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:37,500
Hopefully, the princess will find someone she is interested in so that she will finally have a fiancé.

249
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:04,614
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

250
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:11,706
The Loyal Pin

251
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:21,726
Since Anin has finally returned for good,

252
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:24,606
Father has mentioned that he would like to arrange a welcome party for her.

253
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,872
But he is very busy with work at the moment.

254
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:30,739
So, he has asked me to take care of it instead.

255
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:36,259
Does His Highness want to arrange a party
for the princess to choose her marriage prospects?

256
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:39,966
But Mother would prefer it like that.

257
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,672
She would like to find a suitable spouse for Anin.

258
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:45,179
I believe your father did not agree with her.

259
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:48,766
Father does not wish to arrange such a party.

260
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,392
He only wants to arrange a welcome party for Anin.

261
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:56,752
His Highness probably cannot see anyone who is suitable for the princess.

262
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:03,832
I came here today because I would like to ask if you could please
help take care of the food and desserts in the party for me.

263
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:09,326
Of course. Please let me know the list of food and desserts that you would like me to prepare.

264
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,499
A welcome party for me?

265
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:17,112
Yes. I’ll let you decide how you would like it to be,
or whom you want as your guests.

266
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:21,912
Does Mother intend to invite my marriage prospects to this party?

267
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:28,979
Of course not. Don’t you worry.
She just wants to arrange a welcome party for you.

268
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:35,486
Then I do not have any problem with it.
I never wish to have a fiancé, nor will I get married.

269
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:40,419
About that, I’m afraid you cannot avoid it forever.

270
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,872
Eventually, you will have to get married.

271
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:53,646
Let’s talk about the party.

272
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,232
What kind of party do you prefer?

273
00:32:57,512 --> 00:32:58,699
Ummm

274
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:05,546
I’d like to have a small and friendly party in the garden. Just keep it simple.

275
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:06,299
Okay

276
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:10,699
If you prefer it like that, I would ask Pranot to help organize it.

277
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:13,179
He often arranged a party while he was in England.

278
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:16,712
That’s good. Pranot should know best what I want.

279
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:35,232
This green curry is too spicy. Add more water and a little salt.

280
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:36,206
Yes, Ma’am.

281
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:48,446
Regarding the welcome party for the princess,
our Lotus Palace would only take care of the refreshments and a few desserts.

282
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:49,512
Yes, Ma’am.

283
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:52,486
Why is that, Your Highness?

284
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:59,406
The Princess prefers to keep it simple.

285
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:04,699
It will be a small party in the garden.
Prince Anan has asked Mr. Pranot to help taking care of it.

286
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,992
He often arranged this kind of party when he was in England.

287
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,219
That sounds very interesting, Your Highness.

288
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:16,992
Hopefully, the princess will find someone
she is interested in so that she will finally have a fiancé.

289
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:21,246
A fiancé? What do you mean?

290
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,286
The princess already graduated. It is time for her to get married.

291
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:26,726
Princess Alisa is very worried about this.

292
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,099
She still could not find anyone who is suitable for the princess.

293
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:39,392
Does this mean the princess will have to get married soon, Your Highness?

294
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:43,019
Yes, so will you, Lady Pin.

295
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:48,832
Like I have said, you will eventually have to get married too.

296
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:54,419
Master Kuea…what do you think of him?

297
00:34:55,286 --> 00:34:58,952
I do not like him in that way. And I have not thought about marriage yet, Your Highness.

298
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:01,632
Then you should start thinking about it.

299
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:06,872
If you do not have anyone in your mind, please give Master Kuea a chance.

300
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:27,886
Hopefully, the princess will find someone
she is interested in so that she will finally have a fiancé.

301
00:35:29,446 --> 00:35:35,539
Does this mean the princess will have to get married soon, Your Highness?

302
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:41,699
Anin, someone might see us.

303
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:46,246
Don’t worry. I already paid Prik to be on the lookout for us.

304
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,619
What were you thinking about?

305
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:58,272
Why do you look so serious?

306
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,086
Yes?

307
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:17,979
I heard that they are looking for a marriage prospect for you.

308
00:36:19,952 --> 00:36:21,072
So, that was it.

309
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:32,272
Can we really love each other?

310
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:38,792
As Princess Patt said, you must eventually get married one day.

311
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,459
I will never get engaged or married to anyone.

312
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:54,152
Please believe me.

313
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:59,019
No one or anything can ever take us apart.

314
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,979
Yes, I believe you.

315
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:57,899
Please count them for me.

316
00:37:57,899 --> 00:37:58,699
Yes.

317
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:00,232
Please put them over there.

318
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:18,699
Like you said, Mr. Pranot is very good at this, Your Highness.

319
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,952
He can help us a lot.

320
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:25,019
He often arranged a party while we were in England,
so he is quite familiar with it.

321
00:38:25,979 --> 00:38:29,392
Where are His Highness Prince and Princess Alisa?
I have not seen them today.

322
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:31,699
Father and Mother have an urgent matter to attend to.

323
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:36,406
They would like you to help welcome the guests on their behalf.

324
00:38:36,712 --> 00:38:39,299
That would be my pleasure, Your Highness.

325
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:07,992
I will never let you out of my sight today.

326
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,992
Should you try to charm any man or woman,

327
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,246
I will punish you.

328
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:19,846
Oh!

329
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:22,726
How will you punish me?

330
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:25,126
Like this?

331
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:29,939
Anin.

332
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:37,792
I’m serious. If you are naughty, I will be mad at you.

333
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:42,299
It is you who must be careful.

334
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,459
Isn’t Master Kuea also coming today?

335
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:52,966
You do know that I never pay attention to him.

336
00:39:54,512 --> 00:39:55,139
Yes.

337
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:01,459
It is you who must be careful.

338
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:06,752
All men who come to this party will be looking for you.

339
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:08,952
What would you do then?

340
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:13,459
Huh

341
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:19,499
You smell nice.

342
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:52,592
Brother, Prince Derek is also a good choice for Anin, isn’t he?

343
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:56,926
His title is of a similar rank. He also looks very mature.

344
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:03,126
Of course he does. He is twelve years older than Anin. I’d rather not choose him.

345
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:08,419
What about Prince Danai? I believe you are quite fond of him.

346
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:11,432
Not this one. He is known for having plenty of wives.

347
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:18,232
What about that one over there? What do you think?

348
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:24,366
No. That one is also no. I do not see anyone who is suitable for Anin.

349
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:29,939
Of course you don’t. If her brother is this possessive,
I’m afraid she will never be able to get married.

350
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:34,766
Even if I were not possessive,

351
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,259
she would never get married to anyone that easily.

352
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:41,339
Regardless, today is not her marriage prospects party.

353
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,099
Stop trying to be a matchmaker for her.

354
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,566
Yes, Your Highness.

355
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:47,299
Your Highness.

356
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,312
What is it, Princess Patt?

357
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:54,226
I have just been informed that my friend has come to visit me at the Lotus Palace.

358
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:56,339
I’m afraid I would have to excuse myself from the party.

359
00:41:56,886 --> 00:41:58,232
Please don’t worry, Princess.

360
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:01,646
It was very kind of you to help us with the party today.

361
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,712
Then, please excuse me.

362
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:24,432
It seems that every prince who came to the party today…

363
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:27,712
would like you to choose them as your marriage prospect.

364
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:34,046
Good evening, Princess.

365
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:36,779
Good evening, Princess. I am Prince Derek.

366
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:39,392
Good evening, I am Prince Thumrong.

367
00:42:39,512 --> 00:42:40,486
I am Prince Bhadin.

368
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:02,832
Congratulations.

369
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:06,726
Congratulations.

370
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:08,726
Congratulations, Princess.

371
00:43:10,192 --> 00:43:11,446
Thank you.

372
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:15,779
We have prepared a selection of food for you today. Please enjoy yourself.

373
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:21,779
Wait.

374
00:43:24,286 --> 00:43:26,006
Isn’t this a German Pork Knuckle?

375
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:29,206
Do you want to try it?

376
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:30,686
Oh, no. Thank you.

377
00:43:30,832 --> 00:43:32,406
- Do you?
- Oh, I’d rather not.

378
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:33,392
Do you?

379
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,126
Come on, westerners also eat like this.

380
00:43:57,806 --> 00:43:59,086
Very crispy.

381
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,592
Do you want to have a bite?

382
00:44:04,326 --> 00:44:05,246
Try it.

383
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:06,736
No, thank you.

384
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:08,219
- It’s delicious.
- No, thank you.

385
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:09,992
- Try it.
- No, thank you.

386
00:44:10,286 --> 00:44:11,872
- Do you want some?
- I’d rather not.

387
00:44:14,806 --> 00:44:16,499
Please excuse me then. I must go and wash my hands.

388
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:33,059
Is that how you get rid of those men who are after you?

389
00:44:34,899 --> 00:44:36,952
You know me too well, Brother.

390
00:44:37,726 --> 00:44:39,539
Aren’t you afraid they would talk badly about you?

391
00:44:39,632 --> 00:44:42,472
That the princess of Savettawarit Palace is lack of a manner while eating.

392
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:49,472
If that could stop them from trying to pursue me, then I do not mind at all.

393
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:52,192
Do you not wish to get married that much?

394
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:53,579
Yes.

395
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:55,659
Princess.

396
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:00,446
Good evening, Your Highness.

397
00:45:01,686 --> 00:45:03,019
Hello, Lady Uang.

398
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:04,939
I did not know you would come.

399
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:08,912
Congratulations on your graduation, Your Highness.

400
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:10,339
Thank you.

401
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:14,072
Oh, there you are.

402
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:17,512
Hello, Miss On.

403
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,339
Hello, Princess.

404
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:28,339
Hello, Miss Aon. I did not know you would come.

405
00:45:29,886 --> 00:45:33,899
Hello, Princess. I am here to accompany my sister.

406
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:36,112
Prince Arnon has invited her to this party.

407
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,659
Yes.

408
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:41,699
Shall we take a seat then?

409
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,312
Let’s go sit at the table.

410
00:45:43,456 --> 00:45:44,659
Come.

411
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:55,219
The wine tastes bitter. But your tongue is so sweet.

412
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,406
Your Highness.

413
00:46:16,866 --> 00:46:21,226
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

414
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:28,314
The Loyal Pin

415
00:46:56,534 --> 00:47:02,427
Miss Aon, this is Lady Uangfah Darawan. She is my cousin.

416
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,000
Pleased to meet you.

417
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:06,227
Good evening.

418
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:13,227
This is Miss On, the eldest daughter of His Excellency Thai ambassador in England.

419
00:47:13,627 --> 00:47:15,574
She is Prince Arnon’s fiancé.

420
00:47:16,414 --> 00:47:17,360
Good evening.

421
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,414
Good evening.

422
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,867
This is Miss Aon, Miss On’s younger sister.

423
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,560
She is my school friend.

424
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,707
Aren’t we all familiar faces?

425
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:34,267
And this is Pranot, my best friend.

426
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:37,774
He was my number one lackey while I was in England.

427
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:43,766
I am sweet, kind, and also single.

428
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:47,830
Is that so?

429
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:59,990
Thank you.

430
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:07,318
Please try this, Your Highness.

431
00:48:08,742 --> 00:48:09,750
Thank you.

432
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:22,102
Look at that, Prik. Whether Lady Uang or Miss Aon,
none of them are genuine to the princess.

433
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:25,302
That is true, my lady.

434
00:48:26,342 --> 00:48:30,902
Perhaps you should go and let them know
who it is that holds the heart of the princess.

435
00:48:31,814 --> 00:48:34,518
I’d rather not. I do not want to be upset.

436
00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:36,214
Yes, my lady.

437
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:37,734
Lady Pin.

438
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:42,102
I’m sorry that I came late.

439
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,014
Should we go sit at the table together?

440
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,494
No, thank you. Please go ahead.

441
00:48:54,918 --> 00:48:56,262
Then I’d rather stay here.

442
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,334
How can I go if you’re not coming with me?

443
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:02,054
I’d rather stay here with you.

444
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:06,022
You don’t have to.

445
00:49:07,142 --> 00:49:08,518
Don’t worry. I’m willing to do it.

446
00:49:18,214 --> 00:49:21,958
If you are going to stand here like this, let’s go sit at the table.

447
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:29,142
Please.

448
00:49:30,294 --> 00:49:31,134
Yes.

449
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,590
Please have a seat.

450
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:59,062
Please try this one, Your Highness. It is very good.

451
00:49:59,238 --> 00:50:00,278
Thank you.

452
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:05,158
Try this one, Lady Pin.

453
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:06,422
It’s delicious.

454
00:50:06,998 --> 00:50:08,070
Thank you.

455
00:50:29,254 --> 00:50:32,230
Did you just down it, Anin? You’ll be drunk soon.

456
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,654
It’s once in a while. Let her be.

457
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,870
You always pamper her.

458
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,198
Give it to me.

459
00:50:56,034 --> 00:51:00,966
Wow, I never knew Anin is also good at drinking.

460
00:51:00,964 --> 00:51:05,318
She really is, Your Highness. But never let her get drunk. It’s a mess.

461
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:06,630
- Really, Pranot?    /    - Yes

462
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:07,510
Pranot.

463
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,726
- But there was this one time…
- Yes?

464
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:14,724
She even puked on me.

465
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:18,694
She did that to me too, Your Highness.

466
00:51:18,694 --> 00:51:20,662
When she is drunk, she would run around the palace…

467
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:23,734
laughing and crying while shouting that she misses home.

468
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:26,166
I had to calm her down all night.

469
00:51:29,142 --> 00:51:30,550
Is that true, Anin?

470
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:16,246
Would you like to have a dance with me, Lady Pin?

471
00:52:17,654 --> 00:52:19,622
No, I don’t like to dance.

472
00:52:21,878 --> 00:52:26,758
Then you must finish eating this.

473
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,526
Or else you will have to go out and dance with me.

474
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:32,550
Yes.

475
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:22,278
You are drunk.

476
00:53:23,574 --> 00:53:24,582
Pin.

477
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:31,590
I’m not drunk.

478
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,502
But you look like you are drunk.

479
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:45,174
How? Did you even notice? I saw you only spent time with that Master Kuea.

480
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:47,782
Of course, I did.

481
00:53:48,502 --> 00:53:53,158
Your cheeks are flushing red. Your eyes are so watery.

482
00:53:53,702 --> 00:53:56,326
Your breath must be filled with the scent of wine.

483
00:53:57,494 --> 00:53:59,334
I think we should…

484
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:16,006
How does the wine in my mouth taste?

485
00:54:19,474 --> 00:54:23,366
The wine tastes bitter but…

486
00:54:25,622 --> 00:54:27,814
your tongue is so sweet.

487
00:54:30,902 --> 00:54:32,870
Then, do you want to taste it again?

488
00:54:33,526 --> 00:54:35,190
So that you can get drunk too.

489
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:05,478
Why aren’t you walking straight, Pin?

490
00:55:06,422 --> 00:55:07,382
- Yes    /    - Oh!

491
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:09,158
Be careful.

492
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,966
Why must you drink this much?

493
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,390
How much?

494
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:23,702
Please wait right here.

495
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:26,726
I will get a cloth to wipe you so that you will become sober.

496
00:55:28,822 --> 00:55:30,150
I am not drunk.

497
00:55:30,918 --> 00:55:32,038
Yes, you are.

498
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,014
No, I am not. I am not!

499
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,070
Be careful.

500
00:55:44,902 --> 00:55:46,390
Pin, watch me.

501
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,686
Yes.

502
00:55:47,684 --> 00:55:49,462
I will walk straight to you.

503
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:54,902
Do you like to dance?

504
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:33,494
Does it feel better?

505
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,206
I feel so dizzy.

506
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:41,782
I would feel much better if you hug me.

507
00:56:44,998 --> 00:56:48,550
I shouldn’t have expected a serious answer from you.

508
00:56:50,134 --> 00:56:51,174
Why?

509
00:56:52,822 --> 00:56:57,030
A charming person often comes with a sweet talk.

510
00:57:00,038 --> 00:57:02,134
Did I do anything to upset you?

511
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:08,214
Now that you are sober enough, please answer me honestly.

512
00:57:10,726 --> 00:57:11,862
About what?

513
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:14,934
About Miss Aon.

514
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:20,918
How close is she to you?

515
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:26,230
Is there anything that I should know while you and her were in England together?

516
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:29,318
Well…

517
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:41,734
Yes?

518
00:57:46,118 --> 00:57:51,238
Miss Aon confessed she had feelings for me two years ago, not long after I returned to England.

519
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:00,502
How come you have never told me about this?

520
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:06,246
If it were you, would you tell me about Master Kuea?

521
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:10,598
Absolutely not.

522
00:58:12,582 --> 00:58:15,318
What did you tell Miss Aon then?

523
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:24,630
I only told her that I never loved her in the same way that she loved me.

524
00:58:25,494 --> 00:58:27,174
Please do not worry.

525
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:31,926
How could I not?

526
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:34,518
I saw it with my own eyes tonight…

527
00:58:34,646 --> 00:58:37,382
that she obviously still cannot get over you.

528
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:42,870
And Lady Uang did not even try to hide her feelings for you.

529
00:58:45,862 --> 00:58:48,310
But Lady Uang has never told me how she felt about me.

530
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:55,222
I’m afraid we could not accuse her like that.
Let’s just give her a benefit of the doubt.

531
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:59,142
- Give her a benefit of the doubt?
- Yeah

532
00:59:00,502 --> 00:59:02,646
I am not that kind.

533
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:09,110
You must be punished tonight.

534
00:59:12,102 --> 00:59:13,974
How will you punish me?

535
01:02:04,006 --> 01:02:05,094
Your Highness.

536
01:02:05,094 --> 01:02:07,654
Have you seen Anin?

537
01:02:07,926 --> 01:02:10,150
She has had a lot of wine. I couldn’t find her anywhere.

538
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:14,214
I saw her walking that way, Your Highness. She might go to the restroom.

539
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:17,654
I will go check on her then.

540
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:18,742
Yes, Your Highness.

541
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:44,438
Did you find her, Your Highness?

542
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,678
She was very drunk, so she already went back home.

543
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:51,302
Was she badly drunk, Your Highness?

544
01:02:51,638 --> 01:02:53,294
Why do you look so worried?

545
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:59,766
Nothing. Let’s go back to the party. People might be worrying about us.

546
01:02:59,974 --> 01:03:00,870
Yes, Your Highness.

548
01:03:22,326 --> 01:03:24,758
Brother and I are planning to go to Hua Hin for a vacation.

549
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:27,314
Would you like to join us too?

550
01:03:27,314 --> 01:03:31,030
Of course. Can I ask Lady Pin, Prik, and Pia to come with us too?

551
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:33,366
Sure, that would be fun.

552
01:03:34,822 --> 01:03:38,662
Are Miss Aon and Lady Uang coming too?

553
01:03:39,574 --> 01:03:40,710
Good morning, Your Highness.

554
01:03:42,086 --> 01:03:43,366
Surprise, Lady Pin.

555
01:03:43,622 --> 01:03:45,238
You also came?

556
01:03:46,006 --> 01:03:49,446
Hua Hin is a perfect place for lovers. I hope you can win over her heart soon.

557
01:03:51,142 --> 01:03:53,286
May I have a dance with you, Lady Pin?

558
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:11,794
🎵Nobody might know what it is…🎵

559
01:04:12,064 --> 01:04:21,430
🎵…that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you.🎵

560
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:27,514
🎵Nobody might agree with our love,🎵

561
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:34,118
🎵But please be patient and always…🎵

562
01:04:34,434 --> 01:04:44,102
🎵…wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite…🎵

563
01:04:44,102 --> 01:04:49,914
🎵…as we have promised each other that we’d wait…🎵

564
01:04:50,374 --> 01:04:57,686
🎵…until that day🎵

565
01:04:58,324 --> 01:05:09,718
🎵Until that day I will hold you in my arms,🎵

566
01:05:09,714 --> 01:05:12,118
🎵Kissing you through the night.🎵

567
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:22,314
🎵Can you wait for me, my baby?🎵
