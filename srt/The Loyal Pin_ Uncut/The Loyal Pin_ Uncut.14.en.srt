1
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,020
The Loyal Pin

2
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,020
For Lady Pin,

3
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:41,680
I wish to be happy in love.

4
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,300
Does this mean Lady Pin must move out of the palace soon?

5
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:49,440
Princess Patt is still very fond of Lady Pin.

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,176
So, we agree that I will move in to stay with her instead.

7
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,784
I am in fact very weak.

8
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,976
I am unable to be with the person I love the most.

9
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:28,048
Prik, is it true that you are going to accompany the princess to the North?

10
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:29,584
Yes.

11
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:32,208
How long will you be gone?

12
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:35,024
Maybe almost a month.

13
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,576
It is up to the princess.

14
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:42,496
She said she wants to stay there for as long as possible.

15
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,328
Really?

16
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,256
Yes.

17
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:49,456
Is the princess going to Prae again?

18
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,360
Yes, my lady.

19
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:04,544
Will she be staying at the Chao Fah Palace?

20
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,480
Yes, my lady.

21
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,616
Why is it so sudden?

22
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:03,328
Oh, Lady Pin. Hello.

23
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:07,520
Hello.

24
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,176
I am taking my leave.

25
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,176
You can find her upstairs, Lady Pin.

26
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:19,024
Yes.

27
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,640
Why are you here?

28
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,648
I…

29
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:41,456
I just want to know…

30
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:47,152
when you said last night that you were not feeling well,

31
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:50,880
are you better now?

32
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,160
Apart from my heart which has been shattered in pieces, I am quite fine indeed.

33
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:10,992
Do you know how your words could cut into my heart and bring me pain?

34
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:13,936
I thought I knew.

35
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,008
But it doesn’t seem so now.

36
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,328
For sometimes, you seem to have made your decision in such an unpredictable way.

37
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:27,968
Sometimes…

38
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:32,192
I do not have much of a choice.

39
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:39,056
Then why must you choose one that brings so much pain to both of us?

40
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:49,952
Even until now, are you still certain that the choice you have made is the best one?

41
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:14,048
Now I know that I have made the wrong decision.

42
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:19,296
That I am such a fool.

43
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,744
I am also suffering terribly.

44
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:37,472
I disgust myself every time I have to stand next to that man.

45
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:54,352
I heard you are going to stay at the Chao Fah Palace.

46
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,592
Can you please not go?

47
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,304
I want to escape from here…

48
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,592
so that I do not have to see you being together with Kueakiat.

49
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,392
Why must you let him move into your place?

50
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:24,640
It is upon Princess Patt’s request.

51
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,040
I also want to keep seeing you like I used to do.

52
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:35,456
He will only marry my name.

53
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:40,096
Please believe in me.

54
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:45,488
I was born to be yours, and yours only.

55
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:56,336
Then, I might not go to the Chao Fah Palace.

56
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:00,480
Are you serious?

57
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:03,856
I will go to further my study in England instead.

58
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,224
And I shall never return.

59
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:16,096
Can you please not go?

60
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:21,968
You used to promise that you would never leave me ever again.

61
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,952
Can you please not go?

62
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,040
Please go back.

63
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:57,504
From now on, I do not wish to see your face for even a second.

64
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:37,088
Did you agree to come with me because you wanted to avoid Lady Pin?

65
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,300
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

66
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,430
The Loyal Pin

67
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:40,490
Please.

68
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,802
Thank you.

69
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:10,506
Are you ready?

70
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:11,642
Yes.

71
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:48,906
Did you agree to come out with me because you wanted to avoid Lady Pin?

72
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:58,298
Yes.

73
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:03,786
I’m sorry I used you as an excuse.

74
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,090
Oh, it is nothing at all but…

75
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,914
What is it?

76
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:14,954
I’m afraid Lady Pin might misunderstand us and become even more distress.

77
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,546
I’m afraid it would only make the situation worse.

78
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,194
There is nothing worse than what it is right now.

79
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:26,378
I know that you are heartbroken.

80
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:30,042
But Lady Pin is also not much different from you.

81
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,770
Let’s talk about something else.

82
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:44,026
I will take you to the fabric shop. It is around here.

83
00:13:57,578 --> 00:13:58,730
Your Highness,

84
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,498
isn’t that Master Kueakiat?

85
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:57,722
The lady who is with him does not seem like a normal friend.

86
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:00,058
She is more like a lover.

87
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,730
Too bad I couldn’t catch up with them.

88
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,858
Or else we would have found out the truth.

89
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:09,610
It has been only a day after his engagement, and now he is cheating on her.

90
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:14,538
How I feel pity for Lady Pin if Master Kuea is in fact such a horrible man.

91
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:18,602
How miserable her life would be after the wedding?

92
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:26,042
If that is the case, then I shall never forgive him.

93
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,706
Lady Pin has only been engaged to Master Kuea.

94
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:36,266
She has not yet married him. There is still time to fix the situation.

95
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,594
The opportunity is yours now.

96
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:41,882
Please do not give up just yet.

97
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:55,034
You saw Kueakiat with another woman?

98
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:56,794
Yes.

99
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,050
Just as I thought.

100
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:03,786
What is it?

101
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:10,138
It’s my subordinates. They all came to warn me about Kueakiat
when they knew Lady Pin would be engaged to him.

102
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,154
They said Kueakiat is such a Casanova.

103
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,746
And that he is in fact seeing a lot of girls secretly.

104
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:20,682
So, I decided to investigate on him because I wanted to help you and Lady Pin.

105
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,586
At first, I thought Kueakiat might be dating his own secretary.

106
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,330
So, I secretly followed him.

107
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:38,442
Have some more fish. I heard the chef said
that he ordered it from Mahachai fish market.

108
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:43,914
Are you full?

109
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,594
I spied on him for a while.

110
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:49,706
There you are.

111
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:51,354
Hello.

112
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,834
But in the end, I found out that his secretary already has a husband.

113
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:57,306
Goodbye.

114
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:06,266
I tried to investigate more but still couldn’t find out much.

115
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,794
I will take care of the rest.

116
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:15,386
I first wanted to give up on Lady Pin.

117
00:17:16,058 --> 00:17:18,778
But if Kueakiat is having such a horrid behaviour,

118
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:21,018
I’m afraid I could not let it happen.

119
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:28,522
If you need my help, just say it.

120
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:30,794
I am willing to help.

121
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:37,658
Take it.

122
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,018
What do you want me to do, Your Highness?

123
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:47,834
Thank you, Your Highness.

124
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:53,562
I want you to keep an eye on Kueakiat at his workplace.

125
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:57,738
If you find anything suspicious, let me know immediately.

126
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,282
You want me to spy on Master Kuea, Your Highness?

127
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,578
After spying on him for many days,

128
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:16,538
I found out that he often left his workplace around late afternoon.

129
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:19,322
He will come out in a minute, Your Highness.

130
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:26,266
Anin often told me that you are so smart and witty. Now I know it must be true.

131
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:31,866
Oh please, Your Highness. I am not that good.

132
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:37,258
She is also a master in disguising herself.

133
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,306
She could blend in with the mud, a tree, or even an electric pole.

134
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:46,186
Thank you, Your Highness. I’m so flattered.

135
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,274
She also has eyes and ears everywhere. Her hearing is exceptional.

136
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:55,610
No matter how far it is, if she wants to hear it, she will hear it.

137
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,746
Just a moment, Your Highness.

138
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,658
Are you talking about me or a necromancer?

139
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:02,490
Never mind. You can be whatever you like,

140
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:04,618
as long as we can unveil this secret.

141
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,490
Yes, Your Highness.

142
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:13,450
Do I look good?

143
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:15,322
There he is, Your Highness.

144
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,074
Please don’t turn around! He might see us.

145
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:30,602
Please follow me.

146
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,170
He always comes here for a meal, Your Highness.

147
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,058
That girl is the restaurant owner’s daughter.

148
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:01,546
Her name is Aoyjai. Such a sweet name for it is.

149
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,826
So is her face.

150
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,458
She is a sweetheart for people in this area.

151
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,810
When Master Kuea came for a meal,

152
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:15,210
he would always try to talk to her and keep making eyes at her every single time.

153
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:21,178
Kueakiat surely is very flirtatious. What a Casanova.

154
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,890
Indeed, Your Highness. And he is taking so long to finish his meal.

155
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,242
He takes each bite slowly and deliberately.

156
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:31,178
I just know that it is long past his break time.

157
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:35,066
Please don’t forget that you are also not working at the moment, Your Highness.

158
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,042
I am on business leave to carry out this mission for Anin.

159
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,570
I am not using my work time for personal leisure like him.

160
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:47,242
Can you not make an exception for me, Prik?

161
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:50,554
My apology, Your Highness.

162
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,146
Sometimes, Master Kuea would return to the Ministry after his meal.

163
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,378
But most of the time, he would just skip his work.

164
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:06,714
I do not know where he went afterwards for I do not have a car to follow him.

165
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,418
Oh, he is leaving. Quickly follow him!

166
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:19,290
My apology, Your Highness.

167
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:20,554
Let’s go.

168
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,402
I’m sorry!

169
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,690
Are you all right?

170
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:54,666
Are you all right?

171
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:56,234
Are you hurt?

172
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,290
I’m fine, thank you.

173
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:08,810
Where did he go?

174
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,234
I’m afraid we have lost him.

175
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:29,002
I have never done anything like this before in my life.

176
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,922
Thank you so much, Brother, for helping me.

177
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,234
I’m afraid I won’t be able to go with you tomorrow.

178
00:22:40,778 --> 00:22:42,282
I’m only taking one day off from work.

179
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:46,266
Don’t worry, I will go with Prik tomorrow.

180
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,194
The wedding day is approaching in a few days.

181
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,978
I am running out of time to help Lady Pin.

182
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:28,554
Has the princess gone out today, Your Highness?

183
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:29,994
I do not see her car.

184
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:35,498
Yes, she comes home late every day lately.

185
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,306
She must be hanging around with Miss Aon as usual.

186
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:41,300
Yes, Your Highness.

187
00:23:45,706 --> 00:23:51,002
It is only two more days before your wedding. How is the preparation going?

188
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,578
Very well, Your Highness.

189
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:56,714
I will go out with Master Kuea to try on the wedding dress today.

190
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:19,514
Apart from Her Highness Princess Imm,
I had never embroidered Sabai* for anyone. (*shawl or breath cloth)

191
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:24,490
But this time, I did it for you.

192
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:31,498
It’s beautiful, Your Highness.

193
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:36,666
Is Kueakiat coming to pick you up at three this afternoon?

194
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:42,890
He asked his servant to inform me that he won’t be able
to come today because he has a business to attend to.

195
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,650
What business?

196
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,266
Is it more important than his own wedding?

197
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:11,658
It seems Master Kuea will not come here for a meal today.

198
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:14,570
What should we do, Your Highness?

199
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:23,162
Let’s go talk to Aoyjai then.

200
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:35,754
Let’s sit here, Your Highness.

201
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:44,218
Hello.

202
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:46,210
- Hello.
- What would you like to have today?

203
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:47,594
Here is the menu.

204
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,906
Wow, everything looks delicious.

205
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:55,626
I’ll take this one then.

206
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:56,698
Yes.

207
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:59,274
And also this one.

208
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:00,458
Sure.

209
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,274
And…this one too.

210
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:07,642
What would you like, dear?

211
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:10,922
I’ll have what she’s having.

212
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:12,090
Yes.

213
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:15,706
- Please wait a moment.
- Yes.

214
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,202
- Wait a minute.
- Yes?

215
00:26:20,202 --> 00:26:22,200
Can I ask you something?

216
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:27,610
That handsome guy who often comes here to have his lunch,

217
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:29,018
is he not here today?

218
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:34,730
The one wearing a suit with a pretty face like a popular stage actor.

219
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:40,634
I think his name is Ku…Kuea something. I am not sure either.

220
00:26:41,194 --> 00:26:44,666
Do you mean Master Kuea, one with fair skin?

221
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:47,790
Oh, that’s right. Does he also have a title?

222
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,394
Yes, he is working for the Ministry.

223
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,018
I heard it is quite a big position. He is handsome and very friendly.

224
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,282
But he is not a stage actor.

225
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,354
I see. If he is so handsome,

226
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,114
I believe he must be married already.

227
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:03,110
He told me he is still single.

228
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,770
He sometimes asked me out to a movie.

229
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:07,194
But I didn’t go with him.

230
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,458
I used to see him drove past by with another woman by his side.

231
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,850
I’m afraid people might accuse me of having an affair.

232
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:19,018
That woman might be his colleague.

233
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:23,386
I don’t think so. I saw her wearing a university uniform.

234
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,138
But I have not seen her for a while though.

235
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:30,058
How kind of you. Thank you so much.

236
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,610
No problem. Please wait a moment.

237
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,810
Yes.

238
00:27:56,362 --> 00:27:57,578
Our target has shown up, Your Highness.

239
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:08,746
Let’s go.

240
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:13,914
Yes, Ma’am.

241
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,578
Turn left at the next junction, Your Highness.

242
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:06,426
I’m afraid we must wait here until he comes out again.

243
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,970
What if he spends a night here, Your Highness?

244
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,698
Do we have to sleep in the car then?

245
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:15,146
I’ll let you stay and keep watch.

246
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:17,066
Your Highness!

247
00:29:43,594 --> 00:29:44,810
He is coming out, Your Highness.

248
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:47,114
Oh!

249
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:54,586
Whom are you looking for?

250
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,162
I am here to see you.

251
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,522
I have something to tell you about Master Kueakiat.

252
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,550
The Loyal Pin
MingErTeamSub & @TheLoyalPin2024

253
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:46,651
The Loyal Pin

254
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:04,653
He is coming out, Your Highness.

255
00:31:06,453 --> 00:31:06,759
Oh my god!

256
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,951
Kissing each other like that, they are clearly not friends, Your Highness.

257
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:35,284
I will go talk to her.

258
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:36,751
Let’s go, Your Highness.

259
00:31:55,724 --> 00:31:59,017
Excuse me, is there anyone home?

260
00:32:01,924 --> 00:32:05,137
Excuse me, is anyone…

261
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,484
Whom are you looking for?

262
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:40,204
I am here to see you.

263
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:43,524
I have something to tell you about Master Kueakiat.

264
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,431
Are you one of his people?

265
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:10,764
I’m sorry for intruding, but may I ask if you are pregnant with Master Kuea?

266
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,364
Yes.

267
00:33:18,004 --> 00:33:21,831
Are you aware that he already has a fiancé?

268
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:23,551
I beg your pardon?

269
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:27,031
I am his wife.

270
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:30,644
How could he have a fiancé?

271
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:36,524
Did he marry you properly and apply for a marriage certificate?

272
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,791
Not yet. But he told me he would do it soon.

273
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,351
That means you are still clueless…

274
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:49,124
about his recent engagement with Lady Pilanthita.

275
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:51,804
It was held at Savettawarit Palace a few days ago.

276
00:33:54,377 --> 00:33:55,431
I don’t believe you.

277
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,097
I am carrying his child.

278
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:01,324
He promised me that he would marry me next month.

279
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:04,231
He also bought this house for me.

280
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:06,377
Why on earth would he do that?

281
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:01,004
He already has someone else?

282
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,404
That was just an engagement.

283
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:12,497
By this time on the day after tomorrow, Master Kueakiat will officially be married…

284
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:15,844
to Lady Pilanthita at Savettawarit Palace.

285
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,284
Will that make me his mistress?

286
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:25,791
It is not too late if you wish to object to this marriage.

287
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:27,351
I will help you.

288
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,897
I’m too scared to do it. Please go back.

289
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:47,217
But what you choose to do will decide the fate of another woman and your own.

290
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:52,604
Please reconsider it. I am begging you.

291
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:04,071
Kueakiat already has a wife who is pregnant with him?

292
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:08,911
Yes, her belly is even bigger than a watermelon, Your Highness.

293
00:36:09,577 --> 00:36:12,071
Should we tell Princess Patt to cancel the engagement?

294
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:18,564
This is serious. If we do not have solid evidence…

295
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,377
or if she does not show up herself,

296
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,751
I’m afraid it is us who would be ruined.

297
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,257
And if Kueakiat insists on his innocence,

298
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:28,631
then we cannot do anything to him.

299
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:37,231
Then I must find a way to make him admit it to Princess Patt.

300
00:36:39,084 --> 00:36:41,257
But we only have one more day left, Your Highness.

301
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:45,711
Also, Miss Savitree seems to love Master Kuea very much.

302
00:36:46,511 --> 00:36:48,111
So much that she is afraid to sabotage him.

303
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:50,951
I don’t think she will cooperate with us, Your Highness.

304
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:01,884
- Please go back.
- Oh my god!

305
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:03,804
- Please listen to us first.
- Please go back.

306
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,124
Don’t ever come here again.

307
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:08,457
Please go back.

308
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:10,591
I do not dare to do anything like that.

309
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,844
But are you willing to be his mistress…

310
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:15,551
and keep being his secret wife for the rest of your life?

311
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:19,791
If I do as you have asked, his future will be ruined.

312
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,804
He will be so mad at me. And hate me.

313
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:24,604
Or we might fight so hard and break up in the end.

314
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,591
Will you let your child be fatherless?

315
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:30,551
Will you let him fool another innocent woman?

316
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:34,791
Will you let him cheat on you and her even when he is not married yet?

317
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:38,031
You still have a chance to make everything right.

318
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:47,524
No.

319
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:50,884
I’d rather live my life quietly like this.

320
00:37:51,217 --> 00:37:52,657
I do not want to give people something to gossip about.

321
00:37:54,457 --> 00:37:55,884
Hey, please wait!

322
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:56,844
Miss Savitree.

323
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,151
- Hey!     /    - Miss Savitree!

324
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,457
Tomorrow is the wedding day. What shall we do, Your Highness?

325
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:09,617
There is only one way left for us to help Lady Pin.

326
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:14,657
Are you going to run away with her, Your Highness?

327
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:17,217
Who said I would do that?

328
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,977
What are we going to do then, Your Highness?

329
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:30,177
I will tell Princess Patt and Lady Pin the truth,
so that she would cancel this marriage.

330
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:35,804
Will Princess Pattamika believe us, Your Highness?

331
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:44,537
Kueakiat already has a wife?

332
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,097
Where did you get that opinion from?

333
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:51,831
It is the truth. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Prik.

334
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:03,897
Then, why has that woman not shown up and speak for herself?

335
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,831
Shouldn’t she be the one who finds this marriage most unacceptable?

336
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:12,724
Does this mean you do not believe me?

337
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,537
I was only speculating.

338
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:19,631
You have always been persistent, Princess.

339
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,631
And you would always do anything to get what you wish for.

340
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:28,484
This time, you do not wish Lady Pin to be married.

341
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:39,511
What my princess told you is true, Your Highness.

342
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,951
You can have my head cut off if it is otherwise.

343
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,831
Even if what she said it true,

344
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:53,977
I cannot cancel the wedding which will happen tomorrow…

345
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:56,657
just because your princess said so without any evidence.

346
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:03,177
If you do not cancel this marriage,

347
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:08,311
you will surely regret it one day.

348
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,204
I believe you, Anin.

349
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:00,657
And please know how I am so thankful that you still care…

350
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,097
and try to help me.

351
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:10,084
But things have gone far beyond our control now.

352
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:13,617
I’m afraid I won’t be able to change anything.

353
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:19,177
It must be my own karma that I deserve to pay for it.

354
00:41:27,297 --> 00:41:28,831
If you want to run away from it,

355
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:31,924
I will go with you.

356
00:41:33,177 --> 00:41:34,737
You only have to say it.

357
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:42,537
How I wish I could do that.

358
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:49,444
But if I am to follow my own heart…

359
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:53,964
our aunt,

360
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:55,961
you,

361
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:57,991
and His Highness…

362
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:01,991
all their names will be tainted.

363
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:14,551
So, you chose to walk this path instead?

364
00:42:15,124 --> 00:42:16,697
Even if it pains you to death…

365
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:19,351
as if you are living in hell for the rest of your life.

366
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:25,151
Yes.

367
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:35,991
I am willing to live with all those pains for the rest of my life…

368
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:44,524
to redeem myself from all the wrongs I have done to you.

369
00:43:02,484 --> 00:43:03,537
Then…

370
00:43:08,577 --> 00:43:10,524
I can only wish you…

371
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:14,311
to live happily with him.

372
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:59,937
The princess has gone to Hua Hin with Miss Aon, Your Highness.

The Loyal Pin

375
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,963
You look breathtaking, my lady.

376
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:42,937
Do you think Princess Anin will come to the wedding?

377
00:46:49,457 --> 00:46:51,577
Definitely not, my lady.

378
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:57,817
The princess already left for Hua Hin last night.

379
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:08,323
Why did Princess Alisa allow her to go there on such an important day like this?

380
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:20,123
Princess Anin did not ask for approval from her mother, my lady.
She merely informed her about it.

381
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:24,283
Did she go alone?

382
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:29,977
With Miss Aon, my lady.

383
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,363
Only two of them?

384
00:47:40,963 --> 00:47:41,963
Yes, my lady.

385
00:48:15,737 --> 00:48:20,817
It is almost time for the ceremony, my lady.

386
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,123
Please smile a little.

387
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:05,217
Can you accept this ring as a gift…

388
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:11,337
that portrays all my feelings for you?

389
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:14,923
Yes.

390
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:22,230
I will accept all your feelings and cherish them forever.

391
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:39,070
Let’s go swim.

392
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,363
Let’s not.

393
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:03,723
I’m Anin.

394
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:08,737
What’s your name?

395
00:51:10,283 --> 00:51:11,910
Pilanthita, Your Highness.

396
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,550
Are you happy today?

397
00:51:16,777 --> 00:51:18,257
I am so happy.

398
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,217
Yes, I am.

399
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,763
I will write to you every day.

400
00:51:29,163 --> 00:51:30,217
I promise.

401
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:50,190
And this…

402
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:53,923
is called French kiss.

403
00:51:55,510 --> 00:52:00,257
It is used to express love and desire and between lovers.

404
00:52:05,403 --> 00:52:08,897
Whom does Pilanthita belong to?

405
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:12,323
Pilanthita…

406
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,697
belongs to Princess Anilaphat…

407
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,430
and hers only.

408
00:53:41,283 --> 00:53:42,137
Let’s go.

409
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,790
Oh, 3 envelopes?

410
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,670
Here you go.

411
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:03,923
Thank you.

412
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:05,017
Thank you, Miss On.

413
00:54:06,457 --> 00:54:08,523
Oh, it’s Lady Uang.

414
00:54:10,483 --> 00:54:11,523
How many?

415
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:15,317
6 envelopes?!

416
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:19,817
You want 6? Here you go.

417
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,030
Thank you.

The Loyal Pin

419
00:58:12,057 --> 00:58:13,537
I don’t want to eat anything.

420
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:18,483
Knowing that by now Lady Pin might already be Kueakiat’s arms…

421
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:20,843
makes my heart wrench terribly.

422
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,630
You can’t marry her!

423
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,643
Who are you?

424
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,843
I am the groom’s wife.

425
00:58:36,657 --> 00:58:38,723
What does this mean, Kueakiat?

426
00:58:42,683 --> 00:58:44,323
Lady Pin!

427
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:45,963
- Lady Pin!
- Lady Pin!

428
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,137
Watch out, Your Highness!

429
00:58:53,723 --> 00:58:59,997
🎵Nobody might know what it is…🎵

430
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:09,697
🎵…that we have for each other, and how my heart belongs to you.🎵

431
00:59:09,697 --> 00:59:15,837
🎵Nobody might agree with our love,🎵

432
00:59:16,027 --> 00:59:22,083
🎵But please be patient and always…🎵

433
00:59:22,697 --> 00:59:32,350
🎵…wait for that day when you and I can finally reunite…🎵

434
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:38,077
🎵…as we have promised each other that we’d wait…🎵

435
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:46,097
🎵 …until that day 🎵

436
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:58,003
🎵 Until that day I will hold you in my arms,🎵

437
00:59:57,997 --> 01:00:00,363
🎵 Kissing you through the night. 🎵

438
01:00:00,357 --> 01:00:10,137
🎵Can you wait for me, my baby?🎵
