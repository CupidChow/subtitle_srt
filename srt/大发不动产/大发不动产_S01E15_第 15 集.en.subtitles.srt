1
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,834
Ms. Choi.

2
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,314
Yes, she just went in.

3
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,775
She heard the recording file.

4
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,319
And I told her everything. Let's wait.

5
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,571
It will be hard
to make a decision right away.

6
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,989
Great work.

7
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,617
Should I pick up some food on my way back?

8
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,161
How about the macarons
I got you last time?

9
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,287
No, thanks.

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,009
King-sized dumplings.
With both meat and kimchi.

11
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,528
This is Hong Ji-a, Daebak Realty.

12
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,737
Ms. Hong?

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,324
I'll testify.

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,994
There's a secret ledger,
but it's somewhere else, not here.

15
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,998
That ledger is the record
of all of Dohak's corruption.

16
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,001
It'll be

17
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,088
more than enough evidence.

18
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,173
Ms. Choi.

19
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,260
Thank you for your courage.

20
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,316
That guy is…

21
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,626
At 10:30 p.m.,
at Sky Building in Haengun-dong, Seoul,

22
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,377
-Oh In-beom.
-a fire incident

23
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,755
suspected to be
a gas explosion took place.

24
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,153
In-beom!

25
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,475
In-beom.

26
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,872
Mom!

27
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,982
What are you doing?

28
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,717
In-beom.

29
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,760
Are you okay?

30
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,515
What happened?

31
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,434
There was an explosion.

32
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,105
An explosion?

33
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,569
Hairy…

34
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,329
One of Do Hak-seong's henchmen
who lied to us about the cold storage.

35
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,291
Right after Ms. Choi entered Sky Building,

36
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,502
I saw him leaving the building.

37
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,889
The police obtained security footage
that's from before the explosion.

38
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,645
They'll make a composite
based on the information we gave them,

39
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,439
and put out an APB by tonight.

40
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,567
Do Hak-seong is
more terrifying than ghosts.

41
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,402
She's been his secretary for 20 years.

42
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,864
We must find him before the police do.

43
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,325
That guy headed toward
the intersection in Haengun-dong.

44
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,161
Okay. I'm sure we'll find a lead

45
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,663
if we check the security footage
and his call records.

46
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,918
Give me a list of Choi's real estate.

47
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,754
Include ones that are
under other people's names.

48
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,923
Why do you want to see that?

49
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,634
When she last called me,

50
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,554
she agreed to testify
and mentioned a secret ledger.

51
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,432
There's a secret ledger,
but it's somewhere else, not here.

52
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,977
That ledger is the record
of all of Dohak's corruption.

53
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,687
It'll be

54
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,939
more than enough evidence.

55
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,608
I'll look into it right away.

56
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,862
Will we be able to bring him down

57
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,780
we find that secret ledger?

58
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,950
We must.

59
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,038
That scumbag is really unbelievable.

60
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,374
How many innocent lives did he take
just to murder Ms. Choi?

61
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,824
Didn't I tell you

62
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,536
you wouldn't be able to catch me?

63
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,663
You just wait.

64
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,457
I'll make sure you get sacked
at all costs.

65
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,168
Go home safely, sir.

66
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,461
We'll meet again soon.

67
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,848
-Here he comes.
-Here he comes.

68
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,977
-Move aside.
-Is it true that you instigated

69
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,478
the Yongnam Village fire?

70
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,230
Please tell us!

71
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,023
Please tell us something!

72
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,359
-Please share a word or two!
-Is it true?

73
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,694
Tell us your thoughts!

74
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,280
Please comment!
Do you admit to your offenses?

75
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,342
Sir, it's very difficult to reach you.

76
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,761
Not that

77
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,099
I needed your help to get myself out.

78
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,978
Okay. Sure.

79
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,232
Have you reached Assemblyman Han?

80
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,276
Not yet, sir.

81
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,278
Those darn scumbags.

82
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,572
How dare they treat me like a spent force?

83
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,451
What about the guy who rigged it?

84
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,412
He'll be stowing away
on a ship early tomorrow morning.

85
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,084
I've located Hairy.

86
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,049
DAEBAK REALTY

87
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,270
He turned on his phone for a brief moment,
and it was around Haeseong Port, Incheon.

88
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:50,900
DAEBAK REALTY

89
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,152
I'll call the police for help.

90
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,528
Be careful, guys.

91
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,450
Even if we get him, he won't confess
easily that Do Hak-seong ordered it.

92
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,244
When we handed him over
to the police last time,

93
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,414
he played innocent until he was let go.

94
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,916
This time, he'll spill.

95
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,626
How are you so sure?

96
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,962
Because I won't hand him over
to the police.

97
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,537
Hello, sir.

98
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,061
Wait. Over there.

99
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,855
Hairy was on that motorcycle.

100
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,819
I heard you handled it nicely.

101
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,655
Well done.

102
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,782
Leave Korea for a while.

103
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,159
Thank you, sir.

104
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,296
No. You can't die.

105
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,260
A man is bleeding and unconscious.
Hurry to the warehouse at Haeseong Port!

106
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,563
Stop it.

107
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,400
It's too late.

108
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,878
YOO YEONG-JAE

109
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,922
Get the necklace ready.

110
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,760
YOO YEONG-JAE

111
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,065
Now.

112
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,449
I'm inside.

113
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,120
She just left.
So she'll be there in ten minutes.

114
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,454
So get it done in time.

115
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,414
Yes, sir.

116
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,291
Ten minutes?

117
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,127
That's more than enough time.

118
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,505
Let's see.

119
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,091
Oh, my.

120
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,803
You'll be burnt away anyway.
So why don't you come with me?

121
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,310
What's this? Is it a key to a safe?

122
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,988
I heard you handled it nicely.

123
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,824
Well done.

124
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,035
Leave Korea for a while.

125
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,328
Thank you, sir.

126
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,922
Thank you, sir!

127
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,267
Sir…

128
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:21,397
You can get arrested abroad
and sent back these days.

129
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,253
The key.

130
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,587
What?

131
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,091
He took a key from Ms. Choi's house.

132
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,813
Choi Seon-mi had a townhouse
under a borrowed name.

133
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,774
And there's a private safe
for the residents in the basement.

134
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,568
What's the name of the townhouse?

135
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,528
Happy Townhouse.

136
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,323
Okay. I got it.

137
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,471
Hairy stole this key
when he broke into Ms. Choi's house.

138
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,849
You'll find a secret ledger there.

139
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,146
Did you find this out
from the spirit's memories again?

140
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,715
DOHAK CONSTRUCTION

141
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,366
CHAIRMAN DO HAK-SEONG

142
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,286
Put an APB out on Do Hak-seong right now.

143
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,329
Yes, sir.

144
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,918
Push ahead with the safety inspection
of Sky Building.

145
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,003
If you dawdle and anything goes wrong,

146
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,713
it will be the end for all of us.

147
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,841
There was an explosion in the building.

148
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,635
What if we have people
move back and something happens?

149
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,679
Buildings don't collapse that easily.

150
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,809
Gosh. Mr. Do… No.

151
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,353
Do Hak-seong caused all of this mess.

152
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,148
Please take care of it.
I'll help you if you need anything.

153
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,149
Yes, sir.

154
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,153
Mr. Jung.

155
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,369
You…

156
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,372
Did you enjoy your meal?

157
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,457
What do you think you're doing? How rude!

158
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,048
ARREST WARRANT

159
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,261
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of taking bribes.

160
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,183
What are you doing?

161
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,350
-Let go of me!
-Let go!

162
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,936
-Hey.
-Mr. Jung. Hey!

163
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,980
How could you do this to me?

164
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,524
-Let go.
-Hey! You bastards!

165
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,568
Let go of me!

166
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,738
Okay. Thank you for your help.

167
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,868
The evidence he got from Choi's storage

168
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,661
will be enough to prove him guilty

169
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,331
of embezzlement,
bribery, and aiding and abetting murder.

170
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,210
Even Do Hak-seong won't
be able to get away this time.

171
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,130
But what's the point? He already ran away.

172
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,467
There's an APB on him,
and he's on the No-Fly List.

173
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,801
He'll be apprehended soon.

174
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,806
So it's like Choi took revenge
on Do Hak-seong after she was killed.

175
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,227
That scum ought to be crushed.

176
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,021
There are just so many victims.

177
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,316
And I hear the death toll is still rising
at the hospital.

178
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,948
I'm not sure it's related, but
a strange rumor is going around online.

179
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,491
"A strange rumor"?

180
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,370
A lot of people are saying
they saw a ghost at Sky Building.

181
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,207
But what's odd is
that the ghost is faceless,

182
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,793
and whoever sees the ghost ends up dying.

183
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,218
What's wrong?

184
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,806
Did I say something wrong?

185
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,854
JINSEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

186
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,237
It can't be, right?

187
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,294
The doctor says
it's something like mass hysteria

188
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,297
and that he'll be fine
once he's treated and stable.

189
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,428
We're all going to die.

190
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,888
It's going to kill all of us!

191
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,517
You'll be okay, honey.
Calm down. Goodness.

192
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,478
No, that sound…

193
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,316
That's the sound
of the faceless ghost coming.

194
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,859
Don't kill me.

195
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,944
-Don't kill me.
-Honey.

196
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,154
Please.

197
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,947
All right, calm down.

198
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,408
Someone help him, please. Doctor!

199
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,381
That's the second person.

200
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,634
He said he saw the faceless ghost
and ended up dying too.

201
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,803
What if something bad happens to us too?

202
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,888
Tell me about it.

203
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,475
What on earth is happening?
I'm too frightened to stay here.

204
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,854
The faceless ghost

205
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,231
he mentioned earlier

206
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,067
is the egg ghost, isn't it?

207
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,278
The same one
that possessed me 20 years ago.

208
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:45,739
Yes.

209
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,325
Like that time,

210
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,411
people who died at once in the fire
became an egg ghost.

211
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,751
That means, once again,

212
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,004
an egg ghost was created
because of Do Hak-seong.

213
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,891
Are you saying the egg ghost
is killing people at the hospital?

214
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,520
The egg ghost is
at Sky Building right now.

215
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,439
People who died in the hospital

216
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,151
probably had been bewitched by it
back at the Sky Building.

217
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,821
Egg ghost…

218
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,573
Is there really no way to exorcise it?

219
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,783
There's only one way.

220
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,497
It's stabbing a person possessed by it
with a nameless needle and killing it.

221
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,253
A person who's possessed by the egg ghost?

222
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,504
Isn't it a psychic?

223
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,176
Are you saying In-beom has to die?

224
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,847
An egg ghost can possess
an exorcist's body as well.

225
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,815
Then are you saying
either one of you has to die?

226
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,701
You're kidding, right?

227
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,542
Let's just not do this one.

228
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,174
If we let it go on,
it'll continue to kill people.

229
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,094
It doesn't go around
killing people forever.

230
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,931
It vanishes once it kills enough people
to vent its spite.

231
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,934
How many people must die
before it loses its spite?

232
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,477
One hundred? Two hundred?

233
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,896
What if it's 1,000 people?

234
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,774
Can we sacrifice one person

235
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,028
to save 1,000 people?

236
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,658
If I don't perform an exorcism on him,
more people will die.

237
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,744
To stop that disaster,

238
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,746
we must sacrifice the boy.

239
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,247
What are you talking about?

240
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,627
A disaster or not,
I'll never let you kill In-beom!

241
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,890
An egg ghost is

242
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,935
an evil spirit
that cannot be controlled by humans.

243
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,270
It's like a natural disaster.

244
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,856
How is this a natural disaster?

245
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:28,818
People who died because of Do Hak-seong
became an egg ghost.

246
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,363
And that egg ghost is
going to kill more people.

247
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,784
-We can't turn a blind eye to it.
-What if we don't? Do you have a plan?

248
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,203
What now?

249
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,163
Will you sacrifice yourself?

250
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,998
No, that's out of the question!

251
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,462
-I'm saying I'll find a way.
-That's enough, all of you.

252
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,260
In-beom.

253
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,012
Do whatever you want.

254
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,766
Go find a way
or help those unfortunate people.

255
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,061
Do whatever you like.
But I'm not taking part in this.

256
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,858
Don't ever bring up
"egg ghost" in front of me.

257
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,996
I'm looking

258
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,333
into the possibility of revoking
the building permit on Sky Building.

259
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,713
The permit shouldn't have been granted
due to faulty construction.

260
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,008
But Do lobbied some people
and completed the building.

261
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,469
If it's revoked,

262
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,931
we'll be able to prevent
huge accidents for a while.

265
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,474
Mom…

266
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,079
You can't exorcise it by yourself.

267
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,207
Ms. Hong is out. What's with you?

268
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,125
Stop thinking.

269
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,130
Okay. We'll find a way.

270
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,632
Yes.

271
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,134
Let's just go to bed.

272
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,052
Okay.

273
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,263
-Good night.
-Night.

274
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,491
I'm different from my mom.

275
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,285
I can ignore this.

276
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,497
I can ignore it.

277
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,084
I can.

278
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,161
Hello, may I have a word with you?

279
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,287
Sure, go ahead.

280
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,165
You were at the scene of the fire
at Sky Building, right?

281
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,082
Yes.

282
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,293
I have a question about it.

283
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,923
LIST OF DEATHS IN THE SKY BUILDING FIRE

284
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,723
I never even saw the fire
because of the thick smoke.

285
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,978
There were sprinklers,
but they never went off.

286
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,523
LEE JAE-PIL, 49, MALE, SUFFOCATION,
DIED AT THE SCENE

287
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,819
DIED AT THE SCENE

288
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,701
There was a lot of smoke
due to the cheap interior material,

289
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,246
and the sprinklers didn't go off,
so it became worse.

290
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,123
I see.

291
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,922
CHOI MI-HUN, 17, MALE, SUFFOCATION,
DIED IN THE AMBULANCE

292
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,109
It was a huge fire.

293
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,780
And what's worse was
that the sprinklers didn't work.

294
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,950
I think that's why they all asphyxiated.

Delivery.

297
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,761
Delivery.

298
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,516
Here's your food.

299
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,564
Gosh, you're so generous.

300
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,691
Thank you for the food.

301
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,005
-Where's In-beom?
-He had plans, so he went out.

302
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,889
Are you done already?

303
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,224
I don't have an appetite.

304
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,645
I'm going out.

305
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,027
She didn't finish her food.

306
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,988
She's seriously ill, isn't she?

307
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,716
How may I help you?
You can't go in there right now.

308
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,053
Are you sure no one
has entered the building?

309
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,515
Yes. Until they finish
the safety inspection,

310
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,350
even the residents can't enter.

311
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,815
-Hello.
-Hello.

312
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,654
Didn't you just say
that no one was allowed in?

313
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,738
Sorry?

314
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,699
SAFETY INSPECTION

315
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,701
They're here to do the safety inspection.

316
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,995
If they can't enter,
who will do the inspection?

317
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,039
You could die
if you go in there right now.

318
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,041
-What?
-Who is she?

319
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,502
Beats me. Who are you?

320
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,379
Where are you from?

321
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,091
You look completely normal,
but you must be insane.

322
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,343
Move aside before I call the police!

323
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,521
Is this the police?

324
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:50,903
Why did you do that?

325
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,868
She's crazy. She just threw my keys.

326
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,663
Ms. Hong, you must explain yourself.

327
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,461
Sir.

328
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,296
Take a look at this.

FATAL ACCIDENT AT SKY BUILDING

330
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,766
Once again, people have died.

DAEBAK REALTY

332
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,496
What? What do you want?

333
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,164
Why did you go there?

334
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,374
I was just passing by.

335
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,546
You were just passing by, but you caused
a scene and damaged their property?

336
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,715
Thank goodness
you didn't go there on purpose.

337
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,180
You couldn't just ignore it, could you?

338
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,976
I knew it.

339
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,564
The Ms. Hong I know pretends to be
coldhearted but is actually warmhearted.

340
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,826
Give me the paper
you've been jotting down on.

341
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,788
You knew?

342
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,748
How could I not when we live together?

343
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,048
A list of deaths
in the Sky Building incident.

344
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,218
To perform an exorcism,
we need the vengeful spirits' names.

345
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,804
That's where I began.

346
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,307
I figured identifying them
was the first step.

347
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,355
I've visited the police,
hospital, fire station,

348
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,065
and the bereaved families.

349
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,276
If an egg ghost is
made out of vengeful spirits

350
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,027
who died at once in the same place,

351
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,905
then those eight individuals
are the names.

352
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:05,997
Since there are eight of them,
maybe you should stab me eight times.

353
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,543
Or stab me once with eight needles?

354
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,923
Don't you think that might kill you?

355
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,176
Right.

356
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,511
Hold on.

357
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,513
We're a skillful exorcist

358
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,891
and a special psychic.
What's there to worry about?

359
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,476
All right. Let's think this through.

360
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,254
Have you gone crazy?
How dare you come here?

361
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,797
Please help me this once, sir.

362
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,385
I refuse to go down like this.

363
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,181
If you help me,
I will get back on my feet.

364
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,726
Think about the amount
of money I've given you!

365
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,895
You damn thug.

366
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,272
How dare you threaten me?

367
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,028
Do you still not get it?

368
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:21,781
You're done for.

369
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,830
You've ruined my appetite.

370
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,212
Damn it.

371
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,980
After leeching off me all this time,
how dare he call me a thug?

372
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,108
That damn scumbag.

373
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,752
How did it go?

374
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,051
The police have blocked
all your secret accounts.

375
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,096
God damn it.

376
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,976
How in the world did the police get

377
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,145
the secret ledger Ms. Choi had?

378
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,605
It was Hong.

379
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,483
It was Hong from Daebak Realty.

380
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,739
And she was the last person
to speak with Ms. Choi.

381
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,699
What?

382
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,244
Hong Ji-a, that wench.

383
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,665
Find out her whereabouts
and keep me posted.

384
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,011
What is this?

385
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,971
Your fake passport and a stowaway ticket

386
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,267
for the ship that leaves for Vladivostok
tomorrow evening.

387
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,103
This is as far

388
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,397
as I can help you, sir.

389
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,566
You scumbag.

390
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,195
Don't you know how much I've paid you?

391
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,238
That's why I'm helping you

392
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,074
this much.

393
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,331
All right, then.

394
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,166
Good luck.

395
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,006
Take this with you, you scumbag!

396
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,763
Hong Ji-a…

397
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,350
Hong Ji-a…

398
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,562
Sky Building passed the safety inspection?

399
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,523
How is that possible?

400
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,734
The building permit was
about to be revoked, so how?

401
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,239
It's not that easy to revoke it.

402
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,035
Not only did Do bribe his way
into getting the permit,

403
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,329
but there's also faulty construction.

404
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,417
Did the higher-ups pressure you?

405
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,377
Of course not.

406
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,045
Then how did it pass?

407
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,507
Sir.

408
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,468
We can't let people move
into that dangerous building.

409
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,221
The safety inspection was done
by a reliable company,

410
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,306
and they're not moving in right away.

411
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:39,353
Reinforce will be done thoroughly
before we let anyone move back in,

412
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,646
so don't worry.

413
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,073
DIED AT THE SCENE

414
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,534
LIST OF DEATHS IN THE SKY BUILDING FIRE
CHOI SEON-MI, GU JI-YEONG

415
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,084
If an egg ghost is
made out of vengeful spirits

416
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,044
who died at once in the same place,

417
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,881
then those eight individuals
are the names.

418
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,049
CHOI SEON-MI

419
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,807
DAEBAK REALTY

420
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,751
Yes?

421
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,131
Why are you out here?

422
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,101
No.

423
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,896
So many people will die
once people start moving back in.

424
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,315
But they're not moving back in right now.

425
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,110
It's just a matter of time.

426
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,363
As long as the egg ghost is in there,

427
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,907
a disaster is bound to happen.

428
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:58,742
It hasn't happened yet.

429
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,745
But you know that it will.

430
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,082
What then?

431
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,960
Will you kill Oh In-beom?

432
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,010
Hong Ji-a.

433
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,680
-Don't tell me…
-No one will die.

434
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,056
How?

435
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,851
Someone must die
to kill an evil spirit like an egg ghost.

436
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,312
What if we seal it instead of killing it?

437
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,646
What are you talking about?

438
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,524
In-beom identified
all of the victims who died.

439
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,277
Sealing them might work.

440
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,865
But you don't know that.

441
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,119
Don't worry.

442
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,373
I'm sealing the spirit, not killing it.

443
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,417
So no one will die.

444
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,214
And if anything goes wrong,

445
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,467
I'll get out of there.

446
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,682
Have I ever failed?

447
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,190
You know better than anyone
that I can't die

448
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,068
before I put my mother to rest.

449
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,246
Seal it?

450
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,875
It's a curse that locks up
a very strong evil spirit.

451
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,419
It's only temporary
since it's not an exorcism.

452
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,674
Let's think about
how we'll get rid of it completely later.

453
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,552
Then, no one
has to sacrifice their life, right?

454
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,514
The exorcist will suffer
some aftereffects.

455
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,349
That's why we don't usually do it.

456
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,186
Aftereffects?

457
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,563
Wouldn't that put you in danger?

458
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,192
It's better than people dying.

459
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,321
When will we do it?

460
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,156
Right away.

461
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:05,452
If we delay it even for a day,
there could be more victims.

462
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,044
DAEBAK REALTY

463
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,382
Seal the spirit? What do you mean?
And what's this earthen jar?

464
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,509
You guys don't have to
risk your lives, right?

465
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,388
Don't worry.

466
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,056
How could I not worry?

467
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,683
She's never done this before.

468
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,560
You're not sure if this will work.

469
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,603
I can hear you.

470
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,190
Be safe.

471
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,486
Okay.

472
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,281
I'll bring your boyfriend
back in one piece.

473
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,782
He's not my boyfriend.

474
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,995
Please bring him back in one piece.

475
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,417
Call me as soon as you're done.

476
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,919
If something goes wrong,
we'll come right away.

477
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,548
For what? There won't be
anything you can do to help.

478
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,469
Don't be rash.
The egg ghost might attack you.

479
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,513
Well, we can be like backup.

480
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,474
I'm just giving you moral support.

481
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,268
Okay, I understand. See you.

482
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:49,890
Mi-jin.

483
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,311
Please keep…

484
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,898
Ji-a safe.

485
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,372
If anything goes wrong, I'm going to stop.

486
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,666
Get out of the building right away.

487
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,919
Why are you being like this?
You're scaring me.

488
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,179
I expected it wouldn't be easy.

489
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,181
But

490
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,059
I believe in you.

491
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,436
I know you will make it work.

492
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,860
Thank you for not giving up.

493
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,615
We're partners. That's what partners do.

494
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,438
GU JI-YEONG, GU JI-UNG

495
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,111
GU JI-YEONG, GU JI-UNG

496
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:56,576
LEE JAE-PIL, CHOI AN-NA

497
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,003
JO YONG-JIN, HWANG HO-SEON

498
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,217
Run, In-beom!

499
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,995
This is good. It's always good!

500
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,038
Your food is the best.

501
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,290
Just the food?

502
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,754
No. Everything you do is perfect,
Ms. Hong Mi-jin.

503
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,467
Hey, Ji-a. Why are you standing there?

504
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,843
Come and eat breakfast.

505
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,437
Ji-a, come and have a seat.

506
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,396
Come on.

507
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,981
Mom.

508
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,026
Nice, fried eggs.

509
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,071
-Is it good?
-Yes.

510
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,630
Mom.

511
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,385
I had a dream.

512
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,763
What was it about?

513
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:44,684
I was an exorcist in the dream.

514
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,855
An exorcist? What is that?

515
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,110
Someone who helps vengeful spirits
leave from this world.

516
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,992
And you were a psychic.

517
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,577
A psychic?

518
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,538
What's that?

519
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,082
No idea,
but it sounds like a perfect job for you.

520
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,840
What an interesting dream.

521
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,134
It was sad.

522
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,017
You were a vengeful spirit in my dream.

523
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,316
You're still a little girl, aren't you?

524
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,027
It was just a dream.
Don't be sad. I'm right here.

525
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,993
I'm not sad anymore.

526
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,788
Hey, Ji-a.

527
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,915
What's that necklace?

528
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,876
I've never seen it before.

529
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,336
My necklace?

530
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,800
It'll bother you as you eat.
Why don't you take it off?

531
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,561
Take it off.

532
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,233
-Yes, Ji-a. Take it off.
-Yes.

533
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,651
Just take it off.

534
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,446
Take off that necklace now.

535
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,169
I'm bewitched, aren't I?

536
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:37,964
What?

537
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,801
This isn't real.

538
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,701
You're not my mom.

539
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,266
In-beom.

540
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,822
You cannot leave this room.

541
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,782
Never.

542
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,039
If I don't perform an exorcism on him,
more people will die.

543
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,749
To stop that disaster,

544
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,584
we must sacrifice the boy.

545
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,228
This was it.

546
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,025
This was how she felt back then.

547
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,785
She couldn't let this horrible disaster

548
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,621
go out into the world.

549
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,085
Because she was an exorcist.

550
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,928
A spiritual needle without the spirit's
name on it can cause physical damage.

551
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:33,556
Stabbing the possessed psychic's heart
is the only way to exorcize it.

552
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:38,561
Once the psychic dies,
the egg ghost also vanishes.

553
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,617
Ms. Hong.

554
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,508
No!

555
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,385
No…

556
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,341
We did it.

557
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,178
That's a relief.

558
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,156
Ms. Joo.

559
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,409
We're done with the exorcism.

560
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,413
We did it.

561
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,130
SECRETARY JOO HWA-JEONG

562
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,178
I warned you.

563
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,182
This is what you get

564
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,310
for making an enemy of me.
