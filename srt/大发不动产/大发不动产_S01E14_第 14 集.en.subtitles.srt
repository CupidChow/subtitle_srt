1
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,100
Take your necklace off.

2
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,994
In-beom!

3
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,037
In-beom!

4
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,419
Are you okay?

5
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,216
What happened?

6
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,098
Mom?

7
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,355
This is the same as what happened then.

8
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,375
I…

9
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,086
killed my son.

10
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,424
I'm the one who killed him.

11
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,514
It's not the vengeful spirit
that's refusing to leave.

12
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,268
She's keeping him from leaving.

13
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,782
Ma'am.

14
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,496
It's time to let him go.

15
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,670
It's my fault.

16
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,606
The sun has been up for ages.

17
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,066
How could you get up this late
and still want to eat?

18
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,403
Hey, I'm trying to eat.

19
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,989
How dare you glare at me?
You're guilty as charged.

20
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,199
It's not like I don't want to get a job.

21
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,410
I'm frustrated too.

22
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,871
You need to go make money!

23
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,999
You'll only realize how precious money is
once you start making it.

24
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,001
Money, money. Stop saying that!

25
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,172
Fine. I'll go out and make money.

26
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,924
Gosh. As if.

27
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,263
Yes, go make some money.

28
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,225
Don't even think of coming home
until you make some!

29
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,311
If I didn't drive him out like that…

30
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,520
What's with him?

31
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,276
Chang-hwa wouldn't have died.

32
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,739
That day,

33
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,453
I didn't even let him
eat his breakfast in peace.

34
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,163
I didn't know

35
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,043
that would be the last time to see him.

36
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,050
I killed my own son.

37
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,311
No.

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,734
Your son…

39
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,281
didn't die because of you.

40
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,825
You're wrong.

41
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,954
If I stopped him back then

42
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,709
and if he didn't leave home,

43
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,211
he wouldn't have died.

44
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,382
I killed him.

45
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,723
It was an accident…

46
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,601
that could've happened to anybody.

47
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,442
It wasn't your fault.

48
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,324
My son. My poor Chang-hwa…

49
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,457
My poor son.

50
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,888
Chang-hwa, my poor son.

51
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,573
Chang-hwa!

52
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,000
No, my son…

53
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,423
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

54
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,761
What happened?

55
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,473
Why did the exorcism not work?

56
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,558
Great job today. You may go.

57
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,852
DAEBAK REALTY

58
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,286
I killed my son.

59
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,915
Mom.

60
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,585
Mom.

61
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,422
Mom!

62
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,092
No, right?

63
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,223
It's not me
that's holding you back, is it?

64
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,518
Of course not, right?

65
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,938
I've tried so hard to put you to rest.

66
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,066
No, that can't be right.

67
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,569
Am I the one stopping you?

68
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,656
My obsession,

69
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,201
my regret,

70
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,120
and my guilt

71
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,625
have been holding you back, Mom?

72
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:25,963
No.

73
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,051
No!

74
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,057
I…

75
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,894
I killed you with my two hands,

76
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:45,775
and I'm also the one
who has been stopping you from leaving?

77
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,052
Hang in there, Mom.

78
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,640
I'll vanish.

79
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,354
Once I disappear,

80
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,525
everything will be over.

81
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,541
This is definitely a winning ticket.

82
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,254
But whom should I make a deal with
to make the best of it?

83
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,548
The chairman

84
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,801
will be done for if this gets revealed.

85
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,053
Should I demand to get my nightclub back?

86
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,140
No. He can always take it again.

87
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,435
Yes, I'll just ask him for cash.

88
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,104
It'll be my severance pay.
I'll ask for a huge amount.

89
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,773
A humongous amount of cash.

90
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,278
He never lets anyone live
who finds out about his weakness.

91
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,739
You of all people should know that.

92
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,491
He has a point.

93
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,537
All right. I'll just play it safe.

94
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:27,460
I'll go to our poor In-beom
and ask for just this much.

95
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,670
A teeny bit of money.

96
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,173
That's so little, though. Darn it.

97
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,675
Boss, must you choose only one?

98
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,135
What do you mean?

99
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:40,681
I mean, you could get a huge amount
as well as a teeny bit.

100
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,600
You son of a gun.

101
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,518
You're a genius.

102
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:23,933
Hello, Ms. Hong.

103
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,811
Hey.

104
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,814
Why are you up? You should sleep more.

105
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,650
What are you doing here?

106
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,320
Changhwa Restaurant closed,
so we had to move out.

107
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,863
So?

108
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,449
-Let us stay here until we find a place.
-No.

109
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,285
-What?
-You're out of business anyway.

110
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,080
Be nice and let us use
your spacious house.

111
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,541
We'll only stay here until you move out.

112
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,209
Two days.

113
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,337
Find a place within two days.

114
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,590
Come on. That's too short.

115
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,384
A realtor should know better.

116
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,304
How about ten days?

117
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,311
One week.

118
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,688
No more bargaining.

119
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,489
Did she just give her permission?

120
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,243
I thought she'd grab us by the collar
and kick us out.

121
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,670
Ms. Hong.

122
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,132
I have a question.

123
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,346
What is it?

124
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,973
Where's the hammer?

125
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,102
It's in the toolbox next to the fridge.

126
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,610
I want to cook some ramyeon
but can't find any pots.

127
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,403
Find one yourself.

128
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,743
We're out of coffee.

129
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,412
Do you have any in the house?

130
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,747
No.

131
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,919
I bought some snacks.
Do you want to eat with us?

132
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,589
Where are you going?

133
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,676
Let me come with you.

134
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,306
Don't follow me.

135
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,933
I want to take a walk alone.

136
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,060
I also want to take a walk.

137
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,104
You guys are distracting me too much.

138
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,024
-Give me some alone time.
-No.

139
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,071
How can I leave you alone
when you look so unstable?

140
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,547
My grandfather passed away

141
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,049
the year I was born.

142
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,885
The year after that,

143
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,805
my parents died in a car accident.

144
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,975
When I was seven, my uncle died.

145
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,271
My grandmother

146
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,398
blamed it all on me.

147
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,111
She said I brought

148
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,613
misfortune upon my family.

149
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,283
That's ludicrous.

150
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,494
You're right.

151
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,079
It was ludicrous.

152
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,540
When I was little,

153
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,543
I despised her for that.

154
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,129
But now I understand

155
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,799
why she was like that.

156
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,011
When we encounter

157
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,139
an unfathomably big tragedy,

158
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,810
we tend to look for someone
to resent and blame it on.

159
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,522
Because it's easier to blame someone

160
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,276
than to deal with the tragedy itself.

161
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:10,451
I hope you don't make the same mistake
my grandmother did.

162
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,914
Don't blame someone who's innocent.

163
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,710
Even more so if it's yourself.

164
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,841
It's not your fault.

165
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,759
So,

166
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,888
don't think about disappearing.

167
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,442
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

168
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,502
Is Chang-hwa eating well?

169
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,380
Yes.

170
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,806
Is he enjoying the kimchi stew?

171
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,810
It was his favorite.

172
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,688
He is.

173
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,696
Chang-hwa.

174
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:35,494
My harsh words
hurt you badly, didn't they?

175
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,666
I'm sorry. Okay?

176
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,296
This is the last meal…

177
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,723
I've cooked for you.

178
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,398
I hope you enjoy it…

179
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,320
and go to a better place.

180
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,793
Did the vengeful spirit
really eat the food?

181
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,171
No.

182
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,133
Then how did he leave?

183
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,219
No one was possessed.

184
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,472
What kept him from leaving this world was

185
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,641
her deep-seated grudge.

186
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,601
Her grudge?

187
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,521
The guilt she felt about her son's death,

188
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,023
regret, and obsession.

189
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,904
Cooking him a meal for the last time

190
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,156
helped her let go of her grudge.

191
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,204
I don't think
her feelings are the only thing

192
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,290
that kept his spirit here.

193
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,918
Perhaps,

194
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,921
they both couldn't let go.

195
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,758
Maybe they were not obsessed
but worried about each other.

196
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,013
Give yourself

197
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,933
some more time.

198
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,444
DAEBAK REALTY

199
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,908
KIM TAE-JIN'S MINION

200
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,202
Finally.

201
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,746
Hello?

202
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:08,957
Yes.

203
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,253
Yes. Okay.

204
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,198
DAEBAK REALTY

205
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,640
I think this is the place.

206
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,892
Where is he?

207
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,479
Did you bring the money?

208
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,356
Yes.

209
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,066
Where's Kim Tae-jin?

210
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,069
He's inside. Let me check the money first.

211
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,572
-I need to see if he's here first.
-I told you he's inside.

212
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,157
Okay.

213
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,266
No! My money!

214
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,101
No!

215
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,733
Ji-cheol!

216
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,775
Hey, In-beom.

217
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,652
-Did he take the money?
-Yes, he did.

218
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,249
Okay.

219
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,721
He just grabbed it and bolted,
so he barely checked the box.

220
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,473
Good work.

221
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,851
He didn't have to punch me. That bastard.
Gosh, it hurts.

222
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,227
I think my jaw is broken.

223
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,150
Hey, it's up.

224
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,737
Okay. Nice.

225
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,197
You're dead meat.

226
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,033
Hurry!

227
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,672
-Hey, how did it go? Yes?
-Tae-jin.

228
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,966
-Look at this.
-Yes!

229
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,302
We did it. We got it!

230
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,138
My gosh. Poor guy.

231
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,100
I didn't think
that big guy would fall for that.

232
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,559
I know, right?

233
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,814
-What is this?
-What?

234
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,734
-This is…
-You idiot!

235
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,779
How could you not check it thoroughly
before taking it?

236
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,614
-Darn it.
-I'm sorry.

237
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,991
Gosh. I can't believe this.

238
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,827
How could he fool us like this?

239
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,579
Seriously. I can't trust anyone.

240
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,541
Right. We were too greedy.

241
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,586
We still have the chairman.
Let's go to him.

242
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,296
-Okay.
-Darn it.

243
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,093
-Thank you.
-No problem.

244
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,803
When should I come back?

245
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,012
I'll call you.

246
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,389
Okay.

247
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,406
Yes.

248
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,962
Ms. Yeom told me

249
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,757
if I cut ties with people
whenever things go wrong,

250
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,593
I'd have no one left around me.

251
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,432
That I'd be
no different from a vengeful spirit.

252
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,018
She hasn't changed.

253
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,732
Well, she's one to talk. She's alone too.

254
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,485
Aunt.

255
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,659
When I came back to Daebak Realty
ten years ago

256
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,455
and called you
to say I was going to run it,

257
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,043
you came to help me without hesitation.

258
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,006
Ever since that day,

259
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,217
you've always been with me.

260
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,970
So I didn't have to
live alone like a vengeful spirit.

261
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,768
Thank you.

262
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,855
I have

263
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,901
never told you about my daughter, have I?

264
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,531
My daughter, Bom.

265
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,078
Giving birth to her wasn't my choice.

266
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,789
But she was my only family.

267
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,756
Bom. Hang in there.

268
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,469
Things were tough,
but I really wanted to raise her well.

269
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,012
I'm sorry.

270
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,983
Bom. Please?

271
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,443
Let's go to sleep. Please?

272
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,407
Sleep tight, Bom

273
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,627
Bom. I'll be back.

274
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,213
I'm sorry.

275
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,063
Bom. Mommy is back.

276
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,732
My gosh…

277
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,948
Bom. Oh, no. My baby. What's wrong? Bom.

278
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,118
I didn't even know why my baby died.

279
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,912
Did you plan it
before going into the motel?

280
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,290
But people thought I killed Bom.

281
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,541
Why did you kill her?

282
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,711
You didn't have to kill her.

283
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,339
Because it'd hold me back.

284
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,341
Isn't it obvious?

285
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:18,386
I didn't want to forgive myself
for failing to protect my daughter.

286
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,222
-You got through this.
-It must've been tough.

287
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,267
-I said not to hang out with them.
-It was tough, wasn't it?

288
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,561
GIMCHEON JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

289
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,314
The day I decided to follow my daughter,

290
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,733
your mother showed up.

291
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,572
Who are you?

292
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,201
I know that you didn't kill your daughter.

293
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,261
Your mother
didn't just put Bom's spirit to rest.

294
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,514
She also

295
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,808
saved my life.

296
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,435
Twenty years ago,

297
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:12,982
when your mother asked me
to look after you before she left,

298
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,902
I decided,

299
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,241
though I'd failed to protect my daughter,

300
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,328
to protect you with my life.

301
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,836
You did protect me.

302
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,591
I was able to keep doing this job
and not quit,

303
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,136
all thanks to you.

304
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:49,144
You sacrificed
a lot of your good years for me.

305
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,566
You can stop now.

306
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,237
Are you firing me?

307
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,532
How could I possibly fire you?

308
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:08,663
Where will I find a competent secretary
who would put up with my temper?

309
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,584
So you know you have a nasty temper?

310
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,774
It's me, sir.

311
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,026
Hey, where are you?

312
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,028
I'm on my way to see you, sir.

313
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,740
Sir, I'll think of this as severance pay.

314
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,911
So you want ten big ones?

315
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,663
Yes, sir. If you pay me this one time,

316
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,750
I'll keep my mouth shut for life.

317
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,713
All right. I have it ready.
Take your time.

318
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,798
Okay.

319
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,595
Get it ready.

320
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,055
Yes, sir.

321
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,143
"Severance pay"?

322
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,064
Severance pay sounds great.

323
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,132
What are you doing?

324
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,094
The chairman's expecting me.
I'm here for my severance pay.

325
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,349
Stop, you bastard!

326
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,894
Damn it.

327
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,771
-Seon-nyeo.
-Don't lose him!

328
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,689
Stop right there!

329
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,232
Seon-nyeo!

330
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,860
Hey! Stop!

331
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,198
Hey, man. Call the police! Damn it!

332
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,368
You bastard.

333
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,794
You bastard!

334
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,908
Don't let him get away. Get him!

335
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,492
Stop!

336
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,083
Man, he's stopped here.

337
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,419
Gosh.

338
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,590
What now? Do you think
he already gave it to Do Hak-seong?

339
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,676
Darn it.

340
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,887
-Stop!
-Stop right there!

341
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,806
-Get him!
-Don't let him get away!

342
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,850
Kim Tae-jin! Hop in. Now!

343
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,314
-Get him!
-Get that guy!

344
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,108
-Hey, get him!
-He's getting away!

345
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,865
Stop!

346
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,951
Stop right there!

347
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,676
You bastard!

348
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,261
Where's the memorandum?

349
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,227
Where is the memorandum?

350
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:01,980
They took it.

351
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,648
What?

352
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,358
Don't lie to me.

353
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,028
Darn it.

354
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,822
I'm not.

355
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:15,243
I put it in the inner pocket of my jacket.

356
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,412
How could you be so careless?

357
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,540
This is driving me insane too!

358
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,584
That could've been my jackpot. Damn it.

359
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,503
"Jackpot?"

360
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,964
"Jackpot?"

361
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,966
Do you know what that means to me?

362
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,176
It was the last piece of evidence.

363
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,345
-But you--
-Let go of me!

364
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,514
So what?

365
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,851
Am I the only bad guy here?

366
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,729
You, me, and Do Hak-seong,
we're all the same!

367
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,606
You two conned me too.

368
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,652
Do I take me for a joke?

369
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,989
Do I take me for a pushover?

370
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,389
God damn it!

371
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,773
DAEBAK REALTY

372
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,464
Why are they so quiet today?

373
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,385
They're making me more concerned
now that they're finally quiet.

374
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,477
What's going on, you two?

375
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,730
Hey.

376
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,566
Ms. Hong.

377
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,694
I was just sitting around quietly.

378
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,905
Exactly. Why are you two so quiet?

379
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,491
Where's In-beom?

380
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,035
Ms. Hong.

381
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,787
What do we do now?

382
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,083
The memorandum is gone for good.

383
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,364
What are you doing here, looking pathetic?

384
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,828
Nothing. I'm just sitting here.

385
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,705
Why aren't you doing anything?

386
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,126
You're giving up
just because that memorandum is gone?

387
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,508
The In-beom I know is

388
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,888
a guy who is persistent
to the extent of seeming reckless.

389
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,183
He wouldn't give up this easily.

390
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,104
Get up.

391
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,817
Before we see another one
become a vengeful spirit because of him,

392
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,904
someone has to stop Do Hak-seong.

393
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,227
Ms. Joo!

394
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,941
It became a mess while I was gone.

395
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,652
We're all here now, so let's get started.

396
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,700
This is the mid-investigation report
from a detective I've been working with.

397
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,955
We found Do Hak-seong's
paper company in Manila.

398
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,332
But it'll take us a while

399
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,210
to find out
where the money laundered there goes.

400
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,462
He bribes people with the laundered money,

401
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,257
and they hand him inside information
and watch his back,

402
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,549
then he bribes them again.

403
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,344
And the weak and the poor

404
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,388
are the ones suffering from it.

405
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,683
I wish they'd investigated the fire
properly 20 years ago.

406
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,018
Then Do wouldn't have come this far.

407
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,524
Can you find more information
on Do's secretary?

408
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,567
Nothing official,
but personal information.

409
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,444
Of course.

410
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,996
What?

411
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,164
Why is this open?

412
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,708
OUT OF BUSINESS

413
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,147
Oh, dear! What's that?

414
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,775
Ma'am, it's me.

415
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,865
I thought you were a thief.
What are you doing here?

416
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,450
I almost had a heart attack.

417
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,744
I had nowhere else to go.

418
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,540
I'm sorry.

419
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,834
I wasn't going to stay for long.

420
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,504
You left without a word

421
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,507
but crawled back
because you had nowhere to go?

422
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,265
Ma'am.

423
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,143
Are you out of business? Why?

424
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,104
I see. Is it because Chang-hwa came back?

425
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,357
Did he get you a lump sum?

426
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,484
Didn't he tell you about me?

427
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,736
I gave him your number
and told him to call you.

428
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,073
Are you the one

429
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,202
who gave that note to him?

430
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,244
I did well, didn't I?

431
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,956
How did he look?

432
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,626
What do you mean? He looked fine.

433
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,045
What did he say?

434
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,506
Did he miss his parents?

435
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,134
When you gave him the note,
did he say he'd come back?

436
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,677
Hold on.

437
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,805
Did he not come here?

438
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,392
He is

439
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,060
dead.

440
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,982
While working at a construction site,

441
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,026
he had an accident.

442
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,988
What are you talking about?

443
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,825
Nevertheless, thank you.

444
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,122
Thanks to you, we could give him

445
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,168
a proper burial on time.

446
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,630
Thank you.

447
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,592
I truly mean it.

448
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,221
I'm sorry.

449
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,433
I'm sorry.

450
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,814
This was his.

451
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,108
I don't know if it'll fit you.

452
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,944
Of course, it will.

453
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,321
I look good in anything.

454
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,700
Gosh.

455
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,869
Look.

456
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,166
What do you think?
It fits perfectly, right?

457
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,340
Thank you.

458
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:15,431
Why are you always
a mess on an empty stomach

459
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,474
whenever I see you?

460
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,392
I know, right?

461
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,230
Do your parents know about this?

462
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,858
I don't have any.

463
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,410
I know you're a good kid.

464
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,041
You should stop being a thug,

465
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,670
get a place to live even if it's small,
and settle down.

466
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,300
You don't need much in life.

467
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,053
You just need food in your stomach

468
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,973
and a place you can call home.

469
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,440
Kim Tae-jin, your life is…

470
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,569
so pathetic.

471
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,709
DAEBAK REALTY

472
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,711
Darn it.

473
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,589
In-beom!

474
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,217
Oh In-beom!

475
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,804
You fraud.

476
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:28,772
What are you doing?

477
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,700
Have you gone crazy?

478
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,661
It's in there.

479
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,791
Damn it. I could've gotten
a hefty sum out of it.

480
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,462
That's worth…

481
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,882
my life.

482
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,427
You have to get Do Hak-seong with it.

483
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,263
That's the only way I can survive.

484
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,808
Hey, you know what?

485
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,812
I want to live a normal life

486
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,317
like everyone else now.

487
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,072
So use that…

488
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,990
Use that

489
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,618
to get him!

490
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,706
Bye.

491
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,771
MEMORANDUM REGARDING APARTMENT

492
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:57,903
Goodness.

493
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,823
Now that we have the memorandum,
let's do this right.

494
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,326
We obtained a written document

495
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,912
that says Chairman Do Hak-seong
of Dohak Construction

496
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,790
was behind the Yongnam Village fire
in 2001 that took 7 lives,

497
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,500
and have begun the investigation.

498
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,795
And Oh said in his suicide not
that he'd set the fire while drunk.

499
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,089
But we obtained
his medical records that prove

500
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,842
he wasn't able to drink
due to his medical condition.

501
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,177
So we started to reinvestigate it.

502
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,721
How about the investigation
on Dohak's slush fund?

503
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,724
We have found
their paper company in Manila

504
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,017
and are looking into it.

505
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,227
About that…

506
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,063
The police have announced
that they have a warrant

507
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,399
regarding Dohak Construction's
paper company

508
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,277
and will be doing a search and seizure
of the headquarters.

509
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,738
It's been a while, Mr. Do.

510
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,324
CHAIRMAN DO HAK-SEONG

511
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,327
You told us
to look into this if we wanted to,

512
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,457
so we came back with a warrant.

513
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,878
Your cooperation is appreciated.

514
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,090
Detective Jung, let's begin.

515
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,312
Take all the documents you want.

516
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,522
You still won't be able to get me.

517
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,815
We'll see

518
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,317
about that.

519
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,782
Put it in the back.

520
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,207
A cop named Kang Han-seok came by.

521
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,751
What a passionate cop.

522
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,711
I'm just counting on you, sir.

523
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:42,633
Listen. You still need to come down to
the station for questioning at least once.

524
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:46,261
It's all over the news,
so I can't help you with that.

525
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,181
Sure. That's not a problem.

526
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,141
We should grab a meal sometime.

527
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,809
Goodbye, sir.

528
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,316
Have you called Assemblyman Han?

529
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,652
He's abroad and won't pick up.

530
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,488
These darn scumbags.

531
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,282
How dare they ignore me
after receiving my money?

532
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,160
Damn it.

533
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,829
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

534
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,920
Beer tastes sweet. Maybe it's
because we've finally gotten Do Hak-seong.

535
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,130
I'm going to get drunk tonight.

536
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,016
I called him.

537
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,186
I think he deserves to celebrate with us.

538
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,402
Stop standing there and come sit.

539
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,530
Okay. Thank you.

540
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,284
Hello.

541
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,037
Thanks.

542
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,958
You're so generous.

543
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,964
What? My baby must've seen the news.

544
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,009
I'm the one who caught him.
Don't you know how good I am?

545
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,431
You have a girlfriend? How?

546
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,146
What? What is this fancy smell?

547
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,859
This is good. It goes perfectly with beer.

548
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,945
Of course. It's my favorite snack
to have while drinking.

549
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,739
Pour it on the plate.

550
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,664
This isn't a snack. It's a dish.

551
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,089
Su-jeong wants me to tell you guys
that she misses you.

552
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,215
I miss her too.

553
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,134
Tell her to come see us on her day off.

554
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,803
She studies at her dorm on her days off.

555
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,684
Ms. Hong. It's been a while.
Why don't you make a toast?

556
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,311
This is a small get-together. Why…

557
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,856
Let's never become vengeful spirits.

558
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,941
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

559
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:06,902
What was that?

560
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,489
Just keep it in mind.

561
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,324
Please.

562
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,370
You little…

563
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,289
This is good.
I'm digging this snack. It's so good.

564
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,918
Do you really have a girlfriend?

565
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,462
I can't believe it.

566
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,923
She's so pretty.

567
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,217
-I don't believe it.
-She's so pretty.

568
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,897
Do Hak-seong will be punished
properly this time, right?

569
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,316
It won't be easy.

570
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,694
A lot of people are protecting him.

571
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,906
But since we started this,
we should see it through.

572
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:55,909
It's nice.

573
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:57,911
What's nice?

574
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,746
The weather is nice.

575
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,581
It's perfect for a walk.

576
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,223
I did instigate him to start a fire

577
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,058
two decades ago.

578
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:25,772
Back then, I was young and eager
and didn't know any better.

579
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,651
But I really don't know anything
about Oh Seong-sik's death.

580
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,280
Secretary Choi said she'd handle it,
so I entrusted her with it.

581
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,282
I had no idea that she'd killed him.

582
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,246
Then the paper company in Manila was

583
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,750
also set up by Secretary Choi
without you knowing?

584
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,585
That?

585
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,337
I'm also looking into it
with my legal team.

586
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,132
It looks like she embezzled the money.

587
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,427
Seriously. You can't trust anyone
in this world.

588
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,681
Ms. Choi Seon-mi.

589
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,897
Why are you going this far
to be loyal to Do Hak-seong?

590
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:12,778
Do you think you owe him for paying
your tuition and living expenses

591
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,821
when you were financially struggling?

592
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,285
He didn't help you
out of the goodness of his heart.

593
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,039
He needed someone to do his dirty work,

594
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,708
so he took advantage
of your financial struggles.

595
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,210
I don't care if he's using me.

596
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,465
Even my parents abandoned me.
He was the only one

597
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,218
who helped me.

598
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,512
Once you're no longer of use to him,

599
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,181
he will abandon you
the first chance he gets.

600
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,724
He will not.

601
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,479
Ms. Choi, you are smart and competent.

602
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,024
Do not waste your life

603
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,612
for a piece of trash like Do Hak-seong.

604
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,961
I'll wait for your call.

605
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,524
Hong Ji-a from Daebak Realty

606
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,317
met up with Secretary Choi?

607
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,404
I saw Hong giving
her business card to her.

608
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,407
She's not going to betray us, is she?

609
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,619
She wouldn't betray me.

610
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,830
But…

611
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,292
she does know too much.

612
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,210
Right.

613
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,254
Then,

614
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,964
what should we do?

615
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,384
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

616
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,807
Mr. Do pulled a lot of strings
to get you out.

617
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,808
Thank you.

618
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,311
Don't thank me. Your ride is here.

619
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:10,729
Well, then.

620
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,647
Rest up.

621
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,454
Sky Building in Haengun-dong, please.

622
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,876
VOICE RECORDING

623
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:37,130
But I really don't know anything
about Oh Seong-sik's death.

624
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,508
Secretary Choi said she'd handle it,
so I entrusted her with it.

625
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,719
I had no idea that she'd killed him.

626
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,056
Oh In-beom…

627
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,020
Did you hear that?

628
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,232
It wasn't easy to get my hands
on this recording file.

629
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,151
You just wasted your time.

630
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,778
This won't change anything.

631
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,572
In exchange for your testimony in court,

632
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:06,993
the police will not charge you
for the crimes you committed,

633
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,289
because Do Hak-seong is
the one who ordered you to do them.

634
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,752
But if you turn this down,

635
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,880
you'll take the fall
for what he's done too.

636
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:23,510
Are you really going to take the fall
for the murder charge as well?

637
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,470
I'm not taking the fall.

638
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,764
I killed him. I killed Oh Seong-sik.

639
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:31,977
No.

640
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,689
You didn't kill my uncle.

641
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,358
You weren't even there.

642
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,405
I'm going to make Do Hak-seong pay

643
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,908
for murdering my uncle.

644
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:03,883
Ms. Choi.

645
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,821
Yes, she just went in.

646
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,574
She heard the recording file.

647
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,368
And I told her everything. Let's wait.

648
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,371
It will be hard
to make a decision right away.

649
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,668
But I really don't know anything
about Oh Seong-sik's death.

650
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,796
Secretary Choi said she'd handle it,
so I entrusted her with it.

651
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,757
I had no idea that she'd killed him.

652
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,635
Are you really going to take the fall
for the murder charge as well?

653
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,391
DAEBAK REALTY, HONG JI-A

654
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,268
Once you're no longer of use to him,

655
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,604
he will abandon you
the first chance he gets.

656
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,606
Do not waste your life

657
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:04,027
for a piece of trash like Do Hak-seong.

658
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,539
Ms. Hong?

659
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,503
I'll testify.

660
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,147
That guy is…

661
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,068
Stop right there!

662
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,712
Breaking news. At 10:30 p.m.,

663
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,881
at Sky Building in Haengun-dong, Seoul,

664
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,717
a fire incident suspected
to be a gas explosion took place.

665
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,093
People are being rescued,

666
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,512
-Oh In-beom.
-but the casualties continue to go up.

667
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,809
Ms. Hong. Sky Building…

668
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,977
Call In-beom.

669
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,145
Okay.

670
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,849
In-beom!

671
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,264
In-beom.

672
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:26,205
There are a number of people
who saw a ghost at Sky Building.

673
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,541
The faceless man will kill us all!

674
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,917
This is the CCTV footage from the police.

675
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,669
He'll be wanted as a key suspect.

676
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,963
We have to spot him before the police.

677
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,090
Push ahead with the safety test
of Sky Building.

678
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,468
How dare he treat me
like a toothless tiger?

679
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,638
As long as the egg ghost is there,
we're bound to see a disaster.

680
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,181
Are you saying In-beom will end up dead?

681
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,350
We aren't vanishing him,
so this might work.

682
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,434
Ji-a, are you trying to…

683
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,686
Let's not do this exorcism ritual.

684
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,813
I can do this.
I'm different from you, Mom.

685
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,024
I took care of everything.

686
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,525
No.
