DAEBAK REALTY

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:47,130
Staying in this world
as a spirit without a body is equivalent

3
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,425
to standing outside only in underwear

4
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,344
when there's a snowstorm
in the middle of winter.

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,140
Help me.

6
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,565
No matter what you hear,
do not come downstairs. Understood?

7
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,526
Hwa-jeong, listen carefully.

8
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,613
A child possessed by an egg ghost is here.

9
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,573
But egg ghosts can't be exorcised.

10
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,286
Killing the person that's been possessed
is the only way to dissipate the spirit.

11
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,581
In-beom, let's go.

12
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,509
I heard what you said on the phone.

13
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,593
Move.

14
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,348
If I don't perform an exorcism on him,
more people will die.

15
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,433
To stop that disaster,

16
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,435
we must sacrifice the boy.

17
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,937
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,732
A disaster or not,
I'll never let you kill In-beom!

19
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,364
You will never understand.

20
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,267
No.

21
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,381
Don't kill me…

22
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm sorry…

23
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,554
Die! Just die!

24
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,895
Uncle.

25
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,443
Please don't kill me…

26
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,363
Please don't kill me…

27
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,243
Mom!

28
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,511
Mom?

29
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,977
The needle.

30
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,273
I told you, you have to stab it
in the heart in one go.

31
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,484
Stab it

32
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,819
in the heart in one go.

33
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,444
Mom.

34
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,615
Mi-jin.

35
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,201
Mom…

36
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,049
Mom…

37
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,775
Mom…

38
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,945
RECORD OF EXORCISM: 1979

39
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,750
I…

40
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,128
killed my mom.

41
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,802
Ms. Hong.

42
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,428
No.

43
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,723
Ms. Hong! Wake up.

44
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,724
Hong Ji-a!

45
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,464
Visiting hours are over. We need to go.

46
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,508
No.

47
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,844
I need to keep her warm.

48
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,055
You've done enough.

49
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,209
What do you think

50
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,837
she was trying to do?

51
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,174
I think she was possessed
by her mom several times.

52
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,595
Isn't it dangerous
for the exorcist to be possessed?

53
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,014
Not once

54
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,849
but many times at that.

55
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,392
An exorcist falls into a trance

56
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,561
when they're possessed
by a vengeful spirit.

57
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,063
In Ji-a's case, she sees

58
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,024
the day her mom died.

59
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,066
But

60
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,653
when she was possessed
by the water ghost last time,

61
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,117
she told me that she remembered
a part of her memories she'd forgotten.

62
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,744
Then was she

63
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,790
trying to retrieve
her lost memories from 20 years ago?

64
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,419
I think

65
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,297
she wanted to find out the truth

66
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,133
even if she might die trying.

67
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,962
Have you still not located Tae-jin?

68
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,923
I'm sorry, sir.
We're still looking for him.

69
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,260
He was going to bring me the memorandum.

70
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,554
How could you still not have found him?

71
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,933
He was recently spotted
at an employment agency,

72
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,643
so I've sent some men over.

73
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,855
That sly fox.

74
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:31,112
They could've ordered
some sweet and sour pork as well.

75
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,280
Your ID.

76
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,242
What?

77
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,410
ANT EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

78
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,369
Yang Chang-hwa?

79
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,342
Hey, are you Chang-hwa?

80
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,304
-The son of Changhwa Restaurant?
-Yes.

81
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,434
It's nice to finally meet you.
What a small world.

82
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:03,853
Who are you?

83
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,063
You don't need to know that.

84
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,568
Right. You little brat.

85
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,322
Your mom is desperately
waiting for you, so hurry over.

86
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,241
If I could have my way,
I'd drag you there.

87
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,036
But I can't do that.

88
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,664
Better yet, give me your phone.
Let's call her now.

89
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,500
Do you not have one?

90
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,671
Do you even remember her number?

91
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,596
Hey, give me a piece of paper and a pen.

92
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,765
Here.

93
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,855
Doing this won't wash away all my sins.

94
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,568
Take it.

95
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,865
Why you little…

96
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,911
You'll never get away
with breaking your parents' hearts.

97
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,329
I'm speaking from experience.

98
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,084
You better call her, okay?

99
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,675
What?

100
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,387
-Hey.
-Yes?

101
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,972
Kim Tae-jin is here, isn't he?

102
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,892
No, sir.
We haven't been in touch recently.

103
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,907
Hey! Kim Tae-jin! Stop right there!

104
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,659
Do you think I'll just stop?

105
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,829
Hey, the jjajangmyeon
is going to get soggy. Eat up.

106
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,955
Hey.

107
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,541
-Hey!
-You bastard!

108
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,168
-You sly, little fox!
-Stop right there!

109
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,753
-Hey!
-Stop!

110
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,089
Run as far away as you can, you bastard!

115
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,758
Are you still cold?

In-beom.

117
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,147
Get out.

118
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,291
Did you get possessed
by your mother on purpose?

119
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,835
Why did you do such a dangerous thing?

120
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,754
It could've been bad.

121
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,466
I saw everything.

122
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,805
I don't know what you saw,

123
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,517
but you were in a trance.
It's not accurate.

124
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,851
I remember everything.

125
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,651
I remember everything I saw and heard

126
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,071
that day.

127
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,240
Mi-jin.

128
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,201
Mom…

129
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,204
You saw it too.

130
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,206
How…

131
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,586
How I stabbed my own mother to death.

132
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,588
You were

133
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,466
only exorcising the spirit.

134
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,218
Shut your mouth!

135
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,348
How could you be so arrogant?

136
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,560
Do you think you're some kind of god?

137
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,187
For 20 years,

138
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:20,109
I have controlled me as you wanted.
Has it been fun for you?

139
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,571
I--

140
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,156
Don't you dare say you did it for my sake.

141
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,161
I don't even want to hear your voice
or see that face of yours.

142
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,580
It's horrifying.

143
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,875
Get out.

144
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:39,920
Get out!

145
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,318
What happened?

146
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,785
Ms. Joo. You didn't eat yet, right? Let's…

147
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,624
Something feels off here.

148
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,210
Did something happen?

149
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,506
Try some.

150
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,176
The restaurant lady packed this for you.

151
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,678
Something is definitely off.

152
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,096
What do you mean?

153
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,475
It's odd she fought with Ms. Joo
as soon as she woke up.

154
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,643
They had a fight?

155
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,896
I thought they'd never fight.
I wonder what happened.

156
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,483
The way Ms. Hong looked at me was odd too.

157
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,903
When people are sick,
they get sensitive and easily irritated.

158
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,904
Give her some time.

CASE REPORT

171
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,823
THE DECEASED HONG MI-JIN WAS STABBED
WITH A SHARP HAIRPIN…

172
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,160
By the time I arrived at the scene
after getting a phone call,

173
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,121
your mother had already passed away.

174
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,375
And you, Oh In-beom,
and Oh Seong-sik were unconscious.

175
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,877
The cause of death was

176
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,839
excessive bleeding after getting stabbed
with a sharp hairpin.

177
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,010
And the fingerprints found on the hairpin
belonged to you and your mother.

178
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,971
The analysis of the angle
and depth of the wound showed

179
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,890
the person who'd stabbed her

180
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,643
was you, Ji-a.

181
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,937
That was the conclusion I reached.

00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,811
She was stabbed to death
by her own daughter.

185
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,023
Of course, she couldn't rest in peace.

186
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,447
Then what should I do, Mom?

187
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,914
For this to end,
I have to disappear, right?

188
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,711
Right?

189
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,772
I think she wanted to find out the truth

190
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,275
even if she might die trying.

191
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,735
I…

192
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,197
killed my mom.

193
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,242
Ms. Hong.

194
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,494
Sorry. It's me.

195
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,706
You haven't found her yet?

196
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,126
I searched everywhere,
but I didn't see her.

197
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,087
You should stay here
and call me if Ms. Hong comes back.

198
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,339
Okay.

199
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,593
Where are you going?

200
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,386
You know, don't you?

201
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,599
The truth about that day

202
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,268
that Ms. Hong found out.

203
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,440
By any chance,
did I kill her mother 20 years ago

204
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,485
when I was possessed?

205
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,779
Did I?

206
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,406
It's the opposite.

207
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,620
Ji-a's mother tried to kill you.

208
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,266
Then this necklace is

209
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,436
probably not from Ms. Hong's mother.

210
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,940
She wouldn't have given it
to the kid she tried to kill.

211
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,701
In-beom…

212
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,832
It's all my fault.

213
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,422
You can't die, In-beom.

214
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,174
Mr. Oh.

215
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,184
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

216
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,480
He said he would give me
an apartment unit in return.

217
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,444
I must have gone mad. I'm so sorry.

218
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,447
So it is you that created the egg ghost.

219
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,076
The spirits of the seven people who died
in a fire you set became an egg ghost.

220
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,078
And Mi-jin died trying to exorcise it.

221
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,622
Eight people died
all because of your greed.

222
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,708
I'm sorry.

223
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,836
I shouldn't have done it. I'm so sorry.

224
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,714
If you're truly sorry, turn yourself in.

225
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,925
Turn yourself in
and pay for what you've done.

226
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,761
Yes. I'll do that.

227
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,806
I was going to turn myself in.
I'm telling the truth.

228
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,270
And this.
Put this necklace on your nephew.

229
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,402
As long as he's wearing it,
it'll never happen.

230
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,823
Make sure he never takes it off,
no matter what.

231
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,576
Okay. Thank you.

232
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,911
Thank you so much.

233
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,803
I hated your uncle for what he'd done.

234
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,347
But you were innocent in this.

235
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:15,060
I did the best I could in that situation.

236
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,271
For you…

237
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,275
and for Ji-a.

238
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,323
The best you could…

239
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:34,121
Are you telling me that trying to deceive
Ms. Hong and hide the truth forever

240
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,455
was the best you could?

241
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,790
Don't put it that way.

242
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,376
Ji-a even distorted and erased

243
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,087
her own memories of that day to survive.

244
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,799
Do you really think I should've told her
because it was the truth?

245
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,348
I once asked Ms. Hong

246
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,310
about you, Ms. Joo.

247
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,854
Ms. Joo is

248
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,982
the only person I trust in this world.

249
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,984
You betrayed

250
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,319
her only trust.

251
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,994
Thank you very much

252
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,205
for this necklace.

253
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:22,210
Thanks to it, I've been able to stay safe.

254
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,992
BLUE SALT

255
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,084
No touching.

256
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,253
Why not?

257
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,880
I just have to put this here, right?

258
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,298
No, that's not right.

259
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:06,022
I heard your new psychic
has amazing spiritual energy.

260
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,440
He quit.

261
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,527
What a shame.

262
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,029
Ms. Joo said he was good-looking too.

263
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,366
No? Was she exaggerating?

264
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,784
No, she wasn't.

265
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,411
Nice.

266
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,331
By the way, is it okay to be away
from your office for so long?

267
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,041
I'm quitting my job as an exorcist.

268
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,377
Is that so?

269
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,629
I sold the realty office too.

270
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,219
You must mean it this time.

271
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,471
How will you make a living then?

272
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,182
I'm going to travel.

273
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,601
Travel, my foot. You're a homebody.

274
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,811
You hate traveling.

275
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,647
I can't stay home forever.

276
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,485
I don't think you'll be able to quit.

277
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,030
I can.

278
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,033
Do you really think
you've been doing this job

279
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,328
because you haven't been able
to put your mother to rest?

280
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,582
You say you're sick of them
and never want to see them again,

281
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,542
but I doubt you can turn a blind eye

282
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,503
to vengeful spirits shivering in the cold
and living in pain.

283
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,005
That was my mom.

284
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,506
And you're just like her.

285
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,397
Don't be so hard on yourself.

286
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,941
She was bound to find out someday.

287
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:33,985
If possible,

288
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,739
I never wanted her to find out.

289
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,578
Ji-a is a grown-up.

290
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,247
She can deal with this on her own.

291
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:56,424
Detective Kang's been helping me
with re-investigating Do Hak-seong.

292
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,177
When you brokered the sale of Green Villa,

293
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,889
someone uploaded the call recording
between Hwang and Do online.

294
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,974
It was you, wasn't it?

295
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,727
Could I listen to the original file?

296
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,189
How can I trust this man?

297
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,316
Someone told me

298
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,111
there's more than meets the eye.

299
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,822
That everything has

300
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,032
its hidden side.

301
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,053
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

302
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,190
You'll find Ji-a there.

303
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,197
BLUE SALT

304
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,521
Are you the psychic at Daebak Realty?

305
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,190
How did you know?

306
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,692
I made that.

307
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,492
Where is Ms. Hong?

308
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,287
I think she just went
into the bamboo forest.

309
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,581
Wait inside.
She'll return before the sun sets.

310
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,082
I'll go catch her.

311
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,131
He's as good-looking as she said.

312
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,736
-I need to talk to you.
-I have nothing to say.

313
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,823
But I do, so please listen.

314
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,618
I heard everything from Ms. Joo.

315
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,584
It wasn't your fault.

316
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,087
As you said,

317
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,675
if my uncle and I hadn't come that day,
your mother wouldn't have passed away.

318
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,514
So let's not be sorry.

319
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,183
I'm not going to be sorry

320
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,769
for what happened with my uncle anymore,

321
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,273
so don't be sorry
for what happened with your mother.

322
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,525
After all,

323
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,569
I'm still alive.

324
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,240
But my mother is dead.

325
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,039
I…

326
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,919
I killed my mom with my own hands.

327
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,338
And that's how you're still alive.

328
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,383
Whenever I see you,

329
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,055
I'm vividly reminded
of the fact that I killed my mother.

330
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,101
So I can't see you anymore.

331
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,363
I'm going home.

332
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,783
I know you're not asleep.

333
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,037
I don't expect you to show your face,
but you should at least say bye.

334
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,165
Darn it.

335
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,099
Do you want to know
how to avoid becoming a vengeful spirit?

336
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,850
Sorry?

337
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,521
When you're thankful,
express your gratitude.

338
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,940
When you've done wrong, apologize.

339
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,985
And show affection to those you love.

340
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,571
Who knows when we'll die?

341
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,157
We shouldn't hesitate or be afraid.

342
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,327
What if you die in a car accident today?
Won't you feel bitter?

343
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,997
Say what you want to or must

344
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,499
if you don't want to turn
into a vengeful spirit.

345
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,795
Wait. Or will that prevent
the other person from becoming one?

346
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,797
I don't know.

347
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,384
BLUE SALT

348
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,033
It's me.

349
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,245
I came

350
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,582
to tell you something for the last time.

351
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,168
You were the one

352
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,421
who saved me 20 years ago.

353
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,632
Thank you.

354
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,018
Also, you were the first person
to tell me that I was special

355
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:26,314
and that I was a good person.

356
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,734
Thank you for that as well.

357
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,491
Eat your favorite dishes,

358
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,159
watch your favorite shows,

359
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,286
and buy whatever you like.

360
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,623
Try to take your mind off it.

361
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
Going for a walk?

362
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,162
Let me join you.

363
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,086
Oh, right.

364
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,256
Did you talk with that handsome psychic

365
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,966
last night?

366
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,512
Gosh, you refused to see him, didn't you?

367
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,931
I told you I was quitting my job.

368
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,559
What's there to talk about with a psychic?

369
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,855
Don't push away someone who likes you.

370
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,649
It's not like that.

371
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,861
What do you mean?
I didn't mean anything romantic.

372
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,572
This is just a piece of life advice.

373
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,367
If you keep pushing people away,
you'll eventually be all alone.

374
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,787
I don't care.

375
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,918
So will you cut ties with Ms. Joo as well?

376
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,881
If you live without anyone around you,

377
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,466
how are you any different
from a vengeful spirit?

378
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,020
I see.

379
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,481
So this is the list from the employment
agency that Tae-jin gave you?

380
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,486
He said he'd let me know
if Chang-hwa ever came back.

381
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,281
One minute.

382
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,751
ANT EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

383
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,756
I found it.

384
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,389
ANT EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

385
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,516
I'm looking for this man.

386
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,435
His name is Kim Tae-jin.

387
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,729
I don't know him.

388
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,814
Is that so?

389
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,817
All right.

390
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,824
"I don't know him."

391
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,576
I know you know him.

392
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,923
ANT EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

393
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,883
What? That's Tae-jin's minion.

394
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,386
I got you.

395
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,934
Someone came here looking for Tae-jin.

396
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,979
-Who was it?
-Beats me.

397
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,231
But I don't think Do Hak-seong sent him.

398
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,276
ANT EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

399
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,007
Why are you tailing me?

400
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,676
-To meet Tae-jin.
-What for?

401
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,845
I want to buy the memorandum.

402
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,013
What?

403
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,556
Tell him, and he'll know.

404
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,727
Tell him I want to buy the memorandum
for 135,720,000 won.

405
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,645
-That much?
-Yes.

406
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,149
Your number.

407
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,067
Sorry?

408
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,195
I'll call you after telling him,
so give me your number.

409
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,363
Yes, sir.

410
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,073
BANKBOOK

411
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,036
It may not have been a townhouse,

412
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,622
but I wanted to get her an apartment.

413
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,834
Fine.

414
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,295
I can always make more money.

415
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,505
I should do it for In-beom.

416
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,300
Mom.

417
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,010
I'm sorry.

418
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,223
In-beom.

419
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,987
What about Ms. Hong?

420
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,697
Did she not come with you?

421
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,748
I understand.

422
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,000
Every time she sees me,

423
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,130
she'll be reminded of the painful past
that she desperately wanted to forget.

424
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,052
The only thing I can do for her

425
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,390
is to get out of her sight.

426
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,684
What should we do?

427
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,984
I resent my uncle.

428
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:09,156
He shouldn't have set the houses on fire.
He shouldn't have taken those lives.

429
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,491
Don't do that.

430
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,036
Do Hak-seong is to blame here.

431
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,623
If it wasn't for him, do you think
your uncle would've done such a thing?

432
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,923
In-beom, let's get that memorandum back

433
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,509
and punish that son of a gun.

434
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,178
I think I will soon.

435
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,225
Did Kim Tae-jin call you?

436
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,352
No, but…

437
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,147
I'll tell you once I'm sure.

438
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,567
You trust me, right?

-Hey, go over there.
-Yes, sir.

442
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,083
-You, over there.

451
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,673
just sell this place and leave.

452
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,428
Just give up.

453
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,388
He would've come already if he wanted to.

454
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,683
It's not that he can't.
He doesn't want to come back.

455
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,018
If you want to leave,

456
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,895
go without me.

457
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,940
I'll keep waiting for our son here.

458
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,362
Even if I turn into a ghost,

459
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,323
I'll wait right here until he returns!

463
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,150
They even cut off the electricity?

464
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,790

465
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,961
Are you…

00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,255
Chang-hwa?

467
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,551
You're Chang-hwa, right?

468
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,348
You brat.

469
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,935
Where have you been all this time?
What took you so long?

470
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,021
I have never been able

471
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,356
to sleep soundly because of you, brat.

472
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,193
What…

473
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,530
What happened to your leg?

474
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,200
I heard you work at a construction site.

475
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,328
Did you hurt it there?

476
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,544
And why do you look so messy?

477
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,716
Did you eat?

478
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,804
Why not?

479
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,265
You can't even feed yourself?

480
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,477
Wait here.

481
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,856
I have kimchi stew, your favorite.

Yes, this is Changhwa Restaurant.

00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,748
Are you Yang Chang-hwa's family?

485
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,874
Yes.

486
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,049
What do you mean, Chang-hwa is dead?

487
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,148
Are you sure it's Chang-hwa?

488
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,693
Yes. This was found in his pocket,

489
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,279
so we called the number. Take a look.

490
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,173

00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:22,386

I told you. I'm going to travel now.

498
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,293
Sure. Enjoy your trip then.

499
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,462

Gosh. Whenever you were at my restaurant,

508
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,771
you always reminded me of my son.

509
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,523
Goodness.

510
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,362
Gosh. Hang in there.

511
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,077
Ms. Hong.

512
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,998
When did you get…

513
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,006
Where are you going?

514
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,010
Stay here a bit longer. Ms. Hong
will be uncomfortable if I'm here.

515
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,723
Gosh.

516
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,109
I'm sorry.

517
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,653
I truly thought

518
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,823
what I did was best for you.

519
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,327
But I was arrogant.

520
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,079
Don't bother.

521
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,999
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

522
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,209
But if you are

523
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,129
blaming yourself for this,

524
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,425
I don't want you to do that.

525
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,179
That's what I wanted to tell you.

526
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,476
I'll leave now.

Listen.

546
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,802
I…

547
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,643
I don't know if I've gone insane.

548
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,645
But I…

549
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,274
I keep seeing my dead son.

550
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:03,573
I must be seeing things, right?

551
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,787
He didn't become a ghost, did he?

552
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,170
That darned rascal.

553
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,715
Why didn't he come sooner?

554
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,595
He couldn't even die in peace.

555
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,683
I feel so bad for him.

556
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:36,898
My poor son.

557
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,072
Ms. Hong.

558
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,866
Could you help my son leave in peace?

559
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,120
Please, I ask of you.

560
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,331
Please do that for my poor Chang-hwa.

561
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,636
YANG CHANG-HWA

562
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:03,651
She'll suffer longer if I waste time
looking for another psychic,

563
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,487
so I called you to do this quickly.

564
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,365
Thanks for calling me.

565
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,722
Let's go.

566
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,307
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

567
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,521
Did you know him well?

568
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,356
Yes.

569
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,621
We'll begin.

570
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,207
Until it's all over,

571
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,584
keep your eyes closed.

572
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,213
If we do this,

573
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,217
Chang-hwa will leave
this world for good, right?

574
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,679
Yes.

575
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,216
Take your necklace off.

576
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,282
In-beom!

577
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,034
In-beom!

578
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,832
Are you okay?

579
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,504
What happened?

580
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,637
Mom.

581
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,144
This is the same as what happened then.

582
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,542
I…

583
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,212
killed my son.

584
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,801
I'm the one who killed him.

585
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,432
It's not the vengeful spirit
that's refusing to leave.

586
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,978
She's keeping him from leaving.

587
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:20,283
My obsession is the reason
my mom can't leave.

588
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,451
No!

589
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,453
You look so unstable.
How can I leave you alone?

590
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,164
Have I ever told you about my daughter?

591
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:29,083
Before we see another one
become a vengeful spirit because of him,

592
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,461
someone has to stop Do Hak-seong.

593
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,838
The chairman will die of shock
once he sees this.

594
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,173
I'm on my way to see the chairman.

595
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,132
Where's the memorandum?

596
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,342
Do you know what it means to me?

597
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:40,303
The In-beom I know
wouldn't give up this easily.

598
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,804
Everything is ready, so take your time.

599
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,723
Chairman Do Hak-seong has been…

600
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,350
There's a possibility of murder.

601
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,267
In-beom.
