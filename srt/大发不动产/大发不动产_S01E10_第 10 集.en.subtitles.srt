1
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,024
Ms. Hong.

2
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,976
What are you two doing here?

3
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,979
I can explain. What happened is…

4
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,671
Gosh, my back hurts.

5
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,465
So why did you follow me?

6
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,136
Are you saying it was my fault?

7
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,099
You were going out at night, looking like
you'd kill the murderer. How could I not?

8
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,642
That thought did cross my mind.

9
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,561
See?

10
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,107
But my self-control is not that weak.

11
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,234
"Self-control"?

12
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:36,030
You threw me as soon as you grabbed me.
You lost your self-control.

13
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,323
My gosh.

14
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,369
Even when you're possessed by a vengeful
spirit, your violent tendency remains.

15
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,080
You could've woken me up
before I threw you down.

16
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,874
You were watching from the start.

17
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,210
That's because…

18
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,926
Gosh, forget it.

19
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,014
It's your fault you went out carelessly
as soon as the exorcism was over.

20
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,392
I let my guard down since I hadn't
absorbed their memories in a while.

21
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,771
You nagged me so many times
to be cooped up at home.

22
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,023
That's enough.

23
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,400
If it weren't for me,
he would've called the police.

24
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,526
Hey!

25
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,283
Just eat.

26
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,457
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

27
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,505
Ms. Hong!

28
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,553
DAEBAK REALTY

29
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,975
I forgot to give this back to you.

30
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,401
I've had the same necklace
since when I was a kid.

31
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,949
And I've always thought
I got it from my uncle.

32
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:05,995
But come to think about it, it must've
been your mother that gave it to me.

33
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:12,710
I don't know yet
what happened 20 years ago.

34
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,297
But I could live
an ordinary life to this day,

35
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,008
all thanks to the necklace.

36
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,928
It's belated, but I wanted to say

37
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,264
thank you.

38
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:31,688
To tell the truth, I also don't know
exactly what happened 20 years ago.

39
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,067
My memories aren't complete,
just like yours.

40
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,195
That's why I looked for you.

41
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,533
I thought I might be able to find a way
to put my mom to rest

42
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,161
if I could find you
and learn what happened that day.

43
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,626
We were both after the same thing.

44
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,963
I got too worked up

45
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,425
and said things
I shouldn't have said to you.

46
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,303
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,014
It's all right.

48
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,019
This is yours.

49
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,902
Live an ordinary life like you used to.

50
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,173
You surprised me.

51
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,966
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,552
Why are you out here?

53
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,346
I got scared.

54
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,563
Let's go.

55
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,607
Ji-a.

56
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,151
"Ji-a"?

57
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,923
Thank you.

58
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,802
Let me stay the night here.
I'll go to my friend's place tomorrow.

59
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,063
Ms. Hong, I'll get going.

60
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,565
Make yourself at home.

61
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,275
Thank you.

62
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,207
-Is Su-jeong all right?
-She's doing better.

63
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,960
She'll stay here tonight
and go to a friend's tomorrow.

64
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,169
What?

65
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,131
Can you please take her to your place?

66
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,549
-No, I can't.
-Why not?

67
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,926
I have a little something
called a private life.

68
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,052
What about me?

69
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,138
She asked you, not me.

70
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,059
She'd feel better to be with someone
who's closer to her age.

71
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,727
It's not like that makes us close.

72
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,982
Oh, right. Chief Heo,
you can take her, then.

73
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,317
Of course, I'd love to.

74
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,735
-But--
-Didn't you see her?

75
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,736
My gosh.

76
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,156
After what she just went through,

77
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,617
wouldn't it be tough for her
to be with a guy even if it's him?

78
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,498
It's just for the night. Comfort her.

79
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,084
Comfort her? You think I can?

80
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,503
How about you have a drink with her?

81
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,549
Drink in broad daylight?

82
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,385
Do you drink?

83
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,429
Sorry?

84
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,562
I'll find a replacement tenant soon,
so move as quickly as possible.

85
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,317
Do you think
it'll all be over once I move?

86
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,279
To be honest,

87
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,409
I doubt he'll give up so easily
since he even killed someone.

88
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,661
No.

89
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,872
I meant the spirit.

90
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:23,169
I don't think that spirit will let me go.

91
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,925
What do you mean?

92
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,384
To tell the truth,

93
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,596
I saw it that day.

94
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,975
I saw her face at the very last moment.

95
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,228
Her eyes

96
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,231
were crying out to me for help.

97
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,651
They were saying, "Help! Please help me."

98
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,239
But I was too scared.

99
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,201
I was so scared and decided to ignore it.

100
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,913
I told myself I was mistaken.

101
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,499
And that they must've known each other,

102
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,793
and nothing bad would happen.

103
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,381
She's here! She came back.

104
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,925
I put that vengeful spirit
to rest yesterday.

105
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,677
No, she's still here.

106
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,930
She has been following
and haunting me since that day.

107
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,557
She died because of me!

108
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,684
She'll follow me around
until the day I die.

109
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,564
Get a grip.

110
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,149
Why would she haunt you
when she died trying to save you?

111
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,734
What?

112
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,404
On that day, Lee Hyeon-ju
got back on the elevator

113
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,656
because she couldn't
leave you alone with him.

114
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,784
Because he wouldn't harm you easily
if she was with you.

115
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,288
And she appeared before you
as a vengeful spirit

116
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,000
because she knew Ma Gwang-tae
would come back for you.

117
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,711
I didn't know.

118
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,588
I really didn't know.

119
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,349
Name's Lee Hyeon-ju.

120
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,064
The person who saved you

121
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,776
wasn't just a random woman
killed in the parking lot

122
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,821
or the seventh-floor neighbor.
Her name was Lee Hyeon-ju.

123
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,244
You of all people must remember her.

124
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,041
She was an actress for 12 years

125
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,504
and always said that her performances
were the only thing she could brag about.

126
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,842
Despite barely having

127
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,013
time to sleep to make ends meet,

128
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,186
she was on cloud nine because
she was about to become a leading actress

129
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,396
for the first time.

130
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,817
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,820
I truly am.

132
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,122
Decide

133
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,169
whether you'll stay a pathetic woman
tormented by guilt all your life

134
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,130
or be grateful
and live your life to the fullest for her.

135
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,412
I absorbed a spirit's memories
for the first time in a while.

136
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,375
This is excruciating.

137
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,057
It's still not been taken care of?

138
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,937
Everyone who went to Daebak Realty
claims to have seen a ghost.

139
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,524
Have they all gone insane or something?

140
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,120
-What was that?
-It's a ghost!

141
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,956
They saw her. They looked her in the eye.

142
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,876
Gosh. I knew they'd be like that.

143
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,712
I told you there was
a ghost in Daebak Realty.

144
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,714
Look at them running away.

145
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,925
JUNGBU POLICE STATION

146
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,227
You don't have to believe
what the spirit said.

147
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,814
But you must believe
what I am telling you.

148
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,948
Sir, what would you like for lunch?

149
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,034
We haven't had

150
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,703
lunchboxes in a while.

151
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,206
-Okay. I'll go buy them right now.
-No.

152
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,541
I'll go.

153
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,461
Here are
your bulgogi and shrimp lunchboxes.

154
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,545
Thank you.

155
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,590
How's your shoulder by the way?

156
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,217
It's fine now.

157
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,094
How did you hurt it again?

158
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,889
Well, I fell.

159
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,599
Just my luck.

160
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,059
Just your luck?

161
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,480
I threw in two beverages for you.

162
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,482
Thank you as always.

163
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,696
Your kitchen is
more spacious than I thought.

164
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,369
What is this design?

165
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,581
How unique.

166
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,749
Oh, that?

167
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,085
I bought the set when opening this shop.

168
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,254
I see.

169
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,466
"M" for Ma Gwang-tae.

170
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,599
-Here.
-Thank you.

171
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,725
My pleasure.

172
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,563
LUNCHBOX

173
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,282
What has the chairman been up to?

174
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,205
You punk.

175
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,790
Eat up. It's on me.

176
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,305
You scumbag.

177
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,558
Don't be frightened.
We're not here to hurt you.

178
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,518
I'm telling you.

179
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,063
A ghost really resides at Daebak Realty.

180
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,233
To make matters worse,
it's Ms. Hong's mother.

181
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,569
That's nothing new.

182
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,323
Did you find out anything else?

183
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,618
Well… I did.

184
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,202
Of course, I did.

185
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,832
The mechanism of the exorcism.

186
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,460
It's quite simple.
She lures the spirit with incense.

187
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,004
Then puts the spirit
into the psychic's body.

188
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,214
Lastly, the spiritual needle. Game over.

189
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,175
Is that it?

190
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,970
Come on, what is that?

191
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,056
Gosh, you guys.

192
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,058
You make money that easily?

193
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,727
Easily? Not at all.

194
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,062
It's extremely dangerous.

195
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,272
It is?

196
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,025
They risk their lives every time.

197
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,944
So a preliminary inspection is a must.

198
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,445
A preliminary inspection?

199
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,613
Yes, that's right.

200
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,908
It's something they do
before the official exorcism.

201
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,076
It's like a rehearsal.

202
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,704
Late at night,
they go to the haunted house.

203
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,582
Ms. Hong and Oh In-beom.

204
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,835
Just them two. Gosh, it's just them.

205
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,045
And I heard

206
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,299
this is an extremely terrifying
and dangerous task.

207
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,679
Just them two?

208
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,099
OPENING HOURS
FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE

209
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,231
Ji-a.

210
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:24,858
Are you leaving?

211
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,736
Could you do me a favor?

212
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,074
No.

213
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,159
We must.

214
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,120
Let's just leave this to the police.

215
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,248
The police won't believe me
until they have firm evidence.

216
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,958
We must catch him red-handed.

217
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,960
You're talking about a murderer.

218
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,962
No. I won't allow it.

219
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm terrified too.

220
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,926
But I must do this.

221
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,055
Still, you're going to lure him yourself?
That's just too dangerous.

222
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,474
I can't let him roam around freely.

223
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,103
If I do,
there will be other victims like me.

224
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,606
And some of them will be murdered as well.

225
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,484
My gosh.

226
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,530
Ms. Hong, say something.

227
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,619
Are you sure you won't regret this?

228
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,749
Yes, I am.

229
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,669
Set up the cameras as soon as you can.

230
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,837
Ms. Hong.

231
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,798
Thank you, Ji-a.

232
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,436
Is this because of Lee's memories
you absorbed?

233
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,565
You usually never get involved
once the exorcism's over.

234
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,776
It's because of Bae Su-jeong.

235
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,110
Sorry?

236
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,699
Did she grow on you overnight?

237
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,618
We need to catch Ma Gwang-tae

238
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,622
for her to be free of guilt
and carry on with her life.

239
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,335
I know very well how it feels
to be tormented by guilt

240
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,253
all your life.

241
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,509
She still has

242
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,677
a chance.

243
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,313
LUNCHBOX

244
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,112
You have nothing to do here.
Why don't you go back to the office?

245
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,199
You're much more shameless than I thought.

246
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,993
I didn't expect you to return.

247
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,998
I have nothing to hide anymore.
So why shouldn't I be back?

248
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,500
Haven't you heard?

249
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,961
Ms. Hong and I have made up.

250
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,425
And she even let me
have this necklace back.

251
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,385
For my sake.

252
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,766
What?

253
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,604
Chief He-o,
Ma Gwang-tae has entered the lobby.

254
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,909
OUT ON DELIVERY

255
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,861
Why are you doing this?

256
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,905
Be quiet.

257
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,949
You and I aren't dating.

258
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,994
And I never gave you the passcode.

259
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,705
Su-jeong. I'm sure you'll like me too.

260
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,797
Why won't you just do what I say?

261
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,508
Do you want
to end up dead like that wench?

262
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,344
Is that why you killed Lee Hyeon-ju?

263
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,429
Yes.

264
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,017
Because I really hate women
who don't listen to me.

265
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,105
I also hate men who don't listen to me.

266
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,153
Are you okay?

267
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,205
Be careful!

268
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,624
That scumbag!

269
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,090
Hello. It's a break and enter.

270
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,468
He has a knife too. Please hurry.

271
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,670
Ma Gwang-tae!

272
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,171
Hello? Is this 911?

273
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,875
Ms. Hong.

274
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,387
MA GWANG…

275
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,774
MA GWANG-TAE

276
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,597
This guy's scum.

277
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,350
Are you okay?

278
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,048
What the hell is your deal?

279
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,804
Why won't you just do what I say?

280
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,140
Do you want
to end up dead like that wench?

281
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,767
Is that why you killed Lee Hyeon-ju?

282
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,893
Yes.

283
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,355
Because I really hate women
who don't listen to me.

284
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,364
You're done. You guys can go.

285
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,074
What?

286
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,202
But a man died. We can't let them go.

287
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,288
It's okay. He died in a car accident.

288
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,877
I'll call you if I need anything else.

289
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,839
Let's go.

290
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,595
I don't think we should just release them.

291
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,846
That's enough.

292
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,515
I witnessed the scene myself.

293
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,101
We got the murder weapon as well.

294
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,564
Let's wait until we get the report
from the NFS.

295
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,458
Ji-a.

296
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,088
Go get some sleep and forget everything.

297
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,131
Thank you so much.

298
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,108
Well, Su-jeong.

299
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,777
Can I drop you off at your friend's house?

300
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,155
No. You must feel uncomfortable in my car.

301
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,866
No, Ji-cheol. I would appreciate it.

302
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,660
Thank you. I mean it.

303
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,245
Are you sure?

304
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,165
Let's go.

305
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,098
-I'll drop you off.
-Sure.

306
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,787
DAEBAK REALTY

307
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,127
We aren't open…

308
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,796
The door was open.

309
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,261
We found Lee Hyeon-ju's DNA
on Ma Gwang-tae's knife.

310
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,680
And on his PC,

311
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,433
we found many videos and photos
he took of Bae Su-jeong

312
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,518
and many other women illegally.

313
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,478
That's great news.

314
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,856
I thought I should let you know
how it went.

315
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,065
All right.

316
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,610
Is that all you came to say?

317
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,945
Actually,
there's something I'd like to ask.

318
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,785
This is what Ms. Hong drew
in the interrogation room.

319
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,331
And…

320
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,503
this is the knife Ma used to kill Lee.

321
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,838
Only the culprit and victim
would know the mark.

322
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,966
How did Ms. Hong know that so accurately?

323
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,012
I'm sure she explained it herself
when she drew you this picture.

324
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,348
Does she really

325
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,476
see the memories of a spirit
through an exorcism?

326
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,649
I still find it hard to believe.

327
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,861
You always believed
only what you could see.

328
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,490
-Why did you kill the baby?
-Because it'd hold me back.

329
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,993
Isn't it obvious?

330
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,705
Was there something
I didn't know back then?

331
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,422
Everything has its hidden side.

332
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,141
I'll take that.

333
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,906
What's that?

334
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,366
Oh, this?

335
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,410
I'm preparing for the police exam.

336
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,371
The police?

337
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,875
There are way too many bad people
in this world.

338
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:21,880
To this day, I've lived my life
just hoping I'd never run into one.

339
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,258
But no matter how careful I am,
I can always come across one.

340
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,802
So I decided to just catch them myself.

341
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,390
Gosh, Su-jeong. You're so cool.

342
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,061
Why do I see Ms. Hong in her?

343
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,401
You're going to exorcise
Oh Seong-sik's spirit?

344
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,529
All of a sudden?
What are you talking about?

345
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,072
It's not a sudden decision.

346
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,116
I gave this a lot of thought.

347
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,663
In order to find out
what happened 20 years ago,

348
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,707
we must see his memories.

349
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,211
You don't even know
if he has memories of that day.

350
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,505
-I'll never know until I try.
-You can't!

351
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,345
It's too dangerous.
Did you forget what happened last time?

352
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:14,432
When Oh Seong-sik possessed In-beom,
he broke Do Hak-seong's arm.

353
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,061
What will you do
if he ends up killing him?

354
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,313
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

355
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,735
Is it because Oh Seong-sik
is In-beom's uncle?

356
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:32,158
Ms. Hong. In-beom doesn't know his uncle
is still here as a vengeful spirit.

357
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,745
It might be better for him
to live his life without knowing it.

358
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,246
Do you really think so?

359
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,293
If you live without knowing
the truth that's out there,

360
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,505
will it be all good?

361
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,345
And it's not only because of In-beom.

362
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,848
I realized something
during the Bae Su-jeong case.

363
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,768
That 20-year-old girl

364
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,480
risked her life to catch that murderer.

365
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,024
While I…

366
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,195
I always said I wanted
to put my mom to rest,

367
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,407
but I never did anything about it.

368
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,452
What do you mean, you didn't do anything?

369
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,080
You've done everything you could,
but nothing's worked.

370
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,749
Once we find a suitable psychic…

371
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,960
We've never tried exorcising Oh Seong-sik.

372
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,757
You've changed.

373
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,345
I still don't think you should do it.

374
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,056
But if you're really going to do it,

375
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,517
you'll have to fire me first.

376
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,321
This is driving me crazy.

377
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,578
I get what Ms. Joo is worried about,

378
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,168
but I need to do it.

379
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,462
This is the only way.

380
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:14,093
The problem is
if I'm going to tell In-beom or not.

381
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,808
What would you do, Mom?

382
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,568
This is too hard. My head hurts.

383
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,948
Yes. It'll be better not to.

384
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,384
Who dolled you up? You look perfect today.

385
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,385
Are you sure?

386
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,221
I have to look good today.

387
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,891
You do look good, like a celebrity.
Do you want to see?

388
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,645
You're right.

389
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,396
I look pretty good.

390
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,025
I can't believe this.

391
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,987
How could this be our last date
when we just had our first one?

392
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,076
A con artist and a police officer.

393
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,953
Cheer up, Ji-cheol.

394
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,331
Boarding academies are different
from the army, right?

395
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,543
They can stay out once a month,
and they can use their phones too.

396
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,294
It just sounds like the army.

397
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,338
I can't do this.

398
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,590
I need to join an online community
of people

399
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,467
with girlfriends in boarding academies.

400
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,385
Go ahead.

401
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,763
Make sure you brace yourself
and see her off.

402
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,391
And don't bawl in front of her academy.

403
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,934
I don't think I can

404
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,186
hold back my tears.

405
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,689
You can do it!

406
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,573
In-beom, get ready and come out.

407
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,075
-What?
-I'll buy you a meal.

408
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,536
A meal?

409
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,372
Is she asking you out on a date?

410
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,040
Of course not.

411
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,183
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

412
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,581
How do I look?
I wanted to go with black and white.

413
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,082
Are you playing a game of go?

414
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,128
Whatever.

415
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,489
What do you want to say? You look serious.

416
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,702
Just say it.

417
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:35,336
Do you remember the time
Do Hak-seong hung you upside down?

418
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,589
Gosh. How could I forget that?

419
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,467
Hey, wait!

420
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:48,641
The vengeful spirit hovering around him
suddenly possessed you and attacked him.

421
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,103
We both know that.
Why are you telling me this again?

422
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,854
That vengeful spirit is…

423
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,024
your uncle.

424
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,656
-What?
-Your uncle, Oh Seong-sik,

425
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,368
became a vengeful spirit
and stays next to Do Hak-seong.

426
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,037
Stop joking around.

427
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,375
Stop joking!

428
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,264
When did you find out?

429
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,852
From the moment I saw him.

430
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,523
I've never forgotten the face
of my mom's last client.

431
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,447
Had I revealed who I was early on,

432
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,533
you would've told me this sooner.

433
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,582
Let's go help him find peace.
What's the problem?

434
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,382
For this exorcism…

435
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,218
No.

436
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,889
I don't want you
to get involved in this job.

437
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,642
He was your uncle.

438
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,147
Absorbing a stranger's memories
is painful enough.

439
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,109
Absorbing your beloved's memories…

440
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,779
will be excruciating.

441
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,406
You promised you'd give us
an apartment unit.

442
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,075
-What?
-I set the place on fire

443
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,659
and killed people.

444
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,370
Give me the apartment.

445
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,915
He may not have been who you think he was.

446
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,796
I considered leaving it to another psychic
without telling you.

447
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,007
Perhaps, I may be able to find out

448
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,470
how to put my mom to rest
in your uncle's memories.

449
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,556
That's why I want

450
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,017
to see the memories myself.

451
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,520
But remember what you said?

452
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,274
-No matter--
-No matter how horrible the truth,

453
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,276
I'd want to know it.

454
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,782
Frankly, I'm terrified.

455
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,368
Like you said,

456
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,621
I'm scared he might've
been a horrible man.

457
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:21,419
But suspecting something and being scared
without knowing the full story…

458
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,838
Doing that for 20 years was enough.

459
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,342
So don't worry.

460
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,011
After all, I'm a special psychic.

461
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,062
Vengeful spirits stuck on people
are different from the ones in houses.

462
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,356
The exorcism won't work
without Do's cooperation.

463
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,942
But will he cooperate?

464
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,318
We'll make him.

465
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,112
Any ideas?

466
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,864
That's our specialty.

467
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,158
Right. Scamming people.

468
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,244
We're professionals.

469
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,496
Scammers.

470
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,170
I'll meet him myself.

471
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,213
Chief Heo, you do the rest.

472
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,674
Will he agree to see you?

473
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,426
He will,

474
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,887
if I say I want to talk
about selling Daebak Realty.

475
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,906
I'm here to clean.

476
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,366
Is anyone here?

477
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,768
Sit down.

478
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,985
CHAIRMAN DO HAK-SEONG

479
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,907
I heard you're here
about selling Daebak Realty.

480
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,368
Did Ms. Hong finally make up her mind?

481
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,540
Yes.

482
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,458
Really?

483
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,096
Gosh.

484
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,728
She has decided

485
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,647
never to sell it to you.

486
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,024
What are you trying to pull?

487
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,696
I wanted to ask you something.

488
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,659
But I knew you wouldn't meet with me,
so I had to be sly.

489
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,412
You must have a death wish.

490
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,248
Please. Of course not.

491
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,596
You have

492
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,432
met my uncle before, haven't you?

493
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,019
Who's your uncle?

494
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,815
Oh Seong-sik.

495
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,318
Oh Seong-sik?

496
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,279
Oh Seong…

497
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,782
That squatter area arsonist?

498
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,042
I heard you were the last to see him
before he died.

499
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,918
Why did you see him?

500
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,629
Do you not know?

501
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,590
If I did, would I be asking you?

502
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,386
He called me over
and asked for some money.

503
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,139
What?

504
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,724
He demanded an apartment

505
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,351
since he set the place on fire

506
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,811
and ultimately got the area chosen
for redevelopment.

507
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,441
He threatened to tell the police that
I had ordered him to do so, if I didn't.

508
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,443
Don't you dare lie.

509
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,736
My uncle would

510
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,280
never do something like that for money.

511
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,743
Actually,

512
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,622
people do all sorts of things for money.

513
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,855
Come in.

514
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,534
-How's it going?
-We've already hired some actors.

515
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,953
-Get it over with.
-Yes, sir.

516
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,688
It's been a while since we did this.
It's thrilling and exciting.

517
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,650
Why the long face?
Were you not able to set the camera?

518
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,069
Never mind. Let's go.

519
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,826
There are three key places.

520
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,079
First, the large meeting room.
Second, the emergency stairs.

521
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,998
And third, the chairman's office.

522
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,334
But oddly enough,
the last one's not working.

523
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,921
What do you mean? I did my job.

524
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,631
Is that so?

525
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,842
Then why isn't it working?
It was brand-new.

526
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,928
Don't worry,
since a vengeful spirit is there.

527
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,222
Oh, is that right?

528
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,059
Okay. We've set up everything.

529
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:15,022
Just a little push,
and the rumors will spread like wildfire.

530
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,358
First, the intranet will go nuts.

531
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,196
After that, it'll rank first place
in ghost story websites.

532
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,449
And once the rumors
are posted in tabloids…

533
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,367
Do Hak-seong will hear about it.

534
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,205
Are you sure this will really work?

535
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,712
Just trust us and be patient.

536
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:41,089
This worked every single time.

537
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,090
That's right.

538
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,469
Three days from now,
Dohak Construction will call you.

539
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,226
This is Hong Ji-a from Daebak Realty.

540
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,687
Dohak Construction?

541
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,357
Already?

542
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,026
Sure. Okay.

543
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,695
What did they say?

544
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,198
We're meeting tomorrow.

545
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,619
What did I tell you?

546
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,579
This is how good we are.

547
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,123
Sure.

548
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,925
2002, FROM GOLDEN CONSTRUCTION
TO DOHAK CONSTRUCTION

549
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,177
CEREMONY FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF GOLDEN APARTMENT

550
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,847
Hello.

551
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,600
The chairman is waiting for you.

552
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,733
Okay. I'll take care of it.

553
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,544
I see. We'll talk again later.

554
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,795
Okay. Bye.

555
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:03,922
Sit.

556
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,266
A strange rumor has been
going around our company lately.

557
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,518
People are claiming
to have witnessed a ghost.

558
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,439
I heard you're an expert in this field.
I called you over to consult you.

559
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,609
So what's your take on this?

560
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,279
Based on the amount of energy I'm getting,
you must've felt it too.

561
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,572
What?

562
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,786
There's a vengeful spirit sticking to you.

563
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,705
And?

564
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,749
I'll exorcise that spirit.

565
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,210
An exorcism?

566
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:43,837
How much will it cost?

567
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,215
I don't need your money.
I just need to do the exorcism.

568
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:53,847
That's right. You can't ask me for money.

569
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,442
If you're this sloppy,

570
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,403
you'll never
make a living by scamming people.

571
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,738
That's the reality.

572
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,681
I thought I'd checked all
the security cameras.

573
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,226
I still don't know how that happened.

574
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,398
We can't change what already happened.

575
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,566
Let's go with plan B.

576
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,112
Don't look at me like that.
Just hear me out.

577
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,574
Don't we just need Do Hak-seong
to perform the exorcism?

578
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,078
So what? Are you suggesting
that we should kidnap him?

579
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,166
Do Hak-seong kidnapped us,
hung me upside, and beat me up.

580
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,335
-Why can't we do the same?
-He has a point.

581
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,129
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

582
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,381
But there's no other way.
Do you have any idea?

583
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,591
I'm thinking. Shut your mouth.

584
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,596
What are you guys doing here?

585
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,642
What's with the mood here?

586
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,354
Were you badmouthing me or something?

587
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,610
-Ms. Hong. You have a guest.
-Okay.

588
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,037
Gosh. My heart is hurting.

589
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,040
But how come we're keeping this
from Ms. Joo?

590
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,210
I'm not sure.

591
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:52,424
I urgently need money for my business.
So I want to sell my factory quickly.

592
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,677
But everyone who came to see it
saw a ghost there,

593
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,513
so no one wants to buy it.
It's driving me crazy.

594
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,974
So you didn't see the ghost yourself?

595
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:04,269
Yes, I did. I saw it myself.
That's why I came to you.

596
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,239
The electricity is cut off there,
and I locked up the warehouse.

597
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,616
No one can get in there.

598
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,117
Is anyone there?

599
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,208
Who is it?

600
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,171
Come on out.

601
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,937
Then, I don't remember what happened next.

602
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,940
When I woke up, I was at the hospital.

603
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,650
Did someone die at the factory?

604
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,528
No. I'm the owner.
I would know if someone died there.

605
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,073
I'll go check.

606
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,574
You don't have to do it today.

607
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,743
I just want to get some air.

608
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,625
DAEBAK REALTY

609
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,838
See you later.

610
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,143
Yes?

611
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,743
When will you tell Ms. Joo?

612
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:49,624
When I have a definite lead. If I tell her
before that, she'll just nag me.

613
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,127
It's not because you don't trust her?

614
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:58,091
Ms. Joo is the only person
I trust in this world.

615
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,412
Am I late?

616
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,962
What did you want to talk about?

617
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,257
Right. You're
as straightforward as always.

618
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,593
You get right to the point.

619
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,936
This place is scary. Do you see anything?

620
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,522
Everything seems fine so far.

621
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:10,121
Gosh. Isn't the electricity off
in this cold storage warehouse?

622
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,665
Why is it so cold in here?

623
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,669
Is it because a vengeful spirit is here
as he said?

624
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,463
No. There's no vengeful spirit here.

625
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,758
And no traces either. It's clean.

626
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,221
What? Then why is it so cold in here?

627
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,431
The warehouse is in the middle
of the mountain,

628
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,351
so it's bound to be cold here.
That's probably why people said

629
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,811
that this place was haunted.

630
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,729
Gosh. Seriously?

631
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,190
We came all the way here
at this hour for nothing?

632
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:40,777
Isn't it good to have
one less vengeful spirit in the world?

633
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:42,904
That's true.

634
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:48,785
What?

635
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,338
Ms. Hong came to see me.

636
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:04,592
She tried to scare me saying
that there was a ghost next to me

637
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,428
and that she'd get rid of it for me.

638
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,429
So?

639
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,140
What did you say?

640
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,226
I'm asking this out of pure curiosity.

641
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,562
What's her angle?

642
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,356
-What did you say to her?
-Why are you curious about that?

643
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,818
Don't tell me you said yes.

644
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,155
What's your deal? What do you know
and what are you plotting?

645
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,160
You don't want to tell me?

646
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,496
Then you leave me no choice.

647
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,621
Is anyone out there?

648
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,832
Darn it. It's freezing in here.

649
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:25,965
Damn it.

650
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,398
It's freezing.

651
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:56,037
Use me to stay warm. I don't mind.

652
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,665
I'm your heat pack.

653
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,667
Are you stupid?

654
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,003
You can only bring up my body temperature

655
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,673
when it's gone down
while dealing with vengeful spirits.

656
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:13,263
Still, I'll keep holding your hand.

657
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,776
Ms. Hong.

658
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,280
If we die here…

659
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,034
like a pair of fools,

660
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,829
will we turn into vengeful spirits too?

661
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,334
I don't want that.

662
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,712
Stop saying something so stupid.

663
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,381
We're not going to die.

664
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,385
I will not die
before I put my mother to rest.

665
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,389
I cannot die.

666
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,480
Mom.

667
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,581
DAEBAK REALTY

668
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,902
It was me? You resented me?

669
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,988
Is it because I didn't stab you
as you asked?

670
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,990
Why are you here looking like that?

671
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,241
Why would you go alone? It's dangerous.

672
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,285
Why do you keep going out alone?
Am I that unhelpful?

673
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,411
It's time.

674
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,081
I went this far.
In-beom has to believe me.

675
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,459
What is that brat up to?
I need to see this for myself.

676
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,753
That's my only condition.

677
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,339
Do you think you're the only one
Oh Seong-sik met with

678
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,549
at Ilseong Hospital before he died?

679
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,594
I'm in my right mind.
It's something that has to be done.

680
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,013
Wait, you didn't call another psychic,
did you?

681
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,141
I have the most special psychic.
Why would I do that?
