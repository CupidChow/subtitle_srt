1
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,668
You're back. Did you enjoy the macaroons?

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,299
In-beom. Was the kid from 20 years ago

3
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:51,926
you?

4
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,057
Was it you?

5
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,896
Yes.

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,233
Tell me. What happened here that day?

7
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,654
Tell me what happened
and why my mom had to die.

8
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,323
-Tell me!
-How would I know?

9
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,618
I'm here to find that out too.

10
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,994
What?

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,997
To find out what your mother did

12
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,167
to make my uncle

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,794
die like that.

14
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,588
Are you suggesting
that Oh Seong-sik died because of my mom?

15
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,007
He was the one who attacked her that day.

16
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,718
Your uncle

17
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,555
took his own life
out of guilt after murdering people.

18
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,474
Watch what you say.

19
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,893
Do you want me to tell you
why Oh Seong-sik died?

20
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,311
Because you're a psychic.

21
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,398
If it hadn't been for you,
your uncle and my mother

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,776
would be alive.

23
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,237
No one would've died.

24
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,825
The one who killed my mother is…

25
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,369
you.

26
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,004
That's enough, you two.

27
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:19,973
Get out.

28
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,767
I never want to see you again.

29
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,159
Hey, In-beom.

30
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,326
Hey.

31
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
DAEBAK REALTY

32
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,880
The one who killed my mother is you.

33
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,020
Did you already know about it?

34
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,940
I only found out a few hours ago.

35
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,401
I received a call from Mr. Jung

36
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,695
and was so shocked.

37
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,657
Maybe he tried to con us
using what happened back then.

38
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,646
He was the first person.

39
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,107
It must've been tough. I've only done it
once, and it's already unbearable.

40
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,943
But doing this alone for ten years?

41
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,408
The first person who could truly empathize

42
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,119
with this painful ordeal
I've been going through.

43
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,875
The mere thought of knowing
that I wasn't alone in this.

44
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,548
It gave me a great sense of comfort.

45
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,218
I even felt sorry for him.

46
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,013
Bastard.

47
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,525
I'm sorry, Mom.

48
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,239
I had no idea
he was the reason you'd died.

49
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,034
I worked with him

50
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,290
and even thought
that he might be a decent guy.

51
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,756
I'm sorry I'm such a stupid daughter.

52
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,392
Now,

53
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,771
I have no idea

54
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,650
what I should do.

55
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,689
Uncle.

56
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,527
I don't know anything anymore.

57
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,282
Were you truly an evil person?

58
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,494
Or…

59
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,997
was I the root

60
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,875
of everything?

61
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,897
Don't you dare run away!

62
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,403
OH SEONG-SIK'S GRAVE

63
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,488
Have you been well?

64
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,542
What have you gotten yourself into?

65
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,460
What are you talking about?

66
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,674
Some men came and turned this place
upside down looking for something.

67
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,844
Looking for what?

68
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,138
And some woman came yesterday.

69
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,958
OH IN-BEOM

70
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,446
LUNCHBOX

71
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,787
Welcome.

72
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,508
Here's your food. I had some leftover
fried shrimp, so I put them in as well.

73
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,885
Thank you.

74
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,763
Goodbye.

75
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,522
Aren't you getting in?

76
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,073
Oh, no. It's going up.

77
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,117
-Darn it.
-Hello.

78
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,245
Oh, you're from Unit 602.
You're home late.

79
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,414
Have you found a replacement yet?

80
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,833
We only recently put it up for rent.

81
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,793
Can you just give me back my deposit?

82
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,753
I'm so terrified.

83
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,423
-Last night…
-Talking about ghosts again?

84
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,844
You're a grown woman.
Why are you so scared of them?

85
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,597
But someone died there.

86
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm not the one who killed them.
If you're that terrified, come home early.

87
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,646
You always stay out late.
Don't blame the house.

88
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,068
Better yet,
how about you find a replacement tenant?

89
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,070
Really?

90
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,914
Then I'll ask my acquaintance.
Is that okay?

91
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,887
Open the door!

92
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,472
Help me!

93
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,394
Please open the door.

94
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,730
Help me.

95
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,815
Hey, aren't you getting in?

96
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,233
Please open the door.

97
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,072
Please open the door.

98
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,908
Help me! Please open the door!

99
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,245
Please open the door!

100
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,551
Hey!

101
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,137
What's going on? Wake up!

102
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,396
Hello? Is this 911?

103
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,690
DAEBAK REALTY

104
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,036
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

105
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,289
In-beom, where are you? Call me.

106
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,003
Oh, my God!

107
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,757
-What do you want?
-Well…

108
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,552
Did In-beom and Ms. Hong go on a trip?

109
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,553
What?

110
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,888
It's just that I haven't seen them lately.

111
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,932
Are they dating?

112
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,893
Gosh. Don't be absurd.

113
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,979
What?

114
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,113
Daebak Realty 24-1.

115
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,240
Something's going on between them.

116
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,493
I feel the chill. It feels like
I've been stabbed with a knife.

117
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,458
Mom?

118
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,293
We have deliveries backed up.

119
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:36,088
Deliveries? Right, I should go.

120
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,174
I'm going now.

121
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,849
Oh, here she is.

122
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,350
Hey.

123
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,650
Like you asked,
I've been keeping an eye on her.

124
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:01,197
But she hasn't been doing anything.
She didn't order any food yesterday.

125
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,782
I'll go check on her. You can go now.

126
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,451
-Thank you.
-Sure.

127
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,145
Ms. Hong!

128
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,023
Hong Ji-a!

129
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,817
Where did she go?

130
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,669
Ms. Hong?

131
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,713
-You startled me.
-Oh, my.

132
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,131
When did you get here?

133
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,015
Why didn't you answer your phone?

134
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,475
You called?

135
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,898
-My phone died.
-How long have you been doing this?

136
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,942
What time is it now?

137
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,152
Did you even eat?

138
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,424
I thought you weren't hungry.

139
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,010
I didn't eat anything for two days.
How can I not be?

140
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,056
-I've been thinking.
-Stop thinking.

141
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,518
I thought I'd be able to hear

142
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,687
what happened that day
once I found that boy.

143
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,355
But he knows less than me.

144
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,026
No matter how much I think about this,
books are the way to go.

145
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,863
"Knowledge is power."
They say this for a reason.

146
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,948
So? Have you found anything?

147
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,366
There are way too many.

148
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,703
Too many Records of Exorcism
and too many ancient texts.

149
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,791
What's worse, they were
all written in the Chinese characters,

150
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,168
not in the Korean alphabet.

151
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,922
Well, they're mixed. So I felt like
I could make sense of it, but no.

152
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,883
Gosh. This is just torture. Seriously.

153
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,260
Why do you think my phone died?

154
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,971
I used up all my battery,
looking up the Chinese letters.

155
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,183
I looked and looked, but I couldn't
find anything about an egg ghost.

156
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,560
Was it called differently in the past?

157
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,312
Please eat.

158
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,401
I'll find another psychic for you.

159
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,372
I'll get going.

160
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,667
Make sure to keep your phone on.

161
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,293
I said, I got it.

162
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,128
Stop reminding me.

163
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,172
Off you go.

164
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,453
-Hello.
-Hi.

165
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,040
I'm going on my first date.
Can you recommend me a flower?

166
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,269
Gosh.

167
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,022
Hello.

168
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,357
You look prettier in real life.

169
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,194
It's our first date in person.

170
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,114
So I prepared a flower
that resembles your beauty.

171
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,995
Gosh. That was so cheesy. Goodness.

172
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,413
No.

173
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,000
Hello. I'm Heo Ji-cheol.

174
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,126
Gosh.

175
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,547
What should I say to her? This is
driving me crazy. What should I say?

176
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,215
Ji-cheol?

177
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,510
Hello.

178
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,352
They went like, "Chief Heo."

179
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,189
They were trying to stop me.
"No, Chief Heo."

180
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,982
And they were laughing like this.

181
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,114
When I was saying hello,
he just went like this.

182
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,325
So I went like this.

183
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,535
After that, no one laughed!

184
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,956
And then, it got all quiet.

185
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,094
Is my story boring you?

186
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,346
No.

187
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,389
Should we get going then?

188
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,690
Ji-cheol.

189
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,068
You said you work
at a real estate agency, right?

190
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:33,987
Yes.

191
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,158
DAEBAK REALTY

192
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,998
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

193
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,794
Do you guys specialize
in handling haunted houses?

194
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,130
Yes, we do. Please come in.

195
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,095
They all seem to know
exactly when we open.

196
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,763
Go in.

197
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,785
You've seen the ghost yourself?

198
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:27,040
Yes. A month ago, someone was murdered
in the building I live in now.

199
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,169
The spirit of the deceased
keeps showing up and torturing me.

200
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,628
Did you know the deceased?

201
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,256
No.

202
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,675
I've only seen her drunk a few times.
That's it.

203
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,433
Darn it.

204
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,310
Why won't this open?

205
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,520
Is it broken?

206
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,315
What? She's drunk.

207
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,028
Finally.

208
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,992
What? Who are you?

209
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,161
You came to the wrong unit.

210
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,122
No. This is my place.

211
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,582
I live in Unit 702.

212
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,958
This is Unit 602.

213
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,631
Oh, my. Goodness. I must be losing it.

214
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,758
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,890
You see, I live upstairs in Unit 702.

216
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,601
Are you in college?

217
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,730
She was pretty famous in the building.

218
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,024
Her hairstyle and outfits
always stood out.

219
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,777
People saw guys carrying her home
because she was drunk.

220
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,237
Did you kill her?

221
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,031
Excuse me?

222
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,034
If you saw her only a few times,
why would she haunt you?

223
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,166
She's asking
if you know anything about the murder.

224
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,294
I was…

225
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,506
the last person to see her.

226
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,677
Su-jeong, are you sure you didn't see
the guy's face in the elevator?

227
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,512
Or did you notice anything unusual?

228
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,432
No. He was wearing a mask and a cap.

229
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,394
I really thought they knew each other.

230
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,604
This is frustrating.

231
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,232
Please help me. I have no place to go.

232
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,234
I can't stay at my friend's forever.

233
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,862
We must check if the house is
indeed haunted first, so be patient.

234
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,032
It really is.
I've seen the ghost several times.

235
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,575
You might be mistaken.

236
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,502
You didn't tell them
I referred you to them, right?

237
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,420
No.

238
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,048
But she can't get rid
of the spirit right away.

239
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,466
She must check first.

240
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,261
I see.
That's called a preliminary inspection.

241
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,638
She must check
if there's a vengeful spirit there.

242
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,851
And when she does that,
she usually takes on the case.

243
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,270
-Really?
-I'm telling you.

244
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,772
-You trust me, right?
-Yes.

245
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,985
But why can't I tell them
that you referred me to them?

246
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,862
You said you were the co-CEO.

247
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,989
Well…

248
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,160
I don't know how to explain this to you.

249
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,662
You know Mr. Oh… I mean, Chief Oh, right?

250
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,247
Chief Oh In-beom.

251
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,125
He caused a huge mess at work.

252
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,835
So they're on edge.

253
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,838
I see.

254
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,758
Now, have some food. You look so haggard.

255
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,552
Thank you.

256
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,359
Grandma,

257
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,779
why did Uncle

258
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,031
commit suicide?

259
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,950
That's not true! He didn't kill himself.

260
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,080
You might believe so
because you are his mother,

261
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,581
but the world thinks otherwise.

262
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,458
The police already closed the case.

263
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,502
-And there's also evidence.
-Evidence?

264
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,884
This is proof.

265
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,512
Why would
my kind-hearted son kill himself?

266
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,599
My gosh.

267
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,192
MILITARY MAIL

268
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,215
The fire that broke out
in Yongnam Village on November 15

269
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,050
was set by me.

270
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,427
Due to sudden redevelopment,

271
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,515
I was about to get kicked out onto the
streets without reasonable compensation.

272
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,433
And I couldn't stand the thought of it.

273
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,103
So I did something
I shouldn't have while I was drunk.

274
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,607
I wish to confess everything I did
and pay for it.

275
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,109
I'm so sorry.

276
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,197
She was right.

277
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,577
Ms. Hong's mother passed away
because of my uncle and me.

278
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,219
Where are you going?

279
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,472
I have to go.

280
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,474
There's something I need to do.

281
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,321
Bye.

282
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,960
Is it the best you can do?

283
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,671
Hey! How many times do I have to tell you?

284
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,841
Do you think I'm playing around?

285
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,386
Do you want to see me get mad?
You haven't found him with that many guys?

286
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,097
Jeong-pil runs an employment agency.
Contact him too.

287
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,726
Old habits never die. That thug.

288
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,852
Write this down.

289
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,313
Name, Yang Chang-hwa. Age, 32.

290
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,732
He left home ten years ago,
and she lost touch with him.

291
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,237
He's the son
of the lady who's helping me now.

292
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,115
Hey! Did you forget
who I am? Find him now.

293
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,283
What?

294
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,702
That thug's returning the favor?

295
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:43,750
Since tenant Lee Hyeon-ju was killed in
the underground parking lot a month ago,

296
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,294
a vengeful spirit's
been seen in this building.

297
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,755
It's unfortunate
because she made a police report

298
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,132
that she saw
a suspicious man in the building

299
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,718
and complained
about the building security,

300
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,471
-but they all ignored it.
-Has the culprit been caught?

301
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,934
The security camera near the elevator
is the only camera that caught him.

302
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,853
But it only got the top of his head.

303
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,493
He changed his target during the act.

304
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,953
Sorry?

305
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,039
One second.

306
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,712
You're right.

307
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,214
Do you think she thought

308
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,466
she died in Bae Su-jeong's place?

309
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,845
-But why did she hop back in?
-I'll go check the place.

310
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,646
-We need to talk.
-I have nothing to say.

311
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,075
DAEBAK REALTY

312
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,712
We would've caught the culprit already

313
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,213
if the CCTV worked that day.

314
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,799
It's probably someone
who knows this building very well.

315
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,765
He knew this camera was broken.

316
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,810
A person died because
they tried to save the repair cost.

317
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,897
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

318
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,023
-Sir.
-Yes?

319
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,442
-May we put up some wanted posters?
-Yes, go ahead.

320
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,653
I guess kids keep taking it off.

321
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,742
-Goodness, are you all right?
-I recently hurt my shoulder a little.

322
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,910
Let me get it.

323
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,703
Goodness, thank you.

324
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,706
So you haven't caught the culprit yet?

325
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,211
Goodness. What we really need is a lead,

326
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,090
but there's a rumor
of ghost sightings instead.

327
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,384
I heard about that too.

328
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,552
Goodbye, then.

329
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,638
-All right. Thank you.
-Sure.

330
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,972
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

331
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,491
It's unfair?

332
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,828
Do you resent her?

333
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,543
But you can't turn back time.

334
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:15,795
Forget about it.

335
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,466
You don't belong here anymore.

336
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,824
You're done, right?

337
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,803
I saw the vengeful spirit.

338
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,055
Please call Hyeong-sik.

339
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,688
She was just talking to a ghost, right?

340
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,899
Is that what it looked like to you?

341
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,778
In my eyes,
she was talking nonsense to the air.

342
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,115
Look at my goosebumps. This is real.

343
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,038
LAND, PRIVATE PROPERTIES,
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, RENT

344
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,520
What do you have to tell me?

345
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,110
On the day I first came here,

346
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,321
I remembered something
I had forgotten all my life,

347
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,031
the memories I have of this place.

348
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,287
Die!

349
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,289
Uncle.

350
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,213
I'd lived my life

351
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:27,844
without any idea
why my uncle had to die so suddenly.

352
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,888
But it felt like I finally had a lead.

353
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,600
I thought everything would become clear

354
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,394
once I found out
what exactly happened here

355
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,981
that night 20 years ago.

356
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,819
Hey! Are you okay?

357
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,946
-Gosh! You're bleeding?
-Aren't you Jeong-hun?

358
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,325
-Why am I here?
-Are you crazy? Did you do that?

359
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,660
You punk.
How could you hit him with a rock?

360
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,828
Gosh, look at him.

361
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,746
Grandma.

362
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,176
OUR HOUSES MAY BE DEPRIVED, BUT NOT US!

363
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,270
Uncle, I really…

364
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,188
I know.

365
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,694
It's okay.

366
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:31,699
I know very well
that you didn't do that, In-beom.

367
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,745
I believe you.

368
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,624
He was the only person who was on my side.

369
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,878
I must've wanted to trust him
as he trusted me.

370
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,049
Perhaps, that was why
I couldn't accept the fact

371
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,510
that he had taken so many lives

372
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,638
and committed suicide.

373
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,143
Is that all? Did you come to explain that?

374
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,650
I wanted to sincerely apologize.

375
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,237
Had we never come here that day,

376
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,865
your mother would've died then.

377
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,870
I'm truly sorry.

378
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,916
I'm also sorry

379
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,584
for deceiving you.

380
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,681
Okay.

381
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,534
Are you done with your uncle's death?

382
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,244
No.

383
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,873
There are still too many
unanswered questions.

384
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,957
Then what will you do?

385
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,003
I'll have to think about that.

386
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,381
But one thing for sure is that
I can no longer stay at Daebak Realty.

387
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,384
Right.

388
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,221
Does this mean
we'll continue to scam people?

389
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,018
Let's look for something legitimate to do.

390
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,313
We should also move out.

391
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,440
No! We're not moving.

392
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,194
-Why not?
-Su-jeong is Ms. Hong's client right now.

393
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,653
What?

394
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,578
Mr. Han.

395
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,414
Thanks to your help
in the Bangso-dong's redevelopment,

396
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,375
I truly feel so reassured.

397
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,169
I will do my best

398
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,881
to make your future rosy, sir.

399
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,678
I'm not here to be flattered by you.

400
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,139
-Sorry?
-I heard

401
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,642
there are still many residents
refusing to move out.

402
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,019
Oh, that?

403
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,316
There aren't that many anymore.
It'll all get sorted out soon.

404
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,027
-Don't worry.
-What if a new mayor is elected?

405
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,030
The approval for the redevelopment plan

406
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,032
could always be revoked.

407
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,119
I don't want to suffer
because of your mistakes.

408
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,412
Get this over with before the election.

409
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,290
In the past, you'd get lucky

410
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,961
and a big fire would break out
in these redevelopment cases.

411
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,716
I guess your luck has run out.

412
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,808
DAEBAK REALTY

413
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,976
LEE HYEON-JU

414
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,353
The parking lot
will be blocked off, right?

415
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,438
Yes, I've already talked
with the landlord.

416
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,524
When is In-beom arriving?

417
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,194
You mean Hyeong-sik?

418
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,405
He should be here soon.

419
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,159
-Hello.
-Hey.

420
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,910
Hyeong-sik!

421
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,746
Likewise.

422
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,249
In-beom, get the salt…

423
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,084
Sorry?

424
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,340
Make sure you pack plenty of salt.

425
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,302
This vengeful spirit won't be easy.

426
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,931
Okay.

427
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,333
Hey. I'm home.

428
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,335
Don't be sorry.

429
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,546
Your parents came unexpectedly.
I understand.

430
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,091
Thank you for letting me
stay there until now.

431
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,136
Okay. Good luck with your studies.

432
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,555
Hello?

433
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,265
A-yeong.

434
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,600
Hello?

435
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,131
Now.

436
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,042
Sorry for the long wait.

437
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:47,171
That wench got in my way that night,
so I couldn't come to you.

438
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:50,216
Finally, it's just the two of us here.

439
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,385
Damn it!

440
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,606
What?

441
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,767
Why…

442
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,167
Stop it now.

443
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,335
Don't move!

444
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,257
Drop your dagger and get up.

445
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,844
I don't have time for that.

446
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,322
Hey.

447
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,780
Who are you to come
between me and Su-jeong?

448
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:32,062
Drop it and get on your feet.
Next one is a live bullet.

449
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,285
-Hey. Are you okay?
-What?

450
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,585
We're the police.

451
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,212
Hey, get up!

452
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,673
-My goodness.
-I'm not going. Let go!

453
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,008
Gosh.

454
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,770
Trespass? That's a misunderstanding.
I'm really innocent.

455
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,397
Then why were you there?

456
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,775
I went there to see my Su-jeong.

457
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,902
"My Su-jeong"?

458
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,243
What about you? Why did you go there?

459
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,287
Bae Su-jeong is my client.

460
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,041
Are you talking about exorcism?

461
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,379
Ms. Bae, is she telling the truth?

462
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,093
Of course, she should be here too.

463
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,642
That's the guy.

464
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,393
Pardon?

465
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,896
What did you say?

466
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,147
The guy

467
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,526
who killed the lady from Unit 702
in the parking lot.

468
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,445
He's the guy.

469
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,281
Are you telling me

470
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,701
that he's the culprit
of the parking lot murder case?

471
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,833
Last time, you said you couldn't
see his face because of the mask and cap.

472
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,671
When you questioned me,
I wasn't sure if it was him.

473
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,382
But I am certain now.

474
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,634
Why are you doing this to me?

475
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,635
Sit down!

476
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,430
-Did I upset you in any way?
-Sit. Sit down.

477
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,187
Let's separate
the victim and the assailant first.

478
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,897
"Assailant"?

479
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,233
I'm really innocent.

480
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,536
Wait outside.

481
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:01,211
Don't worry. I'm going to wait right
by the door until the questioning is over.

482
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,853
I mean, why would I ever harm Su-jeong?

483
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,647
You must've been close to Ms. Bae.

484
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,071
Actually, we are dating.

485
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,282
What?

486
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,327
She told me her passcode
so I could enter when I wanted to.

487
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,621
I never told him my passcode.

488
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,663
What?

489
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,167
Su-jeong comes to my restaurant
practically every day.

490
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,460
Naturally, we became close.

491
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,879
-I see.
-I treated her like my sister.

492
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,256
And she treated me like her brother.

493
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,383
But aren't you married?

494
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,096
Right.

495
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:58,685
So I went there today
to break up with her.

496
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,522
But Su-jeong couldn't accept it.

497
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,692
It's all my fault.

498
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,694
I understand why she's upset.

499
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,906
That's ridiculous.

500
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,874
A real estate agency
that performs exorcisms.

501
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,252
Okay. Let's sum it up.

502
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,963
With Ms. Bae's request,

503
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,842
you went to send off the spirit
at the parking lot.

504
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,387
So you burned the incense,
scattered some salt,

505
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,014
entered Ms. Bae's house, and made a mess.

506
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,266
You did all of these
to get rid of the spirit?

507
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,019
Fine. Did you get rid of the spirit?

508
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,865
Psychics can't remember what happens
while they're possessed.

509
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,742
Do you think this is a joke?

510
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,994
Answer my questions!

511
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,414
-Do your job right.
-What?

512
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,917
If you watched the elevator security
footage of the day of the murder,

513
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,046
you must've figured out that Bae Su-jeong
was the culprit's initial target.

514
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:13,051
But Lee Hyeon-ju who got off
the elevator got on the elevator again.

515
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,012
When his plan went south,
he changed his target.

516
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,390
He got extremely mad at Lee Hyeon-ju

517
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:22,686
for messing up the dream
he'd had for a very long time.

518
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,312
So he murdered her.

519
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,525
At the blind spot he found beforehand.

520
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,444
Wait! No!

521
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,195
Let go.

522
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,244
But Lee Hyeon-ju
didn't make it easy for him.

523
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,505
Please…

524
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,426
There was a struggle.

525
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,849
And the culprit's shoulder got dislocated.

526
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:11,443
And the spirit told you all that?
You have a wild imagination.

527
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,237
You don't have to believe
what the spirit said.

528
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,698
But you must believe
what I am telling you.

529
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,659
Not every stalker becomes a murderer.

530
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,996
I can't accuse someone of murder
just based on suspicions.

531
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,707
That's not how investigation works. Okay?

532
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,877
What you said might be all true,

533
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,254
but I must follow a proper protocol.

534
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,257
What's this?

535
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,137
The knife the culprit
used to stab the victim.

536
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,524
JUNGBU POLICE STATION

537
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,696
Su-jeong, are you all right?

538
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,949
Do you know each other?

539
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,828
She's his girlfriend.
I only found out when Chief Heo called.

540
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,664
I thought you wouldn't do it
if I asked you to.

541
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,249
I'm sorry.

542
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,168
Let's go, Su-jeong.

543
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,861
Why did they release him?

544
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,697
He broke and entered,
but this was his first offense,

545
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,700
-and there was no damage.
-Aren't first offenses also crimes?

546
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,078
How much more does she have to suffer?

547
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,044
Let's go.

548
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,088
Ji-a.

549
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,549
"Ji-a"?

550
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,928
Will it be okay to let Ma Gwang-tae go?

551
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,264
What else could we do?

552
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,433
When you saw
the footage from the elevator,

553
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,769
you also said it seemed
Lee Hyeon-ju died instead of Bae Su-jeong.

554
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,315
And if Ma Gwang-tae is
really Bae Su-jeong's stalker,

555
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,358
it makes perfect sense.

556
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,278
But there's no evidence.

557
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,946
We have Ms. Hong's statement.

558
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,950
She heard it from a ghost.
How can we use that?

559
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,917
This is driving me crazy too.

560
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,423
How did it go?

561
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,845
Su-jeong's so shocked
that she won't even look at me.

562
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,680
It's all because of that bastard.

563
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,353
What about the exorcism?
Is Ms. Hong all right? Is she hurt?

564
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,271
She's fine, of course.

565
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:57,108
-But Su-jeong is really--
-It must've been freezing without me.

566
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,405
What are you doing?

567
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,658
What do you mean?

568
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,786
Just go work as her psychic again
instead of pestering me!

569
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,414
I'm already upset
with what happened to Su-jeong.

570
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,717
DAEBAK REALTY

571
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,595
Why won't you read my messages?
You're making me worried.

572
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,016
It'd be okay to pop in and see her.

573
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,601
Right?

574
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,563
No, I shouldn't.

575
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,650
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

576
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,573
You're still worried about Ms. Hong,
aren't you?

577
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,744
No, I'm not. I came out to get some air.

578
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,832
What are you so worried about?
She looked completely fine to me.

579
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,251
The victim was brutally murdered.

580
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,546
It's unbearable
when you get memories like that.

581
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,507
Don't you remember
what happened after that water ghost?

582
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,262
Yes, right. I remember.

583
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,141
I was really scared for you that time.

584
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,434
I was scared too.

585
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,728
Scared I might kill that murderer.

586
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,814
Hey, Ms. Hong.

587
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,692
Is Su-jeong…

588
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,203
Is she still angry at you?

589
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,248
No, that's the aftereffect
of a ghost's possession.

590
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,694
BLUE THEATER WORKS

591
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,620
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE STARRING LEE HYEON-JU

592
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:26,549
WE'RE DELAYED INDEFINITELY DUE
TO THE MAIN CAST'S PERSONAL REASONS

593
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:36,059
WE WILL FULLY REFUND YOUR TICKETS.
WE'RE SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

594
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,874
Ms. Hong.

595
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,342
Ms. Hong.

596
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,981
What are you two doing here?

597
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,026
I can explain. What happened is…

598
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,422
Haven't you heard? Ms. Hong and I made up.

599
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,341
-Did she grow on you overnight?
-In-beom, get ready and come out.

600
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,551
Did she ask you out on a date?

601
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:59,220
You're going to perform an exorcism
on Oh Seong-sik's spirit?

602
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,680
Are you sure you won't give up?

603
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,849
Is it because Oh Seong-sik
is In-beom's uncle?

604
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,184
You wanted to know the truth
no matter how horrible it is, right?

605
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,228
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

606
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,397
We were both after the same thing.

607
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,441
Live an ordinary life like you used to.

608
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,734
Why won't you listen?

609
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,444
Do you want to die like that brat?

610
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,195
Was there something
I didn't know back then as well?

611
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,449
There is a karmic connection
to everything.
