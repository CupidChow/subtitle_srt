1
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,135
Die.

2
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,430
Die.

3
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,016
Hong Ji-a.

4
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,229
It's dangerous to stab
everywhere like that.

5
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,524
I told you, you have to stab it
in the heart in one go.

6
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,359
Let's try again.

7
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,786
Great job, my daughter.

8
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,581
Come on. That's too boring.

9
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,377
Mom, I don't want to become an exorcist.

10
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,588
Then what about vengeful spirits?

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,381
They can just stay in this world.

12
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:39,641
Staying in this world
as a spirit without a body is equivalent

13
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,977
to standing outside only in underwear

14
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,772
when there's a snowstorm
in the middle of winter.

15
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,524
If it's that cold, why stay?

16
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
That sounds foolish.

17
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,071
Because they can't leave behind
unfair things that happened to them.

18
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,366
That's why we need to help them leave.

19
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,120
We can help them forget
about their grudges

20
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,038
and be happy in a warm place.

21
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,505
Help me.

22
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,346
How did your mother pass away?

23
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,932
She died because of me.

24
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,021
You should go now. I'm tired.

25
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,534
You said I was special earlier.

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,797
Why don't you team up
with this special psychic?

27
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,386
Why would I?

28
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,346
I refuse to work with a fraud.

29
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,308
Didn't you beg me to do a case with you?

30
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,059
And we did just now.

31
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,319
Ms. Joo, please wire
Oh In-beom 20 million won.

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,863
Tell her your bank account number.

33
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,624
You think 20 million is chump change?
What's wrong with you?

34
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,751
Just do it. Why did you come here?

35
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:38,468
Mr. Oh, we Daebak Realty pays a psychic
two million won per gig.

36
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,721
She must've been out of her mind
and added another zero.

37
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,308
She said at least three times
that she'd pay me 20 million,

38
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,519
and I almost died
after being dragged upstairs.

39
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,360
-You went upstairs?
-Dragged?

40
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,445
You went up on your own.

41
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,573
And don't whine about passing out
for a few minutes.

42
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,243
He went up on his own?
To the room on the second floor?

43
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,248
So let's do as I said earlier.

44
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,708
You can pay me in installments.

45
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,461
I'm willing to work with you
until I get all the money.

46
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,214
I told you, I don't work with a fraud.

47
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,010
I've heard enough from you two.

48
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,515
I'll think it over favorably and call you.
You should leave for today.

49
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,145
I hope you make a reasonable decision.

50
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,190
-You know my number, right?
-I deleted it.

51
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,567
Then I'll call you. I didn't delete yours.

52
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,662
-Hire him as your psychic.
-Are you insane?

53
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,414
He uses spirits to scam people.

54
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,000
But he made it upstairs.

55
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,169
Look. Don't you see
how the salt has changed color?

56
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,172
Have you ever seen this glow so blue?
Well, I haven't.

57
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,092
What good is that if he can't help my mom?

58
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:09,225
But he gives you warmth
and absorbs vengeful spirits' memories.

59
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,521
It's not easy to find a psychic
who can make up for your weaknesses.

60
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,441
-I have no weaknesses.
-You have many.

61
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,861
I've been doing well
singlehandedly until now.

62
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,823
I never said it out loud,

63
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,286
but do you know how anxious I get
whenever you suffer from hypothermia?

64
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,414
-Nevertheless, I've been fine.
-Have you forgotten about Gonjiam?

65
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,377
You almost died there.

66
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,839
I almost died.

67
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,549
I didn't actually die.

68
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,016
Tell me the truth.
Is it me or Daebak Realty?

69
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,771
Hey, are you going
to abandon me and join Daebak?

70
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,982
I'm not abandoning you.

71
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,444
I just need to look
into something personal.

72
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,529
Aren't I your only personal matter?

73
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,491
You have neither parents nor siblings.
What personal thing?

74
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,204
This.

75
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,622
What?

76
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,792
How did you fix this?

77
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,794
-Did you glue it together?
-It's not mine.

78
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,171
Ms. Hong gave it to me.

79
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,301
But it looks the same
as the one your uncle gave you. How?

80
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,095
That's what I'm trying to find out.

81
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,305
What the relationship
between Daebak Realty

82
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,307
and my uncle was.

83
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,573
I thought it'd work this time.

84
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,379
You must've been startled.

85
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,382
I'm really sorry.

86
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,009
Next time,

87
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,638
I'll find a proper psychic, not a fraud.

88
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,890
You trust me, right?

89
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,910
DAEBAK REALTY

90
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,794
His spiritual energy is powerful enough.

91
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,672
I wonder why he wasn't
possessed by your mother's spirit.

92
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,425
-Maybe he isn't a virgin.
-He is.

93
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,719
He was possessed back at Dream Officetel.

94
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,888
He could've met a woman after that.

95
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,723
That quickly?

96
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,353
-We should look into that first.
-Yes.

97
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,525
Who is he?

98
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,611
He's the driver.

99
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,752
Make me the co-CEO.

100
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,421
And him, the chief.

101
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,133
Is he your plus-one or what?
We're not going to pay him.

102
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,927
Deal.

103
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,554
Ms. Joo, please show them the contract.

104
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,309
He's included, right?

105
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,270
Yes. My name is Heo Ji-cheol…

106
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,482
I'm your plus-one?

107
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:54,909
What?

108
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,453
What is this?

109
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:01,082
I must stay a virgin
until the contract ends?

110
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,960
Did you sleep with anyone
after the Dream Officetel incident?

111
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,419
-What?
-She's no joke.

112
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,801
Why must I answer that?

113
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,388
This is an invasion of privacy.

114
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,057
I'm not interested in your personal life.

115
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,143
I can only hire you as a psychic
once I confirm that.

116
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,479
What nonsense is this?

117
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,023
The harmony
between yin and yang is crucial.

118
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,984
If the psychic's yang is tainted,

119
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,444
they can't possess
a vengeful spirit with strong yin

120
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,071
and may end up dead.

121
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,739
He didn't sleep with anyone.

122
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,118
I've been by his side
ever since that incident,

123
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,244
so I can confirm that.

124
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,665
But I wasn't there
when he was with you, Ms. Hong.

125
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,458
-Did you two--
-Are you crazy?

126
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,710
Calm down.

127
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,045
So…

128
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,760
In any case…

129
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,641
Since it's been confirmed
that you're a virgin, let's seal the deal.

130
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,892
A virgin?

131
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,353
-I'm not.
-You are.

132
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,064
No, I'm not.

133
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,429
Don't say anything.

134
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,097
What? I didn't.

135
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,683
-Don't.
-What?

136
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,310
I said, don't.

137
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,854
Accommodation.
I found accommodations for us.

138
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,272
You virgin.

139
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,024
That little…

140
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,317
WE SERVE BREAKFAST AT 6:30 A.M.

141
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,319
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

142
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,320
LODGING AVAILABLE

143
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,529
50 YEARS OF TRADITION

144
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,865
DIFFERENT MENU EVERY DAY

145
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,661
Don't tell me this is it.

146
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,329
Go inside first.

147
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,548
It's easy
to keep an eye on them from here.

148
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,718
And the chef will cook
whatever we want for us.

149
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,389
Hey, this is the room. Look.

150
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,601
There's underfloor heating as well.
Nice. Hey, come take a look.

151
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,269
Ta-da!

152
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,980
Well, this looks nice.

153
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,650
But this is so not my style.

154
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,455
DAEBAK REALTY

155
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,584
Thank you for the food.

156
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,130
Enjoy.

157
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,714
Wait.

158
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,468
This is for our next month's meals.

159
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,974
We're always grateful.

160
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,308
And please let us know

161
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,353
if your new tenants do anything shady.

162
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,523
And tell us what they do
when they don't do something shady.

163
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,899
Don't worry.

164
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,906
Bye.

165
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,792
Did you inhale that?

166
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,004
How can you inhale ribs?

167
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,743
Okay. Now.

168
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,374
Yes?

169
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,503
Now?

170
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,922
Okay.

171
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,467
Darn it.

172
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,595
Gosh. That was so close.
She was almost there.

173
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,224
-Yes.
-How did it go?

174
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,850
She didn't get to see it.

175
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,519
Should we try the secretary again?

176
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,062
But it didn't work last time.

177
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,356
Lee Eun-hye must see it with her own eyes.

178
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,815
Where are you now?

179
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,068
We're checking
if a building is haunted or not.

180
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,945
I can't believe I'm doing this.

181
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,004
Why don't you just perform an exorcism?
Why do you have to check?

182
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,342
Hey, partner.

183
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,344
Ms. Hong.

184
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,557
I asked you a question.
Why won't you answer it?

185
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,808
I told you earlier.

186
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,894
To perform an exorcism,
I need the name of the vengeful spirit.

187
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,313
Listen.

188
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,191
If you need the name,
check the name on the lease.

189
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,695
Why go through this trouble?
It's a reasonable question to ask.

190
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,655
The tenant lived here without a contract

191
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,032
and paid the rent upfront in cash
for a year.

192
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,577
This tenant was never here on paper.

193
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,540
A man who lived like a ghost
died and became a spirit.

194
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,003
Didn't what I just said sound
like a line from a poem?

195
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,212
Oh In-beom.

196
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,922
-I'm a CEO.
-What?

197
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,174
Don't call me by my full name.
Call me Mr. Oh.

198
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,968
Show some respect to your partner.

199
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,011
Hey, Oh In-beom.

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,972
Unless you're going to keep quiet,
just go home.

201
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,601
Gosh. The way you talk is quite hostile.

202
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,145
No partners start off on the right foot.

203
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,188
Don't you remember what Ms. Joo said?

204
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,232
You need me, Ms. Hong.

205
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,526
This special psychic.

206
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,778
A special psychic, my foot.

207
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,406
That's a load of nonsense.

208
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,159
By the way, what did she mean
by I'm like your heat pack?

209
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,578
Why am I your heat pack?

210
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,624
I'd rather strap
a heat pack on me instead.

211
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,836
By the way,
why do you keep looking around?

212
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,257
Whenever spirits move,
they leave traces like footprints.

213
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,344
Gosh. To find out who that guy was,

214
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,555
you should go through his garbage.
Goodness.

215
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,559
He had instant rice.

216
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,062
And he also drank.

217
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,691
It looks like he drank alone
without any friends.

218
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,860
Goodness.

219
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,196
He had a lonely life.

220
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,620
Why are you looking at me?

221
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,956
Well,

222
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,791
you should be careful.

223
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,210
You might end up dying alone too.

224
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,755
Says a virgin
who doesn't even have a house.

225
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,008
It's you who might die on the streets.

226
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,260
Gosh. I'm not a virgin--

227
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,771
What was that?

228
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,603
She must be insane. What's with her?

229
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,990
Turn around.

230
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,160
Show me your face.

231
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,154
Are you okay?

232
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,911
What are you doing?

233
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,954
Let me hold your hand for a bit.

234
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,540
What's that look on your face?

235
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,874
What?

236
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,503
What look?

237
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,714
You look like you have an ulterior motive.

238
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,843
You're unbelievable.
You held my hand first.

239
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,138
I have my reasons.

240
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,599
Gosh.

241
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,435
-Of course, you do.
-It's not what you think.

242
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,646
Whatever you have in mind, that's not it.

243
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,026
I can understand.

244
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,531
You held my hand,
but you don't want to admit your feelings.

245
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,784
It's not what you think.

246
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,245
When I hold your hand,
my body temperature goes up.

247
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,499
So when you hold my hand,
your body gets hot?

248
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,750
My goodness.

249
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,128
What a bold line.
It's not embarrassing at all.

250
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,048
Let me explain again.

251
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,634
My body temperature drops
when I'm near a vengeful spirit.

252
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,096
When I first started this job,
I almost died from hypothermia.

253
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,848
So when I perform an exorcism,

254
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,350
I bundle up
and try to finish it as fast as I can.

255
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,935
But strangely, when I touch you…

256
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,647
When my body comes in contact with yours,

257
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,693
my low body temperature
comes back up pretty quickly.

258
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,198
Does that only happen with me?
Not with other psychics?

259
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,366
-Why is that?
-I don't know either.

260
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,243
Anyway, to me, you are…

261
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,204
A special psychic.

262
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,790
Let's say I believe that.

263
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,711
Forget it. Let's go.

264
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,713
I'm exhausted today.

265
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,174
Yes, Ms. Joo.

266
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,259
I saw his face.

267
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,931
DAEBAK REALTY

268
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,684
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

269
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,525
What about the art museum? Any progress?

270
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,737
I couldn't show Kwon's spirit to Lee
because she didn't come inside.

271
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,280
I need to try again today.

272
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,741
Right.

273
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,370
While I was waiting for her,
I hacked into Britium's server.

274
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,622
Recently, someone turned off
the security system

275
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,415
and entered the exhibition hall.

276
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,667
Who was it?

277
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,918
Lee Eun-hye.

278
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,129
-Lee Eun-hye?
-Yes.

279
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,507
Something didn't feel right,
so I did some digging.

280
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,551
Her insurance policy says
even if the exhibition gets delayed,

281
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,011
she makes a profit.

282
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,347
What if she staged this whole thing?

283
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:11,895
No.

284
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,983
It makes no sense to damage the museum's
reputation for some insurance money.

285
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,530
For now,
go through all the recent CCTV footage.

286
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,491
If we comb through all of it,
I'm sure we'll find something.

287
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:28,870
What?

288
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,665
We ordered hangover soup.

289
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,916
We're out

290
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,501
of cabbage leaves.

291
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,921
Then you should've told us
when we ordered.

292
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:39,923
Just eat it.

293
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,094
What is this?

294
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,387
It's super delicious.

295
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,140
It really is delicious.

296
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,395
Good shot.

297
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,982
Nice shot, Ms. Lee!

298
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,076
I haven't heard from you,

299
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,245
so I thought you were very busy.

300
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,372
But you don't skip your morning exercise.

301
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,209
Is there any reason
for me to contact you, Mr. Do?

302
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,086
Right.

303
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,382
I did receive a report
about your proposal regarding Britium.

304
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,552
I will go over it carefully
and contact you.

305
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,431
I'm just worried, especially now
that Chairman Kwon is no longer around.

306
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,107
There's a time for everything.

307
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,695
Thank you for your concern.

308
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,086
Did you find out anything
about Ms. Hong's mother?

309
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,344
There's a rumor
that she died while performing a gut rite.

310
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,098
-A gut rite?
-Yes.

311
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,600
But I don't get why she died like that.

312
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,812
Isn't it usually the possessed one
who dies from getting beaten?

313
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,823
Incense.

314
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,116
What?

315
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,327
Ms. Hong lit incense first
when preparing for an exorcism.

316
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,792
Yes, that cool-looking incense burner.

317
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,169
The smoke must cause hallucinations.

318
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,965
That must be
why I lost consciousness twice.

319
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:49,094
The hallucinating exorcist must've lost
her temper and died of a heart attack.

320
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,389
The client also must've died
from side effects of the hallucinations.

321
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,142
Ji-cheol, we need to draw up a plan.

322
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,434
A plan?

323
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,533
From the outside,

324
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,744
it looked like an ordinary realty office.

325
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,021
I know props are important
in this industry,

326
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,107
but these are just too good.

327
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,614
HANOK SAMGYETANG

328
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,949
Next group, please come in.

329
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,089
Thank you. Next.

330
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,593
This helmet…

331
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,179
What?

332
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,348
She's going back already?

333
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,649
Why isn't he picking up?

334
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,714
Right.

335
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,021
What? What's wrong with this?

336
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,399
I definitely charged it earlier.

337
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,798
Darn it.

338
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,056
The phone is turned off.
Leave a message after…

339
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,557
Why is his phone off?

340
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,481
I got scared for no reason.

341
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,945
By the way, why do I feel so chilly
whenever I come here?

342
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,334
What was that?

343
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,344
She should be more organized.

344
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,730
She has so many pairs of the same shoes.

345
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,282
What?

346
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,514
What's wrong with you?

347
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,144
You can't do this while I'm not home.

348
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,191
You can't make a mess like this, Mom!

349
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,276
-"Mom"?
-You hide after doing this?

350
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,196
I can't believe you! My God.

351
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,283
Why on earth did you take everything out?

352
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,160
I know you don't like these, Mom.

353
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,788
But each one
has its own distinctive detail.

354
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,290
Why did you mix up the pairs?

355
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,250
My gosh.

356
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:11,893
Ms. Hong!

357
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,064
Are you in? Ms. Hong!

358
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,197
Ms. Hong!

359
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,740
What is it?

360
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,950
Mr. Oh…

361
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,202
-In-beom has gone missing.
-So?

362
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,790
-I was wondering if he was here.
-He's not. Look elsewhere.

363
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,219
I love you.

364
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,687
I fell in love with you at first sight.

365
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,773
The way you talk is so sexy.

366
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,276
And I love how violent you are.

367
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,486
-Go out with me.
-Are you insane?

368
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,737
I am, right?

369
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,990
I must've gone insane.

370
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,992
Gosh, I even have a girlfriend.

371
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,910
Forget I said anything, Ji-a.

372
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,830
I mean, Ms. Hong.

373
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,707
Then…

374
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,792
Goodbye.

375
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,340
Being beautiful is so tiring.

376
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,435
Darn it!

377
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,354
You startled me.

378
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,983
You should've called
and let me know that she was home.

379
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,484
I did.

380
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,322
-Anyway, you got the burner?
-Of course I did.

381
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,866
"Of course I did."

382
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,454
Take it.

383
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,041
Don't joke around. I'm not in a good mood.

384
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,336
What is that?

385
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,130
I swear I checked it
before putting it in my bag.

386
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,507
-It was definitely the incense burner.
-Are you okay?

387
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,635
Maybe there really is a spirit.

388
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,471
-I couldn't even reach you.
-Come on. There is no such thing.

389
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,515
I can't believe this.

390
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,851
DAEBAK REALTY

391
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,287
Couldn't we have met somewhere else?

392
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,586
Welcome, Deputy Director Kwon.

393
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,507
-Isn't the view breathtaking?
-I guess.

394
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,511
Has Eun-hye given you her answer yet?

395
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,763
I offered her half the original amount.

396
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,556
It's natural for her to hesitate.

397
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,393
Isn't half a bit too harsh?

398
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:02,188
Thirty percent would be
enough to have her step down as director.

399
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:08,319
You're more of a coward
than I thought you were.

400
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,448
-What did you say?
-In a redeveloping neighborhood,

401
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,744
you'll see houses
that have red flags outside.

402
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,663
Do you know what they are?

403
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,791
They're people
who are against the redevelopment.

404
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,544
I see.

405
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,254
But,

406
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:31,175
every single one of them
eventually put down their flags.

407
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,971
What Director Lee is doing
is just like putting up a flag.

408
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,097
However,

409
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,977
that won't work against me.

410
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,278
You should relax for the time being.

411
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,456
He's the one I saw in Mullae-dong.

412
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,750
The cause of death
was a cerebral concussion.

413
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,294
But he was already
in the final stage of lung cancer.

414
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,296
And the time of death
is about a month ago.

415
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,380
What's his name?

416
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,633
They can't identify him
because his fingerprints have worn out.

417
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,552
The landlord says he was an artist.

418
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,513
-None of his paintings are…
-Where did they get that file?

419
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,515
Even I couldn't hack into the NFS.

420
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,060
-Just in case…
-I bet someone's on the take.

421
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,937
There's not much.

422
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,689
You two.

423
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,817
If you have something to say,
come here and say it.

424
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,195
Should we?

425
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,874
If you give me that file,
I could look into him.

426
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,167
Really?

427
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,753
Do it then.

428
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,049
-What should I find out first?
-His name.

429
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,931
But how will you find something
that even the police couldn't?

430
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,392
Just leave it to me.

431
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,562
Using just a shadow
caught in a photo online,

432
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,108
I found out that world stars
Jung Jae-hun and Kim Se-hui were dating

433
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,318
when no one could.

434
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,364
-Why is he so enthusiastic about this?
-It's the power of love.

435
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,119
What do you mean?

436
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes. What does she mean?

437
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,374
It's all your fault.

438
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,459
Let's end the meeting.

439
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,671
I'll go to Britium
and find his name myself.

440
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,757
See you.

441
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,720
Britium?

442
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,934
CHO HYEON-SEO'S
PRIVATE EXHIBITION

443
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,688
Weren't we working
on the Mullae-dong case? Why are we here?

444
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,107
Because it's the same vengeful spirit.

445
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,359
I don't think so.

446
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,904
Why? Because you two made up
the one here at Britium?

447
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,032
Come on. That's a bit harsh.

448
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,828
You know we couldn't even
get it started properly because of you.

449
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,386
Where did I see this?

450
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,264
Where was it again?

451
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,646
Yes! I saw it in Mullae-dong.

452
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,775
Judging by the accuracy,
the artist must've painted it there.

453
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,988
Did Cho Hyeon-seo
know the Mullae-dong painter?

454
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,657
Or…

455
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,997
Who are they to call me over
at this late hour?

456
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,751
I'm sorry. This is important.

457
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:57,089
This man right here is
the living legend of Korean art.

458
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,258
Mr. Cho Hyeon-seo, it's an honor.

459
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,801
Thank you.

460
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,434
Gosh, you have smooth hands.

461
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,313
I guess you take great care of them
since you're a great artist.

462
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,399
Ma'am, who are they?

463
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,154
This is Ms. Hong Ji-a, a realtor.

464
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,490
And as you both know,
this is Cho Hyeon-seo.

465
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,534
Please ask him.

466
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,789
What's the name of the model
in that painting of yours?

467
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:36,170
I know you're a realtor,
but you must know what self-portraits are.

468
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,630
Cho Hyeon-seo.

469
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,508
I'm talking about the real model.

470
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,472
What do you mean?

471
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,974
The real model?

472
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,893
Do you want to get sued for defamation?

473
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,693
Calm down. I'll talk to him.

474
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,911
Ms. Hong!

475
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,539
Is she crazy? It's a priceless painting!

476
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,083
She should've just beaten him.

477
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,556
You…

478
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,894
How dare you ruin my work?

479
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,981
-Do you know how much this is worth?
-I don't care.

480
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,066
Just tell me his name.

481
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,028
Tell me who really painted this piece.

482
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,572
I paint my own work.

483
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,907
I'm Cho Hyeon-seo!

484
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,535
Ask me that question one more time,
and I'll…

485
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,248
Your fingerprints would've worn out
if you finger painted for 20 years.

486
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,084
Yet you claim to have painted
all those paintings?

487
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,920
It hurts. Let go of this.

488
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,383
Tell me who this man is.

489
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,969
I don't know.

490
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,097
You just saw a spirit
in that painting, didn't you?

491
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,098
No.

492
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,018
Will you be tormented
by the spirit for the rest of your life?

493
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,479
Or will you tell me the name
and let me exorcise it?

494
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,524
Kim Byeong-ho.

495
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,247
Well, you see…

496
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,626
He was a temporary assistant of mine.

497
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,255
I didn't know that bastard had drawn it
under my painting like that.

498
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,969
I believe your assistant's painting
is the best one you've had.

499
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,473
-Ms. Lee…
-But then,

500
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,726
that painting will never
be shown to the world.

501
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,685
Right.

502
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,939
I'll take full responsibility
and take care of it.

503
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,816
Of course, you will.

504
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,695
And as for all of my paintings
in my studio,

505
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,490
I'll give them to your museum.

506
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,369
Of course,
the contract requires you to do so.

507
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,995
You must retire.

508
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:16,997
Pardon?

509
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,084
What do you mean?

510
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,840
When people find out
that you had a ghost artist,

511
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,342
the reputation of my museum
will be destroyed

512
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,344
as we've been sponsoring your work.

513
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
You are the fraud.

514
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,266
Why must my museum suffer the loss?

515
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,439
I'm the great Cho Hyeon-seo.

516
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,232
This is just a minor mishap. How--

517
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:49,447
You deceived me.
How dare you call it a minor mishap?

518
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,126
Just focus
on your special exhibition for now.

519
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,211
Afterward,

520
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,422
you will retire

521
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,842
quietly with your honor intact.

522
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,642
DIRECTOR LEE EUN-HYE

523
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,023
How dare she tell me to retire?

524
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,902
She's no more than a lowly businesswoman.
Damn her.

525
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,292
Darn it. Why isn't this working?

526
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,283
What's this? What's happening?

527
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,912
Oh, no. What's happening?

528
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:29,213
How did you know that there was
another painting behind the painting?

529
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,840
Don't tell me you could see through it.

530
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,467
What?

531
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,972
Whatever I find out on the job
is strictly confidential. That's my rule.

532
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,473
I see.

533
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,352
Just like how doctors and lawyers
keep information confidential?

534
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,146
I see. So you're a professional
like those people.

535
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,524
If you exploit the information
you found out today,

536
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,276
you might die.

537
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,445
Why do you keep making death threats?

538
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,530
Fine.

539
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,865
Okay. I won't.

540
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,577
God…

541
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,793
The ghost artist's name is Kim Byeong-ho.
Cho Hyeon-seo confessed everything.

542
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,920
Gather any evidence you can find.

543
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,672
I think we hit the jackpot.

544
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,508
Are you coming?

545
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,427
I'm coming.

546
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,223
-Did you look into it?
-Yes. I did.

547
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,059
Cho Hyeon-seo has two cell phones
under his name.

548
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,477
-Two?
-Yes.

549
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,979
So I tracked his phones.

550
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,731
He carries one with him.

551
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,733
And the other stays in only one location.

552
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,570
Yes! Hello.

553
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,322
-Take the food already.
-Okay.

554
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,241
What? We ordered soft tofu.

555
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,827
Do you know how heavy
the pots for soft tofu are?

556
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,329
My restaurant is right there.

557
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,873
Why did you make me deliver the food?
What a hassle.

558
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,207
Wait. But…

559
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,586
She didn't say anything
when we ordered it.

560
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,130
Wait a second. This smells awesome.

561
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,217
-All right. Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

562
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,512
-Here.
-Okay.

563
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,514
Nice.

564
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,268
All right.

565
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,698
So Cho Hyeon-seo has two phones
under his name?

566
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,119
One of the phones never left Mullae-dong.

567
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,956
That must be it.

568
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,959
That's the phone
the ghost artist was using.

569
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,546
Videos were automatically backed up
to the cloud from that phone.

570
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,215
VIDEOS

571
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,009
There are over a hundred videos.

572
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,640
I don't think Cho Hyeon-seo knows
these videos exist.

573
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,810
If he did, he would've already
deleted them. They're the proof.

574
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:53,065
Goodness. The ghost artist must have taken
the videos to blackmail Cho Hyeon-seo.

575
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,567
But he ended up dead
before he could do that.

576
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,404
Then I should do

577
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,573
what the late painter couldn't do for him.

578
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,162
This place is grand.

579
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,833
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

580
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,003
Nothing. Let's go inside.

581
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,237
Darn it.

582
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,325
That darned jerk.

583
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,538
Is this all?

584
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,918
You will get the remaining 113 videos
once you pay us.

585
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,599
This is odd. It seems less
than I was expecting.

586
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,559
Is it just me?

587
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,561
I'll give you

588
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,730
the rest of the money

589
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,316
once you get rid of all the spirits here.

590
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,027
I heard that you guys
get rid of spirits. Right?

591
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,491
I see.

592
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,785
That's why this place
became a melting pot of religions.

593
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,245
But that's too bad.

594
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,291
The lady you saw the other day,
Ms. Hong, handles exorcisms.

595
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,627
Then, get her here now.

596
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,337
Call her now.

597
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,756
Call Ms. Hong over now.

598
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,929
Seeing how you're going back on your word,

599
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,723
I guess you're okay
with the videos going viral.

600
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,850
Let's go, Chief Heo.

601
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:09,284
He's back again.

602
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,038
Don't go. Don't leave me.

603
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,791
Do something before you leave!

604
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:19,503
I'll give you all the money.
Please don't leave.

605
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,880
Really? I should sit down, then.

606
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,551
What are you doing? Sit down.

607
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,363
It's mine.

608
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:48,865
All of them!

609
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,118
They're all mine.

610
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,037
In-beom.

611
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,465
Hey, In-beom!

612
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,264
In-beom.

613
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,867
He's coming.

614
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:01,897
What?

615
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,030
-How are you here?
-I told you you might die.

616
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,073
What?

617
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,119
Gosh. What's going on?

618
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:31,259
Gosh. What just happened?

619
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,769
YONGIN POLICE STATION

620
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:44,022
So when you arrived,
the incident had already happened?

621
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,858
But how did you find that place?

622
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,111
My client asked me to go there.

623
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,656
-What's your client's name?
-Director Lee Eun-hye of Britium.

624
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,075
Lee Eun-hye.

625
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,202
Britium?

626
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,538
Just let her go.

627
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,580
What?

628
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,873
You can go.

629
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,292
I spoke with Britium's
legal representative already.

630
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,460
Wrap it up.

631
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,346
Wait, Ms. Hong, what about us?

632
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,556
Ms. Hong!

633
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:21,268
Don't bother. We didn't do
anything wrong, so we'll be released soon.

634
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,645
I doubt that.

635
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:29,443
-Why did you hit Cho Hyeon-seo?
-Come on. That wasn't hitting.

636
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,070
We were negotiating, nice and gentle.

637
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,574
Are you really going to keep lying
when we have evidence?

638
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,575
Evidence?

639
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,121
What is this?

640
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,751
What? When was it torn?

641
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:49,504
The woman who works there
saw it and even made a statement to us.

642
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,422
Chief Heo,

643
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,008
say something.

644
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:58,096
But I passed out,
so I don't remember anything.

645
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,183
Why are you trembling?

646
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,283
-Ji-cheol.
-Yes?

647
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,036
Earlier, when I…

648
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:31,671
I'm sorry.

649
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,217
But you were really scary earlier.

650
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,803
You were like someone else.

651
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,981
Stop him.

652
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,025
Hey, are you all right?

653
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,902
He's bleeding. Are you okay?

654
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,363
-What am I doing here?
-Are you crazy, kid?

655
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,656
Did you do this?

656
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,200
-No, it wasn't me.
-Then who was it?

657
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,202
-Look at him.
-How dare you lie to us!

658
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,663
Where are your parents?

659
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,872
You little…

660
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,958
Grandma.

661
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,266
Are you a psychic?

662
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,602
If you were born a psychic, this must've
happened often since you were little.

663
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,354
You are special.

664
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,773
Am I really a psychic?

665
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,111
I've been really possessed by spirits?

666
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,159
That's absurd.

667
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,957
My goodness.

668
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,294
I know In-beom is blinded by money,

669
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,588
but how could he go
into that dangerous place?

670
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,508
Once a fraud, always a fraud.

671
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,470
I'll kick him out
as soon as this exorcism is over.

672
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,518
What will you do
about the exorcism anyhow?

673
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,103
Did you find a way to lure it?

674
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,231
I'll lure it in with his work.

675
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,984
He is obsessed
with his own artworks, after all.

676
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,530
Then we'll have to do it
at Cho's studio or Britium.

677
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,491
Britium has taken
every single piece of art

678
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,410
that was in Cho Hyeon-seo's studio.

679
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,622
Lee Eun-hye moved fast.

680
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,625
So that just leaves Britium.

681
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,338
I'm sure Lee will never allow us
to do it where the artworks are.

682
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,881
I don't need her permission.

683
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,176
The exorcism will be performed
at the Mullae-dong studio.

684
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,513
The spirit has been unable
to leave this place.

685
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,725
It means there is another painting
hidden here somewhere.

686
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,465
Ms. Joo, I found the painting.

687
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,343
I'll take care of the rest.

688
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,812
This is Dongfang meiren.

689
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,942
It's excellent quality.

690
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,239
When I became Director of Britium,
you gave it to me as a gift.

691
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,366
To this day, it remains my favorite tea.

692
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,494
I thought you'd love it, and I was right.

693
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,833
How long has it been? Ten years?

694
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,379
I've been hearing news
from Chairman Han once in a while.

695
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,506
Chairman Han of the Masan investment firm?

696
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,345
Not only is he a VVIP of Daebak Realty,

697
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,347
but he's also our secret salesperson.

698
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:16,021
He appears to have great faith
in Ms. Hong's skills.

699
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,398
Yes, as you'll soon
see for yourself, ma'am.

700
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:25,613
Does that mean
you will take on the sale of Britium?

701
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:31,369
It is the sale of Korea's
finest art museum. Of course, we should.

702
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,246
However,

703
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,418
would you be willing
to grant us just one small favor?

704
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,463
Out. You're being released.

705
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:45,967
Get in.

706
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,595
-No.
-Thank you.

707
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,320
Wait, what about me?

708
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,740
I'm not in the car yet.

709
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,165
What are you doing?
Chief Heo didn't get in.

710
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,002
It's too dangerous for ordinary people.

711
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,006
Dangerous? Are we going
to do an exorcism right now?

712
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:29,135
I absolutely refuse.

713
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,846
Then you'll go to jail
for attempted murder.

714
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,683
Are you threatening me?
Turn the car around!

715
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,019
I'd rather go to jail.

716
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,732
You believe now, don't you?

717
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,776
That you're a psychic.

718
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,491
Please. Of course not.

719
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,994
When we signed our contract,
you didn't believe you were a psychic

720
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,704
or that vengeful spirits existed.

721
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,374
And that's why
you didn't hesitate to sign it.

722
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,042
Isn't that right?

723
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,339
That's right.
And I still don't believe it.

724
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,633
There's no such thing as ghosts.

725
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,387
Then why are you refusing to do this job?

726
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:17,225
If there are no spirits
and all my exorcisms are fake,

727
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,436
why are you suddenly
so scared to work with me?

728
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:31,633
What are you doing?

729
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,470
Hostage negotiations
to lure the vengeful spirit out.

730
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,890
Blackmail, in a way.

731
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,398
You just stand there,
and when I say so, take your necklace off.

732
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,363
If I

733
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,198
take this off…

734
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,492
I'll take care of the rest.

735
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,628
He came quickly.

736
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,226
Now. Take off the necklace.

737
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:28,606
Hurry!

738
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,277
Why are you trembling?

739
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,948
-Where are your parents?
-Where are they?

740
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:38,950
I can't do it.

741
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,160
I don't want a spirit

742
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,330
-to take over my body again.
-Hey.

743
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,171
We don't have much time.

744
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,135
You were right.

745
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,388
It's happened to me
a lot since I was little.

746
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,391
Now I know

747
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,852
that was spirit possession.

748
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,404
Do you know how many times
I woke up with bloody hands?

749
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,364
I don't want that…

750
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,618
to happen anymore.

751
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,201
Is this what you made your psychics do
to make money?

752
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,202
That's assault!

753
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,245
That's exactly why
you should've taken it off.

754
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,415
Due to that artist's memory,
I become teary-eyed all the time.

755
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,584
Ask Director Lee to return
one of his paintings.

756
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,086
He's already dead.

757
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,962
What are you doing? You're scaring me.

758
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,590
No way! I just painted
one of Cho Hyeon-seo's pictures.

759
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,633
The greatest painter of all time.

760
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,469
Oh In-beom is here to sell the painting.

761
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,262
Oh In-beom, that little…

762
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,390
-All your clients' requests are here?
-Why do you ask?

763
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,641
We're dealing with spirits here.

764
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:29,686
Does that mean neither the client
nor the exorcist is safe?

765
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,563
Mom, I'm sorry.
