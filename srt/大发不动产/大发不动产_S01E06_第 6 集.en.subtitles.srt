1
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,722
Get your necklace ready.

2
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,266
How close is he?

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,144
Take it off now.

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,776
Oh In-beom.

5
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,781
Put your necklace back on.

6
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,699
What?

7
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,621
Ms. Hong.

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:40,099
RESTRICTED AREA

9
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:46,356
WOMEN'S BATH, MEN'S BATH

10
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,736
Ms. Hong.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,168
Are you over there?

12
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,299
Ms. Hong.

13
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,137
CHEONHA SAUNA

14
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,852
Ms. Hong!

15
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,104
Wake up.

16
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,522
Wake up!

17
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,691
Hong Ji-a!

18
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,569
Hong Ji-a!

19
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,366
Are you okay?

20
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,035
Are you all right?

21
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,497
You're fine now.

22
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,806
You'll feel warm soon.

23
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,163
What happened to you?

24
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,792
The memories came into my head,

25
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,794
so I thought everything ended well.

26
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,296
It was my mistake.

27
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,591
I didn't make a visit beforehand,
so I missed another spirit.

28
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,343
And that spirit bewitched me.

29
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,011
Bewitched?

30
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,057
As in how people say they feel
as if they're bewitched by a spirit?

31
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,391
Yes.

32
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,603
When a vengeful spirit passes through me,

33
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,856
I fall into a trance against my will.

34
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,946
That must be very dangerous.

35
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,283
It won't happen again. Don't worry.

36
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,960
Did you ever want to do
anything other than this job?

37
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,898
DAEBAK REALTY

38
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,923
Mom, I got bewitched today.

39
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,886
I thought there was one vengeful spirit,
but it turned out there were two.

40
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,182
I know.

41
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,602
It's because I didn't
make a visit beforehand.

42
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,981
I'll never skip it from now on.

43
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,107
Happy now?

44
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,197
Don't worry.

45
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,116
I came back in one piece.

46
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,910
You've seen him. The conman psychic.

47
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,333
I don't know why,

48
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,586
but my temperature doesn't drop
when I'm with him.

49
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,380
So it's not as dangerous
out on the field these days.

50
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,134
Help me.

51
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,432
Mom, you know…

52
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,728
Never mind.

53
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,944
Beer tastes the best after work.

54
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,454
One double-serving of jjajangmyeon,

55
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,789
one japchae over rice,

56
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,415
and medium tangsuyuk.

57
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,459
What about you?

58
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,087
I'll take seafood jjamppong.

59
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,091
Seafood jjamppong. Okay.

60
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,429
Did you lose your appetite?
You didn't order much.

61
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,848
I was bewitched
by a spirit last night, so…

62
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,434
You were bewitched? What happened?

63
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,520
That student spirit
didn't look very violent.

64
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,021
There was another one.

65
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,442
This is exactly
why you make a preliminary visit.

66
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,487
You must've gone back to that night.
Are you okay?

67
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,239
This time, it was different.

68
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,786
Once I got bewitched, I did go back
to the night from 20 years ago,

69
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,580
but this time, there was a child.

70
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,416
Oh Seong-sik

71
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,086
came with a child.

72
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,422
What do you mean?

73
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,384
I think I remember it wrong.

74
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,931
It looks like the child he brought
that day was this nephew of his.

75
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,683
But what's weird is

76
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,811
how the child was missing
his eyes, nose, and mouth.

77
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,650
Isn't it strange that you remember
Oh's face but not the boy's face?

78
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,195
You saw it while you were bewitched,
so it may have been distorted.

79
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,074
Maybe.

80
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,123
But one thing for sure is
that I can't trust my memories anymore.

81
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,671
Why did I blindly believe
that my memories were accurate?

82
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,593
I've been thinking about it,
and there are just too many questions.

83
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:55,183
Why did my mom try
to perform an exorcism without a psychic?

84
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,809
No matter what you hear,

85
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,645
do not come downstairs. Understood?

86
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,816
And why was she
possessed by a vengeful spirit?

87
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,068
Do you remember what I taught you?

88
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,073
Stab me just as you practiced
on that teddy bear.

89
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,451
Why did I just assume

90
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:17,371
that she had fallen victim to the spirit
because it was so powerful?

91
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,130
It's rather strange
that I didn't question any of this.

92
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,468
I need to know
what exactly happened on that day.

93
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,263
Then I'll look into it.

94
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,308
You should focus
on identifying the spirit you missed.

95
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,185
That's more urgent right now.

96
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:42,855
Thank you.

97
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,821
DAEBAK REALTY

98
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:55,159
I've gathered all online posts
regarding Cheonha Building.

99
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:03,042
Someone wrote complaining comments
on every review on the rooftop bakery.

100
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,045
And the ID is Rooftop Bakery.

101
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,757
Just go to bed
if you're going to keep yawning.

102
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,928
It's because the student spirit
was sleep-deprived from gaming.

103
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,971
You know that.

104
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,931
I know, so just go to freaking bed.

105
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,141
I'm listening to everything.

106
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,311
But I can't focus because of you.

107
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,862
Check out the complaints.

108
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,533
I'm the original owner of Rooftop Bakery.

109
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,328
The once empty alleyway started
teeming with people

110
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,414
after I opened the bakery.

111
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,207
But the landlord kicked me out,

112
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,585
saying he was going
to reconstruct the building.

113
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,839
Business was flourishing, so the landlord
kicked out the tenant to keep it himself.

114
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,258
That happens all the time,
so I'm not surprised.

115
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,969
Who are the original owners?

116
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,888
They're two friends in their 30s.

117
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,807
Lee Seong-sil and Park In-suk.

118
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,228
The vengeful spirit I came across
was in her early 30s.

119
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,397
She might be one of them.

120
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,489
Those women were terrible.

121
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,160
One of them was as feisty as a gamecock.

122
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,829
It must've been tough.

123
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,331
Don't be so harsh.

124
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,790
Am I wrong?

125
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,918
Is she the one who spread
the rumor about the ghost?

126
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,004
I knew it.

127
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,132
MISSING PERSON
LEE SEONG-SIL

128
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,847
Ms. Park In-suk?

129
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,265
Yes?

130
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,558
Hello.

131
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,269
It's about Ms. Lee Seong-sil,
your former partner.

132
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,771
Did you find her?

133
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,609
TRAMP COFFEE

134
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,614
-Here.
-Thank you.

135
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,910
When Seong-sil suggested
that we open a bakery

136
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,995
in the middle of nowhere,

137
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,374
I was against it at first.

138
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,876
I didn't think it'd work.

139
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,507
Finally, we've opened our own bakery.

140
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,801
But will they come
all the way here to buy bread?

141
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,096
My friend, don't you worry.

142
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,597
It'll all work out.

143
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,938
ROOFTOP BAKERY

144
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,151
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

145
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,654
-It's freshly baked and tasty.
-I see.

146
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,447
-Hello.
-Hello.

147
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,282
Could you wait a minute?

148
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,409
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

149
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,870
-How do you like the coffee? Thank you.
-Just like Seong-sil had said,

150
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,914
our business flourished.

151
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,502
Then more and more shops
with similar themes opened up,

152
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,505
and the alley also flourished.

153
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,340
Seong-sil?

154
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,718
She tried her best
to receive funds to save this district.

155
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,137
She tried so hard.

156
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,475
She even made sure there was no garbage
or cigarette butt on the streets.

157
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,394
She really went through a lot.

158
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,728
That's what they said?

159
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,856
They hated her.

160
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,526
They badmouthed her behind her back
saying she was going overboard.

161
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,659
The other shop owners seem unhappy.

162
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,619
Let's stop trying to fix everything.

163
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,206
Hey, we need to take care of this area
in order for us to flourish.

164
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,167
It's not about having a lot of customers.

165
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,919
They need to want to keep visiting.
Don't you think so?

166
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,839
I know you're right.

167
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,258
But people don't like those
who say right things.

168
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,427
Still, someone should do the job.

169
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,390
Goodness. You must be busy
getting ready to open.

170
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,433
It's okay.

171
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,603
-How may I help you?
-I'm sorry to say this,

172
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,981
but we need to reconstruct the building.

173
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,443
It wasn't like
he wanted to raise the rent.

174
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,571
Since it was reconstruction,
we had no choice but to leave.

175
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,157
But the rent in the neighborhood
had gone up,

176
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,951
so it wasn't easy to find a new place.

177
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,872
Then we were walking past
that building one day

178
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,083
and saw they were
running our bakery as is.

179
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,961
Do you have no conscience?

180
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,130
You lied about the reconstruction!

181
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,216
I didn't lie!

182
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,427
Not everything goes as planned in life!

183
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,680
I'm going to sue you
for using our bakery name.

184
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,558
Sue? Be my guest!
Do you think that'll scare me?

185
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,606
-Get out. Leave!
-Sir.

186
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,732
How dare you push me?

187
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,901
-Dad.
-Hye-jeong, call the police.

188
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,819
Why are you causing a scene at my store?

189
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,365
He kept kicking her out,
but Seong-sil didn't give up.

190
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,700
-You think I want to come here?
-Then don't come!

191
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,662
So why did you steal my bakery?

192
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,121
That's enough.

193
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,040
Are you trying to ruin our businesses?

194
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,168
I thought we'd get some peace and quiet,
but here she goes again.

195
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,592
Seong-sil went through so much
to revive this area.

196
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,177
She felt so betrayed.

197
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,096
You're going there again today?

198
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,764
Seong-sil.

199
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,058
Let's just forget about it.

200
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,102
It's for the best.

201
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,145
I'm disgusted by those people.

202
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,313
No.

203
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,899
We need to tell them what's wrong.

204
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,652
If we don't, they'll do it again.

205
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,487
Thanks for the coffee.

206
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,664
That was the last time I saw her.

207
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,374
MISSING PERSON
LEE SEONG-SIL

208
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,334
I shouldn't have let her go by herself.

209
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,254
I should've tagged along.

210
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,633
And fought them with her.

211
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,478
Excuse me.

212
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,899
-Who's in charge of missing persons?
-Him over there.

213
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,277
-Thank you.
-Sure.

214
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,910
I have some questions
regarding a missing individual.

215
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,911
Sure.

216
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,580
A month ago…

217
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,341
Hello, sir.

218
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,551
Hello.

219
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,845
A month ago,
Ms. Lee Seong-sil went missing.

220
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,472
I'd like to hear an update on it.

221
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,225
She's not missing.

222
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,270
What do you mean?
Have you located her whereabouts?

223
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,730
No, she's just not missing.

224
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,983
She's not linked to any crimes,
so we've concluded that she ran away.

225
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,279
She went missing after going
to Cheonha Building. She didn't run away.

226
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,823
She did go there that day.

227
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,284
But the CCTV caught her
leaving after an hour.

228
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,120
She must've gone on a trip to cool off.

229
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,374
Nine times out of ten,
they eventually come back.

230
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,291
By the way,

231
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,211
why is a realtor looking for a person?

232
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,712
You're not a detective agency.

233
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,758
Wait…

234
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,218
Ma'am.

235
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,595
Ma'am!

236
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,980
This is the CCTV footage
that Park In-suk received from the police.

237
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,818
Lee Seong-sil clearly left
Cheonha Building.

238
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,904
Oh, dear.
Where could she have passed away?

239
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,781
MISSING PERSON
LEE SEONG-SIL

240
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,828
Now that we know her name and face,
let's get on with it.

241
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,333
LEE SEONG-SIL

242
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,097
The vengeful spirit's in this building.
Doesn't it mean she died here?

243
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,850
That's none of your concern.
Stop playing detective.

244
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,309
And In-beom.

245
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,145
You startled me.

246
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,356
Whatever memories you absorb tonight,
forget them right away.

247
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,484
But how can I possibly control that?

248
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,445
I really want to do it if I can.

249
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,404
Just do it.

250
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,533
What's with her?

251
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,545
Come to think of it,
I never heard a thank-you from you.

252
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,006
What are you talking about?

253
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,676
You know that I deserve it.

254
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,887
If it weren't for me,
you would've died in here

255
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,764
being bewitched by the spirit.

256
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,641
You ought to thank the man
who saved your life.

257
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,771
You never answer me
when you know I'm right.

258
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,982
-I told you that's a nasty habit--
-Thank you.

259
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,615
What?

260
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,451
Thank you.

261
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,329
I gave you what you wanted?
Still not happy?

262
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,542
It's just that I couldn't hear you well.

263
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,170
What did you say? What was that?

264
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,339
What? What did you say?

265
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,049
I know you heard me.

266
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,218
Anyway, are you
going to do that all night?

267
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,970
I'll finish it.

268
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,772
You are grateful to your psychic

269
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,492
What are you using
to lure it out this time?

270
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,452
-You.
-Pardon?

271
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,165
A psychic in the water is the best bait
for a spirit staying in the water.

272
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,876
-You want me to go in there?
-Yes.

273
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,796
-Do you know how much this suit costs?
-I don't know. Go in.

274
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,843
You thanked me without a fuss
to make me do this.

275
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,845
Gosh.

276
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,502
Take off your necklace.

277
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,404
Goodness. I don't know much about it.

278
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,865
Go talk to my husband.

279
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,284
But he won't answer my calls.

280
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,411
Gosh. Don't you know what time it is?

281
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,539
When I came during the day,
you said I was disrupting your business.

282
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,708
That's why I'm here at this hour.

283
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,501
Gosh. Whatever!

284
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,503
You can stand there all night if you want.

285
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,214
Jesus Christ.

286
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,131
Seriously.

287
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,717
You could just run
that stupid bakery somewhere else.

288
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,260
"That stupid bakery?"

289
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,682
Why did you steal
"that stupid bakery," then?

290
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,393
What did you say?

291
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,312
I know you stole it for your daughter.

292
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,398
I'll never let
your daughter run that bakery!

293
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,733
I'll do whatever it takes!

294
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,071
-How dare you!
-Watch me.

295
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,364
See if I can do it or not.

296
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,491
I'll give you a fight
if that's what you want.

297
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,494
You!

298
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,793
You'd better stay away from her!
Or I'll kill you!

299
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,628
That bakery meant everything to me!

300
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,506
You crazy wench!

301
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,300
You'll have to take the bakery
over my dead body!

302
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,597
-I will not let her run that bakery!
-How will you do that? What can you do?

303
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,015
-How?
-It's mine!

304
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,783
Die!

305
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,161
Die!

306
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,586
You're okay.

307
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,088
Everything is over.

308
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,759
Lee Seong-sil was killed…

309
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,929
by the landlord's wife.

310
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,639
She…

311
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,559
killed her right here.

312
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,736
Forget it.

313
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,447
What?

314
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,658
I told you.

315
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,998
Whatever memories you get here,
forget all of them.

316
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,295
You knew, didn't you?

317
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,300
Come out once you've calmed down.

318
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:26,363
CHEONHA SAUNA

319
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,826
DAEBAK REALTY

320
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:43,046
DAEBAK REALTY

321
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,642
You didn't go home yet?

322
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,227
I wanted to see you come back.

323
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,969
Was she murdered as we expected?

324
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,642
I suspected it since I felt her thirst
to kill when she possessed my body.

325
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,395
She was full of hatred
even until the last moment.

326
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,606
I told him to forget her memories,

327
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,900
but it won't be easy.

328
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,446
Are you worried about In-beom?

329
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,368
Of course. Who knows
what stupid things he'll do?

330
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:00,373
He only realizes his mistakes
after making them.

331
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,044
Just like you.

332
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,463
When did I do that?

333
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,424
-Should I remind you?
-No.

334
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,844
Good work today. Go home.

335
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,352
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

336
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,729
Gosh, your sideburns look cool.

337
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,065
Get me out, you scumbags!

338
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,817
-You ate so much.
-Hey!

339
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,194
Gosh.

340
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,279
-Hamburgers.
-Get me out.

341
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,239
Look at that.

342
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,698
You bastard!

343
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,742
Get me out!

344
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,454
Please don't kill me.

345
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,583
Please…

346
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,090
Please don't kill me.

347
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,570
-Are you cold?
-No, sir.

348
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,949
I'm all right.

349
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,617
Good.

350
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,830
You shouldn't complain
after doing such a sloppy job.

351
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,334
I'm sorry.

352
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,963
I'm sorry, sir!

353
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,263
Please give me one more chance.

354
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,764
That chance…

355
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,352
-Sir.
-Please.

356
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,146
-Please.
-You got your second chance.

357
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,606
-Sir.
-Please!

358
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,526
-Sir, please spare us.
-Please spare us!

359
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,779
-Sir!
-Sir!

360
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,366
-Please spare us.
-Sir!

361
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,535
-Please spare us.
-Please spare us.

362
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,996
Sir!

363
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,671
Don't.

364
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,966
Why?

365
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,427
I can at least call the police.
A woman was murdered.

366
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,263
I'll make an anonymous tip.

367
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,641
What will you say to the police?
That you heard it from her spirit?

368
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,686
-Well…
-Do you have evidence?

369
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,688
Or do you at least know where the body is?

370
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,525
Then should I just sit on my hands?

371
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,361
It's not that you won't. You can't.

372
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:38,073
But you helped the Green Villa victim.
Why did you help her then?

373
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,290
You were reminded of your mother.

374
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,459
If you find a way
just as you did that time--

375
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,004
Don't talk like you know me
when you know nothing about me.

376
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,054
So what kind of person are you?

377
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:05,600
Do you not care how people died as long as
you can get commission for selling houses?

378
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,352
-Is that who you are?
-Yes.

379
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,149
If it's that tough, feel free to quit.

380
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,320
You won't have to pay the penalty.

381
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,057
I'm not in the mood to talk.
Don't say a word.

382
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,773
You know I haven't always been like this.

383
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,650
I wasn't like this at first.

384
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,323
That man is the murderer.

385
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,076
You should use a lie detector
or whatever to find out.

386
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,037
Miss, not everyone can use
the lie detector

387
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,416
just by throwing a fit like this.

388
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,837
And you keep saying you saw something.
What in the world did you see?

389
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,172
Are you a witness?

390
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,257
No, I'm not. I…

391
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:25,346
If you keep accusing
an innocent man without evidence,

392
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,140
you'll be charged for libel.

393
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,350
You should be careful.

394
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,619
I'm the one who wants to throw everyone

395
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,330
who created those vengeful spirits
into jail.

396
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,015
Hey, Ms. Hong!

397
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,684
You were eating.

398
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,479
That looks great.

399
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,114
Enjoy.

400

SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

401
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,347
Right after Oh Seong-sik's death,

402
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,641
his mother took his nephew
to her hometown.

403
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,977
She lives there alone right now.

404
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,356
His nephew, Oh In-beom, moved out
once he graduated from high school.

405
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,149
-Oh In-beom?
-Yes.

406
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,402
CERTIFICATE OF FAMILY RELATIONS

407
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,778
OH IN-BEOM

408
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,199
Unlike you feared, I don't think
anything bad happened to the kid.

409
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,368
I looked through his medical record,

410
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,079
and there's nothing in particular
other than a simple cold.

411
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,974
DAEBAK REALTY

412
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,579
-Hey.
-Hey.

413
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,167
I looked into Oh Seong-sik's nephew
as you asked.

414
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,084
And?

415
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,337
His residence is unknown
ever since he moved out

416
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,088
after he graduated from high school.

417
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,882
It's not easy to track him down.

418
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,010
-Is that so?
-I'll keep looking for him.

419
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,345
Don't worry about it.

420
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,055
Okay. Thank you.

421
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,516
Anyway, about Oh In-beom.

422
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,937
Why don't you break the contract?

423
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,397
All of a sudden? Why?

424
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,360
I do see why you need him
since he can keep your temperature up.

425
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,781
But things have been so hectic
ever since he joined us.

426
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,284
And you're going through a lot
cleaning up the mess he makes.

427
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,662
I'm afraid he'll cause
irreparable trouble one day.

428
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,038
I feel anxious.

429
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,501
Let him be. His contract will expire soon.

430
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,754
It's a hassle. I'll never
see him again once it's over, anyway.

431
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,632
All right, then.

432
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,288
Die.

433
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,092
Another dream?

434
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,344
Yes.

435
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,451
In-beom.

436
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,545
It's so different from last time.
It's very serious.

437
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,214
What if something bad happens to him?

438
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,301
Of course, it was a vengeful spirit
of a murdered woman.

439
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,762
He'll be fine in a few days.

440
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,474
Even this morning, he swore
to kill that murderer, and his eyes were…

441
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,144
-I think he meant it.
-He won't kill anyone.

442
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,772
-Is there anything I can do to help him?
-No.

443
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,441
In-beom has to deal with it.

444
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,027
-But you must know--
-There's nothing.

445
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,573
All right.

446
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,450
Please carry on.

447
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,709
Gosh, In-beom. What a weakling.

448
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,796
CHEONHA SAUNA

449
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,386
Hello.

450
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,892
What is it?

451
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:04,977
Excuse me.

452
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,312
Yes?

453
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,730
The faucet isn't working.

454
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,357
Can you come and take a look?

455
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,442
Yes, okay.

456
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,278
One second, please.

457
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,489
Darn it, why is the faucet not working?

458
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,077
Come in and take a look.

459
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,287
Will you just leave it?

460
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,082
I'll have it fixed later. I'm sorry.

461
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,918
-What's with her?
-I apologize.

462
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,799
Hello? Listen, I'm very sorry, but…

463
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,511
Well… Could you come in
just an hour earlier?

464
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,179
I'm not feeling so well.

465
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,431
Yes, okay. Thanks.

466
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,020
Ms. Kim So-min?

467
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,775
You know who the deceased
Lee Seong-sil is, right?

468
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,530
I don't have anything to say.

469
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,077
She's missing, and I said "deceased,"
but you don't seem surprised.

470
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,622
Did you already know that?

471
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,378
I don't know what you're talking about.

472
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:16,465
How would I know
if she was dead or went missing?

473
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,559
You're too much of a coward
to go in there and fix the faucet.

474
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,813
But I guess you're brave enough
to live under the same roof with a ghost.

475
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,942
Who are you?

476
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,945
Why are you doing this?

477
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,158
I'm giving you a chance.

478
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:47,205
A chance to come clean
and ask for forgiveness.

479
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,593
Goodness.

480
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,138
I have no idea why you're doing this.

481
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,267
The police have already
checked the CCTV footage.

482
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,228
And I have no idea where she is.

483
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,940
I have nothing to do with her.

484
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,611
What a weird woman. I can't believe this.

485
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,779
Goodness.

486
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,377
In-beom, that's enough.

487
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,504
You've been watching this all day.

488
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,761
She definitely died in the tub.

489
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,517
But she walked out of the building?

490
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,900
Ji-cheol, isn't she limping?

491
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,068
What?

492
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,446
You're right.

493
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,329
This isn't her. It's the landlord's wife.

494
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,249
She wore Ms. Lee's clothes
to make her own alibi.

495
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,042
She wore a dead person's clothes?

496
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,503
What a scary woman.

497
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,297
But how will we prove it?

498
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,093
Finding her body is
the only way to prove it.

499
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,845
Ms. Hong.

500
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,309
Gosh, this place has a killer view.

501
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,352
-I'll take a photo of you. Get up.
-Sure.

502
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,230
All right. Look here.

503
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,065
Look at the camera.

504
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,026
No, let's try this angle.

505
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:43,446
Would she really have hidden
the body inside the building?

506
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,953
It's impossible for her
to dispose of the body outside on her own

507
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,913
when she doesn't have a driver's license.

508
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,999
CHEONHA SAUNA

509
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,960
Gosh, saunas are the best
when your body feels stiff.

510
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,420
But her husband has a car.

511
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,380
They could've done it together.

512
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,966
This place has a nice sauna.

513
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:11,307
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

514
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,282
Is she the one who spread
the rumor about the ghost?

515
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,910
I knew it.

516
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:33,913
No.

517
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,332
The landlord didn't even know
that she was dead.

518
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,709
He could've played dumb.

519
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,337
If An Chang-seop knew,

520
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,881
he wouldn't have asked me
to perform an exorcism.

521
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,510
Since they continued to run
the sauna and the bakery,

522
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,261
she couldn't have hidden her there.

523
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,265
If a body was stored indoors for a month,

524
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,310
it would've reeked.
She would've gotten caught.

525
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,728
Then where could it be?

526
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,442
-Here.
-Why?

527
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,528
Do you see a spiritual trace or something?

528
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,656
You saw something that night, didn't you?

529
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,742
Only this material is different.
She recently blocked this area.

530
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,702
You're right. It looks new.

531
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,622
What? It was a guess.

532
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,376
It's not a guess.
It was a logical deduction.

533
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,795
Don't get close.

534
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,256
Cheonha Building's basement?
Yes, I constructed it.

535
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,550
Why do you ask?

536
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:33,389
Did you happen to see
what was underneath the stairs?

537
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,182
Underneath the stairs?

538
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,519
There was nothing.

539
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,232
There were clothes and blankets.
Just a bunch of garbage.

540
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,483
Garbage?

541
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,237
So you want me to block this?

542
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,530
Yes.

543
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,243
I understand.
Throwing garbage away also costs money.

544
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,872
Let's see.

545
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,374
It's 430mm.

546
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,751
Do many people do that?

547
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,337
Not many, but some do it.

548
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,383
They're blocking it off anyway.
And it costs money to get rid of garbage.

549
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,970
Garbage…

550
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,606
We're ready.

551
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,526
Do people really get fooled
by such lousy tricks?

552
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,945
Lousy?

553
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,492
CHEONHA SAUNA

554
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,286
My gosh! Go away!

555
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,581
Do you still think it's lousy?

556
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,920
Sir!

557
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,964
-A ghost.
-Are you okay?

558
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,300
-No!
-Sir!

559
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,469
-Look at me.
-Okay.

560
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,221
It's okay.

561
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,972
Let's go inside.

562
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,643
-It's okay. Follow me.
-No.

563
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,316
CHEONHA SAUNA

564
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,944
I saw it.

565
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,947
It was the student ghost.

566
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,323
I knew it.

567
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,783
You knew it?

568
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,785
The exorcism is not done yet?

569
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,913
I apologize.
We actually came because of it.

570
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,456
I'm sorry you had to see it.

571
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,250
You must've been startled.

572
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,543
So what is it?

573
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,219
Wait. What is it?

574
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,111
What is that?

575
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,575
We looked into it and
found out that the student had a lover.

576
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:02,288
On the day of his death,
he lost his promise ring here.

577
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:06,041
We believe he's still lingering here
because he's obsessed with the ring.

578
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:06,959
A ring?

579
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,794
Why would it be here?

580
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,297
That night…

581
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,856
My heart is broken.

582
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:38,282
SAUNA, RED CLAY SAUNA
BASEMENT LEVEL 1

583
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,994
Didn't you block this off after his death?

584
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:45,080
You're right. It's been a month.

585
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,374
I knew it.

586
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,252
Then what should we do?

587
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,174
We just need to find that ring.

588
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,343
-We need to tear down this wall.
-What?

589
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,804
Come on. He can't tear down
a perfectly fine wall.

590
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,767
Or he can just let the vengeful spirit
haunt him until the day he dies.

591
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,976
Come on.

592
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,938
What should I do?

593
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,816
CHEONHA SAUNA

594
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,695
I'll begin, then.

595
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,116
Goodness. Wait.

596
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,953
-What are you doing?
-Honey.

597
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,874
No. Stop this at once! I mean…

598
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,418
Who gave you permission to do this?

599
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,003
He said…

600
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,838
Calm down. I'll explain.

601
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,049
Forget it! Stop this.

602
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:38,884
Stop it right now!

603
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,511
What's going on?

604
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,638
Honey, listen to me.

605
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:46,058
A ring that belonged
to the deceased student is in there.

606
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,602
That's why his spirit still lingers.

607
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,814
Are you a fool?
Do you actually believe that?

608
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,482
I saw him myself.

609
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,859
And they're paying for everything.

610
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,153
They'll block it up again after.

611
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,657
Why else would they waste money on it
when there's only garbage in there?

612
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,617
Because there's something else in there!

613
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,500
There's something else in there?

614
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,961
Is it something you want to hide?

615
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,045
Perhaps,

616
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,256
a body?

617
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,758
What on earth are you talking about?

618
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,077
What? You said the body was here.

619
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,080
-You said it was a logical deduction.
-Shut it.

620
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,919
Honey, what's wrong?

621
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,925
I'm so sorry.

622
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,928
No. I…

623
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,597
I didn't do it on purpose.

624
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,393
Don't come near me.

625
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,853
Don't come near me.

626
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,023
What's wrong?

627
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,740
I didn't do it on purpose.

628
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,044
How did you know
that the victim's body was there?

629
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,004
Gosh. How would I possibly know that?

630
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,341
I went there to find
the dead college guy's ring.

631
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,219
Then, did you break the wall
to find the ring, Ms. Hong?

632
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,305
By nature, I must follow through
when I start something.

633
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,350
I was just trying to help him
as a way to work out.

634
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,319
If you're done questioning her,
I'll take her with me.

635
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,238
It's not over yet.

636
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,908
Why are you keeping her here for hours?

637
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,493
Why?

638
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,412
She's not a murder suspect.

639
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,872
Must you intimidate her
while questioning her?

640
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,425
I've been to the station more
than when I used to scam people.

641
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,552
And who do you think
is responsible for that?

642
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,013
Chief Heo!

643
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,518
Why did you help him?

644
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,522
You even lied and made them
believe it was haunted.

645
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,484
You know the side effect
of being possessed by a spirit

646
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,902
who was brutally murdered.

647
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,656
A series of nightmares
where you always die

648
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,534
and the vivid fear and rage.

649
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,496
I was supposed to be going through that.

650
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,501
So in the end, you did it for him.

651
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,131
I knew that given his personality,
he'd do something for sure.

652
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,760
I couldn't let him fail. I didn't want him
to experience what I went through.

653
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,848
But you left me out.

654
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,892
I'm quite hurt.

655
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,146
No. About that…

656
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,066
I felt like I was bothering you
too much lately.

657
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,445
I am very hurt.

658
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,656
Ms. Joo.

659
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:12,991
Ms. Joo.

660
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:25,087
By the way, what did the landlord's wife
see to get that scared?

661
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,675
Is it possible for a vengeful spirit
to show up even after an exorcism?

662
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:33,720
I don't know why she acted like that,
but there was no vengeful spirit.

663
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,098
In other words, we got lucky this time.

664
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,935
Our teamwork was perfect,
and the universe was on our side.

665
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:45,107
No. There's no guarantee
that we'll get lucky every time.

666
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,567
Next time, don't be rash.

667
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,195
Rash? Gosh. Don't put it like that.

668
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,657
It seems you are getting along better now.

669
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,035
Right? We make a good team.

670
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,747
But Ms. Hong will not admit that.

671
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,790
Don't exaggerate.

672
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,877
Our late-night food is here.

673
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,008
Why are we having bread? Thanks, anyway.

674
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,635
In-beom made it.

675
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,011
What? I did?

676
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,972
Yes. Don't you remember?

677
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,640
Well, you probably don't.

678
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,518
You made the dough in the morning,
fermented it, and baked it.

679
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,811
But you didn't clean up.

680
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,021
So the lady scolded me for the mess.

681
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,732
Because it was too much.

682
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,484
That's all right.
I understand it was the side effect.

683
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,485
I'm used to it now.

684
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,821
Ms. Hong, try some. It's really good.

685
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:33,905
No.

686
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,747
Did you know?

687
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,666
In the States, when people put
their houses up for sale,

688
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,252
they bake bread around the time
for the open house.

689
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,378
Why?

690
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,050
When people smell bread,
they feel at ease and comfortable.

691
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,845
I see.
It's a psychological marketing trick.

692
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,724
When people go to the open house,

693
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:04,060
they think the house feels cozy
thanks to the smell of the bread.

694
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,604
So they're likely to buy it.

695
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,117
It's not bad.

696
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,289
Hello.

697
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,166
What brings you here?

698
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,293
I wanted to thank you.

699
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,420
I didn't know you were coming.

700
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,716
You should keep eating the bread.

701
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,343
Let's talk outside.

702
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,013
Eat up.

703
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,306
Hey.

704
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,194
Did you eat dinner, my baby?

705
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,988
I'm having bread.

706
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,994
Thank you.

707
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,996
It's all thanks to you.

708
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,790
Gosh. I only did my job.

709
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,333
And…

710
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,921
this isn't much, but it's a reward.

711
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:16,174
Gosh. You could have wired
the money to me.

712
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,970
No. Thanks to you,
we were able to have a funeral for her.

713
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,889
I wanted to give you the money in person.

714
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,391
Goodbye.

715
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,893
-Okay. Good luck.
-Thank you.

716
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,322
You startled me.

717
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,366
I knew it. You're still a fraud.

718
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,120
You were after the money, weren't you?

719
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,123
Ms. Hong, rewards aren't money.

720
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,959
An expression of one's gratitude.
A way to deliver it.

721
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,420
If I turn it down,
it'll hurt their feelings.

722
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,423
As if you care about their feelings.
Come here.

723
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,884
I'll kill you once I catch you. Hey!

724
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,887
No. Wait. Hold on!

725
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,806
I'm sorry.

726
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,077
Is she still begging to thin air?

727
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,456
Maybe the victim's spirit
is following her?

728
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,291
You punk.

729
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,502
A cop is talking about spirits.
Good for you.

730
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:39,633
The murderer is just hallucinating
because she's guilty.

731
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,052
Many turn themselves in because of that.

732
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,678
Got it?

733
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,516
By the way, how did the realtors know

734
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,478
exactly where the body was
and tear down the wall?

735
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,776
-That puzzles me the most too.
-I'm telling you. It's the spirit.

736
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,987
-It's not a regular agency.
-Okay.

737
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,115
I heard that they perform exorcisms
to get rid of spirits.

738
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,495
Are you kidding me? Get back to work.

739
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,082
DAEBAK REALTY

740
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,542
A real estate agency
that gets rid of spirits?

741
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,753
Ms. Joo Hwa-jeong.

742
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,716
So you became a professional fraud.

743
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,096

00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:28,807
DECLINED

746
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:32,852
RECORD OF EXORCISM

747
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,497
This year, yellow is the new black.
It's more than just a pretty bag.

748
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,624
It will come in handy
when you carry this bag.

749
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,377
The buckle on the front
definitely stands out.

750
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,295
But Choi Ji-won is alive!

751
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,923
Ms. Hong!

752
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,217
So what kind of person are you?

753
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,221
Do you not care how people died as long as
you can get commission for selling houses?

754
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,305
Is that who you are?

755
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,016
-This is so wide.
-Yes.

756
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,809
Since this is nice…

757
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,526
Mom.

758
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,697
When he works, he reminds me of you.

759
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,703
He doesn't give up and recklessly
throws himself at the case.

760
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,456
How could he do that?

761
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,752
The more I do this job,

762
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,921
the more I loathe people's greed,
hatred, and resentment.

763
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,090
I'm so sick of it.

764
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,846
That's why I've been turning
a blind eye to it.

765
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,352
But how did you do what you did?

766
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:02,275
How were you able to not give up
on these people?

767
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,703
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

768
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,584
All right! This is the way
to let off the steam.

769
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,795
This is it.

770
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,839
I've been too mean to myself lately.

771
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,175

Ms. Hong.

776
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,274
Hey! Do you know how much this suit costs?

777
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,651
Let me go right now!

778
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,236
Darn it.

779
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,405
You cheap jerks.

780
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,199
-He never changes.
-Untie me!

781
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,201
I'll kill you all once I get down.

782
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,911
Let me go now!

783
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,667
Please let me go already. God damn it.

784
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,793
Just for a moment.

785
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,462
My gosh.

REAL ESTATE SALES AGREEMENT

787
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,554
Ms. Hong, you're really something.
You made me come all the way here.

788
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,600
That's the sales contract
for Daebak Realty. Sign it.

789
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,354
No.

790
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,741
Hey, wait!

791
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,826
Let's talk it out. We can talk this out!

792
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,042
That's enough. You might kill him.

793
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,923
-That hurts.
-You don't care if he dies?

794
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,676
I think you're the one who'll die.

795
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,727
Those eyes.
I still love that look in your eyes.

796
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,732
-Go make a hole in his tummy.
-Yes, sir.

797
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,735
Please don't kill me. Please!

798
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,529
I'll… I'll give you money.

799
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,697
-Stay still!
-Please spare my life.

800
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,741
-I can't aim right.
-I'll give you money!

801
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,347
What's your deal?

802
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,018
You promised you'd give us
an apartment unit.

803
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,186
What?

804
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,690
I set the place on fire

805
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,192
and killed people.

806
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,073
Give me the apartment.

807
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,243
The apartment.

808
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,332
It's cold. Or is it just me?

809
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,875
How dare you take the necklace off?

810
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,087
I thought you were invincible,
but you're pretty sloppy.

811
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,172
I don't know when,
but I'm apparently possessed.

812
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,591
No matter how horrible it is,
I'd want to know the truth.

813
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,386
At times, the truth can torment you.

814
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,679
Oh Seong-sik?

815
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,389
My uncle isn't such a horrendous criminal.

816
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,348
Something is wrong.

817
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,518
I want to see the case file
from that night 20 years ago.

818
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,561
What was she like? Your mother, Ms. Hong.

819
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,314
She died helping out people
who didn't deserve it.

820
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,358
I'll never forgive them.

821
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:39,779
