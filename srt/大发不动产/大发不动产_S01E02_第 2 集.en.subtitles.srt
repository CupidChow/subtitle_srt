1
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,587
Ms. Hong! It's me.

2
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,380
Where did Yang U-jin go?

3
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:03,938
Hey, Fraud.

4
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,399
Are you a psychic?

5
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,245
It's all over now.

6
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,455
It's time to leave.

7
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,290
No.

8
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,584
Please…

9
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,674
TO MY FATHER, FROM U-JIN

10
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,842
What was that?

11
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,802
What did I

12
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,554
just see?

13
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,063
What did you just say?

14
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,732
Did you see something?

15
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,358
What?

16
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,736
You said you saw something.

17
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,742
Ms. Hong, help me.

18
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,256
Are you this patient's guardian?

19
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,884
No, she's the perpetrator.

20
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,844
I see.

21
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,014
Just stop by the admin desk
before you leave.

22
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,474
I see. Thank you.

23
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,314
Mr. Oh, we need to talk.

24
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,692
I don't have anything
to talk to you about.

25
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,611
Just pay for my treatment.

26
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,199
I did everything they asked for,
so it's not on me.

27
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,742
-Okay?
-Of course.

28
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,162
Ms. Hong, all there's left to do
is sell the building, right?

29
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,580
Yes.

30
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,623
How's Hyeong-sik?

31
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,668
Thankfully, he only needs
to wear a cast for six weeks.

32
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,381
Anyway, who are you
and why were you at the scene?

33
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,717
I'm a researcher at Stanford University--

34
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,552
He's a lead shaman.

35
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,221
My wife called him.

36
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,307
I see, a lead shaman.

37
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,483
No, I'm a doctor.

38
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,155
Gosh, when are they coming out?

39
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,415
Oh In-beom.

40
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,672
-Did you just call my name?
-Let me ask you one thing.

41
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,260
When you came to on the roof,
you said you saw something.

42
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,219
What did you see?

43
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,763
What was that?

44
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,432
What did I

45
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,101
just see?

46
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,354
What are you talking about?

47
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,940
You keep asking if I saw something.
Should I have?

48
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,280
When I exorcise spirits,
part of their memories come into me.

49
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,575
The regrets, obsessions,
and things they couldn't let go of

50
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,909
right up until their death.

51
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,704
-Just a moment. Out of the way!
-That's why…

52
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,207
-Hurry!
-Will he be okay?

53
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,752
But this time,
such memories didn't come into me.

54
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,671
They went into you, didn't they?

55
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,256
Memories? What are you talking…

56
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,189
TO MY FATHER, FROM U-JIN

57
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry, Dad.

58
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,134
I have no idea what you're talking about.

59
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,054
Do you want me to explain again?

60
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,223
Usually, when I exorcise spirits…

61
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,600
Stop it, I get it.

62
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,353
But I didn't see anything.

63
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,023
-You really didn't?
-Believe me or not, I don't care.

64
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,694
Right.

65
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,325
It's my turn now.

66
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,202
Earlier…

67
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,998
This is so embarrassing to say out loud.

68
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,254
You did something to me earlier,
didn't you?

69
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,383
I remember pulling
that big guy up with you,

70
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,178
but when I came to,
that guy had a broken leg,

71
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,347
and I was on the ground.

72
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,642
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

73
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,937
Wow, you're looking down on me.

74
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,440
I didn't want to brag about this,

75
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,484
but I was even accepted
to Seoul National University.

76
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,736
So don't worry I might not understand,

77
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,989
and just explain why my memories are gone.

78
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,952
Because you're a psychic.

79
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,872
What? A psychic?

80
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,958
That's what we call people
easily possessed by spirits.

81
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,297
I exorcise a spirit
by trapping it inside a psychic

82
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,008
and sending it up there.
Yesterday, you were my psychic.

83
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,217
That's all.

84
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,018
I was wondering what kind of excuse
you'd come up with.

85
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,270
-But this is absurd.
-You really are a psychic.

86
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,399
A psychic can't remember what happened
while possessed. That's the proof.

87
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,363
That's enough.

88
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,741
I'm not a psychic or anything like that.

89
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,244
You should stop lying to yourself.

90
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,746
If you were born a psychic,

91
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,081
this must've happened often
since you were little.

92
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,334
Why do you pretend it hasn't?

93
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,216
Whatever.

94
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,093
Let's never see each other again.

95
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,829
What were you two talking about
for so long?

96
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,998
I have no idea.

97
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,168
I had a bad feeling about that woman
from the start. She's insane.

98
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,254
Gosh, that stings.

99
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,259
What? My necklace.

100
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,969
It's gone.

101
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054
Your necklace?
The one your uncle gave you?

102
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,847
Search carefully. Check your pockets.

103
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,353
Ji-cheol. Turn the car around.

104
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,605
-Hurry!
-Okay.

105
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,956
I'm sure I dropped it
somewhere around here.

106
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,165
In-beom, I found it.

107
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,083
Really?

108
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,382
Is it there?

109
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,726
It's totally smashed.

110
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,394
Maybe the ambulance ran over it.

111
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,688
Damn it!

112
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,690
That woman is just bad luck!

113

00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,371

Fourth floor.

This is 50 pyeong.

117
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,179
As you can see, it gets a lot of sunlight.

118
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:43,100
If you decide to rent this,
you can open your store whenever you want.

119
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,436
As you can see,
this place gets a lot of sunlight.

120
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,063
There's great energy here as well.

121
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,191
This building is conveniently located too…

122
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,068
I have a really good feeling about it.

123
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,028

How did it go?

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,933

She refuses to sell the place.

147
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,273
She doesn't want any money.

148
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,024
So?

00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,527

What will you do?

00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,739
I think we saw something there.

152
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,826
Perhaps, a spirit.

153
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,119
A spirit?

154
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,580
Well, the boys said they saw one.

I hate people saying stuff about spirits

158
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,399
more than parasites
who try to leech off of you.

159
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,359
They're just too weak.

160
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,072
You're right, sir.

Oh, dear.

179
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,913

Then why is he on your mind?

183
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,343
Come to think of it,

184
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,263
I even took off my coat that night.

185
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,312
I never take it off
during an exorcism because of hypothermia.

186
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,899
And I never put it back on
because I didn't feel cold.

187
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,905
So you're saying that the fraud
absorbed the spirit's memories

188
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,450
-and raised your body temperature as well?
-Yes, but I'm not completely sure.

189
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,244
Could a psychic be that powerful?

190
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,038
If he is that powerful,

191
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,918
I can't help but think
he could help my mom leave this world.

192
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,756
I should've just dragged him here.

193
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,426
I'll ask a cop that I know.

194
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,595
Since he's a fraud, he must have a prior.

195
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,138
His name's Oh In-beom, right?

196
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,599
No.

197
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,185
I should've beat him up
and brought him here.

198
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,282
RECORD OF EXORCISM

199
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,452
HONG MI-JIN

200
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,631
RECORD OF EXORCISM

201
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,897
Instant coffee is the best.

202
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,946
Have you eaten dinner yet, my dear baby?

203
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,160
What are you thinking about?

204
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,664
Didn't you say the drip coffee
tastes best when it's still hot?

205
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,296
It doesn't feel right.

206
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,716
The coffee?

207
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,891
I'm also drinking drip coffee right now.

208
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,894
I'll brew some for you next time.

209
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,939
When I exorcise spirits,
part of their memories come into me.

210
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,859
The regrets, obsessions,
and things they couldn't let go of

211
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,235
right up until their death.

212
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,488
They went into you, didn't they?

213
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,717
TO MY FATHER, FROM U-JIN

214
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,487
I'm sorry, Dad.

215
00:17:58,827 --> 00:17:59,661
What is it?

216
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,413
I'm at the building right now.

217
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:02,998
What?

218
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,043
I'll burn this building down,

219
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,421
and then I'll kill myself.

220
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,091
Yeong… Nam Yeong-do.

221
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,272
What?

222
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,066
Where am I?

223
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,328
Ji-cheol.

224
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Ji-cheol…

225
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,480
TO MY FATHER, FROM U-JIN

226
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,991
What? It…

227
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,868
It wasn't a dream?

228
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,444
You heartless brat.

229
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,497
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES
FROM DO HAK-SEONG

230
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,180
You heartless brat.

231
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,618
Where are we?

232
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,954
-Ji-cheol.
-Yes?

233
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,582
If a family member commits suicide…

234
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,500
Yes?

235
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,545
Do you know what happens
to the rest of the family?

236
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,799
That came out of nowhere.

237
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,177
Why do you ask?
Did you dream about your uncle?

238
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,725
Whatever.

239
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,769
Why should I care?

240
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,537
PERSONAL INFORMATION ON OH IN-BEOM

241
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,458
As you can see, I found two ex-convicts
under the name of Oh In-beom.

242
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,210
But they're too old or too young.

243
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,753
The age doesn't match.

244
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,174
They'll look into reports
regarding shamanic scams.

245
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,010
So we'll see.

246
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,556
I shouldn't have
let him go that day. Gosh.

247
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,725
Please stop drinking.

248
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,851
What do you mean?

249
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,104
SOJU

250
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,942
Damn this habit of the vengeful spirit.

251
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,071
Last time, you were a chain smoker.

252
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,573
This time, you're an alcoholic.

253
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,700
I'll book a checkup for you.

254
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,646
I think I know where Oh In-beom is.

255
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,647
How?

256
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,194
When you absorb a spirit's memories,
you get its habits too.

257
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,032
I'll be able to find him if I check
places where Yang U-jin would go.

258
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,204
Don't drive. Take a cab.

259
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,705
Okay?

260
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,097
Gosh.

261
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,473
Here again?

262
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,824
-Why is that woman here?
-Who is it?

263
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,874
You are Yang U-jin's father, right?

264
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,711
Didn't a strange man come to you
and do weird things recently?

265
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,715
A strange man?

266
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,261
Someone who looks like a sly fraud.

267
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,931
He might have behaved
just like your late son.

268
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,724
Like sitting in your yard.

269
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,395
Did you lend money to U-jin too?

270
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,355
Pardon?

271
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,608
If that's why you are here,
you wasted your time.

272
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,946
I don't know how much money you lent him,
but I don't have the means to pay it back.

273
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,031
And he broke my heart

274
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,242
when he took his own life.

275
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,374
So please, just go back.

276
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,917
I'm sorry.

277
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,378
Wait.

278
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,177
Your son…

279
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,804
didn't commit suicide.

280
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,200
Is it wrong to want to live like others?

281
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,826
While my friends

282
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,414
studied without worrying
about their tuition in college,

283
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,082
I did three part-time jobs.

284
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,669
Had you given me
as much as the other parents did…

285
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,757
Darn it.

286
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,312
And throw out those glasses
and buy a new pair.

287
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,942
I'll make a lot of money
and buy you an expensive pair.

288
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,957
TO MY FATHER, FROM U-JIN

289
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,731
Dad, this is U-jin.

290
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,193
I'm writing to you
because I'm too ashamed to face you.

291
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,321
I wanted to make you proud of me.

292
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,491
I am sorry that I disappointed you.

293
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,578
I didn't mean it
when I talked back to you.

294
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,623
Living like other people…

295
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,791
Hey, hurry up!

296
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,628
Not worrying about money
when choosing what to eat

297
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,714
-Come here.
-or when meeting my friends…

298
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,966
I would be lying if I didn't want that.

299
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,260
But I never resented you.

300
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,597
-Hey. Didn't you eat?
-Dad.

301
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,808
I'm going to start over.

302
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,146
Trust me and give me one more chance.

303
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,275
I'll come see you
on your birthday this year.

304
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:53,653
Let's go and have pork ribs,
your favorite.

305
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,177
Your son…

306
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,804
didn't commit suicide.

307
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,266
I'm sorry.

308
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,864
You scared me!

309
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,741
I got you.

310
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,287
You said you didn't absorb his memories.
Then what are you doing here?

311
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,624
Who are you?

312
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,876
Hey.

313
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,255
Hey. Oh In-beom, wait.

314
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,007
Hey, let's talk. Hey!

315
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,180
Hey!

316
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,182
Why is she following me?

317
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,060
I need to talk to you.
Get out of the van. Hey!

318
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,693
Hey! Get over here!

319
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,930
-What?
-What's wrong?

320
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:44,889
Another nightmare?

321
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,146
What? Isn't that Ms. Hong?

322
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,898
-Why is she chasing us?
-I don't know. She's a headache.

323
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,569
Hey, what's up with her?

324
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,988
Why won't she stop?

325
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,031
-Look at her eyes.
-Pipe down a second.

326
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:02,949
Hey!

327
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,556
We're good, right?

328
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,350
But In-beom, why did she do that?

329
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,186
I don't know. What's with her?

330
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,637
Did you lose him?

331
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,722
I almost had him.

332
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,478
No need to worry. He's a fraud exorcist.

333
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,606
We're bound to meet sooner or later.

334
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,817
He'll be either sued or arrested.

335
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:23,154
I hope he doesn't go clean
and stop with his scams.

336
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,280
Darn it!

337
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,765
OPEN TEMPLE FREE OFFERINGS EVENT

338
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,399
Thank you for the food.

339
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,322
There's not much to temple food,
but it's so tasty.

340
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,866
Maybe because it's all natural?

341
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,951
It's just because you're hungry.

342
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,619
We climbed all the way here.

343
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,746
-Of course, it tastes good.
-Is that so?

344
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,874
Lee Eun-hye.

345
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,168
Director of Britium,
the biggest private art museum in Korea.

346
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,213
They had a new construction
planned in Yongin.

347
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,633
But it's not going well
because of rumors of a spirit appearing.

348
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,266
Why would such educated people
believe in spirits?

349
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:36,603
Of course, people like us
are grateful if they do.

350
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,147
Rumor around the Stock Street has it

351
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,900
that Lee poisoned her husband to death.

352
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,652
Her husband was in a coma
for a whole week,

353
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,280
but she didn't show up
at the hospital even once.

354
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,741
Publicly, she said it was

355
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,577
because she was preparing
for an exhibit by a famous artist.

356
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,540
So that's why there's a rumor that
the gallery is haunted by Kwon Mu-jin.

357
00:31:58,541 --> 00:31:59,918
That's right.

358
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,186
But do you think
Lee even believes in spirits?

359
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,773
She will when her husband's spirit appears
right in front of her.

360
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,067
We're great at making them look real.

361
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,152
That's true.

362
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,865
But if that still doesn't work,
there is a plan B.

363
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:35,495
Honestly, I think
this one might be more effective.

364
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,249
So Kwon Mu-jin's wife is the director.

365
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,752
A sibling from a different mother,

366
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,922
a nephew, and a cousin.

367
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,883
They are all executives at Britium.

368
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,885
I'm sure the rumor of the spirit was

369
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,222
fabricated by Kwon,
the sibling from a different mother.

370
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,391
Why? Because
if an important exhibit is ruined

371
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,893
and causes significant damage to Britium,

372
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,728
Lee's position will be endangered.

373
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,773
And Kwon will have
a shot at becoming the director.

374
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,192
And then what?

375
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,111
If we can find evidence

376
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,613
that Kwon started
those rumors of the spirit,

377
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,409
we can use that to blackmail him
or hand it over to Lee.

378
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,995
Either way, we win the lotto.

379
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,788
Nice one, In-beom.

380
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,792
-Would you marry me?
-I really don't want to.

381
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,794
Don't ever leave me.

382
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,088
-Really.
-We'll hit the jackpot.

383
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,304
This used to be a factory,

384
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,390
but it doesn't smell at all.

385
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,851
See how big the windows are?

386
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,687
There's great ventilation,
and it gets a lot of light.

387
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,191
Plus, it's a quiet neighborhood,
so it's perfect for a workplace.

388
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,861
What do you do again?

389
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,279
We're designers.

390
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,449
This place would be perfect!

391
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,661
This is the bathroom on the first floor.

392
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:07,754
The second floor
is being used by an artist.

393
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,214
That artist loves this building so much

394
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,633
that they've been using it
for several years now.

395
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,928
What's wrong?

396
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,931
Wasn't someone there just now?

397
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:19,974
What?

398
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,399
What's this smell?

399
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,821
What's wrong?

400
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,410
What did he see?

401
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,789
Excuse me, I'm the landlord.

402
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,333
My gosh, the smell…

403
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:51,839
Goodness.

404
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,324
How did it go?

405
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,575
It's a wandering spirit.

406
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,495
A wandering spirit?
That died away from home?

407
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,997
But he died inside his house.

408
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,208
He probably didn't consider
this place as home.

409
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:36,837
Or maybe a wandering spirit
that died somewhere else settled here.

410
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,676
I think I'll find a lead
once I follow him.

411
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,521
Yes, check that once more.

412
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,190
Isn't this better?

413
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,361
-Please hurry with the lights.
-Yes, ma'am.

414
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,838
It's done.

415
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,264
Checked. The cameras are working fine.

416
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,182
Let's wrap it up.

417
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,100
Okay.

418
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,777
Goodbye.

419
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,197
Goodbye.

420
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,116
Wait.

421
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,703
Yes?

422
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,664
Please turn off the ceiling lights
before you go.

423
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,583
Sure.

424
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,425
I swear I saw
Mr. Kwon's spirit downstairs.

425
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,844
What are you talking about? I'll go check.

426
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,180
EXHIBIT HALL 4

427
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,061
I'm leaving now.

428
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,109
Why aren't the lights turning on?

429
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,261
Good work.

430
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,541
Did you check?

431
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,585
It disappeared into the museum,

432
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,505
but I'll have to come back
during the day to confirm.

433
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,180
Let's see.

434
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,892
Nice.

435
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,816
You startled me.

436
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,782
What? What is it?
Don't come out. Go back inside.

437
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,325
This isn't new.

438
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,118
I bought it on sale last year.

439
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,913
Unbelievable.

440
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,791
She always knows when I buy new clothes.

441
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,754
New sweatsuit?

442
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,382
New shoes as well?

443
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,800
They're not new.

444
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,178
At least take the price tag off.

445
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,815
You know wandering spirits
are hard to track and locate.

446
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,233
I needed activewear.

447
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,901
I never asked.

448
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,029
After all, you bought them
with your own money.

449
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,240
Exactly.

450
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,992
I'll be off.

451
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,286
See you later.

452
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,407
Oh In-beom.

453
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,826
Who are you?

454
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,063
What was that for?

455
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,484
Don't come out of there
until I say it's all right.

456
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,236
I need you, so I can't let
anything happen to you.

457
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,990
How dare you keep trying to scam a fraud?

458
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,787
What was that?

459
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,041
I couldn't see his face because of you!

460
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,341
What a feisty way
of expressing your gratitude.

461
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,678
What?

462
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,597
Come on.

463
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:28,183
Gosh.

464
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,276
Excuse me.

465
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,611
Excuse me!

466
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,615
Do you know

467
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,368
that you look like a pervert right now?

468
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,671
Gosh.

469
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,883
Check the pieces.

470
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,053
-Who are you?
-This isn't good.

471
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,598
I'm Hong Ji-a from Daebak Realty.

472
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,310
Ms. Hong Ji-a?

473
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,858
I'll give you the chance to explain
yourself before we check the CCTV.

474
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,695
You won't find anything
on the CCTV footage anyway.

475
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:25,824
When a vengeful spirit is around,
most electrical devices malfunction.

476
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,494
"A vengeful spirit"?

477
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,078
Are you talking about ghosts?

478
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,748
Let me explain.

479
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,043
I hate to break it to you,

480
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,379
but there's a vengeful spirit
full of resent in this building.

481
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,174
You're an exorcist?

482
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,346
Ghost Story Cleaner is a start-up company

483
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,683
that uses electromagnetic waves
to push vengeful spirits away.

484
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,393
-Are you with him?
-No.

485
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,610
Excuse me.

486
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,572
-Oh In-beom speaking.
-It is your real number.

487
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,037
Please leave.

488
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,876
Call me if you change your mind.

489
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,254
And be careful of this woman.

490
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,340
She's very violent.
And I don't think she's sane.

491
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,761
I'll show myself out.

492
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,600
Ms. Hong.

493
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,354
I'd like to talk to you
about selling this Britium building.

494
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,400
Ms. Hong, I'll wait for you outside.

495
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,318
Explain it to her well for me.

496
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,425
Right after my husband's funeral,

497
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:11,221
a rumor that my art museum is haunted
started to spread.

498
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,185
And a rumor
that I poisoned my husband too.

499
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,523
Did you murder your husband?

500
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,617
You are straightforward, just as I heard.

501
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,831
You know Chairman Han
of Masan Venture Capital, right?

502
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,169
He told me that you handled
the sale of the building

503
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,129
that had given him headaches.

504
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,299
I'm sure you saw it on the news.

505
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,344
My art museum, Britium,
will move to a bigger place.

506
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,014
I already bought the land
for the new location.

507
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,683
The negotiation to sell this building
was in place.

508
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,479
But I was offered a ridiculous price
because of the rumor.

509
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,900
If this is about the sale of the building,

510
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,486
I'm sorry, I'm working on another case.

511
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:11,406
And I ended up here while chasing
the vengeful spirit of that case.

512
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,827
A vengeful spirit, is it?

513
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,290
You don't believe me.

514
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,211
If so, why are you asking me for my help?

515
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:30,425
Because the most important job for me
as the director

516
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,094
is finding the best solution

517
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,972
that can keep our image intact
and minimize our monetary losses.

518
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,151
Deputy Director Kwon is here.

519
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:58,495
Unless the client
must believe in exorcisms,

520
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,998
please call me as soon as you are done
with your current case.

521
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,334
Call me directly.

522
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,017
Hey, hurry up.

523
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,895
Hey, that's crooked.
Level it properly. Okay?

524
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,274
Hey, let's get the angle right.

525
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,775
That's it.

526
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,909
Look at this mess, Eun-hye.

527
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,580
There was a minor commotion. It's nothing.

528
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,332
It's nothing?

529
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,336
You are the director.
But obviously, you don't act like one.

530
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,257
So even tabloids think
they can belittle us and get away with it.

531
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,177
It's disgraceful.

532
00:50:56,595 --> 00:51:00,640
Responding to such tabloids
would even more disgraceful.

533
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,018
Is that so?

534
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,147
I wonder if the board will agree with you.

535
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,567
Rumors that you poisoned my brother
and that the museum is haunted…

536
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,568
Gosh.

537
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,823
Will they reappoint you as the director
when you're the subject of the rumors?

538
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,543
You ran into her here again?
Are you guys ill-fated or something?

539
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,295
What do we do? Should we give up?

540
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,713
Why would we give up?

541
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,799
We can't let her steal two cases in a row.

542
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,302
Hey, she's coming. Bye.

543
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,269
What should I say?

544
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,231
I'm sure he'll turn me down firmly again.

545
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,691
Gosh. What should I say?

546
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,820
She'll really beat me up
if I don't sound sincere.

547
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,866
"Not being intimidated
by the mighty Lee Eun-hye."

548
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,117
"That was so cool."

549
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,912
No.

550
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,706
If I crawl right away, it won't look cool.

551
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,376
"Be my psychic just once."

552
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,837
That sounded so selfish.

553
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,092
"You can't steal two of my cases
I worked very hard on."

554
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,760
"Let me have this one."

555
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,180
As if. She would never.

556
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:27,477
Why am I racking my brains for this?
He's a fraud. He'd say yes to money.

557
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,105
Right. Not looking cool
isn't important right now.

558
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,815
Money is.

559
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,155
-We…
-Let's do a case together.

560
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,119
-No, I…
-I don't mean, permanently.

561
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,829
Just one case. That's it.

562
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,211
Hold on.

563
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,840
This is great!

564
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,762
Let's do that then.

565
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,515
We keep running into each other.

566
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,767
So we must be destined to cross paths.

567
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,660
I'm on my way
to Ms. Hong's place right now.

568
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,539
No way. She must be interested in you.

569
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,708
Or why would she bring you to her house?

570
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,463
I'm not going to her house.
I'm going to her office.

571
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,256
She says she needs to test something.

572
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,717
That's an excuse.

573
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,470
She lives alone
on the second floor of that building.

574
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,730
Gosh.

575
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,281
I see.

576
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,908
What?

577
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:06,701
Nothing.

578
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,165
I saved her life earlier.

579
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,959
That must have been it.

580
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,252
Even I thought I was pretty amazing.

581
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,838
When did you save her life?

582
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,591
When there was a commotion
in the gallery earlier.

583
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,346
A commotion in the gallery?
What do you mean? When?

584
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,418
So this is how it looks inside.

585
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,586
It's just a regular office.

586
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,519
What is it?

587
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,063
Nothing.

588
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,107
Go to the second floor.

589
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,027
-What's up there?
-My room.

590
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,488
She's making it too obvious.

591
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,869
If this is about work, let's talk here.

592
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,455
Go upstairs. That's the test.

593
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:44,758
Are you okay?

594
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,303
What do you mean?

595
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,140
Is your heart beating fast?

596
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,267
Are you experiencing shortness of breath?

597
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,894
Or do you feel dizzy?

598
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,272
I'm not climbing Mount Everest.

599
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,107
Why would I be out of breath for this?

600
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,610
I might not look like it,
but I work out regularly.

601
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,112
As long as you're okay, keep going up.

602
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,753
He really climbed all the way up.

603
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,351
Why is it so dark in here?
Are you allergic to sunlight?

604
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,396
Gosh, it's cold in here.

605
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,777
What's that?

606
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,989
Stay right there until I tell you
it's okay to move.

607
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,793
Isn't this what you did
at Dream Officetel the other night?

608
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,920
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

609
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,090
The smoke from this burner
calls a vengeful spirit.

610
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,592
I see. A vengeful spirit.

611
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,394
I bet it does.

612
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,150
It's my mother.

613
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,612
She's quite beautiful.

614
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,115
She passed away 20 years ago.

615
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,790
Mom!

616
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,811
And she's here now.

617
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,899
She's been haunting this house
for 20 years.

618
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,235
Oh, I see.

619
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,197
So she's a delusional mental, not a fraud?

620
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,453
The one exorcism I asked you to do with me

621
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,331
is for my mother.

622
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:26,252
I think there has been a misunderstanding.

623
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,172
I only came thinking
we were going to work on Britium.

624
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,590
I'll give you 10 million won.

625
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,342
-Money's not the problem.
-20 million.

626
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,221
Last time,

627
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,598
you had a strong-looking man
working with you.

628
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,058
Why are you asking me?

629
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:45,271
My mom's a special case, so she can't
be exorcised by an ordinary psychic.

630
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,648
Then what about me?

631
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,276
You are special.

632
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,658
HONG MI-JIN

633
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,972
Step out of the circle.

634
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,775
Should I just run away now?

635
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,402
Now.

636
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,530
No, if I just humor her properly,

637
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,116
I'll get 20 million
and the Britium job to boot.

638
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,325
I'll give it a go.

639
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,552
Mom?

640
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,152
In-beom?

641
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,626
In-beom.

642
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,753
In-beom!

643
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,768
Help me.

644
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,562
I'm sorry…

645
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:50,897
Die.

646
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,900
Die!

647
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,735
You should die too!

648
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,655
Uncle.

649
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,085
Are you okay?

650
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,756
Isn't that something you use
when your heart stops?

651
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,841
Did I

652
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,260
die just now?

653
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,930
I prepared this in case of emergency,

654
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,974
-but thankfully, your heart didn't stop.
-Thankfully?

655
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,061
Are you saying that I was supposed
to die, but thankfully didn't?

656
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,611
Why…

657
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,864
Why is Ms. Hong's mother in my memories?

658
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,908
Why was she doing that

659
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,702
to my uncle?

660
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,497
I'm sorry.

661
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,583
I thought it would work with you.

662
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,508
Take this.

663
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,517
-This is…
-If you wear it,

664
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,186
you won't be possessed by most spirits.

665
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,690
It's like a bulletproof vest,
so never take it off.

666
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,234
Never…

667
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,571
take this off.

668
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,573
Do you understand?

669
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,121
What? What's happening?

670
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:32,957
I'll pay you what I promised,
so don't worry.

671
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,094
Your mother…

672
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,931
You said she died 20 years ago, right?

673
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:53,853
How did she

674
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,688
pass away?

675
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,657
She died because of me.

676
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,749
You should go now. I'm tired.

677
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,807
Spare me.

678
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,851
I'm sorry…

679
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,316
Twenty years ago,
my uncle and I came here.

680
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,943
Something happened then.

681
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,448
There's no way
our Seong-sik committed suicide.

682
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,827
Did my uncle really commit suicide?

683
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,832
You said I was special earlier.

684
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,013
Why don't you team up

685
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,266
with this special psychic?

686
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,193
I said I would never work with a fraud.

687
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,279
No partners start off on the right foot.

688
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:11,782
Ms. Hong, you need me.
You need this special psychic.

689
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,701
We need a psychic right now.

690
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:14,952
You said he even helps get
your temperature up.

691
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,663
-Staying pure?
-They didn't sleep together.

692
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,998
Why does Ms. Hong have
the same one as your uncle?

693
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,000
That's what I'm trying to find out.

694
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,920
What the relationship
between Daebak Realty and my uncle was.

695
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:27,340
On the outside, it looks just like
a regular realty office.

696
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,342
-Ji-cheol, let's form a plan.
-A plan?

697
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,553
Writer Cho Yeon-seo
and the artist of Mullae-dong?

698
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,931
You believe now, right?
That you're a psychic.

699
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,433
So being possessed by spirits
was real after all.
