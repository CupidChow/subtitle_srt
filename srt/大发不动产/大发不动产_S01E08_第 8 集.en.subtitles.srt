1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,923
-Wake up.
-That's my sister!

2
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,092
-What on earth is going on?
-Move aside!

3
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,803
-Where are you taking them?
-What happened her?

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,723
-My goodness.
-You can't be here. Leave at once.

5
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,724
Get over there.

6
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,442
What in the world did you see?
Snap out of it.

7
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,610
That…

8
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,782
In March of the Year of the Black Horse,

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,452
laborers building the fortress walls
suddenly died from plague.

10
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,998
Those who survived claimed
they saw a man without a face.

11
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,300
In February
of the Year of the Black Rooster,

12
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,805
three days after a rumor spread
that the faceless man appeared in Hanyang,

13
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,140
a fire broke out
from the southern part of Hanyang

14
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,936
and engulfed the entire city,
burning down over 2,000 houses.

15
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,248
In February of
the Year of the White Dragon,

16
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,501
hailstones the size of an egg
fell over Gyeongsang Province,

17
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,169
freezing and withering the crops.

18
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,924
And the farmers claimed
to have seen a faceless woman.

19
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,350
These are records
that say big disasters broke out

20
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,477
after faceless people were seen.

21
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,479
It happened in other eras too.

22
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,730
Faceless people?

23
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,107
Egg ghosts.

24
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,861
You'll see an explanation of them
in the Encyclopedia of Unrested Spirits.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,830
"Egg ghosts are created
through an entanglement of spirits

26
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,542
who die on the same day and time
from wars, epidemics, or big fires."

27
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,378
"They have no eyes, nose, or mouth."

28
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,171
"When this ghost appears,

29
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,924
many people fall ill or die."

30
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,303
The kid Oh Seong-sik brought
also didn't have a face.

31
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:02,098
The spirits who died from the fire
he'd set must've become an egg ghost

32
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,266
and possessed that kid.

33
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,393
But it says right here

34
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,396
that it can't be exorcised
with a spiritual needle.

35
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,773
That's what concerns me.

36
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm sure my mom knew
that her needle wouldn't work.

37
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,823
But she definitely used it that day.

38
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,076
I need to know
what she was meaning to do then.

39
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,830
But that doesn't change the fact
that you need a strong psychic

40
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,875
to put to rest
a vengeful spirit of an exorcist.

41
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:33,004
Oh In-beom was a strong enough psychic,
but it didn't work.

42
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,424
Maybe it's not a matter of psychic.

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,930
Just as I've been sure
of my incorrect memories for 20 years,

44
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,224
I may be missing something here.

45
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,438
In any case, the egg ghost is
the only lead I have at this point.

46
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,903
By the way,

47
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:03,243
what have you been looking for?
You're being very distractive.

48
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,622
I've been looking
through the Records of Exorcism to see

49
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,166
if any of my ancestors
have exorcised an egg ghost.

50
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,753
But only the record from 1979 is missing.

51
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,298
Really?

52
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,054
No one but me would touch
the Record of Exorcism.

53
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,144
Well, I guess there's one more.

54
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,236
OPENING HOURS
FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE

55
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,491
So in total, four laptops
and two tablet PCs

56
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,619
are missing
from your room and car, correct?

57
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,998
Yes, I think that's about it.

58
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,542
I'll give you a call
when we find something.

59
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,586
But there are no CCTVs around here,
so it won't be easy.

60
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,258
Were you worried about us?

61
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,885
-It's nothing--
-Did you go through my bookshelf?

62
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,220
What?

63
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,890
One of my grandmother's
Records of Exorcism is gone.

64
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,101
Did you take it?

65
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,356
You're treating me like a thief now?

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,692
Did a thief break into your place too?

67
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,861
What's a Record of Exorcism?
Is that expensive?

68
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,696
If you didn't, forget it.

69
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,283
Wait. You can't just leave like this.

70
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,618
Hey, what's a Record of Exorcism?

71
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,536
Tell me!

72
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,041
Shouldn't you apologize for suspecting me
without reasonable grounds?

73
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,417
I do have them.

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,920
Have you forgotten I caught you
snooping around my bookshelf?

75
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,299
Why would you bring that up?
You never forget anything.

76
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,301
Ms. Hong, I'm off now.

77
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,511
Okay. See you in the evening.

78
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,429
See you.

79
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,770
What is this Record of Exorcism?

80
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,856
They're exorcism records
written by an exorcist.

81
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,358
I see. Like a workbook.

82
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,822
Ever since the Joseon Era?
It's like your family trade.

83
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,074
It is.

84
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,284
But it'll end with me.

85
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,202
Why?

86
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,747
This isn't something worth passing down.

87
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,417
You have to absorb strangers' memories

88
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,421
only to feel
their sadness, hatred, and regret.

89
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,590
With time,
you start hating humans in general.

90
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,513
You start to forget your own emotions.

91
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,349
In the end, you lose your entire life.

92
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,435
Don't worry.

93
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,646
You're not

94
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,941
a character
that can't be forgotten so easily.

95
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,280
-Is it empty?
-Should we break in?

96
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,198
Who are you?

97
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,699
Hello, ma'am.

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,787
Oh In-beom lives here, right?
We're his friends.

99
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,622
Hello.

100
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,792
-Search there too.
-What on earth are you doing?

101
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,211
Get out! Get out this instant!

102
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,588
Stop bothering me!

103
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,843
We searched through the houses of
Oh's grandmother and everyone around him,

104
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,553
but found no memorandum.

105
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,012
Are you sure?

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,143
Seeing how he's been visiting
those who knew his uncle,

107
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,603
I don't think he knows anything for sure.

108
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,608
You promised you'd give us
an apartment unit.

109
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,777
-What?
-I set the place on fire

110
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,071
and killed people.

111
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,406
No.

112
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,076
Judging by what he said,
he must know about it.

113
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,787
I'm sure of it.

114
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,042
CEREMONY FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF GOLDEN APARTMENT

115
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,711
What was that?

116
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,098
Should I eat something before I go to bed?

117
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,314
What was that?

118
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,360
Did I hit someone?

119
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,457
Was I mistaken?

120
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,502
Gosh, that startled me.

121
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,927
It scared the hell out of me.

122
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,559
What's wrong with this?

123
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,786
Rumors about a child ghost
have been going around since last month.

124
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,664
It's not uncommon
for ghosts to appear in accident spots.

125
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,917
Then have you two
also seen this child ghost?

126
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,627
No, we haven't.

127
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,380
Then why are you suddenly
putting your house up for sale?

128
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,297
It's Byeol.

129
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,425
Sorry?

130
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,512
The child ghost people have been seeing

131
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,847
is Byeol, our daughter.

132
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,808
She refuses

133
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,436
to leave this world
because it's too unfair for her.

134
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,858
It's all because her murderer
hasn't been punished.

135
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,443
How could he be so brazen?

136
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,905
He keeps lying
and says it wasn't his fault.

137
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,491
Honey.

138
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,953
To be frank,

139
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,831
I've never believed in ghosts.

140
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,541
But,

141
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,088
after hearing our poor kid
was wandering this world,

142
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,299
how could I ignore it?

143
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,094
So we asked around
and decided to come to you.

144
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,307
Please help my daughter

145
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,559
find peace.

146
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,894
I beg you.

147
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,939
Nothing's certain just yet.

148
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,817
There might be really her vengeful spirit.

149
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,821
But people might've made up
the story for fun or seen things.

150
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,035
If it turns out
that there is no vengeful spirit,

151
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,579
we won't sell your house for you.

152
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,213
I will start the briefing.

153
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
RENDEZVOUS PARK APARTMENT

154
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,969
Rumors about a vengeful spirit
appearing around the complex

155
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,932
started a month ago, after a car accident
took place in the complex.

156
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,519
The victim was Eun Byeol, a ten-year-old.

157
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,396
She lived in Block 108.

158
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,315
She got hit by another resident's car

159
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,901
on her way home
from her friend's in Block 109.

160
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,028
Goodness. Poor girl.

161
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,073
The driver claims that he's innocent.

162
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,910
You murderer. Bring my daughter back!

163
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,244
Stop it already!

164
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,706
How many times must I tell you?
I didn't kill her!

165
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,084
She was already on the ground!

166
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,503
It was too dark to see anything!

167
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,297
-Come on, now.
-Bring her back!

168
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,799
What about the CCTV?

169
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,094
They were putting up fences
inside the complex,

170
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,638
so the street lamps and the CCTV
were all turned off.

171
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,847
"Putting up fences"?

172
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,517
Is it normal to put up fences
inside apartment complexes?

173
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,311
This is a social-mix complex

174
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,941
where normal residents
and public rental residents live together.

175
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:38,406
Some of the apartments were allotted
to low-income families for rent

176
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,449
when they were originally built.

177
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,245
Families from different financial statuses
were mixed together,

178
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,955
thus the term "social-mix."

179
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,084
Just putting them together
won't help them become closer.

180
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,546
That's why the two groups had a conflict.

181
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,425
The normal residents put up fences
to keep themselves divided

182
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,928
while the public rental residents
were against it.

183
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,140
Then which group was Byeol in?

184
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,267
The normal residents.

185
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,686
You can't just block a pathway like that!

186
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,271
What about our kids?

187
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,606
They'll have to
take a detour to go to school.

188
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,276
Please stop yelling.

189
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,903
This is right for our kids' safety.

190
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,823
Strangers come and go here.
It's not safe for them.

191
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,325
Are you calling us strangers?

192
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,245
Why won't you answer me?

193
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,248
We're all residents of this complex,
so let's not fight.

194
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,792
We may live in the same complex,
but we're different.

195
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,462
What did you just say?

196
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,338
Don't touch me! How uncivil of you!

197
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,383
I looked into the rumors.

198
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,511
The most popular ghost stories
on online community sites for mothers

199
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,724
and ghost story sites were about drivers
who died of cardiac arrest

200
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,809
at the sudden appearance of a child ghost

201
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,978
or because it covered the driver's eyes…

202
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,897
Child spirits aren't evil.

203
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,524
No victims from that area
were hurt or passed away.

204
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,279
Ghost stories and facts
don't go hand in hand.

205
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,073
Continue.

206
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,950
Anyway,

207
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,369
similar accidents keep happening,

208
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,581
so vehicles are
not allowed in the complex now.

209
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,460
To be precise,
only delivery vans are not allowed.

210
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,838
They weren't even caused by delivery vans.

211
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,175
-They're just abusing their power.
-That has nothing to do with us.

212
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,843
We'll end the briefing here.

213
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,094
Okay.

214
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,972
Will you visit the scene today?

215
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,641
Yes.

216
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,518
I should.

217
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,562
I shouldn't skip it.

218
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,694
What?

219
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,988
Can you even drive in that?

220
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,740
-Shut it.
-You look cute, that's all.

221
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,116
Shut up.

222
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,244
Gosh.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,170
See? I knew it. You can't do it.

224
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,923
You do it for me.

225
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,968
Gosh.

226
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:05,928
You can't do it?

227
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,558
They decided not to allow unauthorized
vehicles to enter at the resident meeting.

228
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,142
Don't get mad at me.

229
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,062
How am I to carry
all these packages inside by myself?

230
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,899
In any case, your vehicle's
not allowed to enter. It's written here.

231
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,796
I knew it.
This is exactly why I hate kids.

232
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,256
They have no pattern.

233
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,674
You can do it, Ji-a.

234
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,053
Do you know
that your theme today is very odd?

235
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,514
Child spirits just don't stay put.

236
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,600
They go everywhere.

237
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,228
So it's more difficult to identify them.
And my body temperature drops faster.

238
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,898
What's there to worry about?
Your special psychic is here.

239
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,358
Stop rambling. You're distracting me.

240
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,819
Have you forgotten
that I saved your life twice--

241
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,075
It's here.

242
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,309
Darn it.

243
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,125
What's going on?

244
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,951
She's such a good runner.

245
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,229
Hold my hand.

246
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,232
That's what I'm here for.

247
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,619
Don't move.

248
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,915
The child spirit is right behind you.

249
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,093
Why aren't you doing anything?

250
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,345
-Did she leave?
-Wait.

251
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,307
I didn't see her face yet.

252
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,853
What are you two doing here?

253
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,067
They are my guests, sir.

254
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,944
Oh, they are here for you?

255
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,823
I got a complaint about a stranger
going around the complex.

256
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,034
-I'm sorry about that.
-Have a good night.

257
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,454
Mom.

258
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,768
Did you see it?

259
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,940
Is it my daughter, Byeol?

260
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,651
Yes.

261
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,653
It's Byeol.

262
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,906
Ma'am.

263
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
Are you feeling better now?

264
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,679
It's all my fault.

265
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,849
Ma'am.

266
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,269
I should've tried harder
and moved to a better apartment.

267
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,982
I wish we hadn't moved here…

268
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:16,530
Since I checked the face, my secretary
will be in touch to schedule the exorcism.

269
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,577
Ms. Hong. When you perform the exorcism,

270
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,745
can I be there with you?

271
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,582
No. It's dangerous
to have an outsider present.

272
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,585
I don't want her to be alone
when she leaves this world.

273
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,212
Please let me be there for her.

274
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,255
Let's go.

275
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,443
Don't say anything.

276
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,822
-You don't know what I'm going to say.
-Just keep your mouth shut.

277
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,492
Don't even sigh.

278
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,704
What?

279
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,707
It's a green light now.

280
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,365
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

281
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,009
What?

282
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,011
You…

283
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:08,850
My gosh.

284
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,231
Don't worry. He'll leave soon.

285
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,277
Did God finally punish you?
You look like a mess.

286
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,133
Thanks.

287
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,640
What happened?

288
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,813
Do Hak-seong tossed me out

289
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,398
because I couldn't take care of

290
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,108
Daebak Realty.

291
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,408
He kicked me out of my nightclub.

292
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,953
-No. I can't leave!
-My gosh. Goodness.

293
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,581
Hey!

294
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,207
Oh In-beom.

295
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,669
What? Don't sound so serious.

296
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,671
Let me ask you one thing.

297
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,423
What I saw that day…

298
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,677
Did you use the same trick you used
when you scammed me

299
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,555
at my nightclub?

300
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,974
What you saw that day?

301
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,397
That wasn't a real ghost,

302
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,316
right?

303
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,991
It was a real ghost.

304
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,659
I'm sure you heard

305
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,454
that Ms. Hong's late mother's spirit
still lives here.

306
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,875
Is that so?

307
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,961
I see.

308
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,717
Use this opportunity
to quit bullying people.

309
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,302
Live an honest life.

310
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,890
-Oh In-beom.
-Don't hold my hand. It's creepy.

311
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,851
Do you think I can work…

312
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,979
for Daebak Realty?

313
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,942
Gosh. You're a lunatic.

314
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,902
To be in that line of business,

315
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,530
I'm sure they'd need someone strong.

316
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,864
Ms. Hong is strong.

317
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,076
And if you were her, would you hire you?

318
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,455
Darn it. Ms. Hong is stronger than me.

319
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,499
And she can fight better than me.

320
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,546
Hey, you owe me 350 million won. Remember?

321
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,423
-I'll forget about it.
-Unbelievable.

322
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,135
I don't owe you any money to begin with.

323
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,555
And I earned the 50 million
by doing the exorcism.

324
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,640
I really don't have anywhere to go.

325
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,517
Hey, look at this.

326
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,727
Do Hak-seong abandoned me.

327
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,521
He's a scary guy.

328
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,190
He really might kill me.

329
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,986
I'm really sorry it happened to you.

330
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,283
But you're on your own.

331
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,883
Since you're here anyway, eat it.

332
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,301
And don't ever come back.

333
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,312
Slow down.

334
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,773
Hey, In-beom. My baby sent me a present…

335
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,283
-My gosh.
-Are you sure her photo is real?

336
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,579
You two have never met in person,
and she sent you a birthday present?

337
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,456
She's real. My girlfriend is real.

338
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,458
We're meeting next week.

339
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,959
-Really?
-Yes.

340
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,671
That will be your first date.

341
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,385
It's underwear.

342
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,721
Read it.

343
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,267
"Thank you as always, honey.
Happy birthday."

344
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,439
My gosh. Let me see.

345
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,570
Wow, look how classy these are.

346
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,823
-Don't you think my baby has great taste?
-Yes. They do look special.

347
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,244
Here. That's for you.

348
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,538
But this is your birthday gift
from your girlfriend.

349
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,499
-She told me to share with you.
-With me?

350
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,002
-Why?
-Because my baby is that sweet.

351
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:46,962
Anyway,

352
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,757
giving underwear
as a gift is quite special, right?

353
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,884
Yes, sure.

354
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,846
Giving underwear to a man.

355
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,682
I have to think hard now.

356
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,977
What kind of a special present
should I get her?

357
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,436
Congrats.

358
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,318
DAEBAK REALTY

359
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,737
Hello.

360
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,364
Is this it?

361
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,700
This is it. This is the address.

362
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,619
-Is this really it?
-Yes.

363
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,788
It doesn't look too great.

364
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,749
Look at this. "From sunset to sunrise?"

365
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,002
-Are they open or not?
-What's going on?

366
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,337
-Hello?
-Excuse us.

367
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,338
Hello.

368
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,716
-My gosh.
-She was in.

369
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,217
-Come later.
-Let's go inside.

370
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,802
-Later, my foot.
-Let's go inside.

371
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,220
-Let's go.
-Hey, I said…

372
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,146
-You tell her.
-No, you talk to her.

373
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,731
Hye-jeong's mother?

374
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,074
Byeol's family
put their house up for sale, right?

375
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,660
I hear they're selling it urgently.
Is it true?

376
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,539
Our residents promised
to not drop the price

377
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,583
below 10 million per square meter,

378
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,335
so please keep that in mind.

379
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,753
I didn't promise anything.

380
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,968
Our residents made this promise
for everyone who lives there.

381
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,304
If one family sells it at a cheaper price,

382
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,723
the price for our entire complex
will go down.

383
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,185
It's to protect
our property rights together.

384
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,354
-But price fixing is illegal.
-Illegal…

385
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,690
We aren't fixing the price.

386
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,318
It's our community banding together.

387
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,864
Byeol's mother knows that very well too.

388
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,117
But she's emotional right now
and making a mistake.

389
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,663
You know very well why she's leaving.

390
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,625
But all you care about is money.
You call that banding together?

391
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:59,636
We're more heartbroken than anybody
about what happened to that family.

392
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,264
However, that doesn't mean
we should all suffer a loss.

393
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,475
A loss…

394
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,772
Please leave.

395
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,441
I need to get some rest.

396
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,116
Well, I think
we've made ourselves clear enough.

397
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,367
Let's go.

398
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,871
Unbelievable.

399
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,756
The problem with tonight's operation
is that it'll be held outdoors,

400
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,633
just like the time at the hospital.

401
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,302
Incense burns much faster outdoors,

402
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,098
so it'll become very problematic
if we get even a little stalled.

403
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,017
So don't you get distracted
or do anything else.

404
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,437
I never do anything else.

405
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,730
Whatever.

406
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,607
I already talked to a security guard

407
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,694
who works the night shift
to keep as many people away as possible.

408
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,363
-"Talked?"
-She bribed him.

409
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,448
I see.

410
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,075
EUN BYEOL

411
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,956
You really won't tell her mother?

412
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,126
I told you not to get distracted
or do anything else.

413
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,713
I mean, she's a little kid.
You should do it with the mother…

414
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,257
Do you think we're holding
an open class for exorcism?

415
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
Are we letting parents in now?

416
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,472
I just thought I'd mention it.
I knew you'd say no.

417
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,183
All of her memories will flow
into me afterward,

418
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,101
so I just want her to leave in peace.

419
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,461
Oh In-beom. You did it again.

420
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,629
It wasn't me.

421
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,845
Ms. Hong, I beg you.

422
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,889
Please let me see her one last time.

423
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,935
I can't do that.

424
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,772
It's impossible for you to see
her vengeful spirit anyway.

425
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,856
I don't mind.

426
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,400
Just let me be there with her
as she leaves this world.

427
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,494
Please do this and help me save myself.

428
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,997
Please, I beg you.

429
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,541
Please.

430
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,377
Please.

431
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,130
Ma'am, please stand up.

432
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,513
You cannot see her.

433
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,599
But it might be possible

434
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,852
for you to hear her voice.

435
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,645
I can't guarantee that though.

436
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,939
Are you all right with that?

437
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,697
That's more than enough. Thank you.

438
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,615
Thank you so much.

439
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,327
But you must promise me one thing.

440
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,711
You have to cover your eyes with this

441
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,130
and stay in this circle.

442
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,173
No matter what you hear,

443
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,218
you can't come out of the circle
or take it off.

444
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,262
Okay.

445
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,601
Let's get started.

446
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,442
We won't need that soccer ball.

447
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,569
Her mother is here.

448
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,297
Mom!

449
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:05,840
Mom!

450
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,137
Mom!

451
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,032
It's time. Take it off.

452
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,800
Mom.

453
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,972
Byeol?

454
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,600
Mom!

455
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,435
Byeol.

456
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,156
Byeol, is that you?

457
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,830
Byeol!

458
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,296
Byeol.

459
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,758
Mom, I'm sorry.

460
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,427
No.

461
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,138
I should be sorry.

462
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:39,100
I'll make sure I catch that man

463
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,560
who did that to you.

464
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:45,231
I lied when I told you
I went to the English academy,

465
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,858
and played with Yu-ri.

466
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,154
-Mom!
-Byeol.

467
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,949
-Hello.
-Hi, are you Byeol's friend?

468
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,243
Yes, Yu-ri lives in this complex too.

469
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,288
-Really? Which block?
-Block 109.

470
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,457
I see, Block 109.

471
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,086
Okay. Goodbye.

472
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,925
Why are your clothes dirty?
Where did you play?

473
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,093
What?

474
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,386
Let's go.

475
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,266
You'll be in fourth grade
next year, right?

476
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,520
You'll fall behind
if you only play soccer.

477
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,316
Yu-ri's mom told her that she could play
soccer as much as she wanted.

478
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,902
That's why she's the best player
in our class.

479
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,321
That's why they live in the rental block.

480
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,363
What about it?

481
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,034
Only the poor live there.

482
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,912
If you don't study,
you'll end up living there too.

483
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,163
Is that what you want?

484
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,084
If you don't know what I mean,
just do as I say.

485
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,252
I'm only doing this for your sake.

486
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,671
-Okay?
-Okay.

487
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,132
Goodness. My princess.

488
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,931
-Hello.
-I'm glad we ran into you.

489
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,182
Where are you headed?

490
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,725
Residents from the rental block

491
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,144
are causing a scene
at the fence construction site.

492
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,230
-Let's go together.
-Really?

493
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,606
I should go as well.

494
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,942
I'll see you later.

495
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,361
Make sure to come home
right after the academy.

496
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,654
Dad's buying macarons.

497
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,823
-Yes!
-She's adorable.

498
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,794
I'm so late. Mom's going to kill me.

499
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,382
I need to hurry.

500
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,596
I'm late. I should hurry.

501
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,940
You weren't hit by a car?

502
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,610
You fell off the fence?

503
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,617
Do you mean that fence

504
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,829
-that I allowed them to build?
-I'm sorry, Mom.

505
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,625
I know you told me
not to do anything dangerous.

506
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,629
I really thought I could climb over it.

507
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,966
No, Byeol. It's not your fault.

508
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,509
It's my fault.

509
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,804
I built that fence. I…

510
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,435
I killed my own daughter.

511
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,396
Byeol! I'm so sorry!

512
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,691
I'm so sorry!

513
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,361
It's okay. Don't cry.

514
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,531
Byeol.

515
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,284
Byeol, I'm so sorry!

516
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,876
Byeol…

517
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,964
Byeol…

518
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,430
Byeol.

519
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,060
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,326
Byeol, I'm so sorry.

521
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,397
Did Byeol leave in peace?

522
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,857
She did.

523
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,444
That's a relief.

524
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,947
I was worried
because I didn't absorb her memories.

525
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,408
That's because I didn't use the needle.

526
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,078
A vengeful spirit's memories
channel through the needle.

527
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,458
Is it possible to do it without using it?

528
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,168
It's my first time seeing it myself.

529
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,265
Hello.

530
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,103
You called Byeol's mom,

531
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,022
didn't you?

532
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,191
I'm a wench

533
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,818
who killed her own kid.

534
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,739
I couldn't ignore it. I'm sorry.

535
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,116
Byeol left in peace.

536
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,619
She told her everything she wanted to.

537
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,830
And even comforted her mom.

538
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,625
That's great.

539
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,217
Thank you.

540
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,019
DAEBAK REALTY

541
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,539
So you had already planned everything out
when you entered the inn.

542
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,544
I bet you weren't confident about it
and were terrified.

543
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,131
But had you asked for help,
many people would've helped you.

544
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,592
You could've sent it
to an orphanage as well.

545
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:33,013
Why did you kill the baby?
That was unnecessary, don't you think?

546
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,599
Because it'd hold me back.

547
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,685
Isn't it obvious?

548
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,027
Gosh, look at you.

549
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,280
I told you to wait for me.

550
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,666
Ji-a called me this afternoon.

551
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,379
She wanted to see the case file
on Oh Seong-sik's suicide.

552
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,175
I told her no, of course.

553
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,473
Will you be all right?
I don't think she'll give up so easily.

554
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,100
What if she snoops around and finds out?

555
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,812
I won't let that happen.

556
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,731
At all cost.

557
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,364
Hello, ma'am.

558
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,284
My daughter

559
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,786
wasn't hit by a car.

560
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,956
She fell off the fence.

561
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,460
The fence that I allowed to be built.

562
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,547
Did a witness come forward?

563
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,673
No.

564
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,135
She told me herself.

565
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,474
Your daughter told you?

566
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,808
Yes.

567
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,894
I wasn't the only one there.

568
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,481
Ms. Hong from the realtor also heard it.

569
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,275
Ms. Hong from the realtor?

570
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,820
Do you mean Daebak Realty?

571
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,490
Ms. Hong Ji-a?

572
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,368
YEAR 2021, RENDEZVOUS PARK APARTMENT

573
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,224
CLOSED FOR TODAY

574
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,730
Are you here to eat?

575
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,108
Why did she close it?

576
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,652
Someone who'd spotted her son
called this morning,

577
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,945
so she went to check.

578
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,739
She went to a rural area,
so she'll be back late.

579
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,868
Where are you going?
I haven't eaten yet either.

580
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,248
TTANG TTANG CHICKEN

581
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,336
They have
both fried and oven-baked chicken.

582
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,674
Set three, this, this, and this.

583
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,304
That's what I'll have. What about you?

584
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,888
What?

585
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,976
I'd like this one, please.

586
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,571
You eat so well.

587
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,198
I can't eat as much nowadays
due to stress.

588
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,167
It's delicious.

589
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,921
DAEBAK REALTY
JOO HWA-JEONG

590
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,676
Sir. We received the autopsy result.

591
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,637
Like what the driver claimed,

592
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,222
she'd already passed away
before getting hit by his car.

593
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,599
They believe she fell.

594
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,020
The mother was right.
Do you think this is a coincidence?

595
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,439
-What do you mean?
-The real estate agency.

596
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,191
They got it right twice in a row.

597
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,819
It could be a coincidence at first,
but it's not when it happens twice.

598
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:16,737
Then, what?

599
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,409
Should we ask her who the culprit is
in the robbery case in Suam-dong?

600
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,203
They can't find any evidence.

601
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,164
Right. You should go to her
and ask her this too.

602
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,042
Ask her when you'll get slapped.

603
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,669
Are you kidding? Get back to work.

604
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,504
-What a useless thing to say.
-What?

605
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,506
After everything you said to me,

606
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,966
you're looking into Daebak Realty
behind my back.

607
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,886
-It's not what you think.
-Of course, it is.

608
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,472
Come here. Grab a chair.

609
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,521
-Listen carefully.
-Okay.

610
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,273
Twenty years ago,

611
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,318
someone died at Daebak Realty.

612
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,821
And the person who died was Hong Mi-jin,

613
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,947
Hong Ji-a's mother.

614
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:05,202
And young Hong Ji-a, young Oh In-beom,
and his uncle, Oh Seong-sik,

615
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,413
were at the scene.

616
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,000
But the first person
to report this incident was…

617
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,877
CASE REPORT

618
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,171
Joo Hwa-jeong.

619
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,548
Really?

620
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,133
And two days later,

621
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,885
Oh Seong-sik wrote in his suicide note
that he was the one

622
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,637
who set the fire and killed himself.

623
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,306
You mean the fire in Yongnam Village?

624
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,558
Yes.

625
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,185
Golden Properties was
the biggest benefactor of the fire.

626
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,104
Obviously, they were our prime suspect.

627
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,691
But with Oh Seong-sik dead,
they were no longer the suspect.

628
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,860
And Golden Properties…

629
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,487
-Do you know what it is now?
-No.

630
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,657
It's Dohak Construction now.

631
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,367
Gosh. Keep going.

632
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,452
Here's what I think.

633
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,913
Golden Properties made
Oh Seong-sik set the town on fire.

634
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,333
And they were going to have Hong Mi-jin
kill Oh Seong-sik.

635
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,878
But things went south,
so she was the one who died.

636
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:00,048
So they got rid of Oh Seong-sik
by making it look like a suicide.

637
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,342
Gosh. That makes no sense.

638
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,677
It makes perfect sense.

639
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,847
Then how could Hong Mi-jin's daughter
and Oh Seong-sik's nephew

640
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,599
work together now? That's impossible.

641
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,853
That's what puzzles me.

642
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,275
Did you think about it?

643
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,651
About what?

644
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,112
I told you to quit working as a psychic.

645
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,451
I already gave you my answer.
I'm not going to quit.

646
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,830
Aren't you the one
who'd miss having me around?

647
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:36,126
I absorb their memories and habits
and even keep your temperature up.

648
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,421
You won't be able to find
a valuable partner like me again.

649
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,090
I'm not kidding.

650
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,763
I'm not kidding either.

651
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,934
To be honest, this job was tough.

652
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,977
But it was fun too.

653
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,897
It was the first time I'd felt rewarded

654
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,024
for what I did.

655
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,610
I didn't know.

656
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,572
But I think I can be a good person too.

657
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,244
You are a good person.

658
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,375
So you should quit.

659
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,546
You were going to quit anyway
once your contract ended.

660
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,218
Who knows?

661
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,441
Hello.

662
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,068
What? Why are you here?

663
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,572
Are you still not done with it?

664
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,365
-Go and deliver the food first.
-Okay.

665
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,908
I'll go deliver it.

666
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,785
-I'll be back.
-What?

667
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,328
Enjoy your meal. Enjoy.

668
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,338
He's working here now?

669
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,508
-It just happened.
-How?

670
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,679
What's with the third degree?
Are you interrogating me?

671
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,681
Come here.

672
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,355
What happened? Didn't she go
out of town to find out about her son?

673
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,733
That was a bust.
So she came back all disappointed.

674
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:26,153
Then she saw him looking all shabby
in front of the restaurant.

675
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,615
And that must have
reminded her of her son.

676
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,907
Really?

677
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,037
-I don't feel good about this.
-Same here.

678
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,094
So the chairman let out the guys?

679
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:57,100
Yes. They raided Oh In-beom's van, room,
and his house in his hometown.

680
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,437
We don't know what it is,
but he is looking for something important.

681
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,355
I'm sure of it.

682
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,900
Something important for the chairman?

683
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:11,239
-Make sure to find out what it is.
-Okay.

684
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,366
Sir.

685
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,577
Are you making deliveries too?

686
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,999
To jump, you must crouch down
no matter how embarrassing it is.

687
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,837
I may be going
through this humiliation now,

688
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,548
but I will find the weakness of those two

689
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,009
who made me go through this.

690
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,886
And I'll win back the chairman's trust

691
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,516
and go back to where I was
with my head held high.

692
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,060
-Seon-nyeo.
-Yes.

693
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,061
Pay for my food.

694
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,147
-Good luck, sir!
-Good luck, sir!

695
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,454
Help me.

696
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,207
Nothing really stood out.

697
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,628
I just saw two adults and two kids
lying unconsciously.

698
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,304
OH SEONG-SIK

699
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,557
HAD A 53-YEAR-OLD MOTHER
AND A 7-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW

700
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,767
His residence is unknown
ever since he moved out

701
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,644
after he graduated from high school.

702
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,312
It's not easy to track him down.

703
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,523
BORN IN GEONJEONG-MYEON, HAJU,
SOUTH GYEONGSANG PROVINCE

704
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,909
Where are you going?
I picked up some treats for you.

705
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,036
I'm going out of town.
Take a day off today.

706
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,080
Where? Let me come with you.

707
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,875
-You can eat this on the way.
-It's a personal matter.

708
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,096
What?

709
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,183
Eat it as you drive there.

710
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,436
I thought of you, so I even stood in line
to get them for you.

711
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,104
Drive safely.

712
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,424
It's good.

713
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,269
Is anyone home?

714
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,605
Is anyone home?

715
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,199
My goodness. It's killing me.

716
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,409
Gosh.

717
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,664
Is anyone inside?

718
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,918
-Goodness.
-Ms. Jung Geum-ja?

719
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,711
Goodness.

720
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,255
Oh, dear.

721
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,258
Goodness. It's killing me.

722
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,520
Let's talk.

723
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,356
Why didn't you come sooner?

724
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,400
-We tried to reach you, but…
-Pardon?

725
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,069
-Aren't you her guardian?
-No.

726
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,863
I just happened to be…

727
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,493
Wait. Ma'am. Where… Where are you going?

728
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,537
Ma'am, wait!

729
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,622
Gosh. You can't leave like this.

730
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,749
The cancer has spread. It's serious.

731
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,501
Go to a big hospital now.

732
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,586
-I know.
-You must get…

733
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,421
-Leave me alone.
-Ma'am!

734
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,887
DR. KIM'S CLINIC

735
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,430
Ms. Jung.

736
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,227
I'll drive you home.
Please get in the car.

737
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,021
Buses are still running.

738
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,815
Do you even have a wallet?

739
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,663
Shouldn't you call your children?

740
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,415
They are all dead.

741
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,172
You're not in touch
with your grandson at all?

742
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,257
Why do you ask?

743
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,885
Does he owe you something too?

744
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,220
Not exactly.

745
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,431
Since he left home,

746
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,767
he's never called me.

747
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,456
Goodbye.

748
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,833
Where do you think you're going?
Eat before you go.

749
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,210
I'm good.

750
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,129
Do I have enough rice?

751
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,632
I'm not hungry.

752
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,100
-Do you want more rice?
-Yes.

753
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,074
Here.

754
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,411
It's late. You should stay over.

755
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,371
No, I'm leaving right away.

756
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,249
Anyway, why are you looking for In-beom?

757
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,671
Pardon?

758
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,549
You're here to find him too. Aren't you?

759
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,928
Your grandson's name is

760
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,264
Oh In-beom?

761
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,845
HAJU HIGH SCHOOL

762
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,273
OH IN-BEOM

763
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,548
What are you hiding in a hurry?

764
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,343
Weren't you told
not to come to work today?

765
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,931
It became a habit now,
so I can't seem to sleep.

766
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,030
What are you doing?

767
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,367
I'm just going to look.
Am I not allowed to do that?

768
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:56,746
I told you, just see the contract through
without causing trouble.

769
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,456
Why are you dying to make me leave?

770
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,500
-Because I can't trust you.
-What about you?

771
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,002
Are you trustworthy?

772
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,719
You're back.

773
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,474
You're back. Did you enjoy the macaroons?

774
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,144
In-beom.

775
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,607
Was the kid from 20 years ago

776
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:26,901
you?

777
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,744
Was it you?

778
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,542
Yes.

779
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,378
Tell me.

780
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,089
What happened here that day?

781
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,633
Tell me what happened

782
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,677
and why my mom had to die.

783
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,679
-Tell me!
-How would I know?

784
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,391
I'm here to find that out too.

785
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,726
What?

786
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,729
To find out what your mother did

787
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,024
to make my uncle

788
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,775
die like that.

789
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,742
Do you want me to tell you
why Oh Seong-sik died?

790
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,827
Because you're a psychic.

791
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,835
If it hadn't been for you,
your uncle and my mother

792
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,588
would be alive.

793
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,007
No one would've died.

794
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,595
The one who killed my mother is…

795
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,139
you.

796
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,561
There are too many mysteries
surrounding my uncle's death.

797
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,938
But I do know that I can no longer stay
at Daebak Realty.

798
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,983
Maybe he tried to con us
by using his history.

799
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,109
I'm sorry, Mom.

800
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,695
I didn't know he caused your death.

801
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,862
That jerk.

802
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,281
No, something is definitely
going on between them.

803
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,575
Someone was murdered
at the officetel I live in.

804
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,326
Please spare me.

805
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,954
-I'll find you another psychic.
-It's over, right?

806
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,789
I cannot begin investigating
on pure speculation!

807
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:46,916
You don't have to believe
what I said about spirits.

808
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,835
But shouldn't you trust
what someone alive is saying?

809
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,295
-Ms. Hong!
-She's possessed.

810
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,754
Drop your knife and get up.
