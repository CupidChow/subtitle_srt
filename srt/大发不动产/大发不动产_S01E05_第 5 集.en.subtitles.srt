1
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,043
WHO IS THE REDEVELOPMENT FOR?
WAKE UP! STOP THE REDEVELOPMENT!

2
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,213
RESIDENT DISSOLUTION COMMITTEE
FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT OF ZONE B

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,841
STOP THE REDEVELOPMENT
FROM DESTROYING MY FORTUNE!

4
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,802
The world has become so generous.

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,766
Back in the day, we would've demolished
them and built the apartment by now.

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,976
-No, no.
-Ms. Hong!

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,895
-I won't buy it.
-Ms. Hong!

8
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,188
Get out of the way.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,651
How dare you block my way to eat?

10
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,237
Hey!

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,573
What?

12
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,369
Those two

13
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,997
still have something to discuss with me.

14
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,208
-Ma'am!
-Go ahead.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,503
We don't have anything
to discuss with you. Sir.

16
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,507
The chairman is here.

17
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,144
Attention, greetings!

18
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,063
-Hello, Mr. Do!
-Hello, Mr. Do!

19
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,648
Hey.

20
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,484
Aren't you supposed
to be at the realty office?

21
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,777
Well…

22
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,405
She is Hong, the CEO of Daebak Realty.

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,673
Please help me.

24
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,809
You're younger than I thought.

25
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:09,939
Who are you?

26
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,237
You've got balls.

27
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,284
No wonder you dared
to mess with me, Do Hak-seong,

28
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,077
when you helped Britium out.

29
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,455
I see. Dohak Construction.

30
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,541
Anyway,

31
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,836
why is someone
as gutsy and competent as you

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,505
doing something so lowly
as toying with redevelopment?

33
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,425
Don't you know
it doesn't get you much money anymore?

34
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,970
If you need money,
how about you work for me instead?

35
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,432
I love that look in your eyes.

36
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,269
I don't work with just anyone.

37
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,235
"Just anyone"?

38
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,581
How cute.

39
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,750
I'll give you a few days

40
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,628
to decide whether to be my friend or foe.

41
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,507
If you choose the latter,
you can look forward to what'll await you.

42
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,592
I won't wait long.

43
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,312
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

44
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,902
Your hand is ice-cold. There was
a vengeful spirit here, wasn't there?

45
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,445
Is it still here?

46
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,073
Not anymore.

47
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,703
Seriously?
I held it because I was worried.

48
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,789
Hey, how did Kim Tae-jin find us?
Should we move?

49
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,041
Didn't you see it?

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,252
He was completely intimidated by Ms. Hong.

51
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,964
Then let's stick close to her.

52
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,218
Did they leave?

53
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,053
Yes.

54
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,645
Ma'am, are you okay?

55
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,651
I was terrified that they'd barge in
and smash everything again.

56
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,153
Oh, God.

57
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,071
Have they been doing that?

58
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,741
They come at least once or twice a month.

59
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,327
-They want me to sell this land.
-Ma'am.

60
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,872
Isn't it better to get the compensation
than to hold out

61
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,206
only to get kicked out--

62
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,499
Chief Heo.

63
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,252
What?

64
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,676
Do you know why she named
the restaurant Changhwa?

65
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,635
What?

66
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,264
It's the name of her son
who left home 12 years ago.

67
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,019
She can't leave this place
in case he comes back.

68
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,360
You want me
to look into your mother's last client?

69
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,196
Yes.

70
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,198
I want to know why he died.

71
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,658
He's dead?

72
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,204
I saw him as a vengeful spirit.

73
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,122
Are you sure it was him?

74
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,042
You only saw him once 20 years ago.
You could be mistaken.

75
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,126
No.

76
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,838
I still remember
every little detail about that day.

77
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,469
Okay. I'll look into it and let you know.

78
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,974
Hello.

79
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,351
What?

80
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,854
It's still early evening.
Why do you look so down?

81
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,816
Seeing how you're all hyped up,
you must've found something.

82
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,736
I told you. I found out about the
world-star couple only with their…

83
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,989
Let's begin the briefing.

84
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,417
For the past 15 hours,

85
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,838
using the cutting-edge method
of social media,

86
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,840
I've looked into every single person

87
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:08,302
who was even slightly connected
to the Green Villa fraud case.

88
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,347
And there were
three people who lost their lives.

89
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,936
And it turned out--

90
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,230
It's the third photo. The mom.

91
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,898
How are you so sure?

92
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,525
Because I saw her.

93
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,443
I see.

94
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,989
Her name is Joo Gyeong-hui.
She was 60 years old.

95
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,907
She died of myocardial infarction.

96
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,500
I'd never seen her so elated before.

97
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,462
That's why

98
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,214
I couldn't stop her
even though I was concerned.

99
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,592
She looked so happy.

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,180
I should've dissuaded her back then.

101
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,349
We don't know when this house
will sell. Why did you sign it already?

102
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,560
You don't have to hurry.

103
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,355
I can cover the down payment
with the money I've saved up.

104
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:06,319
The sales agency will
also help us take out a loan for it.

105
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,030
-Loan?
-Don't worry about anything.

106
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,866
This is the very first house
I've purchased in 60 years.

107
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,911
I made sure to be thorough.

108
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,332
Gosh. You never wanted to own a house.
What has gotten into you?

109
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,377
I should get to own my own house
before I die, shouldn't I?

110
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,967
You cannot go there alive

111
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,637
-Are you that happy?
-What? Yes.

112
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,350
Gosh. I love it.

113
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,312
Hey, had I known it'd feel this great,
I would've purchased a house much sooner.

114
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,025
Goodness.

115
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,821
You guys should just move in here
before your house gets sold.

116
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,866
-We'll think about it.
-Gosh.

117
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,910
Honey. Mother. Look here.

118
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,495
Sure. Come here.

119
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,290
All right. One, two, three.

120
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,668
I love you.

121
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,630
Every day, she cleaned and wiped the house

122
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,092
even though there wasn't much to clean.

123
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,137
Who is it? Goodness.

124
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,640
But she had to leave
her cherished house in a week.

125
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,183
What do you mean?

126
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,935
This house isn't mine?

127
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,771
I'm illegally residing here?

128
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,358
What do you think you're doing?
This is my house!

129
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,152
You can't come in here with your shoes on!

130
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,280
Don't do this!

131
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,408
-Take everything out.
-You can't do this! Stop!

132
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,288
This is my house!

133
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,879
You should've checked! What is this?

134
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,590
What more could I do?

135
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,133
I checked enough!

136
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,968
This is so frustrating.

137
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,642
-Mom.
-Mother.

138
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,979
Her anger is

139
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,442
what really killed her,
not myocardial infarction.

140
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,985
She felt wronged.

141
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,739
She felt so deeply wronged
that it got her.

142
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,157
Those people…

143
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,910
are murderers, not frauds.

144
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,846
Block B has stairs in the middle
and eight houses in total.

145
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,224
Our client in Unit 302
doesn't live there anymore.

146
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,852
But we need to ask
for cooperation of the rest.

147
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,106
The vengeful spirit is
obsessed with Unit 302

148
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,025
and won't leave that place.

149
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,737
So we can do the exorcism tonight
without asking the rest.

150
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,157
But let's do it at 3:00 a.m.,
when most people are asleep.

151
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,998
Gosh. Awesome.

152
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,839
How are we luring out
the spirit this time? By threatening?

153
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,896
I thought the other units
won't be affected.

154
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,232
I'm preparing for the worst.

155
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,027
Since I suffered
because of some fraud recently.

156
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,905
Don't tell me you're talking about me.

157
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,117
Seriously?

158
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,454
Not answering questions is a bad habit.

159
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,701
Don't take off your shoes.

160
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,660
What?

161
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,413
Keep your shoes on.

162
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,795
This is my house!

163
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,965
You can't come in here with your shoes on!

164
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,648
What?

165
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,443
What's going on?

166
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,615
Oh In-beom!

167
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,886
Now. Take it off!

168
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,490
Get out!

169
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,330
Get out of my house.

170
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,624
This is my house!

171
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,679
This is my house.

172
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,765
I bought it for my daughter.

173
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,850
My house…

174
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,941
Gosh.

175
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,569
Here's a warm drink for you.

176
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,362
Okay.

177
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,613
Thank you.

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,494
My daughter's family and I
want to move in together

179
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,037
-to a deposit-based house.
-Gosh.

180
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,416
There are no deposit-based houses
these days. It's all monthly rent.

181
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,712
But it'll be burdensome for us, so…

182
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,550
Then, why don't you buy a house instead?

183
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,928
It's much better
to just buy a house with a mortgage.

184
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,766
Fortunately, we have villa units on sale
because they haven't been sold.

185
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,809
Please wait.

186
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,896
How big are they again?

187
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,356
One is 79 square meters,
and the other, 105.

188
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,984
-Those are nice units.
-Take a look at them.

189
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,826
No. Just call me when you have
a nice listing for a deposit-based house.

190
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,871
Gosh. Sure. I'll do that.

191
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,332
Oh, right. Just in case.

192
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,668
Why don't you take this
and read it through at home?

193
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,837
NO COMMISSION FEES, BUY GREEN VILLA

194
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,256
-Thank you.
-Sure.

195
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,098
Yeong-mi…

196
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,202
I'm glad you changed your mind.

197
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,162
Your daughter will be so happy.

198
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,790
You won't regret it.

199
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,210
The developers and construction company
are very solid.

200
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,964
There's nothing for you to worry about.
You can just live happily in that house.

201
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,882
You have a happy future ahead of you.

202
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:12,054
You cannot go there alive

203
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,639
What do you mean?

204
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,224
This house isn't mine?

205
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,267
I'm illegally residing here?

206
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,103
-Take everything out.
-You can't do this!

207
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,980
Even if you sue them for fraud,

208
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,357
it will be hard to get
all of your money back.

209
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,610
You didn't wire the money
to the designated trust account,

210
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,322
so legally speaking,
this house doesn't belong to you.

211
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,292
I'll bring my mom here.

212
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,712
How will we live with her
in this small room?

213
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,631
I can't let her stay
at her friend's house forever!

214
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,384
I know. But let's find
another way to help her.

215
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,553
She should stay with her daughter!

216
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,929
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,099
I'm such an idiot,

218
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,560
-My mom…
-getting scammed like that.

219
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,271
I just wanted

220
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,566
to buy a house for my daughter

221
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,988
since I hadn't done much for her
as a mother.

222
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
My daughter.

223
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,579
I am…

224
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,707
sorry.

225
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,376
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,702
DAEBAK REALTY

227
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,583
She saved up the money

228
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,503
working at restaurants
and as housekeepers.

229
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,881
She bought it with that money.
Gosh, those scumbags.

230
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,426
How are you doing this for ten years?

231
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,804
I would have killed a few people already.

232
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,389
What's the point?

233
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,017
I'd just have more vengeful spirits
for me to get rid of.

234
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,312
So you can make jokes.

235
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,190
I wasn't joking.

236
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,155
The duty of an exorcist ends
once the spirits are sent off.

237
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,450
That's where the job ends.

238
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,537
I see.

239
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,456
You want me to try to pretend
that I watched a sad movie again?

240
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,838
You know what?

241
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,801
My parents passed away when I was
very young, so I have no memories of them.

242
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,762
And I never missed them either.

243
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,473
I must know them to miss them.

244
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,563
But earlier, this crossed my mind.

245
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:13,277
"When my parents had to
leave me in this world alone,

246
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,281
did they feel like this?"

247
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,828
"I hope they didn't."

248
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,227
My daughter.

249
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,897
I am…

250
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,316
sorry.

251
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,074
Mom?

252
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,164
Is that how you felt too that day?

253
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,921
Is that why you are still here?
Because you can't leave me?

254
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,550
Please help me.

255
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,761
No matter what you hear,

256
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,513
do not come downstairs. Understood?

257
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,266
Promise me.

258
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,395
-I promise.
-You must keep the promise. Okay?

259
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,855
Okay. I got it.

260
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,166
Mom!

261
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,630
Ji-a…

262
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,229
Mom?

263
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,690
Ji-a.

264
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,777
Pick up that needle.

265
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,244
Do you remember what I taught you?

266
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:14,291
Stab me just as you practiced
on that teddy bear.

267
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,084
No.

268
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,130
Pull yourself together, Ji-a!

269
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,758
You have to do this. Now.

270
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,967
I can't do it, Mom.

271
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,179
You can. You have to.

272
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,805
I don't want to do it.

273
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,020
Mom.

274
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,689
Mom.

275
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,318
Mom.

276
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,847
Hey, Ms. Joo.

277
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,267
Right now?

278
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,686
Yes, it's fine.

279
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,157
OH SEONG-SIK

280
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,575
Oh Seong-sik.

281
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,369
He killed himself?

282
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,788
Yes, 20 years ago,

283
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,166
two days after he came to Daebak Realty.

284
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,336
Does this have something to do
with my mother's last exorcism?

285
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,546
That's not the case.

286
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,923
There were lots of conflicts
between the residents

287
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,509
and real estate developers
in the squatter area.

288
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,138
They were to get kicked out
without proper compensation.

289
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,932
So he set the town on fire out of anger,

290
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,435
and the fire killed seven people.

291
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,104
He couldn't deal with the guilt
and committed suicide.

292
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,107
Then why is he haunting
the chairman of Dohak Construction?

293
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,610
The redevelopment was
led by Golden Properties,

294
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,944
the former entity of Dohak.

295
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,282
Since Do Hak-seong pushed ahead
with redeveloping the squatter area,

296
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,701
he probably became
a vengeful spirit to haunt him.

297
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,911
Maybe.

298
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,997
How's the lawsuit for Green Villa going?

299
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,708
They haven't found
President Hwang of the sales agency.

300
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,792
No progress.

301
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,462
Why do you ask?

302
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:07,714
I was reminded of my mom.

303
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,719
Can you look into
all of real estate Hwang owns?

304
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:13,720
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,851
The evicted resident union

306
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,230
is making an issue
out of the joint owners' agreement?

307
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,609
The committee gave their approval.
There's nothing to make an issue of.

308
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,486
The thing is,

309
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,907
they bring in other civic groups
and put up a fight together.

310
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,160
They also bring reporters
from independent media or something.

311
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,250
So you, the head of the borough,
got scared and want to revoke

312
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,795
the agreement for the redevelopment
of the joint-owned area?

313
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,715
Things aren't like
how it was back in the day.

314
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,761
Come in.

315
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,153
I got cheap ginseng for you
to abide by the Anti-bribery Act.

316
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,739
But you should still feel burdened.

317
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,383
Goodness.

318
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,428
All redevelopment projects
entail evictee problems.

319
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,722
Don't worry, Mr. Do.

320
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,975
Anyway, that's that.

321
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,062
How's it going
with Assemblyman Han Hui-seop?

322
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:50,025
I already mentioned it to him
to set up a meeting for you.

323
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,237
All right.

324
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,448
-Have a drink, sir.
-All right.

325
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,496
This is my house!

326
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,083
No.

327
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,044
This is my house…

328
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,515
Get up.

329
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,809
Five more minutes.

330
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,773
How can you sleep when I can't sleep
because I'm heartbroken?

331
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,900
Whatever.

332
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,072
I said, get up!

333
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,948
Mom, come on.

334
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,201
Hey.

335
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,495
You sounded just like my mom.

336
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,540
Man, I hate it too.

337
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,210
Is this what that lady spirit left on you?

338
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:56,966
So please find President Hwang for me.

339
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,719
I need to find him
and take my precious money back

340
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,513
for me to live in peace.

341
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,973
That's not exactly your money.

342
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,558
What?

343
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,310
Darn it.

344
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,687
I don't know anything anymore.

345
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,982
Being a psychic must be really stressful.

346
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,403
So we just need to find President Hwang?

347
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:17,946
Yes.

348
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,495
Goodness.

349
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,248
Hey, look.

350
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,959
Come on. President Hwang is a guy.

351
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,043
I know that.

352
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,337
This is his younger sister, Hwang Ji-yeon.

353
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,256
On her call history,

354
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,759
I saw a number she has been calling often
since her brother went missing,

355
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,219
and it's a burner phone.

356
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,096
It has to be President Hwang.

357
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,267
Hey, I knew you'd do it, Chief Heo.

358
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,769
But can you locate the phone?

359
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,273
I'm almost done with that too.

360
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,607
YOUR VIOLATION OF THE TRAFFIC REGULATIONS…

361
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,776
Don't be so cheap about food.

362
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,905
Go eat cup noodles.
We shouldn't treat him too nicely.

363
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,991
-Eat up.
-Okay.

364
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,452
What is this?

365
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,912
What the heck is this smell?

366
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,873
-Your foot?
-Speeding?

367
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,374
When did I get caught?

368
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,876
Pharming completed.

369
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:17,046
We just have to wait
until he calls someone.

370
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,304
That lady must've come again. You cleaned.

371
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,768
But it's great. It's really clean in here.

372
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:33,021
DAEBAK REALTY

373
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,441
It's been rumored for two year
that Do Hak-seong uses President Hwang

374
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,942
for his secret fund.

375
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,278
The police did investigate it,

376
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,572
but there was no evidence,
so it came to nothing.

377
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,656
Then it's likely

378
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,495
that Do took the money from
selling the apartment units, not Hwang.

379
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:52,457
If that wasn't the case,
Do Hak-seong wouldn't have let him live.

380
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,211
Is this all President Hwang owns?
Hwang Ji-yeon is listed as a joint owner

381
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,254
-for most of it.
-Yes, that's his sister.

382
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,882
What's the current market price
for this land?

383
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,843
A while ago, it dropped
by half the price he bought it for.

384
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,596
It looks like he was fooled
by some con man.

385
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,432
The con man has been conned.

386
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,433
Let's go with this.

387
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,654
My God, what's going on?

388
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,323
Did I just clean this place?

389
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,408
I don't know.

390
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,328
It doesn't look much different to me.

391
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,038
What do you mean?

392
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,873
This place was full of dust.

393
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,500
It wasn't that bad.

394
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,547
My gosh, a man's hands
are what defines him.

395
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,549
I didn't even put on rubber gloves.

396
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,592
Ms. Hong.

397
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,262
I talked to them. Let's get going.

398
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,263
Okay, I'll be there.

399
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,975
Where are you going?

400
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,729
To eat.

401
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,357
At this odd hour?

402
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,984
I eat whenever I want.

403
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,118
If the sales have been made…

404
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,585
Go on.

405
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,639
What's with you? You went to her office
after putting me to work?

406
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,974
I'll explain it later.

407
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,225
And remember.

408
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,644
-Ms. Hong can't find it out.
-I don't want to die.

409
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,731
Oh In-beom or Chief Heo
can't know about my involvement

410
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,983
-with President Hwang.
-I'll keep it a secret.

411
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,905
They might not know when to butt in
if we let them in on it.

412
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,990
I hate cleaning up after them too.

413
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,663
Bye.

414
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:19,479
I'll give you 70 percent of the price
you paid for it three years ago.

415
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,526
I know that the current value is well
below 50 percent of the original price.

416
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,278
That's why I'm looking to buy it.

417
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,281
It's my job to make an investment
for its future value.

418
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,995
If you're keeping it for a reason,
then it's fine.

419
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,624
I thought you were here to sell it.

420
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,211
My brother and I are the joint owners,

421
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,879
so I have to ask him.

422
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,632
One second, please.

423
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,732
Hello? Jae-u.

424
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,568
MY LOVE

425
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,654
What?

426
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,365
Hey, we got President Hwang's location.

427
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,835
Then when do you want to seal the deal?

428
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,380
As soon as possible.

429
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,924
Let's do it
with Mr. Hwang Jae-u today if possible.

430
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,386
Well, actually…

431
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,930
He's busy right now.

432
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,433
I can get his power of attorney
and sign for him.

433
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,351
I can't do that.

434
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,438
I don't make deals
unless I meet the title-holder in person.

435
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,107
Come on, why not?

436
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,276
If you can't do that, let's call this off.

437
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,195
Wait!

438
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,297
If it's really Hwang,
call the police, and your job is done.

439
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,320
Who is it?

440
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,156
-You got a package.
-Leave it in front of the door.

441
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,160
I need your signature.
Could you come out for a second?

442
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,828
I'm not expecting any package,

443
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,371
so just take it back, then.

444
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,499
Aren't you Mr. Hwang Jae-u?

445
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,584
This is from Ms. Hwang Ji-yeon.

446
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,219
Where do I sign?

447
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,807
-I need the receiver to sign it himself.
-I am the receiver. Where do I sign?

448
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,103
It's not you.

449
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,691
What's your problem?

450
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,778
Hey. Are you crazy?

451
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,448
You… You bastard! Hey!

452
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,001
What is this? Why are you here?

453
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,964
I'm working part-time. You want me
to pay you back. So I'm working.

454
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,341
What are you trying to pull?

455
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,849
Darn it.

456
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,536
So Mr. Hwang Jae-u is here.

457
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,624
Oh In-beom. Hey, In-beom.

458
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,585
In-beom! You bastard.

459
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,920
-Gosh.
-You do it.

460
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,589
Take this. You bastard.

461
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,549
You jerk!

462
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,218
-Hey. You idiot.
-Hey!

463
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,472
Stop making a scene out there.
Do it in here.

464
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,557
Yes, sir.

465
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,393
You're ordering me around again.

466
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,478
Isn't that exhausting?

467
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,899
It is. Let's go inside.

468
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,198
Come here, you idiot.

469
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,451
-Come!
-What the hell are you doing?

470
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,911
You can't even drag him?

471
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,418
Jae-u.

472
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,296
Ji-yeon.

473
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,099
Ms. Hong?

474
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,393
Ms. Hong!

475
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,876
In this quarter, we are looking to promote

476
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,128
premeditated and systematic control

477
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,464
over our real estate businesses…

478
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,716
President Hwang
has been arrested by the police.

479
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,678
That dimwit.

480
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,138
Which station?

481
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,140
Call the chief there.

482
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,059
Yes, sir.

483
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,273
Continue.

484
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,150
We didn't confine
or assault anybody, officer.

485
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,071
Officer, how could you say that
after looking at our faces?

486
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,991
Those two beat us up!
Especially the woman!

487
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,451
She's a total thug.

488
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,453
Please stop yelling.

489
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,123
Why did you fight?

490
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,168
-Do you know each other?
-It wasn't a fight. I got beaten up.

491
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:20,339
And this guy. He's wanted,
so will you please look him up?

492
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,301
Mr. Hwang, you really are wanted.

493
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,510
See?

494
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,723
Let me call my lawyer.

495
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,517
Are we all done? May I go?

496
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,186
Not yet.

497
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,689
Why not? It was self-defense.

498
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,524
They hit me first!

499
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,360
I told you not to do anything.

500
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,071
My blood boils
whenever I think of that con man.

501
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,156
How can I not?

502
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,783
Do you finally understand
how your victims must've felt

503
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,909
when you conned them?

504
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:58,502
That's a whole different story.
All of my victims deserved it.

505
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,087
Speak for yourself.

506
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,007
What about you?

507
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,551
You told me not to do a thing.
So why were you there?

508
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,219
You're no different.

509
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,388
Will you please keep quiet?

510
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,869
-Careful.
-What the hell?

511
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,206
I can't believe this happened.
Hey, bring that over.

512
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,500
-Darn it.
-What is this?

513
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,335
Tofu. We have to eat this.

514
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,545
Man, are you serious? God…

515
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,714
Hey, make sure you eat some tofu.

516
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,053
Let's go.

517
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,723
It hurts.

518
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,067
Good luck.

519
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,946
This isn't right!

520
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,740
Darn it!

521
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,785
Darn it!

522
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,454
What did I get beaten up for?

523
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,289
Kim Tae-jin was at Hwang's place.

524
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,751
That means Dohak Construction and Hwang
were both in on the fraud.

525
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,545
There's only circumstantial evidence.

526
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,132
Without hard evidence,
they'll be put on probation or fined.

527
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:31,011
And they would rather pay a fine
than compensate the victims.

528
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,806
How did you track President Hwang?

529
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,599
I used pharming on his phone.

530
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,644
Can you also hack his phone
and retrieve a file?

531
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,229
It is possible, but…

532
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,314
It's a burner, so you won't find anything.

533
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,359
Just give it a try.

534
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,778
Scumbags like him

535
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,448
often make sure they have a way out.

536
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,200
What is this?
Why are you singing a different tune?

537
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,661
Didn't you tell us
not to do anything before?

538
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,458
We should finish what we've started.

539
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,128
-I'm finally liking you.
-I'm not doing this for you.

540
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,547
Sure, ma'am.

541
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,719
DAEBAK REALTY

542
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,018
No way.

543
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:19,977
Hey, In-beom.

544
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,895
Yes?

545
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,188
There really is something.

546
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,358
Play it.

547
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,197
Did you ask the chairman
to get me off the no-fly list?

548
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,325
He's currently talking about it
with the old man,

549
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,576
so be patient.

550
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,286
Will the money be sent late?

551
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,331
The guys in Manila only work properly
when I'm there.

552
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,832
I understand, so please wait.

553
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,667
President Hwang Jae-u of Mirae Design

554
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,128
and Secretary Choi
of Dohak Construction's call

555
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,173
went viral online
and became controversial.

556
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:53,469
It's proof that the two companies
were in on this fraud from the start.

557
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:57,139
Despite this concrete proof,
the police aren't investigating.

558
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,934
It means that the police
and the court are on their side!

559
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,811
-Despite the victims' pleading,
-Punish Dohak Construction!

560
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:06,565
Dohak Construction has not released
any official statement regarding this…

561
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,529
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't expect
Mr. Hwang to record the call.

562
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,782
Don't worry.
It was time to discard him anyway.

563
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,160
The public will forget about this
in a week.

564
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,205
Make it look like he embezzled it

565
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,541
and put an end to the trial.
Don't let it drag on.

566
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,918
And prepare for a press conference.

567
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,045
Yes, sir.

568
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,178
Dohak Construction is

569
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,350
deeply heartbroken that it had a part in
causing unforgivable scars on the victims

570
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,563
due to the criminal activities
committed by the head of the agency.

571
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,692
As our way of taking moral responsibility,
regardless of the result of the trial,

572
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:55,030
we decided to give all of the victims
consolation money.

573
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,076
I sincerely hope that this will bring

574
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,245
at least a bit of peace to the victims.

575
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,374
Once again, I would like to offer

576
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,252
my sincerest apologies.

577
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,302
-Sir!
-Sir!

578
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,095
-Wait!
-Answer our question, please.

579
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,642
Did you find who spread it online?

580
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,813
I believe those who came to Hwang's studio
that day are behind it.

581
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,649
Hong Ji-a, the CEO of Daebak Realty,
and Oh In-beom.

582
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,027
You've met them once.

583
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,112
Why would they do that?

584
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,073
The prosecution demanded
the court to sentence

585
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,452
Mirae Design's President, Hwang Jae-u,
to seven years in prison

586
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,995
and collect 3.6 billion won.

587
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,455
The call recording…

588
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:47,374
Dohak is behind it,
but they'll only charge Hwang?

589
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,961
How can a paper company
give back that much money?

590
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,339
They don't care about the victims.

591
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,008
Was it just a pipe dream of ours?

592
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,218
I hope the consolation money is big.

593
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,554
They ought to compensate the victims.

594
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,389
How shameless! What? Consolation?

595
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,560
Among the victims,
they entrusted the agency

596
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,229
to oversee the sales…

597
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,565
Ms. Hong.

598
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,609
Did you see--

599
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,924
The client will be here at 8:00 p.m.

600
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,526
Oh, my. She ripped it apart.

601
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,111
When did she start punching it?

602
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,365
As soon as that shameless Do Hak-seong

603
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,659
started to babble
about the consolation money,

604
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,828
she lost it and started punching it.

605
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,665
So it's been over an hour.

606
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,295
It's still better
than beating up a person.

607
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,050
That sandbag is saving a lot of lives.

608
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,474
The exorcism was done properly.

609
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,853
Then you just have to find
a buyer now, right?

610
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,313
Actually, that's why I wanted
to meet with you.

611
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,566
Is there a problem?

612
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,030
Why don't you rent it out instead?

613
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,408
Rent it out? Why, all of a sudden?

614
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,161
There will be a light rail station
around there soon.

615
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,414
If you sell it now, it'll be your loss.

616
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,958
Are you sure they'll build
a light rail station there?

617
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,209
I did hear the rumor.

618
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,671
Yes. Trust me
and keep the house for five more years.

619
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,007
Okay, then.

620
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,432
Goodness.

621
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,601
Ms. Na Yeong-mi.

622
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,853
Peekaboo.

623
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,438
You are so beautiful.

624
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,981
Let me get that for you.

625
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:18,108
I'm Hong Ji-a of Daebak Realty.

626
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,451
The house is up for sale?

627
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,745
But I can't buy that house.

628
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,997
Even with that consolation money,

629
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,958
after I pay the medical bills
and the interests on the mortgage…

630
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,420
The landlord decided to rent it out
as a deposit-based house.

631
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:42,090
The deposit isn't that high.
I'm sure it'll be within your budget.

632
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,550
But why me?

633
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,846
My job is to find the perfect tenant.

634
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,058
And I think you are
the perfect tenant for the house.

635
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,897
-Think about it and call us.
-If you want the house,

636
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,441
we can proceed
with the contract electronically.

637
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,569
So you don't have to come
all the way to our office with the baby.

638
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,419
You rarely see a south-facing house
like this one nowadays.

639
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:23,549
Doesn't it get a lot of sunlight? Small
apartments are also great these days.

640
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,594
Fire-resistant materials were used
for this house.

641
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,597
And it was designed
to endure earthquakes as well.

642
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,516
So it's perfectly safe.

643
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,394
The master bedroom is
the wow factor of this house.

644
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,772
I like that the mountain is so close.

645
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:41,191
You like listening to the birds
in the morning.

646
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,237
What I love the most about this house

647
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,613
is the elevator.

648
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,200
When your baby is born,

649
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:54,288
you'll be able to
easily go down with your stroller.

650
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,623
Mom. Thank you.

651
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,737
YEAR 2021, GREEN VILLA

652
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,583
Why are you smirking like that?
It's creepy.

653
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,087
How did you think
of sweet-talking him to rent it out?

654
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,967
-That was the perfect move.
-"Sweet-talk"? I'm not you.

655
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,263
I merely reminded my client
of the future value of his property.

656
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,184
In any case, you did what the deceased
wanted to do for her daughter.

657
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,062
Suit yourself.

658
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,833
DAEBAK REALTY

659
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,560
Found it.

660
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,021
What are you doing in here?

661
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,950
I asked, what are you doing?

662
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,452
My goodness. What just happened?

663
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,330
Why am I here?

664
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,084
No way. Was I cleaning here again?

665
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,878
Darn this side effect. Gosh.

666
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,007
Do you have a death wish?

667
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,720
How dare you try to fool me
with that stupid acting?

668
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,763
-Please let go of me and talk--
-Get out.

669
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:22,936
It was foolish of me to think for a second
that you actually might be a good guy.

670
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,355
I was just trying to study.

671
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:32,696
You scare me all the time
that I could die doing this job.

672
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:36,074
And I can't handle the emotions
from the spirits after the exorcism.

673
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,910
You know,

674
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,165
it was my first time hating someone
so much that I wanted to kill him.

675
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,752
And I realized for the first time
what it meant to have your heart broken.

676
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,088
But doing exorcisms

677
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,967
made me feel like I was helping people.

678
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,011
It made me feel good.

679
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,807
So I was trying to find a proper solution.

680
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,727
Not punching the sandbag
or drinking to forget.

681
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,356
I wanted to find a proper solution
that I could accept.

682
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,358
Once the contract's over,

683
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,236
just live an ordinary life like before.

684
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,155
That's the solution.

685
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,574
Besides, there are no solutions.

686
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,910
So don't waste your time, and go.

687

Hello. As you requested,

690
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,319
I'm on my way to film the spirit
at the PC cafe.

CHEONHA BUILDING

692
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,371
Every lot on the ground level is vacant.

693
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,915
Is it because of that spirit?

694
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,085

This is where the spirit
of the PC cafe has been seen.

697
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,807
The PC cafe has closed down.

698
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,644
Sir. Hello.

699
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,688
Are you here?

00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,732

-They are part-timers.

00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,767
Please go on.

705
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,813
I'm already angry
that the rumor goes around

706
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,899
that my perfectly fine building
is haunted.

707
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,234
Now that this kind of footage is online,

708
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,154
no one would want to rent
the lots in my building.

709
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,781
My building is the only one
that has vacant lots.

710
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,160
If I could, I just want to sell it.

711
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,038
-But my wife is against it.
-Of course.

712
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,206
It's an up-and-coming neighborhood.

713
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,709
-It'd be foolish to sell it now.
-Right.

714
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,211
We will find great tenants for you soon.

715
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,296
My goodness.

716
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,883
Did someone die or did you
kill someone in that building recently?

717
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:40,884
Excuse me?

718
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,471
Now that she's seen the vengeful spirit
in this video,

719
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,599
she's just asking
if you have any idea who that might be.

720
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,226
Given the nature of our job,
we must ask this question.

721
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,561
You don't recognize him?

722
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,188
Seriously?

723
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,150
Name, Han Dong-hui.
He was 23 when he died.

724
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:59,819
His story made the headlines
three months ago.

725
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,781
He played games in the PC cafe
for two days without any sleep.

726
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:07,285
And when he stepped out late at night,
he died of a heart attack.

727
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,538
-A life in vain.
-What a way to die.

728
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,125
But is it possible for spirits
to be filmed like this?

729
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,002
It's not common, but it happens.

730
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,047
Well, for us, we get to identify him
without making the trip,

731
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,467
-so it makes things easier for us.
-Do we know the time of death?

732
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,095
Around 4:00 a.m.

733
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,346
CURRENT TIME
3:53 A.M.

734
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,559
-Tell me about the building.
-Cheonha Building.

735
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,187
The owner runs
a dry sauna in the basement.

736
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,606
And his daughter runs a bakery
on the rooftop.

737
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,942
And the lots
on the rest of the floors are vacant.

738
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,152
Do we do it right now?

739
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:45,699
I know his face and name.
There's no point in delaying it.

740
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,918
CHEONHA SAUNA

741
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,305
Take it out from the bamboo tube
and scatter it.

742
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,099
Make sure to cover the entrance.

743
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,521
What's this?

744
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,731
Salt.

745
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,109
I see. It's just salt?

746
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,406
By the way, why are we scattering it?

747
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,035
To block the vengeful spirit from
running away after possessing your body.

748
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:32,954
I see.

749
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,959
Wait. Then what if this shield breaks?

750
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:38,877
What happens?

751
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,795
You saw it yourself.

752
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,964
When we first met.

753
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,816
Will you do that all night long?

754
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,985
Gosh. My life depends on it.

755
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,612
I can't half-ass it.

756
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,623
Do you have plans this late at night?
Why do you keep checking the time?

757
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,043
The vengeful spirit will show up soon.

758
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,586
How do you know that?

759
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,965
This vengeful spirit is
endlessly repeating

760
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,801
what he did right before he died.

761
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:32,555
He will show up at the exact location
where he died at the exact same time.

762
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,114
Get your necklace ready.

763
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,242
How close is he?

764
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,787
Take it off now.

765
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,584
Oh In-beom.

766
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,463
Put your necklace back on.

767
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,271
SAUNA, RED CLAY SAUNA
BASEMENT LEVEL 1

768
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,802
There's one more vengeful spirit?

769
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,026
I'm possessed.

770
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,324
This is not real.

771
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,328
Hong Ji-a. Open your eyes.

772
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,372
Pull yourself together, Ji-a!

773
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,294
Mom…

774
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,760
Mom. Wake me up.

775
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,179
I'm sorry.

776
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,139
Hong Ji-a.

777
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,936
It's dangerous to stab
everywhere like that.

778
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,773
I told you, you have to stab it
in the heart in one go.

779
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,108
Let's try again.

780
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,444
Help me.

781
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,321
Wake up.

782
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,115
Ms. Hong.

783
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,200
Ms. Hong!

784
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,245
Hong Ji-a!

785
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:50,878
Are you okay?

786
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,673
Are you all right?

787
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,731
Help me.

788
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,446
A child.

789
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,283
There was a child.

790
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,747
There are too many oddities.

791
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,833
Why did my mom try to do
an exorcism ritual without a psychic?

792
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,335
You remembered
that while you were bewitched,

793
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,836
so it may be distorted.

794
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,254
I need to know what exactly happened
on that day.

795
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,675
I found everything on the internet
regarding Cheonha Building.

796
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:19,801
We're a great team.

797
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,260
You want me to go in here?

798
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,470
Whatever memories you absorb tonight,

799
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,429
forget them right away.

800
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,390
That vengeful spirit was murdered
as we expected.

801
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,683
Even this morning,

802
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,018
he swore to kill that murderer,
and his eyes were…

803
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,229
As soon as Oh Seong-sik died,
he took the nephew and…

804
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,314
Oh In-beom? It's about Oh In-beom.

805
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,900
I don't think it's too late
to call off your contract.
