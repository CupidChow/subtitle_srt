1
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,590
Hey, wait! Let's talk it out.
We can talk this out!

2
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,180
That's enough. You might kill him.

3
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,727
-You don't care if he dies?
-That hurts.

4
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,229
I think you're the one who'll die.

5
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,536
Please don't kill me. Please!

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,538
I'll give you money.

7
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,707
-Stay still!
-Please spare my life.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,001
-I can't aim right.
-I'll give you money!

9
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,937
What's your deal?

10
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,274
You promised you'd give us
an apartment unit.

11
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,777
-What?
-I set the place on fire

12
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,113
and killed people.

13
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,367
Give me the apartment.

14
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,662
The apartment.

15
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,183
-Give me my apartment.
-What is this nonsense?

16
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,769
Give me my apartment!

17
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,807
What are you doing?
Go tend to the chairman now!

18
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,936
Get up.

19
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,574
What's going on?

20
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,828
Stop overreacting.

21
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,748
You didn't break anything.
You only pulled a ligament.

22
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,833
Hey.

23
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,588
-What happened?
-The spirit on Do Hak-seong

24
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,090
suddenly possessed your body,

25
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,883
then you began to attack him.

26
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,094
Thanks to you, the whole thing ended.

27
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:25,139
I see. So some vengeful spirits
linger around people?

28
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,349
But then,

29
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,810
I'd be surprised
if he had no vengeful spirits

30
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,812
on him after all that he has done.

31
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,232
You promised you'd give us
an apartment unit.

32
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,109
-What?
-I set the place on fire

33
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,278
and killed people.

34
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,614
-Give me the apartment.
-The apartment…

35
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,575
Anyway, how did you end up
getting caught by them?

36
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,204
Man, if they didn't attack me
from behind, I would've…

37
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:16,274
KING-SIZED DUMPLING

38
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,127
If you're about
to take out your knife, don't.

39
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,004
You're the one who'll be hurt by it.

40
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,308
My story is similar to yours.

41
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,520
I thought you were invincible,
but you're rather sloppy.

42
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,440
Wait, come to think of it,

43
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,068
I already saved your life twice.

44
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:04,238
Man, just saying thank you
is not going to cut it this time.

45
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,116
Don't you think you owe me a nice suit?

46
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,576
Quit working as a psychic.

47
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,582
You're firing me to save on that suit?

48
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,584
It doesn't cost that much.

49
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,795
You'll get hurt
if you're with me. So quit.

50
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,838
Our contract will expire soon anyway.

51
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,092
I'm not going to sell my place
until I help my mom leave.

52
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,804
And something like this
is bound to happen again.

53
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,015
Then,

54
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,144
why are you unable to help your mother?

55
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,732
I remember you saying it's difficult
because her spirit is special.

56
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,152
It's always difficult to send away
an exorcist's spirit.

57
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,406
Until now, I thought
I just needed to find a powerful psychic.

58
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,993
But I really have no idea now.

59
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,664
What was she like?

60
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,959
I mean your mother, Ms. Hong.

61
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,504
She was pleasant,

62
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,924
cool, and nice.

63
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,847
That's why she died. She was too nice.

64
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,101
She passed away because she was too nice?

65
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,769
What do you mean?

66
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,065
-Her last client was…
-Help me.

67
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,693
an arsonist who killed seven people.

68
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,161
She passed away helping someone
who didn't deserve to be helped.

69
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,627
I'll never forgive them.

70
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:57,018
Maybe what Kim Tae-jin said is true.

71
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,270
That he always saw a ghost
near Daebak Realty.

72
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,813
Not you too!

73
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,358
I'm sorry, but…

74
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,860
Shut it! Go and get me

75
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,738
all the information you can find
on everyone at Daebak Realty!

76
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,449
-Don't leave anyone out!
-Yes, sir.

77
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,997
I could've come home alone.

78
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,795
Get some rest. I'm leaving.

79
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,381
Ms. Joo.

80
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,426
I'd like to meet Mr. Jung.

81
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,889
Why, all of a sudden?

82
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:39,060
I need to know what exactly happened
to my mother and if I'm missing anything.

83
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,730
I think Mr. Jung might know.

84
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,776
Okay, I'll give him a call.
We can go see him.

85
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,820
No, I'll meet him alone.

86
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,863
Good night.

87
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,663
CRIMINAL RECORD
HONG JI-A

88
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,123
So she's the CEO.

89
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,338
She may not have gone to jail,
but it's like she has seven priors.

90
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,633
Attempted fraud and blackmail.

91
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,303
Birds of a feather flock together.

92
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,765
They're a scamming team.

93
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,642
Who is this lovely woman?

94
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,394
You startled me.

95
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,437
It's nothing.

96
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:24,939
Don't lie.

97
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,483
You're obviously abusing your power

98
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,653
on a background check
on a woman you're interested in.

99
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,988
Cut that nonsense.

100
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,781
That's ridiculous.

101
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,157
I'll get back to work.

102
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,328
Why did you kill them?

103
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,289
Because they'd hold me back.

104
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,584
Isn't it obvious?

105
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,796
Ji-a will visit you.

106
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,049
Please don't let her look into the case

107
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,552
from 20 years ago.

108
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,305
Okay.

109
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,809
That woman didn't hesitate

110
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,020
to kill her own kids

111
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,523
for her own sake.

112
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,822
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

113
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,783
It's been a long time.

114
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,287
I barely recognized you.

115
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,080
It has.

116
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,629
I'd like to read the case file
from 20 years ago as well as the photos.

117
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,049
You're still just as direct.

118
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,553
But since your mother
wasn't a victim of a crime

119
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,764
and died of cardiac arrest,

120
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,643
her file has been discarded.

121
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,980
Why are you looking for something
that happened 20 years ago?

122
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,275
I recently remembered
something new from that night.

123
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,403
You were first
to arrive at the scene, right?

124
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,114
I was.

125
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,786
Could you tell me everything you remember?

126
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,373
Let's see. It's been quite a long time.

127
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,006
Nothing really stood out.

128
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,261
I just saw two adults and two kids
lying unconsciously.

129
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,475
It looked like any other realty office.

130
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,612
I'm sorry I couldn't be of much help.

131
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,286
A real estate agency
that specializes in haunted houses?

132
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,371
Yes, sir.

133
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:50,960
Also, Oh In-beom and Heo Ji-cheol
are frauds who fabricate hauntings.

134
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,711
Fabricate hauntings?

135
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,967
I knew it. Damn it.

136
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,928
How dare those brazen scumbags
mess with me?

137
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:05,766
And sir, it turns out that Oh In-beom
is Oh Seong-sik's nephew.

138
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,185
The arsonist of Yongnam Village
from 20 years ago.

139
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,520
Oh Seong-sik?

140
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:18,070
And the last place he went to
before he died is Daebak Realty.

141
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,822
What?

142
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,787
I really thought no one was there.
I'm telling you the truth! I am!

143
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,249
That spirit possessed my nephew!

144
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,168
I'm serious!

145
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:37,631
In-beom!

146
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,217
I should've died instead.

147
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,969
Please call the police.

148
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,555
Please call the police! Please!

149
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,767
I don't need any money or apartment.

150
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,231
Are you finally awake?

151
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,652
Sir.

152
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:03,240
You're hell-bent on letting everyone know,
aren't you?

153
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,993
You even asked for the police.

154
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,162
Why? To report me?

155
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,079
No, sir.

156
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,625
I'll never tell them
that you ordered me to do it.

157
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,754
I'm going to tell them I did it on my own
and pay for it.

158
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,422
Did someone talk you into this?

159
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,967
Did they say I'd give you more money
if you threatened me like this?

160
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,845
Threaten you? Not at all.

161
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,848
-No?
-I didn't tell a soul. I swear.

162
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,141
Please believe me!

163
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,519
I just can't bear the guilt.

164
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,396
I've taken many lives.

165
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:42,071
My goodness. I'm so softhearted.

166
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,410
Write that down.

167
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,665
THE FIRE AT YONGNAM VILLAGE
ON NOVEMBER 15 WAS MY DOING.

168
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,584
That's a written statement
that says you did it by yourself.

169
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,003
You need to give it to me
for me to believe you.

170
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,006
If you write that,
I'll still give you the apartment.

171
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,802
Really?

172
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,137
Okay. I'll do it right now.

173
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,438
THE FIRE AT YONGNAM VILLAGE
ON NOVEMBER 15 WAS MY DOING

174
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,957
Thank you, sir.

175
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,502
Don't worry about a thing, and rest up.

176
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,255
Dream about your new apartment.

177
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,382
I will. Thank you, sir.

178
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,050
Don't worry about it.

179
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,437
Sleep tight.

180
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,108
You promised you'd give us
an apartment unit.

181
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,068
-What?
-I set the place on fire

182
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,403
and killed people.

183
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,572
How did Oh In-beom know

184
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,824
about that?

185
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:14,288
Maybe he found the memorandum
that we had failed to find.

186
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,634
Read it after you're discharged.

187
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,594
The doctor said you needed to rest up.

188
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,514
MYSTERIOUS FIRE AT YONGNAM VILLAGE
KILLS 7 RESIDENTS

189
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,439
Goodness, sir. Let me help you.

190
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,900
-Thank you.
-Take it slowly.

191
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,110
In-beom, I'll be right back.

192
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,073
Her last client was

193
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,993
an arsonist who killed seven people.

194
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,871
My uncle would

195
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,165
never do such a thing.

196
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,168
Something's wrong.

197
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,465
ARSON SUSPECTED
AS THE CAUSE OF THE YONGNAM VILLAGE FIRE

198
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,097
I can't believe the Yongnam Village fire
happened 20 years ago.

199
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,306
Time flies.

200
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,852
Please tell me everything
that you remember.

201
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:24,024
To be honest, I can't believe
my uncle was an arsonist

202
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,026
and killed himself.

203
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,987
That's completely understandable.

204
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,156
We also suspected
Golden Construction at first

205
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,659
since they were determined
to redevelop the area.

206
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:39,832
It was also odd that Chairman Do Hak-seong
had visited Mr. Oh right before his death.

207
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,043
Did you just say "Do Hak-seong"?

208
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,313
CEREMONY FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF GOLDEN APARTMENT

209
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,401
CEREMONY FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT
OF GOLDEN APARTMENT

210
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,018
Why would Ms. Joo meet

211
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,771
with Do Hak-seong's secretary?

212
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,381
You're actually back.

213
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,675
What kind of hello is that?

214
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,804
I expected you to quit
after what happened.

215
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:22,351
Ms. Hong would have a hard time
without her special psychic.

216
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,645
I shouldn't quit because of such a mishap.

217
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,066
A responsible fraud?

218
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,822
Were you at Dohak Construction
this afternoon?

219
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,616
I think I saw you there.

220
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,121
Judging by your reaction, I'm right.

221
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,123
Does Ms. Hong know?

222
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,875
No. She doesn't.

223
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,796
She also doesn't know
you're Oh Seong-sik's nephew.

224
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't know why you approached us,

225
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,595
but keep your mouth shut
and leave once your contract ends.

226
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,643
You know who I am
but haven't told Ms. Hong.

227
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,189
You must have an ulterior motive.

228
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,356
It's chilly in here. Is it just me?

229
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,905
Hello.

230
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,953
Is this the real estate agency
that deals with haunted houses?

231
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,168
Well, the house belongs to my mother.

232
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,962
We want to sell it
because they say it's haunted.

233
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,672
Did you see the spirit yourself?

234
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,341
No. We don't live there.

235
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,052
But apparently, the son of the tenants
was possessed by it.

236
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,304
Gosh. There's no such thing.

237
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,057
He was sick to begin with.

238
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,271
All right. Let's go inside
and look at our new house.

239
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,402
Is that you, Jun-seo?

240
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,002
Jun-seo.

241
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,631
What are you doing in the dark?

242
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,704
Anyway, because of the rumor
that our house is haunted,

243
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,082
no one comes
to buy it even if we try to sell it.

244
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,918
And other realtors suggest
we lower the price by half.

245
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,754
You guys will help us sell it
at a market price, right?

246
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,006
Ms. Yoo Yeong-sun?

247
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,758
Yes?

248
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,302
Will you sell the house?

249
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,430
What? Yes, she will.

250
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,015
Why are you asking my mom?

251
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,600
The house belongs to her.

252
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,978
I must ask the owner
if she wants to sell it.

253
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,897
How could you put it like that?

254
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,567
Are you insinuating
that we're trying to take her house?

255
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,278
Mom, why won't you say anything?

256
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,364
Tell her you want to sell it.

257
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,199
I…

258
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:38,166
Because you act like this,
she thinks we're taking advantage of you.

259
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,628
I want to sell it. I do.

260
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,630
Gosh.

261
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,175
Okay.

262
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,849
DAEBAK REALTY

263
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,518
Watch your head.

264
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,940
Hey. One second.

265
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,067
What?

266
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,863
Can she stay with you next month too?

267
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,700
What are you talking about?
We agreed to take turns every month.

268
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,494
Do-hyeon's on edge during the exam period.

269
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:18,582
No, I can't.
If I do that, my wife will kick me out.

270
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,542
Isn't she being so selfish?

271
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,878
She's such a terrible daughter-in-law.

272
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,462
And you're a good daughter?

273
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,965
You're just pretending to care
to get the inheritance.

274
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,133
Hey!

275
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,221
Then is the boy
who was possessed by the spirit

276
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,432
a psychic like me?

277
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,435
I'll have to check myself,
but it's highly likely.

278
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,481
I think the spirit was always there,
but its energy was too weak to be shown,

279
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,067
but it stated
to be seen after it met a psychic.

280
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,959
Hey. The house is haunted, right?

281
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,585
-There was a spirit, right?
-Yes.

282
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,089
My secretary will call you
to schedule an exorcism.

283
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,550
My boy is sick.

284
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:38,096
We moved here since living in a place
with good air might improve his health.

285
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,265
I should've checked more thoroughly.

286
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,225
Does he have a place to stay?

287
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,729
Until we find a replacement,
we'll stay with his aunt.

288
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,731
That's good. Let's go.

289
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,830
This is for you. You can keep it.

290
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,917
I went through
a lot of weird stuff like you.

291
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,837
But after wearing this necklace,
they stopped happening.

292
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,310
Consider it a shield
that protects your character in games.

293
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,271
So don't take off this necklace
no matter what.

294
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,356
Can you do that?

295
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,324
What are you doing?

296
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,661
How could you take off the necklace?
Have you no fear?

297
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,998
You know there's a vengeful spirit
in there. What if you get possessed?

298
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,334
You said that the spirit had weak energy.

299
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,629
Besides, you're right here with me.
I'm sure you'll help me.

300
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,546
What?

301
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,636
Think about that boy. He'd have kept
getting possessed without knowing why.

302
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,970
How could I just ignore it?

303
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,766
Not everyone born with the ability
becomes a psychic.

304
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,770
Usually, when boys like him
get girlfriends or date girls,

305
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,355
they become normal.

306
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,107
"Usually"?

307
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,320
What do you mean by that?

308
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,073
What… What do you mean?

309
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,328
Tell me. What do you mean?

310
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,039
-Tell me.
-Shut your mouth and get in.

311
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,208
Come on.

312
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,338
This is a very old house.

313
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,258
At first, Ms. Yoo's family lived
in the house.

314
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,926
But since 50 years ago,

315
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,386
they've left the house vacant

316
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,180
or rented it out,
so it's had many tenants.

317
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,142
I have put together

318
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,894
a list of old tenants who have died
from the 1960s to now.

319
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,814
In 1979, an old man
who rented Ms. Yoo's house died

320
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,484
when he lost his footing at the reservoir.
And in 1993, after Ms. Yoo left…

321
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,319
It's none of these people.

322
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,863
What?

323
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,032
Right, you saw their face.

324
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,617
What about you, Ms. Joo?

325
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,412
The police in the area are helping me,

326
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,540
but it'll take a while
since we don't know when exactly he died.

327
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,334
I'll meet some elderly people in the town
starting tomorrow.

328
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,503
Then I'll go meet Ms. Yoo Yeong-sun.

329
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,963
Where does she live?

330
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,549
She said she'd be
at her daughter's place this week.

331
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,386
You haven't lived in that house
for 50 years now.

332
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,721
Is there a reason?

333
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,807
I find it odd that you haven't live there

334
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,477
or sold it for 50 years.

335
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,105
And you were hesitant
about selling it the other day.

336
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,319
Many people keep their property
as an investment too.

337
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,862
You know,

338
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,993
I don't even know
how my father passed away.

339
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:53,291
The year I turned 20,
my father fell ill with a stroke.

340
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,212
Then he was diagnosed with dementia
after two years.

341
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,632
You've never showed up
since our father collapsed,

342
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,926
and you want to sell this house now?

343
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,094
I really think this business will hit big.

344
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:09,599
Do you know how much you lost trying
to run a business? Come to your senses!

345
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,519
Half of the share will be mine
once Dad passes.

346
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,853
I just want it in advance.

347
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,730
-It's not your money.
-He's still alive.

348
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,482
He doesn't even recognize me!

349
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:24,113
How is that any different from being dead?
Instead of keeping him at home,

350
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,991
you should get him into a nursing home.

351
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,117
Get out!

352
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,829
You're not my brother or family anymore.

353
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,996
Get out of here!

354
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:03,611
That night,
my father suddenly disappeared.

355
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,782
It probably wasn't easy
for him to even walk because his stroke.

356
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,826
He disappeared.

357
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,747
I'm sure Yeong-sik killed him
for his money.

358
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,792
Goodness, no matter how much
he was blinded by money,

359
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,586
he'd never kill his father.

360
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,463
He could do that and worse.

361
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,091
Even before graduated from high school,

362
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,844
he sold off his late mother's jewelry
to start a business.

363
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,388
Then did the police not suspect him?

364
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,472
They did.

365
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,809
But his father's body wasn't found,
and there was no evidence.

366
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,810
What could they do?

367
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,314
-So there was no evidence.
-He must've felt guilty.

368
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,026
He ran off as soon as he got released,
and has never come back.

369
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,737
If that's not the proof,
what is? Don't you think?

370
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,739
I think that might be the case.

371
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,867
Where did you bury him?
Just tell me where his body is.

372
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,828
-Tell me!
-Stop it. How would I know?

373
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,123
Yeong-sik, please.
We need to give him a funeral.

374
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,416
How could you…

375
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,880
Yeong-sik!

376
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,383
Since that day,

377
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,012
I haven't been able to bring myself

378
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,849
to live in that house or sold it.

379
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,437
This is a photo I took
at my graduation ceremony.

380
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,356
I always keep it with me.

381
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,320
My other albums are at my son's place.

382
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,786
What did your father like?

383
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,747
He had a sweet tooth.

384
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,459
He loved chocolate,
candies, and sweet snacks.

385
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,964
He'd buy those treats
without my mom knowing.

386
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,145
That's an expensive apartment.

387
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:05,191
But why does it
look like a jail, not a home?

388
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,290
YOO CHEOL-GU

389
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,755
Why are you taking so much sugar?

390
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,133
Because I need it.

391
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:32,760
My gosh.

392
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,013
You're not the one who has to carry it.

393
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,600
BROWN SUGAR

394
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,157
-I think you have the wrong bait.
-Shut it.

395
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,828
It's here. The ants are here.

396
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,872
-You called ants here.
-And cockroaches.

397
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,832
Where? My gosh!

398
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,959
That was so mean!

399
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,535
Take your necklace off.

400
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,408
-What's he doing?
-I think he came back to himself.

401
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,378
You can just leave it.

402
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,591
Dad, let me draw you a bath.

403
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,239
You look great, Dad.

404
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,616
Thank you, ma'am.

405
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,202
I appreciate it.

406
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,583
He doesn't even recognize me!

407
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,503
You should get him into a nursing home.

408
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,629
Get out!

409
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,299
You're not my brother or family anymore.

410
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,216
Get out of here!

411
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,414
Dad.

412
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,002
I'm sorry.

413
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,339
I just felt so bad

414
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,633
for Yeong-sun. That's all.

415
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,262
I'm sorry, Dad.

416
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,132
You look great, Dad.

417
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,236
In-beom.

418
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,656
In-beom, where are you going?

419
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,782
In-beom.

420
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,908
RESTRICTED ACCESS

421
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,539
This is it.

422
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,376
-What do you mean?
-He threw himself down the well.

423
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,130
He struggled to walk

424
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,757
all the way here from his house

425
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,844
and killed himself.

426
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,641
So?

427
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:42,690
Are you going to whine and tell me
that Ms. Yoo should know the truth?

428
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,317
Do you think you're God?

429
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,988
Reading a vengeful spirit's
memories doesn't

430
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,824
give you the right
to meddle in people's lives.

431
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,576
-I'm not trying to be God.
-Then?

432
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,789
Remember what she told us?

433
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,668
She doesn't even know
how her father passed away.

434
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,133
I also don't know
how my uncle passed away.

435
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,972
You heartless brat.

436
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,684
I know how painful it feels not to know
why someone you love had to die,

437
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,605
and to have to force yourself
to accept it and move on.

438
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,565
I do.

439
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:31,238
If I were her, I'd want to know the truth

440
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,033
no matter how horrible it may be.

441
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:42,249
DAEBAK REALTY

442
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,212
You once asked me

443
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,173
what kind of person I was.

444
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,222
When I first started this job,

445
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,474
I was just like you.

446
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,857
I thought it was right to tell them
the truth I had witnessed.

447
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,778
That it'd relieve
the vengeful spirits' grudges.

448
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,739
However…

449
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,659
What did you just say?

450
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,661
My son killed my wife?

451
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,331
He's only in middle school.

452
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,750
How could you make up such a thing
for money?

453
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,920
I will sue you for fraud!

454
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,599
-Goodness.
-Excuse me.

455
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,017
EMERGENCY SERVICE

456
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,107
Goodness. He killed his son
then committed suicide.

457
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,067
Why would he kill his son as well?

458
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,195
-What did that boy do so wrong?
-Tell me about it.

459
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,866
That's when I promised myself
not to interfere in their lives

460
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,705
no matter what I learned
during the exorcisms.

461
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,170
Just because you mean well
doesn't mean it ends well.

462
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,047
In fact,

463
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,800
most of the time it ends badly.

464
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,719
Then,

465
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,097
I'd like to at least tell her
where his body is.

466
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,225
We can do that much, right?

467
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,766
They must've found the body by now.

468
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,565
Does it bother you?

469
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,945
I can't help but see myself
in Ms. Yoo Yeong-sun.

470
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:23,243
I've wasted the past 20 years of my life
because I didn't know the truth.

471
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:29,958
Is it right to let her keep
believing something that's not true?

472
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,672
At times, the truth is more painful.

473
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,605
KSCI

474
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:23,554
I had no idea you were so close.

475
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,435
You must've been so cold.

476
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,649
You must've been so cold.

477
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,049
How did you take
such good care of the house?

478
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,554
It's rare to find
such an old but beautiful house.

479
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:09,016
This is a perfect place to raise children
since it's surrounded by nature.

480
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,895
What? Oh In-beom?

481
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,898
What are you doing here?

482
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,737
We Daebak Realty try our best to make sure

483
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,823
our houses are always
in tip-top condition.

484
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,575
I'm so grateful.

485
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,621
In-beom.

486
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,581
Hey, snap out of it.

487
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,963
Ms. Hong, I'll give them a house tour.

488
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,298
Sure.

489
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,133
-Shall we?
-No.

490
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,135
I'll wait here.

491
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,596
-Feel free to look around.
-Okay.

492
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,805
-Okay.
-Okay.

493
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,140
This way.

494
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,355
The trees have grown so much.

495
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,526
I heard my father planted them
the year I was born.

496
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,448
Nothing has changed.

497
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,077
Only I have aged.

498
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,000
Out here, I'd make snowmen in winter

499
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,587
and have watermelon in summer.

500
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,591
This house holds

501
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,219
so many fond memories.

502
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,058
Don't you want to look

503
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,810
for your brother?

504
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,358
If you want, we can help you find him.

505
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,652
My brother died 50 years ago.

506
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:48,907
Don't you just love how it was renovated?

507
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,784
You can move in right away.

508
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,455
Did you look around the house thoroughly?

509
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,209
Yes. I will talk to my husband
one more time and call you.

510
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,420
Sure. Take your time making your decision.

511
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,839
-Okay.
-Shall we get going?

512
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,883
No. I'm going to stay here for a bit more.

513
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,886
Today might be my last day here.

514
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,514
-Okay. I will call you soon.
-Okay.

515
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,544
You're still here.

516
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,466
Your brother didn't kill your father.

517
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,553
Pardon? What are you
talking about all of a sudden?

518
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:38,058
I'm telling you the truth which we came
across while exorcising this house.

519
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,185
Your father

520
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,397
took his own life.

521
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,609
Why are you telling me such a lie?

522
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,945
I'm not lying.

523
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,533
That's the last memory your father
held onto down to his last moment.

524
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:58,078
With that memory,
we were able to find his body.

525
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,046
Your brother

526
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,465
wasn't after the inheritance.

527
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,928
He just wasn't good at expressing himself.

528
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,222
He felt so bad for you
going through the trouble.

529
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,476
And your father knew
how truly your brother felt.

530
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,272
The fact that he was a burden
on his children

531
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,191
caused him more pain than his illness.

532
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,778
So when he was lucid,

533
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,365
he decided to end his own life.

534
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,621
Even until the last moment,

535
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,291
all he ever wanted
was for you two to be happy.

536
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:50,005
If he knew that
you guys would be strangers for 50 years,

537
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:51,923
he would not have

538
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,259
made that decision.

539
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,137
Ma'am.

540
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,889
I see.

541
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,726
Thank you for telling me.

542
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,769
Ma'am!

543
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,399
I am sorry.

544
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,110
You are sorry? That's it?

545
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:16,573
What if my mom dies?
What will you do then?

546
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,783
Darn it.

547
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:21,203
Mom. Wake up!

548
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,705
Mom…

549
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,292
Mom. Wake up.

550
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,428
Are you okay?

551
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,562
Why did you do that?

552
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,649
That wasn't like you.
I'm the troublemaker between us.

553
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,652
-Hey.
-He's here.

554
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,323
Sir.

555
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,827
This is Ms. Hong Ji-a,
the CEO of Daebak Realty.

556
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,786
I see.

557
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,415
Hello. I'm Yoo Yeong-sik.

558
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,116
The visiting hours are over, sir.

559
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,023
Yeong-sik.

560
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,653
Yeong-sun. Do you recognize me?

561
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,906
Now that you are old,

562
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,992
you look just like Dad.

563
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,202
I came too late, didn't I?

564
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,788
I'm sorry.

565
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,917
No. Thank you for coming.

566
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,297
And I'm so sorry.

567
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,800
I was young
and didn't know any better then.

568
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,261
I only made things worse for you.

569
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,185
Thank you. Thank you for coming to see me.

570
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,738
DAEBAK REALTY

571
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:05,367
I must have scared you dearly.

572
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,077
No.

573
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,374
Thank you so much
for making a great recovery.

574
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,792
Right.

575
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,669
That day,

576
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,923
I never got to thank you
before I collapsed.

577
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,425
I am sorry about that.

578
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,971
I'd be lying if I told you

579
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:29,265
that I wasn't shocked
when I heard what you said.

580
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:34,312
But now that I am a mother and older,

581
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,524
I can understand why my father

582
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,234
made that decision.

583
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,864
Thank you.

584
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:50,787
Thank you for not letting me
resent my brother until I die.

585
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:57,043
I'm sorry to do this to you,
but I don't think I can sell the house.

586
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,130
I want to spend my remaining time
in the house

587
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,048
where I have so many

588
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,092
childhood memories.

589
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:08,013
I'm sure your father will be very happy.

590
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,806
Okay.

591
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,065
Lighten up. Everything ended well.

592
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,365
By the way, why did you really do it?

593
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:32,495
You told me never to get involved in their
lives after exorcisms.

594
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,957
Why did you
suddenly tell Ms. Yoo the truth?

595
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,711
Your nosy quality
must have rubbed off on me.

596
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,922
So you're giving me all the credit.

597
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,551
Yes. You deserve all the credit.

598
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,389
That was unexpected.
Are you trying to make my heart flutter?

599
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,728
No. Right after you thanked me
the other day,

600
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,938
you told me to go into the water.

601
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,482
What's the catch?

602
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,525
What will you make me do now?

603
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,027
There's no catch.

604
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,039
I've thought about it.

605
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,918
Helping her find out the truth
about her late father was nice.

606
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:24,672
But helping Ms. Yoo reconcile
with her brother made me happier.

607
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,009
She'll be able to live
without resentment now.

608
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,430
-We don't do exorcisms
-We don't do exorcisms

609
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,599
-just for vengeful spirits,
-just for vengeful spirits,

610
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,770
but also for the people left behind.

611
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:42,023
They must go on with their lives.

612
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,110
Yes. I was just about to say that.

613
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,278
That's a nice lesson.

614
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,031
She was a good exorcist.

615
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,413
My mother used to say that all the time
when I was young.

616
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,501
Back then, I didn't understand
what she meant by that.

617
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,510
Are you sure you can live here
all by yourself?

618
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,847
Goodness. I still got
a few good years left in me!

619
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,935
Living alone would be great.
It'll be very relaxing.

620
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,812
You should come by often.

621
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,855
Okay.

622
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,649
-You got it, Yeong-sun.
-Okay.

623
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,192
DAEBAK REALTY

624
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,110
WITHDRAWN

625
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,487
Forget about hitting the jackpot.
We'll go broke.

626
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,906
Two cases have been canceled in a row.

627
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,659
Some days are just bad days.

628
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,912
RECORD OF EXORCISM: 2021

629
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,720
RECORD OF EXORCISM: 1980

630
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,889
RECORD OF EXORCISM: 1978

631
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,435
Only the record from 1979 is missing.

632
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,524
What?

633
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,944
What's going on?

634
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,197
Darn it.

635
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,147
RECORD OF EXORCISM: 1979

636
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,441
At times,

637
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,110
the truth is more painful.

638
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,031
Did you give it a thought?

639
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,533
I told you to quit working as a psychic.

640
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,952
Aren't you the one
who'd miss having me around?

641
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,413
Do you know
that your theme today is very odd?

642
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,039
-You seemed cute, that's all.
-Shut up.

643
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,958
-Hold me.
-Do not move.

644
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,918
-It's right behind you.
-Will you be alright?

645
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,795
I don't think Ji-a will give up easily.

646
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,630
If she finds out anything…

647
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,382
I won't let that happen.

648
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,220
I'm the only one who looks
into the Record of Exorcism.

649
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,472
One of my grandmother's
Records of Exorcism is gone.

650
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,308
Did you take it?
