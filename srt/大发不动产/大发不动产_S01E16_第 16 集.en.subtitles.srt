1
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,512
We did it.

2
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,183
That's a relief.

3
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,280
-Hello?
-Did it go well?

4
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,366
Ms. Joo. We're done with the exorcism.

5
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,327
We did it.

6
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,750
-Thank you.
-All right.

7
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,004
Great work. Great work, really.

8
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,216
Ms. Hong.

9
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,258
SECRETARY JOO HWA-JEONG

10
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,427
Ms. Hong, are you there?

11
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,720
SECRETARY JOO HWA-JEONG

12
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,971
Ji-a.

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,181
Ji-a?

14
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,517
I warned you.

15
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,395
This is what you get

16
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,981
for making an enemy of me.

17
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,367
Did you think you could mess with me

18
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,619
and get away with it? Did you?

19
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,506
What the…

20
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,134
You bastard.

21
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,279
-Hey!
-You bastard!

22
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,281
Darn it.

23
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,784
Ji-a!

24
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,744
Oh, no!

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,954
In-beom!

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,331
In-beom!

27
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,550
-Hey, I'm going to pee.
-Where are you going?

28
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,759
-Okay.
-All right.

29
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,346
What's your problem?

30
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,892
Wait. Hey.

31
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,812
You should apologize for hitting me.

32
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,856
Let me go, you bastard!

33
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,737
-Are you okay?
-What's your problem?

34
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,573
-Get him.
-Wait.

35
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,411
Let go of it, you scum!

36
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,081
Hey. He hit me!

37
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,917
-Hey!
-Get him!

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,377
-Hey! Get him!
-Get him!

39
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,299
Let go!

40
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,721
Are you looking down on us
because we're homeless?

41
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,890
Let go, you scumbag!

42
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,300
Hurry up! Wake up, Ms. Hong!

43
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,511
-See you at the hospital.
-Okay!

44
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,055
Hurry up! Hurry!

45
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,823
In-beom!

46
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,826
Please save him!

47
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,706
Please save him!

48
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,878
Please get an OR ready
for immediate surgery. Thank you.

49
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,516
Don't die.

50
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,395
Don't die.

51
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,525
-Sir, are you awake?
-In-beom.

52
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,444
Are you okay?

53
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,405
What?

54
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,285
What's going on?

55
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:26,344
RESTRICTED AREA

56
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,678
OPERATING ROOM

57
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,198
Mom.

58
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,002
Are you feeling okay?

59
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,556
A centimeter deeper,
and it could've been life-threatening.

60
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,142
How's In-beom doing?

61
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,356
Don't tell me he's still unconscious.

62
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,822
According to the ambulance driver,

63
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,824
the car suddenly malfunctioned,

64
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,535
so they lost control of it and crashed.

65
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,120
When he regained consciousness,

66
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,080
In-beom had already disappeared.

67
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,875
Did you say Do Hak-seong died
while running away?

68
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,834
Correct.

69
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,880
His body's been found in an underpass
near Sky Building.

70
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,631
We believe he fell down the stairs.

71
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,009
It was a freak accident,

72
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,052
but I think karma got to him.

73
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,432
I think his vengeful spirit
has possessed In-beom.

74
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,352
But he's wearing his necklace.

75
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,315
It broke during the exorcism.

76
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,145
I've analyzed all the footage

77
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,857
from CCTVs within a 20km radius
of the scene of the accident.

78
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,700
Electronic devices malfunction
when a ghost is around.

79
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,661
So I connected all CCTV cameras

80
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,081
that had temporarily malfunctioned
for no apparent reason.

81
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,418
I think he's headed to our office.

82
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,461
You're right.

83
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,713
Do Hak-seong wants to kill me.

84
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,592
Because he failed
and became a vengeful spirit.

85
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,264
This is infuriating.

86
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,849
How dare he turn into a vengeful spirit

87
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,143
after all the evil deeds he committed?

88
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,854
First,

89
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,232
let's ask the police for help.

90
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,859
He's an evil spirit who's out to get you.

91
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,987
-Who knows what he'll do?
-No, not the police.

92
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,323
What if the vengeful spirit
gets caught red-handed?

93
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,367
Then In-beom will go to prison.

94
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,035
That won't happen.

95
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,453
Don't worry.

96
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,549
DAEBAK REALTY

97
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,402
Ms. Hong.

98
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,864
It's not too late to reconsider.

99
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,742
You can't hold your own in that state.

100
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,080
Let's leave it to the police for now.

101
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,583
Then we'll think about
how to save In-beom.

102
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,418
I'll get help from everyone I know.

103
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,296
I made a promise to him
during our first exorcism.

104
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,467
You'll never wake up
with bloody hands again.

105
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,927
I won't let that happen. I promise.

106
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,648
I must keep my promise.

107
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,782
Where is he?

108
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,991
He's almost there.

109
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,160
Okay.

110
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,937
I think he'll arrive
at Daebak in five minutes.

111
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,815
Okay. Stop following him
and go somewhere safe.

112
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,692
Okay, I will.

113
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,829
Hey! You…

114
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,415
Why are you walking on the road?

115
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,333
Have you gone mad? Are you crazy?

116
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,759
No, In-beom. Stop!

117
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,474
In-beom…

118
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,400
What…

119
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,539
In-beom…

120
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,667
In-beom.

121
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,589
DAEBAK REALTY

122
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,908
In-beom.

123
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,660
Are you in there?

124
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,336
No.

125
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:23,881
No.

126
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,006
I got you.

127
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,060
Did you think
I would let you go that easily?

128
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,859
DO HAK-SEONG

129
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,453
DO HAK-SEONG

130
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:26,503
Repent all the crimes you have committed

131
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,006
as your bones burn in the blazing fire

132
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,133
forever.

133
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,273
Come out!

134
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,235
In-beom. Are you in there?

135
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,157
No.

136
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,826
No.

137
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,750
Ms. Hong.

138
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,170
You woke up. Are you all right?

139
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,473
I heard.

140
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,018
That Do Hak-seong's spirit possessed me

141
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,270
and tried to kill you.

142
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,564
I almost

143
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,900
killed you.

144
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,610
No.

145
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,867
You saved me.

146
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:45,953
Pardon?

147
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,415
You were possessed,
but you resisted the evil spirit.

148
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,709
So I was able to finish the exorcism.

149
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,839
Thank you.

150
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,221
Thank you

151
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,556
for staying alive.

152
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,738
Ms. Joo.

153
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,158
-Did you have lunch?
-Yes. I just did.

154
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,536
I heard there's a great makguksu
restaurant nearby.

155
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,704
I just ate there.

156
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,163
That sounds delicious, right?

157
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,126
By the way, how did you hurt your hand?

158
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,961
It looks like it got burned.

159
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,005
What happened?

160
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,132
The aftereffect of sealing the spirit.

161
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,426
Sealing the spirit?

162
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,054
The method you were going
to use on the egg ghost?

163
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,683
I didn't want Do Hak-seong
to dissipate without any pain.

164
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,938
He'll feel burning pain
all over his body for eternity.

165
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,736
That's a glorious injury, then.

166
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,084
Hey.

167
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,502
How's Ms. Hong?

168
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,046
She'll be discharged in a week.

169
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,925
Goodness,
it must be a lot of work for you.

170
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,051
It's not bad.

171
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,231
-Ji-cheol.
-Yes?

172
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,774
Thanks.

173
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,194
What? For what?

174
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,154
I heard you hurt your arm

175
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,989
because of me.

176
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,785
No, I slipped in the bathroom.

177
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,995
Ms. Joo told me.

178
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,582
You stopped me from hurting other people
while I was possessed.

179
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,502
I can't believe her.

180
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,131
I knew you'd feel bad,
so I asked her not to tell you.

181
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,801
-Ji-cheol.
-Yes?

182
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,970
Did I ever tell you that I love you?

183
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,931
What's gotten into you? You're scaring me.

184
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,684
Someone told me

185
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,146
I should say thanks when I'm grateful,
and say sorry when I feel bad.

186
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,108
And if I love someone,
I need to tell them that I do.

187
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,652
Not to turn into vengeful spirits.

188
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,279
Ji-cheol.

189
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,073
Thank you, and I love you. Lots.

190
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:11,908
My gosh!

191
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,703
Hey, I just got goosebumps. Look.

192
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,539
You really surprised me. My gosh.

193
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,333
-Man.
-My gosh.

194
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,502
Hey, I feel great. Take these.

195
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,339
Aren't these from Su-jeong?

196
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,759
No, I bought them. I wouldn't give you
something my baby gave me.

197
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,609
You bought a lot of these.

198
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,196
Ever since I got these as gifts,
I've only been wearing them.

199
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,448
-I can't wear anything else now.
-Really?

200
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,119
You travel back and forth between here
and the hospital. You need more underwear.

201
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,495
I got a lot, so don't worry.

202
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,497
-Thanks.
-Me too.

203
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,960
Thank you, and I love you.

204
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,795
Lots.

205
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,890
Doesn't it feel like time is flying?

206
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,768
It was freezing when we first met,

207
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,811
but it's summer now.

208
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,699
What's on your mind?

209
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,577
Once I get discharged tomorrow,

210
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,207
I want to give another shot
at letting my mom go.

211
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,252
Will you help me?

212
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,379
Of course.

213
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,507
It won't be easy

214
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,719
because I hurt her.

215
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,773
She hasn't shown herself since that day.

216
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,319
She must be furious with me.

217
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,363
I don't think she's furious.

218
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,699
She must be heartbroken.

219
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,036
I'm sure she knows how you feel.

220
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,290
She's your mom.

221
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,287
What's wrong?

222
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,080
Is there

223
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,624
a vengeful spirit around here?

224
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,752
No, I don't know.

225
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,296
I don't see anything.

226
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,270
Is something wrong?

227
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,363
You're back!

228
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,032
Congratulations! You finally…

229
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,955
Did something happen?

230
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,251
Let her be alone for a while.

231
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,318
Then, no one
has to sacrifice their life, right?

232
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,280
The exorcist will suffer
some aftereffects.

233
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,115
That's why we don't usually do it.

234
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,951
What do I do now?

235
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,208
What do I do, Mom?

236
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,173
I have to put you to rest.

237
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,389
She was

238
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,309
just getting better
physically and emotionally.

239
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,687
What if she breaks down like last time?

240
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,439
I'm worried.

241
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,233
She'll overcome it.

242
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,652
Ji-a is

243
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,030
much stronger than you think she is,
Hwa-jeong.

244
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,741
How is she?

245
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,705
Let's give her some time.
I'm sure she's sorting things out.

246
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:37,418
Gosh. I can't believe
her exorcism powers are lost.

247
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,006
Gosh! Do Hak-seong,
that disgusting scumbag.

248
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,718
He's a pain in the butt
even after being exorcized.

249
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,055
Wait a minute. Hey.

250
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,766
You still have your psychic ability.

251
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,729
Can't you just get possessed by her
and get stabbed with the needle?

252
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,566
I think we can put her to rest that way.

253
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,360
If someone without exorcism powers
stabs a psychic,

254
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,486
the psychic will die.

255
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,930
Are you going somewhere?

256
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,350
Let's go eat.

257
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:40,940
It looks delicious.

258
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,667
Eat up.

259
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:12,430
It's my fault I took
the aftereffects of sealing a spirit

260
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,890
lightly.

261
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,436
But I don't regret it.

262
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,774
Do Hak-seong deserved
such a cruel punishment.

263
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,943
Even if I could turn back time,

264
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,112
I'd make the same decision.

265
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,280
You're right.

266
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,702
And come to think of it,

267
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,581
no one has ever said
that the aftereffects are permanent.

268
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,335
Then you might regain
your powers over time?

269
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,419
There's no guarantee.

270
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,589
So I can't just sit back
and wait for them to come back.

271
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,549
I'm going to look for a way.

272
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,426
We'll help you.

273
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,395
What is this?

274
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:05,024
Gosh, that's hot!

275
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,736
This is something martial artists do.

276
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,740
It's called the Iron Palm. It's something
masters do when they lack strength.

277
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,284
And I've replaced the sand with salt.

278
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,663
You want me to put my hand in this?

279
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,541
-Have you gone insane?
-Give it a try.

280
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,458
Who knows?

281
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,130
So this is not it.

282
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,306
Boosting your vigor could solve it.

283
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,111
This proves
that your vigor isn't the problem.

284
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,118
I'll be counting down from ten.

285
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,120
And you will

286
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,289
go back to the past.

287
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,250
Go back

288
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,919
and retrieve your powers.

289
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,298
Ten,

290
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,341
nine…

291
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,718
Go back to the past.

292
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,472
-Eight…
-There's a tunnel.

293
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:23,227
On the other side of the tunnel is

294
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,979
a big flower bed.

295
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,233
It's pretty.

296
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,111
I didn't know
there was a flower bed in his heart.

297
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,573
How fragrant.

298
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,874
Are you okay?

299
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,376
What do you mean?

300
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,712
You're struggling.

301
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,676
When I was young,

302
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,888
I'd pray every single day

303
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,682
that I'd stop seeing vengeful spirits.

304
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,104
I didn't want my exorcism powers.

305
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,273
I wanted to get rid of them.

306
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,614
I hated myself for being different
from others. I wanted to be normal.

307
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,036
But now that I've really lost the powers,

308
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,165
I think I'm nothing without them.

309
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,003
Ms. Hong.

310
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,340
Don't worry.

311
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,804
I won't blame myself
or get disheartened again.

312
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,891
I haven't found a way yet,

313
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,895
but I will retrieve my powers

314
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,772
and put my mom to rest.

315
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,694
I know you will.

316
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,043
Goodness. You brought so much.

317
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,673
We left in such a hurry

318
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,342
and couldn't even say goodbye properly.

319
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,095
I couldn't thank you either.

320
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,847
You did that day.

321
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,807
Did I?

322
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,269
Thanks to you,

323
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,981
I was able to feed my boy one last time.

324
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,817
That had always been
something I regretted.

325
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,907
I'm truly grateful.

326
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,243
Chang-hwa.

327
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,245
I'm sorry.

328
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,208
This is the last meal I've cooked for you.

329
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,169
I hope you enjoy it

330
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,796
and go to a better place.

331
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,077
Ms. Joo.

332
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,161
Yes?

333
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,541
I think I can put my mom to rest.

334
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,087
Did you get your powers back?

335
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:44,095
No. I'm going to try it without the needle
like I did with Chang-hwa.

336
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,892
The moment she let go
of her obsession over her son,

337
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,186
the vengeful spirit left on its own.

338
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,981
Are you saying her obsession
kept his spirit from leaving?

339
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,986
And I'm the one keeping
my mom from leaving as well.

340
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,571
My reluctance to let her go,

341
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,742
my resentment toward her
for leaving me behind,

342
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,329
and my guilt for killing her.

343
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,416
It wasn't your fault.

344
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,126
I know.

345
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,504
Nevertheless,

346
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,717
I couldn't let go
of the reluctance and resentment.

347
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,681
After exorcizing the egg ghost,

348
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,935
I finally understood
why my mom made that decision.

349
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,690
Although I can't agree with her decision,

350
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,278
I can now at least understand her.

351
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:49,243
That's why I think
I can finally let her go.

352
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,998
Though it took too long.

353
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,542
That's natural.

354
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,254
Letting go of your beloved

355
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,423
is always painful.

356
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,944
CHINESE CHARACTER DICTIONARY

357
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,655
What are you doing?

358
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,951
I'm trying to find a way
to retrieve your powers,

359
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:35,414
but your ancestors aren't helpful.
Why is everything in Chinese characters?

360
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,543
On top of that, a lot of them
aren't even in the dictionary.

361
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,630
In-beom.

362
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,385
Help me perform an exorcism.

363

00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,677
Take off your necklace.

366
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,694
Ji-a.

367
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,786
Mom.

368
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,958
Yes, it's me.

369
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,795
Mom.

370
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,132
Mom…

371
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,346
Mom…

372
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,266
My baby.

373
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,811
My beautiful daughter.

374
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,195
Mom.

375
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,824
Mom…

376
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm sorry, Mom.

377
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,501
I made you stay here.

378
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,464
I made you suffer in cold

379
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,552
and stopped you from leaving me.

380
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,388
I'm so sorry, Mom.

381
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,892
No. I was so happy

382
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,689
since I got to see you grow up
by your side.

383
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,027
Thank you

384
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,988
for growing up
into a fine lady without me.

385
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,408
I've been proud of you every single day.

386
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,001
I should

387
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:50,878
go now.

388
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,549
Can you tell that boy that I'm sorry?

389
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,260
He had done nothing wrong,

390
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,804
but I almost took his life.

391
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,392
Mom. No, don't go.

392
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,145
No. Please don't go. Please stay.

393
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,273
I must go.

394
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,319
I can't stay here forever like this.

395
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,820
You know that.

396
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,032
I don't care about that. Mom…

397
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,326
Ji-a.

398
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,789
Then, let me go with you.
Please take me with you.

399
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,499
Take me with you.

400
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,756
It means you won't be here anymore
when I come home.

401
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,761
I won't be able to see you ever again.

402
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,889
Mom…

403
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:47,142
Don't leave me alone here.

404
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,105
Ji-a.

405
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,650
You're not alone.

406
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,612
You have so many people
who love and cherish you by your side.

407
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,534
You were a much better exorcist
than me 20 years ago.

408
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,620
And you still are.

409
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,499
You achieved what I couldn't.

410
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,168
And you saved a lot of people.

411
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,671
I'm sure you will

412
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,132
continue to be great.

413
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,978
Mom.

414
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,697
You're not cold anymore, right?

415
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,140
Take care,

416
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,018
my dear daughter.

417
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,123
Mi-jin.

418
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,417
Hwa-jeong.

419
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,590
I left such a great responsibility to you.
I'm sorry.

420
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,514
Mi-jin.

421
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,559
I have…

422
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,398
tried my best to keep Ji-a safe.

423
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,319
You've done a great job.

424
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:13,241
Thank you for keeping my Ji-a safe.

425
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:46,316
DAEBAK REALTY

426
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,022
PSYCHIC, SPECIAL

427
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,492
Get ready and come out.
Let me buy you a meal.

428
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,885
-Hop in.
-What is this?

429
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,974
Just get in. We're going somewhere nice.

430
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,584
Let's go.

431
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,845
Gosh, don't you feel so refreshed?

432
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,473
Close the roof.

433
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,643
What's the point of a convertible
if we close the roof?

434
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:48,897
The weather is nice and so is the road.
Everything is looking nice.

435
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,998
HAPPINESS HALL

436
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,548
I heard it from Ms. Joo.

437
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,718
You've never been here
ever since your mother passed.

438
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,347
I knew her spirit wasn't here.

439
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,723
I had no reason to come.

440
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,735
It's your first time
at your mother's resting place.

441
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,737
You can't show up empty-handed.

442
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,448
Let's go inside.

443
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:49,916
HONG MI-JIN

444
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,755
When you miss her, you can come here.

445
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,924
Forget it.

446
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,093
She's not here. Why would I?

447
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,762
That's how ordinary people live.

448
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,433
Not because they believe
their spirits actually rest here,

449
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,437
but because they can be comforted
when they miss them so much.

450
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,439
That's what this place is for.

451
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,491
HONG MI-JIN

452
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,584
You once asked me

453
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,629
if I ever wanted
to do anything other than this job.

454
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:41,676
I've never thought of doing anything
other than living as an exorcist.

455
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,890
It's not that I wanted to do this.

456
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,809
I had to.

457
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,062
I couldn't avoid it.

458
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,441
I didn't think I had any choice.

459
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,654
But now you do.

460
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,204
Then think about

461
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,206
what you want to do.

462
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,333
I'm done thinking.

463
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,709
Already?

464
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,213
I want to be an exorcist.

465
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,509
I think I'd do an excellent job.

466
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,763
This is great. You have a dream.

467
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,726
Actually,
I also have something I want to do.

468
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,894
What is it?

469
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,438
It's a secret.

470
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,776
Fine. I'm not that curious anyway.

471
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,153
-I know you are.
-I'm not.

472
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,406
-Do you want to know?
-I'm not curious at all.

473
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,866
You won't be able to sleep.

474
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,034
All right.

475
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,871
How was your visit to your mother?

476
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,874
When did you and In-beom become so close?

477
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,084
Are we not allowed to?

478
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,878
You must be jealous.

479
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,172
Jealous, my foot.

480
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,926
Did you say goodbye to him?

481
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,724
You didn't.

482
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,851
My gosh.

483
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,478
Think about how sad he'll be
if you leave without a word.

484
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,605
It's not like I'm leaving for good.

485
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,233
I don't want to make a big fuss
over going on some trip.

486
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,737
Traveling to find your lost powers
isn't a trip.

487
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,697
You don't even know when you'll return.

488
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,539
You have the weirdest personality.

489
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,083
And you have a knack
for breaking people's hearts.

490
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,522
-What are you doing?
-I've been seeing

491
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:04,027
awful lines on my neck recently.
So I began to take care of it.

492
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,571
You're looking happy.

493
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,283
-Are you going on a date?
-No.

494
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,495
I've been meaning to ask.

495
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,331
Are you seeing Mr. Jung?

496
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,128
-No?
-No.

497
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,926
You should start going on dates.
It doesn't have to be him.

498
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:32,180
You've barely had any personal time
because of me.

499
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,182
I don't think you realize this,

500
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,601
but I've enjoyed a fair share
of personal time.

501
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:40,313
Those years weren't a devastating
sacrifice, so don't make it sound so.

502
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,693
Take this.

503
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,783
Use it during your trip.

504
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,370
This is a good time for you
to start preventing wrinkles.

505
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,664
I don't need to.

506
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,291
Thanks, anyway.

507
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,796
Have fun on your date.

508
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,716
It's not a date!

509
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,553
It's not!

TEMPORARILY CLOSED

512
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,411
Why do I feel like crying?

513
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,668
It's been fun.

514
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,965
Ms. Hong is awful. How could she
leave without saying goodbye?

515
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,508
She'll be back soon.

516
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,928
She said goodbye to you?

517
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,515
What?
You've been keeping in touch with her?

518
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,226
No, it's not that.

519
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,104
But this is Ms. Hong.

520
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,528
Take care.

521
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,780
And stay out of trouble.

522
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,699
Come on.

523
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,827
You sound like you'll never see us again.

524
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,663
I'm going to text you every day.
Don't leave me on read.

525
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,790
All right.

526
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,334
You do that.

527
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,841
I'm really leaving now.

528
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,191
We should go too.

ONE YEAR LATER

531
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,000
As per your request,

532
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,295
I've deleted all of your daughter's traces
on the Internet.

533
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:54,173
Including her social media accounts,
web portals, other websites,

534
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,551
as well as records
of her financial transactions.

535
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,636
So don't worry, ma'am.

536
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,679
Thank you.

537
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:03,391
If you come across any records
related to your daughter,

538
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,978
please give me a call.
I'll make sure they're gone.

539
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,105
Thank you so much.

540
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,274
Don't mention it, ma'am.

541
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,318
I'm only doing my job.

542
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:19,949
Goodbye.

Has the result been announced?

01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,009
You got in?

546
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,471
Congratulations!
You worked so hard for it.

547
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,639
Tomorrow?

548
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,183
Of course, I'm free.

549
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:49,479
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

550
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,023
Yes!

551
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:57,070
THANK YOU FOR HELPING TO SHUT DOWN
THE REDEVELOPMENT PLAN!

552
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,239
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

554
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,662
WE'RE OPEN AGAIN

555
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,872
This looks scrumptious.

556
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,208
Here's your rice soup.

557
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,751
Are you their son?

558
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,752
Sorry?

559
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,506
Yes.

560
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:21,636
Hey. I said I'll go.

561
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,304
It's okay. It's not far.

562
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,139
Okay, but let me go.

563
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:29,394
Someone as old as you shouldn't
be carrying heavy things.

564
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,520
I'll go.

565
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,605
I'll be back. Enjoy your food.

566
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:33,606
I'm off then.

567
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,901
You must be so happy
to have such a reliable son.

568
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,111
What?

569
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,031
He's not reliable at all.

570
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,991
He's still a kid.

571
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,244
Congratulations, Mr. Director.

572
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,245
Congratulations!

573
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,209
-Let me pour you a glass.
-Sure.

574
01:01:58,631 --> 01:01:59,716
Thank you.

575
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,759
Tonight's on me, so drink up.

576
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,094
Why would you treat us?

577
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:06,806
Because I'll be needing
your help often in the future.

578
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,308
Excuse me.

579
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,645
Please give us your raw tuna special
and sprinkle some gold dust on top.

580
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,272
Just kimchi for me.

581
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,774
Gosh, what was that?

582
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:17,984
Congratulations!

583
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,819
Bottoms up!

584
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,454
Have you heard from Ji-a yet?

585
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,622
I'm sure she's doing well.

586
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,251
Thanks to her trip,
I get to hang out with you. It's great.

587
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,338
I'm happy to spend some time
with you as well.

588
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:44,427
REDEVELOPMENT PLAN CANCELED

DAEBAK REALTY

590
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:39,732
You're back.

591
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,526
Why are you here?

592
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,907
You meant "hi," right?

593
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,534
Yes.

594
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,371
Did you get them back?

595
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,516
DAEBAK REALTY

596
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:34,662
Is it true that you guys handle
haunted houses?

597
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,958
Yes. You've come to the right place.
Have a seat, please.

598
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:45,047
We have coffee, Solomon's seal tea,
and green tea. Which one would you like?

599
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,717
We'll be asking you a few questions.

600
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,972
It's just a formality that we have.

601
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,894
Have any of your electronic devices
malfunctioned for no reason

602
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,354
or have there been
repetitive power failures?

603
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:17,121
Did someone die or did you
kill someone in that building recently?

604
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,669
I've secured the area,

605
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,005
and there will be no one nearby.

606
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,715
Good luck tonight.

607
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,301
Let me remind you once more.

608
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:33,054
This is a historic place.
Please don't break anything.

609
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,558
Remember you broke all kinds
of objects during our last exorcism?

610
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:40,770
Compensating for them was such a pain.
