1
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,044
Is anyone out there?

2
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,839
Darn it. It's freezing in here.

3
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,030
It's freezing.

4
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,436
Ms. Hong.

5
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:53,363
If we die here like a pair of fools,
will we turn into vengeful spirits too?

6
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,743
I don't want that.

7
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,912
Stop saying something so stupid.

8
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,540
We're not going to die.

9
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,127
I will not die
before I put my mother to rest.

10
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,256
I cannot die.

11
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,255
Mom.

12
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,127
Ms. Hong!

13
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,129
Hey, In-beom.

14
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,797
In-beom!

15
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,633
Hey! Wake up!

16
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,509
Is anybody out there?

17
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,136
Hey, In-beom!

18
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,485
We must be dead.

19
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,697
We're dead

20
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,158
and have become vengeful spirits.

21
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,495
Seeing how you're rambling,
you must be okay.

22
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,875
Right. You said
vengeful spirits can't talk.

23
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,214
Gosh, what happened?

24
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,299
How did we escape?

25
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,051
In-beom!

26
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,803
In-beom!

27
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,972
That hurts!

28
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,766
-You're finally awake.
-Gosh.

29
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,059
Ms. Hong.

30
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,232
I couldn't reach either of you.
It seemed off, so I ran over there.

31
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,151
You were unconscious
in the storage warehouse.

32
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,361
I thought you were dead.

33
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,864
But we're not, so stop crying.

34
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,782
Okay.

35
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,787
The doctor said if you were found a little
later, you would've died of hypothermia.

36
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,540
Where's Ms. Joo?

37
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,209
Well…

38
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,003
Don't tell her if you haven't.

39
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,464
She's the worrying type,
so she'll just nag.

40
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,758
Ms. Hong.

41
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,636
Actually…

42
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,124
Thankfully, she's no longer critical.

43
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:38,254
The doctor says she'll come around soon,
so don't worry too much.

44
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,678
How are you feeling?

45
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,765
What happened?

46
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,186
She left right after you two did,
saying she had plans.

47
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,229
That late? With whom?

48
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,481
Do Hak-seong.

49
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,692
Do Hak-seong?

50
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,237
She called me
and said she was meeting with him.

51
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,740
After that, I couldn't reach her.

52
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,118
When I got there, she was already…

53
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,874
EMERGENCY

54
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,471
That means it was his doing.

55
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,098
But there's no proof.

56
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,933
Construction materials fell on her,

57
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,852
and the police think
it was just an accident.

58
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,770
An accident?

59
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,981
Around the same time,
we almost froze to death in a warehouse.

60
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,776
And Ms. Joo's hurt and unconscious.

61
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,694
This isn't a coincidence.

62
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:47,490
He's right. The owner of the cold storage
warehouse can't be reached either.

63
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,034
Ji-cheol.

64
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,621
Let's find that guy first.
I'm certain he's tied to Do Hak-seong.

65
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,914
Okay.

66
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,833
Don't worry about Hwa-jeong.

67
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,336
I'll move her to a safe place that I know.

68
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,048
Thank you.

69
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,416
Ms. Hong.

70
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,220
Don't worry too much about her.

71
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,806
They said she'll wake up soon.

72
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,893
Okay.

73
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,365
It was you, right?

74
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,786
You're the one who saved me, right?

75
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,920
No. That makes no sense.

76
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,464
You never leave this place.

77
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,091
You're tied down to this house.

78
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,304
That's why
I've never run into you outside, right?

79
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,599
So there's no way
you came all the way there, right?

80
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,294
Is it not this place,

81
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,215
but me?

82
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,349
I'm the one you're tied down to?

83
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
But why?

84
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,689
Because you resent me?

85
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,657
Is it because I didn't listen to you
and went downstairs?

86
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,204
Is it because I ruined
the salt line you drew? Or…

87
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,499
Or because I didn't stab you
like you told me to?

88
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,126
Is that why you're not leaving?

89
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,509
Why on earth do you remain here
looking like that?

90
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:07,106
Those who were supposed
to freeze to death are still alive.

91
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,109
And that wench who should've been
crushed has disappeared!

92
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,570
I'm sorry, sir.

93
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,991
Find that wench, Joo Hwa-jeong, first.

94
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,410
-That's the top priority!
-Understood, sir.

95
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,921
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

96
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,173
Hello, ma'am.

97
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,634
Yes.

98
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,429
No. They're not showing any reaction.

99
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,224
The secretary is nowhere to be seen.

100
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,102
Yes. Okay.

101
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,147
I see. Yes, ma'am.

102
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,482
Understood.

103
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,491
It's time.

104
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,499
He has removed all traces of himself.

105
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,543
None of the cameras
caught his face properly.

106
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,714
I'm sure his vehicle was rented
under a fake name too.

107
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,008
This will take some time.

108
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,470
Our food's here.

109
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,722
Hello.

110
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,683
-Delivery.
-Thank you.

111
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,061
You could've just come over to eat.

112
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,229
It's seaweed soup.

113
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,315
Yes. I think it's her son's birthday.

114
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,236
She makes seaweed soup every year
on his birthday because she misses him.

115
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,863
So? Did you find the fraud?

116
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,283
-How do you know about that?
-I told him.

117
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,911
Why would you tell him about that?

118
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,955
Well… I just…

119
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,625
Hey. We've been living together
for some time now.

120
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,794
Gosh, I'm getting teary-eyed.

121
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,422
I had some information
I thought would be useful,

122
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,924
so I wanted to give it to you.
But never mind.

123
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,384
Information?

124
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,137
We don't need it.
You've delivered our food, so just go.

125
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,517
Gosh, why are you so impatient?

126
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,645
It's nothing much.

127
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,149
Do you remember President Hwang
you put behind bars recently?

128
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,569
The one who pulled the Green Villa fraud?

129
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,778
Yes, him.

130
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,991
And this guy. He's wanted,
so will you please look him up?

131
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,410
-You really are wanted.
-See?

132
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,122
Let me call my lawyer.

133
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,374
He helped Do Hak-seong with his slush fund

134
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,084
and managed muscle like me.

135
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,879
There's another company he managed.

136
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,590
Hwang went to prison
due to the Green Villa incident.

137
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,258
I was ousted.

138
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,218
Then there's just one more person.

139
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,889
You're saying Do Hak-seong ordered
the company to do this job?

140
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,599
I'm positive.

141
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,144
Surprisingly, he doesn't have
that many friends.

142
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:55,232
How should I put it?
He's one to stick to the same people.

143
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,401
Gosh, they must be sick of him.

144
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,278
Cut it out.

145
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,281
So do you know who it is or not?

146
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,950
Of course, I do.

147
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,120
His nickname is Hairy.

148
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,247
After Hwang and I went out of the picture,

149
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,708
he started working directly
with Do Hak-seong.

150
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,424
Stop right there!

151
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,303
Hey!

152
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
Hey!

153
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,476
-Ji-cheol! Go that way!
-Okay!

154
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,570
Stop right there!

155
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,074
-Darn it!
-Watch it!

156
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,116
Hey!

157
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,746
Hey!

158
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,416
-Darn it!
-Darn it!

159
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,545
Stop!

160
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,255
Get out of the way!

161
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,217
Are you okay?

162
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,427
Make sure to get that checked by a doctor!

163
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,234
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

164
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,946
Why did you run when we could've
just talked it out? I'm all sweaty now.

165
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,244
Don't come closer.

166
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,704
I'll kill you.

167
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,666
Move aside.

168
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,502
We will. We'll move aside.

169
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,466
Gosh. He has a knife.

170
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,260
-Do we have anything?
-Do we?

171
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,220
Yes, we do.

172
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,112
Mister.

173
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,865
Don't move! Don't you dare!

174
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,705
Just tell me who gave you the order.
It's Do Hak-seong, isn't it?

175
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,790
Who's that?

176
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,002
I just pulled a prank on my own.

177
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,796
Fine. I'll man up and apologize.

178
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,256
Sorry. Are we good now?

179
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,010
He gives me no choice.

180
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,429
Let's hand him over to the police.

181
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,347
Sure.

182
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,807
Gosh. Go ahead.

183
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,602
You guys assaulted me, too, anyway.

184
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,003
Yes, protein.

185
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,263
Even if they catch Hairy,
they won't get anything out of him.

186
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,227
Unless he wants to die,
he would never utter the chairman's name.

187
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,523
I knew you had a plan.
You're the cleverest guy.

188
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,402
When you told me you'd given Hairy away,
I thought you had gone mad.

189
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,121
-Eat up. Eat a lot.
-Okay.

190
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,664
-Ma'am, give us more food.
-Okay.

191
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:43,002
Gosh. After everything I did
for Oh In-beom, he ought to trust me.

192
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,587
-Seon-nyeo.
-Yes.

193
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,506
I'll come back soon.

194
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,926
I'll give the chairman
information on Daebak Realty

195
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,596
and get back Taejin Nightclub

196
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,640
on my own.

197
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,891
You will.

198
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,437
I will come back
as the chairman's right-hand man soon.

199
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,771
Okay.

200
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,356
-Seon-nyeo.
-Yes?

201
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,441
Thanks for the food.

202
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,112
Hey, money is tight this month.

203
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,575
JUNGBU POLICE STATION

204
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,916
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 1

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,294
I understand what you're saying,

206
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,880
but it's hard to charge him
with that for now.

207
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,092
What's this about?

208
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,975
I understand he desperately wants
to redevelop the area,

209
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,477
but hiring a hitman to kill you

210
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:43,937
seems far-fetched.

211
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,483
Do is more than capable of doing so.

212
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,069
He kidnapped Ms. Hong and me once already

213
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,654
to have her sign the purchase agreement.

214
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,532
So this time, he tried to kill you guys?

215
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,619
Yes.

216
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,623
And Ms. Joo is still unconscious.

217
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,209
Which hospital is she in?

218
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,087
I can't tell you that now.

219
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,548
I'll tell you what.

220
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,343
I'll look into the warehouse incident.

221
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,469
It's a known fact

222
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,098
that he works as an enforcer
for the redevelopment project.

223
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,767
And I doubt he'd cause trouble
for nothing in return.

224
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,644
It is fishy indeed.

225
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:29,191
I thought you thought badly of us
and that we were a bunch of frauds.

226
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,693
I still have my doubts about you.

227
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,781
I'm just doing my job as a detective.

228
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,583
That will be of no use.

229
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,378
I'm sure Do already
took care of everything.

230
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,756
He's a detective. He might find a lead.

231
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,550
Don't get your hopes up.

232
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,096
It's obvious Do Hak-seong was behind this,

233
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,515
but we can't do anything. How frustrating.

234
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,235
-Hello.
-Hey, Detective Kang.

235
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,361
Yes.

236
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,947
How's the attempted murder case
of Joo Hwa-jeong going?

237
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,450
The director told me to close
the case as a simple accident, so…

238
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,786
Well, then.

239
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,880
Come in.

240
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,673
Sir.

241
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,010
Hey, Mr. Jung. What's this about?

242
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,348
Right. This is the best cop
our station has,

243
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,933
Jung Ji-uk.

244
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,644
I see. Mr. Jung.

245
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,271
I've heard a lot about you.

246
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,149
I heard you are very upright
and honorable.

247
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,734
What's this about?

248
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,199
It's nothing. I'll come back another time.

249
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,291
Please have some.

250
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,462
INVESTIGATION TEAM 1

251
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,345
I'm Kang Han-seok from Jungbu Station.

252
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,517
A few days ago,
two people got locked up in cold storage.

253
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,813
I'm investigating it based on a tip
that Do Hak-seong is the instigator.

254
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,190
How much have you found out?

255
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,651
I haven't found anything yet.

256
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,527
While looking into it,

257
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,198
I noticed you investigated
a similar case 20 years ago.

258
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,284
Back then, you investigated
Do Hak-seong of Golden Properties

259
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,955
on suspicion of murdering Oh Seong-sik,
but stopped due to a lack of evidence.

260
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,500
May I ask why you suspected
and investigated Do?

261
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,920
It's simple.

262
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,339
The only person
who benefited from the fire was…

263
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,342
Do Hak-seong.

264
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,207
Ms. Hong, you seem well.

265
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,043
Thanks to you.

266
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,438
REAL ESTATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

267
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,820
What are you trying to pull?

268
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,281
You tried to kill us for that.

269
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,909
So I'm giving you what you want.

270
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,203
I didn't put down the price,

271
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,205
so you can just put down
a number you want.

272
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,167
The price doesn't matter to me.

273
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,005
But in return,

274
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,926
let me exorcise the vengeful spirit
staying next to you.

275
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,929
That's my only condition.

276
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,306
That again?

277
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,768
What's your real reason
behind this charade?

278
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,020
What's your angle?

279
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,733
The vengeful spirit sticking to you is

280
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,945
Oh In-beom's uncle who died 20 years ago.

281
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,363
It's Oh Seong-sik.

282
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,922
I don't care what you did to Oh Seong-sik.

283
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,302
I just want to put the spirit to rest
who couldn't leave this world.

284
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,642
Fine.

285
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,561
Do it. Go ahead and perform your exorcism.

286
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,606
Let's see how good you are.

287
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,702
Why did you agree to that?

288
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:38,416
Do you honestly believe
that Oh Seong-sik's spirit is with you?

289
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,584
Do you think I'm crazy?

290
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,711
There's no such thing as ghosts.

291
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,755
Then, why?

292
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,468
I must see for myself

293
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,930
what she's trying to achieve.

294
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,474
After that,

295
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,937
I'll get rid of her myself this time.

296
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,072
Gosh, Mom. You should eat something.

297
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,367
Eat up, okay?

298
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,578
-I loved the beans in soy sauce.
-Okay.

299
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,539
I'm off to do a delivery.

300
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,710
He's getting on my nerves.

301
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,211
Kim Tae-jin?

302
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,506
Don't mind him.
I think he's turned over a new leaf.

303
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,803
Why would he suddenly turn over a new leaf
right in front of Daebak Realty?

304
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,390
Goodness, you shouldn't judge people
by their appearance,

305
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,600
but by their actions.

306
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,811
What did he ever do?

307
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,064
Giving us information on Hairy?
That wasn't helpful at all.

308
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,651
What matters is that he tried to help us.

309
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,448
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

310
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,746
-Thanks for the food.
-Thank you.

311
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,790
I found it! Mr. Yang! I found it!

312
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,834
I found him. Look.

313
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,127
-Look at this.
-What?

314
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,046
Look.

315
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,965
Honey, come on out!

316
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,217
Ma'am!

317
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,303
-I found him.
-What is it?

318
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,888
Look at this.

319
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,556
Look.

320
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,809
A friend of mine runs
an employment agency in Seocho-dong.

321
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,187
Look, this list is from six months ago,

322
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,232
and there's Yang Chang-hwa,
born on March 20, 1990. That's him.

323
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,609
It is him.

324
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,652
It's him, right?

325
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,362
That little rascal.

326
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
How could he never contact us?

327
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,823
Don't worry, okay?

328
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,867
I already called everyone I know.

329
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,453
Once they see him,
they'll give me a call right away.

330
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,955
Thank you.

331
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,540
-Mr. Yang, you trust me, right?
-Yes.

332
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,001
Just trust me and hang in there.

333
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,796
-Anything you want to eat?
-Japchae.

334
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,881
Are you going to make it?

335
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,716
-Let's go.
-Let's eat some japchae!

336
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,884
All right!

337
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,845
I was right. A bad guy wouldn't
be helping them find their son.

338
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,724
Did he really decide to live a new life?

339
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,393
I'm telling you.

340
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,727
People can change.

341
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,896
You and I stopped scamming people too.

342
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,899
Hey, it's okay.

343
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,444
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

344
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,178
This expensive talisman
cost my entire paycheck.

345
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,139
It'll keep me safe.

346
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,725
I trust you, talisman.

347
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,101
I trust you.

348
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,074
DAEBAK REALTY

349
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,335
Oh, man.

350
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,842
-Who is it?
-God!

351
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,720
It's you, In-beom.

352
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,847
The night sky is very clear.

353
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,432
Go to bed.

354
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,186
Go on inside. Good night.

355
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,483
My gosh, what's with him?

356
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,403
Man, that felt weird.

357
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,448
I met with Do Hak-seong.

358
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,784
By yourself?

359
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,827
Ae you hurt? Are you okay?

360
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,208
He agreed to let me
perform an exorcism on your uncle.

361
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,170
Did Do Hak-seong

362
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,922
just say yes to it?

363
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,383
On condition that I sell this house.

364
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,385
If you sell this place,

365
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:01,596
what about your mother?

366
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,433
You said you couldn't leave this place
because your mother wouldn't.

367
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,894
I was wrong.

368
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,438
What do you mean?

369
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,901
When you and I were dying
in the cold room,

370
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,446
I saw her there.

371
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,575
If she was tied to this place,
it would've been impossible.

372
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,037
She isn't tied down to this house,

373
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,623
but to me,

374
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,170
just like your uncle
sticking to Do Hak-seong.

375
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,721
I was always afraid

376
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,350
the reason she wouldn't leave

377
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,229
might be her resentment toward me.

378
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,149
That's absurd.

379
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,569
No mother would do that to her daughter.

380
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,531
And your mother of all people
has no reason to do that.

381
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,828
A vengeful spirit
usually remains next to somebody…

382
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,248
because of resentment.

383
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,294
Pull yourself together, Ji-a!

384
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,921
You have to do this. Now.

385
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,131
I can't do it, Mom.

386
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,384
You can. You have to.

387
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,261
I don't want to do it.

388
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:30,018
If I didn't hesitate back then,
she wouldn't have died.

389
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,106
You said

390
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,402
you wanted to know the truth
no matter how horrible it is.

391
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,697
I feel the same way.

392
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,827
I need to know why my mom is here with me.

393
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,789
In order to do that,

394
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,918
I need the memories of your uncle
who was there that night.

395
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,253
That's why

396
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,465
I must do this exorcism.

397
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,311
Hello?

398
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,423
Hey.

399
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,134
You're here.

400
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,763
What is this?

401
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,225
You came to visit your only full-time
employee, but you came empty-handed?

402
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,190
I guess you were worried sick.

403
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,244
Goodness, you really were worried.

404
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,706
I was scared…

405
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,919
that I might lose you forever too.

406
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,009
I guess you don't know this.

407
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,013
The secretary position
at Daebak Realty has life tenure.

408
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,099
Check my contract.
There's no contract period.

409
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,187
What are you doing?

410
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,857
Are you crying?

411
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,820
My gosh, what's with you?

412
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,907
What has gotten into you, really?

413
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,548
Thank you…

414
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,552
for staying alive.

415
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,391
I'll never go anywhere leaving you behind.

416
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,310
I promise.

417
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,191
Why did you go see Do Hak-seong?

418
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,944
And why did you go alone?

419
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,198
I thought he would just threaten me.

420
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,202
Goodness.

421
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,121
I never imagined he'd go this far

422
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,624
since I had something on him.

423
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,542
What do you mean?

424
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,170
To tell the truth,

425
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,257
I did something like threatening him.

426
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,261
"I know what you did 20 years ago."

427
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,139
"I even have evidence."

428
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,102
"Secretary of Daebak Realty,
Joo Hwa-jeong."

429
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,896
A MONTH AGO

430
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,399
What brings you here, Ms. Joo?

431
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,902
Are you willing to settle?

432
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,278
Settle?

433
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,200
You won't be able to report me
to the police anyway.

434
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:18,579
You're the one who abducted and threatened
Ms. Hong and In-beom first.

435
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,999
Then why are you here?

436
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,793
To talk about Oh Seong-sik.

437
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,256
-Who?
-Do you think

438
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:33,011
you're the only one Oh Seong-sik met with
at Ilseong Hospital right before he died?

439
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,390
He told me many things.

440
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,726
I also know a lot of things
that you've done.

441
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,643
For example,

442
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,438
the memorandum.

443
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,193
What do you want?

444
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,907
Goodness. We're finally on the same page.

445
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,953
Don't hurt Ji-a.

446
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,998
If you do,

447
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,085
the whole world will know
about the memorandum

448
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,713
you gave to Oh Seong-sik.

449
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,514
When I told him
I had the memorandum, he turned pale.

450
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,100
You have it?

451
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,977
Of course, I don't.

452
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,897
Lying and threatening go hand in hand.

453
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,692
Don't ever do that again.

454
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,944
I'll take care of it myself.

455
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,197
You'll take care of it?

456
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,034
We both know you're hot-tempered.
What are you planning to do?

457
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,538
What?

458
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,416
Why aren't you answering?

459
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,879
Don't you do anything
until I get discharged.

460
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,923
You must always run it by me, got that?

461
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,675
Fine.

462
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,261
Get better soon.

463
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,304
I'll get going.

464
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,685
Don't you do anything, okay?

465
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,364
Kim Tae-jin would like to speak with you.

466
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,366
-Kim Tae-jin?
-Yes.

467
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,285
He says he has something
to tell you in person.

468
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,411
What should I do?

469
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,706
What a bold bastard.

470
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,085
-Let him in.
-Yes, sir.

471
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,592
What's wrong?

472
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,431
Nothing, sir.

473
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,059
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,483
Kim Tae-jin…

475
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,283
CHAIRMAN DO HAK-SEONG

476
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,211
You have something to tell me? What is it?

477
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,463
I've located

478
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,633
the secretary of Daebak Realty.

479
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,471
-Sit down.
-No, sir.

480
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,390
-I said, sit down.
-Thank you, sir.

481
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,605
Are you positive?

482
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:33,983
I am, sir.

483
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,693
You better be.

484
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,305

REAL ESTATE AGENT LICENSE
HONG MI-JIN

486
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,150
-Hello.
-Hello.

487
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,362
I'd like to sell a building.

488
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,198
I see. Have you heard about us?

489
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,449
Yes, I have.

490
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,993
I can't pay the wages.

491
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,088
They would cook together.

492
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,923
But didn't I come later?

493
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,967
I was so shocked when you danced.

494
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,511
Don't you think so?

495
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,179
-Right?
-You're right.

496
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,015
At first, I had a sore throat.

497
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,309
You're right.

498
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,277
-Right.
-Right.

499
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,571
I'm sorry, Mom.

500
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,494
You cherished this house.

501
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,333
I'm sorry I failed to protect it.

502
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,997
It's nice and cozy.

503
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,755
It's too suffocating for me.

504
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,049
Care to switch places?

505
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,640
You impudent wench.

506
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,229
I beg to differ.

507
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,524
I don't think you have any power here.

508
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,405
Do you think I can't harm you
because those cops are here?

509
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:07,047
I don't care what you know or have anymore

510
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,925
because I'll get rid of
everything and everyone.

511
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,762
Be my guest.

512
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,933
But as you can see,
I don't die that easily.

513
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,023
I've decided to let Ms. Hong
carry out the exorcism.

514
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,153
This is interesting.

515
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,699
I guess I'll soon find out

516
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,451
what all this fuss is about.

517
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,455
Get better soon. Okay?

518
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,169
Mr. Jung.

519
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,795
Fancy seeing you here.

520
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,930
Ms. Joo, I knew
you had a lot of connections,

521
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,182
but I didn't know
you had one in the police too.

522
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,600
I believe

523
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,102
you were leaving.

524
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,397
Right.

525
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,574
Are you okay?

526
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,215
Yes, Ms. Joo?

527
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,303
Yes. That's right.

528
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,306
-I'm going to do it.
-Are you mad?

529
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,102
I'm completely sane.

530
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,397
And it's something
I have to do eventually.

531
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,483
Don't worry.

532
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,735
I'll make sure it goes well.

533
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,706
SECRETARY JOO HWA-JEONG

534
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,798
I guess you've gotten much better,

535
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,301
seeing how you called me over
at this hour.

536
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,386
What is this about?

537
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:22,224
Do not perform an exorcism on your uncle.

538
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,105
That's a pretty insulting
and ridiculous demand.

539
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:32,276
I don't know how to express my anger.
But I'll listen to your reason.

540
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:37,573
When you were possessed last time,
you broke Do Hak-seong's arm.

541
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,325
This time, you might kill him.

542
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,076
That's for me to deal with,

543
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,828
even if I kill him.

544
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,164
You know nothing.

545
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,665
Vengeful spirits aren't human.

546
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:51,086
Once they lose control, everyone there,
not just Do Hak-seong, will be in danger.

547
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,757
You might end up killing Ji-a.

548
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,264
If that's all you need to tell me,
I'll get going.

549
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,770
I'm sorry that your uncle
is still here as a vengeful spirit.

550
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,980
However,

551
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,817
he could be paying
for the crime he committed.

552
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:24,244
I cannot let Ji-a be put in danger
for someone like him.

553
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,746
Neither 20 years ago

554
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,623
nor now.

555
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,183
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

556
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,125
Where are you going?

557
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,460
A preliminary inspection.

558
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,878
What preliminary inspection?

559
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,467
You mean the place where we'll meet
Do Hak-seong tomorrow?

560
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,678
Isn't it obvious?

561
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,721
It's too dangerous to go there alone!

562
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,099
We're partners.

563
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,935
Why do you always go alone?
Am I not helpful?

564
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,939
Get in.

565
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,987
DAEBAK REALTY

566
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,865
I don't see any other spirits.
This building is clean.

567
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,959
You met with Ms. Joo, didn't you?

568
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,631
She has a point.

569
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,551
How can we trust Do? He tried to kill us.

570
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:51,058
I doubt that he agreed
because he believes in exorcism.

571
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,436
He might have an ulterior motive.

572
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,147
But if we lose this chance,

573
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,233
we might never get another chance.

574
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,655
If I were to only think about my uncle,

575
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,075
I want to put him to rest
as soon as I can,

576
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,954
but I can't put you in danger
because of what I want.

577
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,706
Didn't I tell you?

578
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,668
I need your uncle's memories.

579
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,836
We might find another way if we--

580
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,005
If this is too much for you,
sit this one out.

581
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,091
I'll find another psychic.

582
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:29,012
As you know, I didn't want you
to take this case from the beginning.

583
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,935
I'll leave it up to you.

584
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:48,907
In-beom.

585
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:51,827
Yes?

586
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,539
Why don't you sit out this exorcism?

587
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,750
Let's ask Ms. Hong
to find another psychic.

588
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,712
To be honest,

589
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,964
who knows
what horrible memories you'll get?

590
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,258
And I'm worried
the memories might bring you

591
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,719
a lot of pain.

592
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,473
I know that it's selfish.

593
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,102
But Ms. Hong is strong.
And she's been doing this for ten years.

594
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,688
I'm sure she has
her way of dealing with it.

595
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,199
HONG MI-JIN

596
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,329
Mom, I'm almost there.

597
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,459
If I can get Oh Seong-sik's memories
from that day,

598
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,546
I'll be able to find a way
to put you to rest.

599
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,055
Give me a bit more time.

600
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,143
OH SEONG-SIK

601
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,698
What? Did you think I wouldn't show up?

602
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,867
I didn't say anything.

603
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,912
What? You prepared everything by yourself.

604
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,582
Don't tell me you already called
another psychic to replace me.

605
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,091
I have a special psychic.

606
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,592
Why would I?

607
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,102
Look at him. He's liking it.

608
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,312
Gosh.

609
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,777
Both of you! You must be careful. Okay?

610
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,171
Ms. Joo, they just left.

611
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,093
Okay. I got it.

612
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,098
MR. JUNG

613
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,480
Mr. Jung, it's me.

614
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,340
They are on their way up.

615
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,200
My gosh. This is some nice setup.

616
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,245
I said only you were allowed to come.

617
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,039
Do what she says.

618
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,666
She's the host tonight.

619
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,169
But let's tie him up before we begin.

620
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:12,838
What?

621
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,549
He was pretty rough last time,

622
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,259
so I can't exactly trust him.

623
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,261
-No.
-No?

624
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,138
Then let's forget about this whole thing.

625
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:26,726
I can't even see the ghost anyway.
I don't care if it stays or goes.

626
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,479
-Tie me up.
-No.

627
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,149
-I'm fine.
-I'm not fine with it.

628
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,486
If the vengeful spirit loses control,
it'll be dangerous.

629
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,864
Once I'm tied up,
I won't be able to hurt people.

630
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,991
That way, I'll feel reassured.

631
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,159
You could end up getting hurt.

632
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,246
A vengeful spirit
doesn't care about the psychic.

633
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,081
It only tries to get what it wants.

634
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,295
I'd rather get hurt myself

635
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,881
than hurt others.

636
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,284
Now.

637
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,870
Uncle.

638
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,032
Give me my apartment!

639
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,869
My apartment! Give me my apartment!

640
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:09,139
What are you doing?
This can put you in danger too.

641
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,275
You're Oh Seong-sik right now?

642
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,573
Then tell me. What do you know?

643
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,742
You promised you'd give us
an apartment unit.

644
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,996
You promised you'd give it to me
if I set the town on fire.

645
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,334
You said that to me last time.

646
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,545
Don't tell me that's all you know.

647
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,592
Ms. Hong, I'm disappointed.

648
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,763
You risked your life and crawled in here,
so I thought you might have

649
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:50,972
a voice recording.

650
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,307
Stop!

651
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,606
Stop it!

652
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:01,941
Hey!

653
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:10,867
Oh In-beom.

654
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,498
You must've heard a few things
from your uncle as a kid.

655
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:22,045
But if you pull a scam
on the great Do Hak-seong, you die.

656
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,215
Okay?

657
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,510
Do you get it now? Do you?

658
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:30,845
Do you?

659
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,264
In-beom.

660
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,038
The apartment unit!

661
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,500
You promised you'd give it to me
once I set the place on fire!

662
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,181
You!

663
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,728
You said you'd have it ready

664
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,647
after I took a nap.

665
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,318
Then you killed me. Why?

666
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,945
What?

667
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,780
Oh Seong-sik, you…

668
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,617
You! Give me my apartment!

669
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,251
Mr. Do!

670
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,768
Darn you!

671
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,221
In-beom!

672
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,101
I killed him 20 years ago.
How can he come back to haunt me?

673
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,477
It was Oh Seong-sik!

674
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,479
You need to stop trying
to find the truth of that day.

675
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,149
I'm sorry. I put you
in danger because of my stubbornness.

676
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,569
It's me. Can you do me a favor?

677
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,945
-Ji-a said that?
-She asked me

678
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,154
to protect her while she sees
Do Hak-seong.

679
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,240
You said you'd give me a unit
if I set the place on fire.

680
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,575
Write me a memorandum.

681
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,868
You were the living egg ghost.

682
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,996
Everything you remember
from that day isn't true.

683
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:43,997
Stop lying!

684
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,791
A regular exorcism ritual
doesn't work on egg ghosts.

685
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,420
I will find out exactly what happened
on that day with my own two eyes.

686
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:54,716
