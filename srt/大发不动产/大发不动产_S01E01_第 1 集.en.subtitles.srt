DAEGUK HOSPITAL

2
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,773
EMERGENCY ROOM

3
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,332
Now.

4
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,371
Hyeong-sik.

5
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,416
Hey, get up.

6
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,546
Is it over? Is the spirit gone?

7
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,134
DAEGUK HOSPITAL

8
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,806
Homes where you feel a chill
even at the height of summer.

9
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,225
Homes where you get
sleep paralysis and see spirits.

10
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,646
Homes in which every resident
ends up dead or goes mad.

11
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,650
Simply put,
we deal with all kinds of haunted houses.

12
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,653
Daebak Realty ousts evil spirits
quickly and accurately

13
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,655
to sell your house
at a satisfactory price.

14
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,699
We're basically a one-stop shop.

15
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,868
By "satisfactory price," you mean…

16
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,578
Of course, it's the market price.

17
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,205
So to sum up,

18
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,501
you're saying that you hear
footsteps every day at midnight

19
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,628
from the deserted rooftop, yes?

20
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,925
It gives me the chills every time.

21
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,595
Did anyone die in the building recently?

22
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,219
This is Ms. Hong Ji-a,
the CEO of Daebak Realty.

23
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,470
I see.

24
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,223
Or have you ever killed anyone?

25
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,435
Excuse me?

26
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,562
It's a question we ask all of our clients.

27
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,022
When we perform an exorcism,

28
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,565
the most important thing is

29
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,401
to confirm the identity
of the vengeful spirit.

30
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,241
Well, I heard a former tenant
who was evicted last year

31
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,492
has died…

32
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,078
in a car accident.

33
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,503
Anyway, how do you oust spirits?

34
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,673
Should I prepare food and such
like for a gut rite?

35
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,634
Why would you
give food to bodiless spirits?

36
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,261
To mock them?

37
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,473
Let's go.

38
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,808
What?

39
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,185
You're going right now to do the exorcism?

40
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,606
Before that, I need to see
if there really is a vengeful spirit.

41
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,901
Even the sound of a cat

42
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,612
can sound like

43
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,782
a vengeful spirit to a guilty person.

44
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,250
Ms. Hong tends to be impatient.

45
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,962
She doesn't like to waste time.

46
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,176
DAEBAK REALTY

47
00:07:54,056 --> 00:08:00,188
DAEBAK REALTY

48
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,718
Who are you?

49
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,472
Why are you taking photos of my house?

50
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm sorry.

51
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,142
Why are you hiding what you took?

52
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,437
What is this?

53
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,232
So you're the owner of this house, right?

54
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,191
Yes.

55
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,862
Have your electronic appliances
malfunctioned

56
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,156
or have you had
frequent power outages recently?

57
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,199
Yes.

58
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,618
There have been mysterious outages
since a week ago.

59
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,037
With this much energy,

60
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,706
I'm sure you heard
some strange noises as well.

61
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,334
Every night, I hear a man weeping.

62
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm too terrified to sleep,

63
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,965
but I can't tell anyone about it
because the house price may drop.

64
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,841
Let's go inside.

65
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,350
It's more serious than I thought.

66
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,520
Any idea whose spirit it could be?

67
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,729
Oh, right.

68
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,900
The former landlord committed suicide
after this house was auctioned off.

69
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,694
I knew it.

70
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,446
So you're saying his spirit lives here?

71
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,077
I've only read about these cases
in research papers.

72
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,412
It's fascinating.

73
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,454
Research papers?

74
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,208
Actually,

75
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,628
I'm a researcher studying scalar
energy healing at Stanford University.

76
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,424
I'm sure you've heard there's a close
connection between EM fields and health.

77
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,094
I'm studying the correlation between
that theory and spiritual phenomena.

78
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,304
To put it simply,

79
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,849
it's about creating energy fields
at places where spirits lurk

80
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,851
to push them far away.

81
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,439
-So you'll drive the spirits out?
-Correct. However,

82
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,234
we must install the equipment
my research team has developed.

83
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,281
-How much is it?
-No, we should pay you instead.

84
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,533
We're using your house for our research.

85
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,952
For 2 days, how about 500…

86
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,871
Excuse me.

87
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,457
What do you say to 500 dollars?

88
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,251
You'll drive the spirit out
and pay me as well?

89
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,721
DAEBAK REALTY

90
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,856
Let's see.

91
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,866
Gosh.

92
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,832
Many people consume red ginseng
for their health.

93
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,668
We have a limited amount.

94
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,628
Red ginseng.

95
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,630
It's more expensive than when I bought it.

96
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,631
6-YEAR-OLD RED GINSENG

97
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,091
It was a great deal.

98
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,511
This will be the only live deal
you'll get, so don't miss out.

99
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,763
For a price of one cup of coffee…

100
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,517
These black cowhide boots
are great for everyday wear.

101
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,768
No way.

102
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,603
This is a unique brand.

103
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,730
There's one downside, though.

104
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,774
I shouldn't pass up this opportunity.

105
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,443
But today, we're offering a discount.
While this is…

106
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,239
Hello? I'd like the black boots
that are being aired right now.

107
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,659
I'd like them in a wide 235mm.

108
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,743
Hello?

109
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,371
They're expected to be sold out soon.

110
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,540
Yes, they'll sell out soon.

111
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,791
You must hurry.

112
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,506
Mom.

113
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,552
Do you always have to make a mess?

114
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,930
It's not like you'll clean up
after yourself.

115
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,598
You're unbelievable.

116
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,350
Come on.

117
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,649
They may look the same,
but if you look closely…

118
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,945
If you look closely,
the designs are all different.

119
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,699
You know nothing about fashion.

120
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,545
Gosh, she keeps flickering the lights.

121
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,756
God, she's so meddlesome.

122
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,433
What's so wrong

123
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,644
about buying some shoes with my own money?

124
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,813
Darn it!

125
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,285
You scared me.

126
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,874
Why are you standing there like a ghost?

127
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,005
Why are you still here at this hour?

128
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,631
How late is it?

129
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,344
When did the sun go down?

130
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,603
The spirit I got rid of this time
must've been a heavy smoker.

131
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,897
I've picked up his habit of chain-smoking.

132
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,607
Why did it have to be this habit?

133
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,692
It'll go away in a few days anyway.

134
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,657
Come to your senses, Ms. Hong.

135
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,701
The psychics are outside right now.

136
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,413
Was the interview today?

137
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,054
Thank you for coming to Daebak Realty's
psychic interview. Welcome.

138
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,348
-Hyeong-sik, you're back.
-I am.

139
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,100
Excuse me. Psychic?

140
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,395
I thought you were hiring a new assistant.

141
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,148
Right, I now remember there was a newbie.

142
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,191
There it is.

143
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,109
You sleepwalk,

144
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,403
suffer from night terrors,
and are a virgin.

145
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,031
You have the basic qualifications.

146
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:54,078
First, let me explain what we do.

147
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,871
Daebak Realty

148
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,458
only handles haunted houses
and performs exorcisms.

149
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,796
Psychics are absolutely needed
when exorcists are doing their work.

150
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,798
A vengeful spirit doesn't have a body,

151
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,509
so it can only be exorcized

152
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,053
when it's inside a psychic's body.

153
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,556
We've invited you here today
because we need a psychic

154
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,809
who'll do something a bit more special.

155
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,185
Understood?

156
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,314
This is our CEO and also an exorcist.

157
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,440
She's Ms. Hong Ji-a.

158
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,483
Excuse me.

159
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,777
Is it not dangerous?

160
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,529
Are there any side effects?

161
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,365
If it wasn't,
I wouldn't pay you a million won per hour.

162
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,998
If you have no more questions,
we'll begin the test.

163
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,170
What's the best ingredient worldwide
for casting spirits out?

164
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,297
Salt.

165
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,718
Please step over the salt.

166
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,741
What a pity.
You've used up your spiritual energy.

167
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,076
Those whose salt has changed color
may stay.

168
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,786
The rest of you, please leave.

169
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,747
I'll wire you the interview fee.

170
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,081
Goodbye.

171
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,875
Goodbye.

172
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,379
Nice.

173
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,922
All right.

174
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,383
This is the last test.

175
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,897
Climbing all the way up the stairs
is your final test.

176
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,607
Really?

177
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,069
I'll be paid a million won
for just going up these stairs?

178
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,946
You bet.
You'll be paid extra for succeeding.

179
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,323
Extra?

180
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,302
Hyeong-sik, you're next.

181
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,721
Okay.

182
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,274
I can do it.

183
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,166
Who's going to carry them?

184
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,502
You and I together.

185
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,721
I guess neither of them is
the psychic we're looking for.

186
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,057
I wonder if there is such a psychic.

187
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,873
That didn't get rid
of the spirit for good?

188
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,541
As I told you the other day,

189
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,753
the device only creates energy fields
to push the spirits far away.

190
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,255
So it just pushed it away.

191
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,008
I was relieved that the spirit went away.

192
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,511
But without the device,
it will come back, won't it?

193
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,639
Unfortunately, probably.

194
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,184
Leave it here.

195
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,561
I'll let you collect data
from my place for free.

196
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,315
Well, as I explained before,
we're doing this for research.

197
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,567
So I need data
from a wide array of locations.

198
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,402
I am very sorry.

199
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,613
Doctor, I'll disassemble it now.

200
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,989
Wait!

201
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,034
Sir.

202
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:03,952
Doctor.

203
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,715
Okay.

204
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,218
All right.

205
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,971
-Bye.
-How trustworthy.

206
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,521
Ta-da!

207
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,401
Gosh. He mobilizes thugs to buy properties
at cheap prices from the poor,

208
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,736
but he's scared of spirits.

209
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,280
He's terrified
because he's done a lot of shady stuff.

210
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,034
Why don't we go and spend
our hard-earned cash?

211
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,140
Oh, my God.

212
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,394
-How much is the daily rental fee?
-Is that important right now?

213
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,563
Think about how happy this baby
can make me for the day.

214
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,481
That's important.

215
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,067
You are born to be a fraud.

216
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,487
You are born to be an average Joe.

217
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,405
Come on.

218
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,782
You are the only fraud
who saves money in a bank.

219
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,326
You don't know how it feels
to see the number going up.

220
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,369
I don't.

221
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,079
-Gosh.
-Get in.

222
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,582
-Please get in.
-Thank you.

223
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,169
-I'll close the door for you.
-Okay.

224
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,059
This is it.

225
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,024
Hey, hop in!

226
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,818
Hey, there's an empty seat. Get in!

227
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,245
This is nice.

228
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,539
-Oh, my.
-Who could it be?

229
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,791
KIM TAE-JIN

230
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,377
-Come on.
-What is it?

231
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,213
It's Mr. Kim from Tae-jin Nightclub.

232
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,300
He's being so petty
over 50 million won. Gosh.

233
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,886
I hate everything about him
including his face.

234
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,804
He ruined my mood.

235
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,639
TAE-JIN NIGHTCLUB

236
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,436
What?

237
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,064
What is it?

238
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,690
In-beom!

239
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,193
In-beom, answer your phone!

240
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,320
Answer your phone, please!

241
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,281
-Oh In-beom!
-What do we do?

242
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,450
-In-beom!
-I don't know.

243
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,037
What? Look at that punk.

244
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,582
-Act cool.
-Block his car!

245
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,126
-Hold tight.
-Step on it!

246
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,012
Hey, step on it! Faster!

247
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,728
Catch him,
or you're not going home tonight.

248
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,605
Go!

249
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,899
Darn it.

250
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,235
Hey, what do we do now?

251
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,531
-Hold tight.
-Okay.

252
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,742
Step on it. Come on, man.

253
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,955
-Hey.
-We got him.

254
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,624
Hey! Watch out!

255
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,503
-Hey! What are you doing?
-You bastard!

256
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,506
Hey! Pull over now!

257
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,843
Hey! No!

258
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,454
In-beom!

259
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,707
Oh In-beom!

260
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,294
I'll see you again.

261
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,432
I told you to buy it
at the convenience store earlier.

262
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,601
You just have to drink that expensive one.

263
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,730
Come on.
That wouldn't look cool, would it?

264
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,026
This is it.

265
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,362
Seize the day.

266
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,867
What's the point of
tomorrow's dream car or dream house?

267
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,536
I might not even survive the night.

268
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,496
That's life.

269
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,750
Seriously. Kids these days are so weak.

270
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,797
How come no one is spiritually
strong enough to climb the staircase?

271
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,011
You're sighing more heavily than usual.

272
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,971
Hang in there.

273
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,849
We've always had trouble
finding the right psychic.

274
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,602
We are running out of time.

275
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,564
They will redevelop
this neighborhood pretty soon.

276
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,274
We can't hold out here forever.

277
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,318
And I can't leave my mom here all alone.

278
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,738
Did the thugs come again?

279
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,205
Please don't tell me

280
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,209
that you lost your temper
and beat them up.

281
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,087
-Ms. Joo.
-Right.

282
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,423
You're now old enough to know better.

283
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,556
What if there isn't any psychic
that can help my mom leave this world?

284
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,809
What do I do?

285
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,073
Staying in this world

286
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,325
as a spirit without a body is equivalent

287
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,328
to standing outside only in underwear

288
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,081
when there's a snowstorm
in the middle of winter.

289
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,042
If it's that cold, why stay?

290
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,335
That sounds foolish.

291
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,214
Because they can't leave behind
unfair things that happened to them.

292
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:36,428
We can help them forget
about their grudges

293
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,722
and be happy in a warm place.

294
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,863
Mom, you must be cold.

295
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,450
I'm sorry.

296
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,161
Gosh.

297
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,790
I'm really good at sending
vengeful spirits to the other world.

298
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,377
But I can't seem to help you, Mom.

299
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,007
Sorry.

300
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,472
But don't forget

301
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:25,018
I'm Hong Ji-a,
the daughter of the great Hong Mi-jin.

302
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,853
I…

303
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:33,360
I will find the strongest psychic
and help you leave here.

304
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,697
You trust me, right?

305
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,449
I promise.

306
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,082
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

307
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,350
Gosh, you scared me.

308
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,605
So embarrassing.

309
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,982
Did you have a dream?

310
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,859
Yes.

311
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,318
A nightmare.

312
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,614
In-beom.

313
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,785
Never take this off.

314
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,203
Do you understand?

315
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,083
No, my poor son.

316
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,169
No.

317
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,506
There's no way
our Seong-sik committed suicide.

318
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,009
There's something wrong here.

319
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,637
Seong-sik!

320
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,150
Is that your goal?

321
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,152
I'm not even close yet.

322
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,404
I'm sure you're not.

323
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,366
You can't buy a house in Korea
without a loan,

324
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,743
no matter how hard you save.

325
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:52,248
On top of that, there's no one who would
lend us money except for loan sharks.

326
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,333
I see.

327
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,542
Just go back to sleep.

328
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,377
Go back to having nightmares.

329
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,130
Why are you up
spoiling my sweet along time?

330
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:04,260
So to help our hardworking Chief Heo
buy his house as soon as possible,

331
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,222
I found a big job.

332
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,058
-A big one?
-Yes.

333
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,102
-How big?
-This big.

334
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,729
Dream Officetel.

335
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,608
The construction company went bankrupt
last year, so the construction was halted.

336
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,985
Two victims who had bought lots
in the building

337
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,114
committed suicide by jumping
off the roof of the very building.

338
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,200
I'll give you a discount on your rent.

339
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,161
The current owner bought it
and finished the construction.

340
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,873
But there are rumors
that everyone who moves in

341
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,875
either goes mad
or gets killed by a spirit.

342
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,920
It's the perfect situation
for us, isn't it?

343
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,464
This is our target.

344
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,050
The room purchased
by one of the investors who died.

345
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,343
Room 401.

346
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,561
COMMERCIAL SPACE FOR RENT

347
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,645
Fourth floor.

348
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,860
You said you were coming.
Why aren't you here?

349
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,820
What is it?

350
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,656
What? A spirit?

351
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,911
Fine, tell them to just forget it.

352
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,958
I told you we should ask
Mr. Oh to do an exorcism.

353
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,252
As soon as you install the device

354
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,379
-invented at a US college--
-Come on.

355
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,425
Spirits are not mosquitos.
You catch them with an electronic device.

356
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,969
My goodness.

357
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,681
-Where are you going?
-To take a dump.

358
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,183
All your nonsense
has given me a stomachache.

359
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,338
Great, we've now set the mood.

360
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,924
When he comes out,
let's add the sound and wrap it up.

361
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,932
An exorcism, my foot.

362
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,684
Doesn't she know
we don't have money for that?

363
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,022
What the hell?
What does the maintenance do?

364
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,857
They should've replaced the bulbs.

365
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,032
What?

366
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,835
Who's there?

367
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,313
Honey?

368
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,069
What's with him?
He's not supposed to be out yet.

369
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,453
Honey?

370
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,874
What?

371
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,792
What did you do?

372
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,295
-I didn't do anything.
-Then what's going on?

373
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,505
At this crucial moment.

374
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,924
-This shouldn't be happening.
-Fix it.

375
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,599
Honey,

376
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,809
what's the matter?

377
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,186
Honey,

378
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,979
what are you doing?

379
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,279
Honey, what are you doing there?

380
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,867
-What's going on? What's happening?
- Honey…

381
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,535
What happened?

382
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,163
Get down!

383
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,667
Are you insane?

384
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,002
What just happened?

385
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,798
I wasn't trying to die.

386
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,551
Then why were you up there?

387
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,720
I don't know why I ended up there.

388
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,473
What's going on?

389
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,725
It's working.

390
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,728
What happened? Was the hologram turned on?

391
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,063
I don't think so.

392
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,941
Darn it. We should've seen it.

393
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,485
It's the owner's wife.

394
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,239
Hello, ma'am.

395
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,409
It's not difficult
to install those devices,

396
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,662
but you said your husband
was opposed to them.

397
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:26,249
It doesn't matter.
Please set them up right away.

398
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,793
All right. Okay.

399
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,755
Yes, ma'am.

400
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,884
What do you mean, an exorcism?

401
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,596
Are you trying to rip me off?

402
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,182
We don't charge for the exorcism.

403
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:47,061
Like other realty firms, we only get
a commission after the sale is completed.

404
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,272
Really?

405
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,067
You can't go back on your word later.

406
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,867
Did you see the spirit yourself?

407
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,328
No.

408
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,123
Wait

409
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,208
I think I did.

410
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,126
Did you?

411
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:15,131
I mean, I saw my wife throwing herself
off the rooftop out of the blue.

412
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,342
Then suddenly,
I was the one standing on the edge.

413
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,512
It was like I was possessed by a spirit.

414
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,513
You were possessed.

415
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,183
Right?

416
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,475
Who could it be?

417
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,146
You see, I bought the building at auction.

418
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,941
Later I found out that two investors
fell to their deaths from it.

419
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,112
If you don't buy this, you're a fool.

420
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:44,118
I've never seen such a good site for sale
in my entire career.

421
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,747
I don't have the money
to buy a lot in a commercial building.

422
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,915
I didn't either.

423
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:52,418
Who invests with their own money
these days? Everyone takes out a loan.

424
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,502
A loan?

425
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,297
But what about the interest?

426
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,716
God, you're so frustrating.

427
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,885
After renting out the lot for a year,

428
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,221
you'll have earned enough
to pay it all off.

429
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,183
Remember that naive kid, Jae-hun?

430
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,311
Everyone said he was a fool
when he bought his house. But now?

431
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,563
The price went up
by 300 million won in a year.

432
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,150
The Korean real estate market
is invincible.

433
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,241
I can pay back the principal and interest
in a year if I rent it out.

434
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:27,286
If it were that easy to make money,
everyone in the world would be rich.

435
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,373
Father, everyone makes
money this way these days.

436
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,960
If they all decide to die,
will you do the same?

437
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,003
Why are you swayed by others?

438
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,256
Is it wrong to want to live like others?

439
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,635
While my friends studied without
worrying about their tuition in college,

440
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,137
I did three part-time jobs.

441
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,433
Had you given me
as much as the other parents did…

442
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,146
Yeong-do, what's going on?

443
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,189
-Bankrupt?
-I'm sorry.

444
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,275
-I'm sorry!
-I don't know. I'm a victim too.

445
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,568
Gosh! I'm done for!

446
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,070
Goodness!

447
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,948
What should I do?

448
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,245
-No!
-What should I do?

449
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,706
-Goodness.
-What about my money?

450
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,124
Goodness!

451
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,209
Selling your soul, being in debt,

452
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,004
a negative account, and panic buying.

453
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:22,717
These two young men believed
Korean real estate was invincible.

454
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,512
What made them commit suicide?

455
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,098
This happened last year.

456
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,266
DREAM OFFICETEL CASE

457
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,393
The construction company went bankrupt,

458
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,772
and two victims who lost all their money
jumped off the building together.

459
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,649
Yang U-jin and Nam Yeong-do

460
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,777
were 30-year-olds and friends.

461
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,614
If they jumped, then it's similar
to what the owner couple attempted

462
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,158
when they were possessed.

463
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,493
The police concluded
that they'd committed suicide

464
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,372
because they couldn't even pay
the interest of the loan they took out.

465
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,749
They took out a loan?

466
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,254
They should have thought it through.

467
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,549
They must've been so desperate.

468
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:09,388
What's important is identifying
whose vengeful spirit is wandering around.

469
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,474
Let me go check his face.

470
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,714
Fourth floor.

471
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,965
How long will you keep this up?

472
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,651
I know you're still roaming around
because you feel resentment.

473
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,531
I'm sure you hate the person
responsible for your death

474
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,158
and those who ridiculed you.

475
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,953
But nothing will change
even if you kill everyone in the world.

476
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,206
You'll only feel colder and suffer more.

477
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,352
Two vengeful spirits
are tied to each other.

478
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,027
Ms. Joo, I've checked.

479
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,779
We'll get to work tomorrow midnight,
so look for a buyer.

480
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,662
What's her deal?

481
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,873
Is she insane?

482
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,172
You were here already.

483
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,091
I inspected the device
before disassembling it.

484
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,927
What? Disassemble?

485
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,596
Thanks to your device,
I could get a good night's sleep.

486
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,848
How much is it? I'll buy it.

487
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,852
-This is why I called you.
-It's for research only, so…

488
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,480
-What are you doing here?
-Honey.

489
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,815
-Gosh.
-This is Doctor Oh In-beom.

490
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,193
I told you about him.

491
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,862
He's the researcher
from Stanford University.

492
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,323
Hello, I'm Oh In-beom,
Doctor of the Paranormal.

493
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,492
Hello.

494
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,752
I already hired a real estate agency.
They'll get rid of all the spirits.

495
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,672
What kind of realtor performs exorcisms?

496
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,300
You got scammed.
How much more do they want?

497
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,718
What do you take me for?

498
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,346
I've checked that they'll
only get the commission.

499
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,224
Let them do whatever they want
to get rid of the spirits.

500
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,893
They promised to sell it at a normal price
so let's wait.

501
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,019
Normal…

502
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,481
-At a normal price?
-That's right.

503
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,573
Doctor.

504
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,994
Have you disassembled everything?

505
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,329
Sure.

506
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,373
I'm happy for you.

507
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,542
Thank you.

508
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,054
Did you hear?

509
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,808
They'll sell it at a normal price?
That agency must be really good.

510
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,810
They're not selling anything.

511
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,688
They'll probably bail
after receiving a heavy pre-payment.

512
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,442
There are way too many scammers
in this world.

513
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,820
Check all nearby CCTV cameras.

514
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,905
-I think I know who it is.
-Did you see them?

515
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,171
It's her.

516
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,799
She's pretty.

517
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,843
Pretty, my foot.

518
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,765
I thought she was insane.
But she's a scammer?

519
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,186
49NA 0681

520
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,022
DAEBAK REALTY

521
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,735
Daebak Realty.
The CEO's name is Hong Ji-a.

522
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,405
Simply put, they perform exorcisms
in haunted houses and sell them.

523
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,240
Isn't that brilliant?

524
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,035
They're only open at night.

525
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,537
Are you sure they're open at all?

526
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,040
No one has seen Hong perform an exorcism.

527
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,377
Not even her clients.
She performs it in secret.

528
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,714
Of course. Since anyone can tell
it's a scam if they see it.

529
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,716
Where are you going?

530
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,763
I should know exactly whom
I'm dealing with to attack them properly.

531
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,264
Here I go.

532
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:49,937
DAEBAK REALTY

533
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,282
Construction companies, agencies,

534
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,244
and home shopping? All right.

535
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,041
DAEBAK REALTY

536
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,592
She buys her daily necessities online.

537
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,178
Judging by the items,

538
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,264
I'm certain she lives alone.

539
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,142
Investigation 101.

540
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,686
Start with their garbage.

541
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,952
Excuse me.

542
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,787
-Hello, I'm…
-Where are you from?

543
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,957
Construction? Service? Union?

544
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,500
Are you here alone?

545
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,712
I think there's a misunderstanding. I'm…

546
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,964
Of course.
You wouldn't come here all alone.

547
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,674
I'm not with them.

548
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,968
In that case, leave.

549
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,386
Before you get hurt.

550
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,813
Kim Tae-jin?

551
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,901
You seem busy, so I'll just leave.

552
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,114
TAE-JIN SERVICE

553
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,450
Gosh, this is pitiful.

554
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,329
Ms. Hong.

555
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:34,666
Come on. Holding out like this
won't solve any problem. You know that.

556
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,087
You could get evicted without getting paid
half the market price.

557
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,633
I hope you make the right decision.

558
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,677
I've already made my decision.
I'm not selling.

559
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,013
So quit being a nuisance and get lost.

560
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,767
Why? Why won't you sell it?

561
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,352
Chief Heo.

562
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,938
In-beom, I don't see you.
Are you hiding well?

563
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:56,855
How much?

564
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,483
-How much do you want?
-I told you already.

565
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,611
My mom's spirit lives here,
so I can't leave her behind.

566
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:06,114
-That again?
-If you don't believe me, then so be it.

567
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,034
It was quite original at first,
but not anymore.

568
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,202
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

569
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,912
Maybe we were too nice.

570
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,540
-Turn the police siren on right now.
-Siren? Why?

571
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,917
-Hurry up!
-Don't go easy on her.

572
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,794
Sex discrimination is bad.

573
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:36,979
What's this?

574
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,817
What's going on?

575
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:47,030
DAEBAK REALTY

576
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,663
I'm scared.

577
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,293
Stop it.

578
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:18,645
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry…

579
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,155
What?

580
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,281
Why are they like that?

581
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,367
-Ji-cheol. Hurry.
-Don't rush me.

582
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,411
Hey, be patient. Gosh.

583
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,147
I didn't think
it would scare them this much.

584
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,817
Who knew the police siren
would scare them out of their wits?

585
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,862
I was able to think on my feet.

586
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,739
Right. I just did what's right.

587
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,366
No need to thank me.

588
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,867
Are you from the borough office?

589
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,412
What? Have you ever seen such
an impeccably dressed civil servant?

590
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,209
Actually, I'm studying paranormal events.

591
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,962
I came here because I felt
quite strong energy from here.

592
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,888
I know it may sound absurd,

593
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,308
but there is a vengeful spirit here.

594
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,520
And the spirit resents you.

595
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,149
The vengeful spirit is here…

596
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,903
because it resents me?

597
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,660
If you don't take action,
the resentment will grow

598
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,579
and might kill you.

599
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,794
Have you been
hired for any realty recently?

600
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,551
That's where the spirit is from.

601
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,637
Luckily, it latched onto you not long ago.
I can get rid of it--

602
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,558
You are a fraud, aren't you?

603
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,729
You must have worked out.

604
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,231
My agility is above average, you know.

605
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,316
But you are super-fast.

606
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,286
Let go so we can talk.

607
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,414
I can get out of this on my own,
but I don't want to hurt you.

608
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,544
Fine! I'm a fraud! But…

609
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,796
But you are a fraud too.

610
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,922
I know everything.

611
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,469
Dream Officetel.
I've been working on it for a month.

612
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,429
So butt out.

613
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,097
Frauds have a code of ethics too.

614
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,140
A code of ethics?

615
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,771
If you don't want to die young,
find another job.

616
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,856
If you keep scamming people
by using spirits,

617
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,691
you might face a sudden death.

618
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,362
Darn it.

619
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,283
Hey, are you okay?

620
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,076
Why did she attack you?

621
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,497
Exactly. I helped her!
How dare she treat me like this?

622
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,875
Let's go to Dream Officetel.

623
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,794
Now? Why?

624
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,296
Set it up again with our best stuff.

625
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,008
Let's see which one of us
ends up looking for another job.

626
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,776
I told you to order your own
if you were going to eat.

627
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,238
I just want a slice.
Why would I order a whole pizza?

628
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,823
I must eat the whole thing.

629
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,701
I must stuff myself to feel less cold
during the exorcism later.

630
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,454
Ms. Hong.

631
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:08,291
Eating a lot will not solve
the source of the problem.

632
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,794
Why the serious face?

633
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,589
During the exorcism,
your body temperature drops because

634
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,925
you're not strong enough.

635
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,597
So I can have a slice.

636
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:30,647
Did you come up with a plan
for the tied-up spirits?

637
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,693
It'll be hard to separate them
before they take up bodies.

638
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,071
So after I put both of them
into Hyeong-sik's body,

639
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,407
I need to stab him twice consecutively.

640
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,785
Will you tell him
that you will stab him twice?

641
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,245
Why would I?

642
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:46,788
Right.

643
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,749
He would be scared if he knew.

644
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,879
-Hello.
-Hey, Hyeong-sik.

645
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,714
Hi.

646
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,466
Our valuable psychic, Hyeong-sik.

647
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,888
Before we set out, make sure
no one can get into the building.

648
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,056
There can't be any outsiders
even by mistake.

649
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,642
The building owner promised
to empty the fourth floor.

650
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:11,396
The elevators and staircases will be
sealed off from 11:30 p.m. to 1 a.m.

651
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,260
Looking good.

652
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,805
Let's make sure
the sounds come out on time.

653
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,367
NAM YEONG-DO

654
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,836
YANG U-JIN

655
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,239
Should I pack extra rock salt?

656
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,532
I already did.

657
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,371
Let's go.

658
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,330
Okay.

659
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,614
Don't salt the door.
The spirits must enter.

660
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,617
Gosh. I've been doing this
for six months now.

661
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,763
I salted all over here
except for the door.

662
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,724
-Okay.
-What are they doing?

663
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,643
Gosh. Are they trying to catch a raccoon?

664
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,563
Oh, my. They even lit incense
when no one's watching.

665
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,148
And she got a cool incense burner.

666
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,359
Hey, be quiet.
Let's start with the sounds first.

667
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,659
I told you to start with the sounds.
Why are you changing the lights?

668
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,495
Chief Heo.

669
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,331
Mr. Oh. In-beom.

670
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,084
Why isn't he answering?

671
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,380
What? What's wrong with this now?

672
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,008
What is he doing?

673
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,345
Hey.

674
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:31,971
Ji-cheol!

675
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,641
Can't you hear me?

676
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,313
Why is it so chilly in here?

677
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,158
Fourth floor.

678
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:40,415
You stand no chance. Let's
not drag this out and end it quickly.

679
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,500
Hyeong-sik, take it off.

680
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,736
You…

681
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,614
What was that?

682
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,283
Why are they suddenly fighting?

683
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,754
Hey!

684
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,051
Stay still, you crazy fool.

685
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,368
I'll kill them all.

686
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,208
Yeong-do.

687
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,380
-Please stop this now.
-Don't try to stop me.

688
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,509
I'll burn this building down,
and then I'll kill myself.

689
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,885
Don't you think it's unfair?

690
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,014
Unfair?

691
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,227
How could you say that to me?

692
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,565
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

693
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,610
Darn it!

694
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,241
You and I were both too greedy
for our own good.

695
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,784
We didn't invest, we gambled.

696
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,329
But why are you blaming others?

697
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,666
I'm going to quit now and start over.
You should come to your senses too.

698
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,502
Shut it.

699
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,755
You're the one who needs to wake up.

700
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,341
No matter how hard we try,

701
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,136
we'll have to repay the debt
for the rest of our lives.

702
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:45,058
You might be happy
working in manual labor forever,

703
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,184
but not me.

704
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,477
I'd rather die

705
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,395
than live like that.

706
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,070
Nam Yeong-do.

707
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,739
I feel so bad for you.

708
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,767
Feel bad for me?

709
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,686
Do you feel bad for me?

710
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,188
Who do you think you are?

711
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,731
Damn it.

712
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:41,864
What?

713
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:45,827
Hey.

714
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,830
You're not dead, right?

715
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,457
U-jin?

716
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,210
U-jin?

717
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:57,171
U-jin!

718
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,613
I didn't do anything wrong.

719
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:24,699
I don't know anything.

720
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,660
I didn't do anything wrong.

721
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,084
You came here

722
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,336
alone.

723
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,507
And you drank alone

724
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,510
and fell to your death.

725
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,239
TO MY FATHER, FROM U-JIN

726
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,701
Yeong-do.

727
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,203
Let go.

728
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,622
You're going to make me fall too.

729
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,874
Yeong-do, please save me.

730
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,334
-Let go!
-Please, Yeong-do.

731
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,085
Please save me.

732
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,837
-Please save me.
-No.

733
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:21,672
Please.

734
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,592
No!

735
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,436
It's so unfair.

736
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,147
I didn't do anything wrong.

737
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,233
I…

738
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,570
This is why I hate this job.

739
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,835
Ms. Hong! It's me.

740
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,753
Where did Yang U-jin go?

741
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,441
Hey, Fraud.

742
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,194
Are you a psychic?

743
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,120
What, a psychic?

744
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,998
That's what we call people
easily possessed by spirits.

745
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,666
I knew I got a bad feeling
from that woman.

746
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,127
-She's insane.
-Is something wrong?

747
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,630
-I keep thinking of that fraud psychic.
-Did you fall for him?

748
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,882
The biggest private art museum in Korea.

749
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,635
They had a new construction
planned in Yongin,

750
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,054
but it isn't proceeding
because of rumors of a spirit appearing.

751
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,640
I hate people saying stuff about spirits.

752
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,016
It's that ghost.

753
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,601
It disappeared into the museum,

754
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,561
but I'll need to come back
during the day to confirm.

755
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,355
-Installation complete.
-Oh In-beom.

756
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,191
Don't move a single step
until I say it's all right.

757
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,652
It'll cause me more trouble
if something happens to you already.
