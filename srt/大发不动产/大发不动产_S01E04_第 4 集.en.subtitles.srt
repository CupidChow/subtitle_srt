1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,129
Now. Take off the necklace.

2
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,882
I can't do it. I won't.

3
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,384
You can do it. You have to.

4
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,595
I don't want to do this, Mom.

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,398
Ji-a, are you awake?

6
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,279
Auntie.

7
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:14,991
Where's Mom?

8
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,297
Call me if you need any help.
Anytime, okay?

9
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,802
Mom died because of me, didn't she?

10
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,763
No, that's not true.

11
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,350
Mom told me to stab the ghost,

12
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,894
but I was too scared to do it.

13
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,563
You were right.

14
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,149
It's happened to me
a lot since I was little.

15
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,860
I always thought I was sleepwalking.

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,906
But now I know that was spirit possession.

17
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,579
Do you know how many times
I woke up with bloody hands?

18
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,623
I don't want that…

19
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,668
to happen anymore.

20
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,962
You'll never wake up

21
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,965
with bloody hands again.

22
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,717
I won't let that happen. I promise.

23
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,221
So trust me and take the necklace off.

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,686
Ji-won,

25
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,272
after the surgery,

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,524
let's go home.

27
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,028
I'll get it ready.

28
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,670
Ji-won,

29
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,674
how could I…

30
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,678
leave you all alone?

31
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,190
I have to go home.

32
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,902
I have to go home.

33
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,528
Home?

34
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,365
Why would someone who died at home
become a wandering spirit?

35
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,751
What just entered…

36
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,587
my body?

37
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,759
The memories that the spirit
could not let go of until he died.

38
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,616
Please come again.

39
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,327
Why did you tear it off
when I was going to take it off?

40
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,789
I was getting emotionally prepared.
That's assault!

41
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,667
You should've taken it off
when I told you to.

42
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,210
I was going to.

43
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,588
Even if you hadn't done that,
I would've taken it off.

44
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,133
What is this?

45
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,303
Does that guy have no pride?

46
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,179
What's there to cry about?

47
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,557
Hey, mister, it's not like that.

48
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,813
This isn't me crying.

49
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,772
I know.

50
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,733
That's a side effect.

51
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,573
A side effect?

52
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,009
Once the vengeful spirit's memories
enter your body,

53
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,552
even after the exorcism is over,

54
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,013
those memories and habits
remain in you for a while.

55
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,266
So I recommend you
to stay home for a week.

56
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,394
-You should've told me that!
-It's in the contract.

57
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,604
The contract…

58
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,237
How long did you say it lasts?

59
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,741
A week? It's not forever, is it?

60
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,618
The emotions gradually wear away.

61
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,954
But the memories stay.

62
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,961
So these painful memories
will last forever?

63
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,131
The memories of strangers'?

64
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,512
Is this what you made your psychics do
to make money?

65
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:32,517
Gosh, you're really cruel.
You don't even pay us that much.

66
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,187
Vengeful spirits' memories
shouldn't be absorbed by psychics.

67
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,606
What do you mean?

68
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,359
Usually, the exorcist
is the one who absorbs them.

69
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,489
But strangely, when I perform an exorcism
with you, you absorb their memories.

70
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,950
I told you this the day we first met.

71
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,131
I see. So is that why you asked me
to work together?

72
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,091
You coldhearted woman.

73
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,135
You're the one who mentioned it first.

74
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,553
Do you not remember that?

75
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,289
Like I said, it's best to stay home.

76
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,308
Oh In-beom.

77
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,688
What is it this time?

78
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,067
Eat your favorite dishes,
watch your favorite shows,

79
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,110
and buy whatever you like.

80
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,197
Try to take your mind off it.

81
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,576
Good work today.

82
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,121
DAEBAK REALTY

83
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,752
How long have you been doing this?

84
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,549
Ten years.

85
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,759
Why?

86
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,222
It must've been tough.

87
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,766
I've only done it once,
and it's already unbearable.

88
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,518
But doing this alone for ten years?

89
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,896
You did great today as well, Ms. Hong.

90
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,029
DAEBAK REALTY

91
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,886
Great work today.

92
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,389
I got your favorite dish ready.

93
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,516
Enjoy it and rest up.

94
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,693
My God!

95
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,198
Check out my reflexes.
I saved the chicken.

96
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,287
You want me to carry them
one by one safely?

97
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,205
Making several trips is a hassle.

98
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,459
Move aside. You're in my way.

99
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,630
Forget it.

100
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,383
I'll just go this way, my gosh.

101
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,599
Darn it.

102
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,976
It's…

103
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,856
Gosh, could you just move aside for once?

104
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,109
Gosh.

105
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,654
Let's eat.

106
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,117
This looks delicious.

107
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,967
-I finally understand why.
-What?

108
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,011
What do you mean?

109
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,973
Kids in my neighborhood
never played with me.

110
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,396
Some of them threw stones at me
while some ran away crying.

111
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,940
The look on their faces was

112
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,318
the same as yours.

113
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,658
It's okay.

114
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,285
Even my grandma said

115
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,665
that I was possessed by ghosts
and that it was my fate.

116
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,999
She'd curse at me.

117
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,255
I thought it was ridiculous.

118
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,799
But she was right.

119
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,474
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,356
You know that I'm a scaredy-cat.

121
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,817
Do understand. Please?

122
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,778
I'll never be afraid of you ever again.
I promise.

123
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,821
Are you still

124
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,489
scared of me?

125
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,490
No.

126
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,715
What do you want to do?

127
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,718
Do you want to quit here?

128
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,183
No.

129
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,353
I still don't know why my uncle had this.

130
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,273
I must find out.

131
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,404
Having chicken and beer after work
is the best.

132
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,868
It must've been tough.

133
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,454
I've only done it once,
and it's already unbearable.

134
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,164
But doing this alone for ten years?

135
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,251
I guess he's not that bad
of a guy after all.

136
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,004
Don't you think so?

137
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,095
What's your problem? Is this fun for you?

138
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,015
You keep startling me.

139
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,102
I finished all of them.

140
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,163
Got it.

141
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,717
I'm possessed.

142
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,679
No matter what you hear,
do not come downstairs.

143
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,596
Understood?

144
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,613
No.

145
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,907
Don't go.

146
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,034
Don't go.

147
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:30,828
No!

148
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,628
Pull yourself together, Ji-a!

149
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,714
You have to do this.

150
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,841
Now.

151
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,678
Wake up, Hong Ji-a.

152
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,180
This isn't real.

153
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,266
You must wake up.

154
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,660
Mom…

155
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,999
Mom… I'm sorry…

156
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,514
Sorry, Mom.

157
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,518
I'm sorry, Mom.

158
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,235
I'm sorry, Mom.

159
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,070
Ms. Hong!

160
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,155
Ms. Hong!

161
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,199
Open up.

162
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,784
DAEBAK REALTY

163
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,202
Ms. Hong!

164
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,954
I know you're inside. Come on.

165
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,707
Ms. Hong.

166
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,208
Hey, Hong Ji-a!

167
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,421
"Hey, Hong Ji-a"?

168
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,841
Why did you pretend you weren't in?

169
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,010
-What is it?
-Don't treat me like a stranger.

170
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,261
Open up.

171
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,096
If it's not urgent, let's talk later.

172
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,055
Wait.

173
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,559
This is urgent.

174
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,275
My heart is breaking
because of the painter's memories.

175
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,986
I can neither eat nor sleep.

176
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,613
And I cry all the time.

177
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,700
Gosh. I'm about to cry again.

178
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,869
Just give it a week.

179
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,621
I explained everything to you yesterday.

180
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,582
You said you would take care of it.

181
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,712
Take responsibility for what you said!

182
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,091
What? You look awful.

183
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,302
-Shouldn't you go see a doctor?
-Be quiet.

184
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,928
Just come in.

185
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,474
Go ahead.

186
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,184
Pardon?

187
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,521
You wanted a solution.

188
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,233
Punching the sandbag until I forget
the deceased's memories is my solution.

189
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,402
Is there another solution
that's non-violent?

190
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,029
I'm a delicate guy.

191
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,031
Then, punch it delicately.

192
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,700
You can't just leave like that.

193
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,749
It was urgent.

194
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,258
Sorry. It was urgent for me as well.

195
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,889
Urgent? What do you mean?

196
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,100
I told you. When I touch you…

197
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,771
When you touch my body,
it becomes warm again.

198
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,317
Oh, that?
Then you must be very grateful to me.

199
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,612
So you must help
to get me out of this misery!

200
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,699
-What do you want me to do?
-I don't know. Do something!

201
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,536
Do you know what happened to me
last night?

202
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,248
ADMINISTRATION,
PRESCRIPTION PICKUP COUNTER

203
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,528
Excuse me.

204
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,489
Excuse me.

205
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,119
Who are you?

206
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,371
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

207
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,132
Gosh. How did I end up here?

208
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,137
I came to see her, but I'm leaving now.

209
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,141
Wait.

210
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,642
Yes?

211
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,978
Can you give this
to Ms. Choi Ji-won's guardian?

212
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,237
He had a wife?

213
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,243
They didn't register their marriage,
but they were married.

214
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,705
And his wife is very sick now.

215
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,249
She needs to get the surgery,

216
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,336
but the money…

217
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,504
I've given it some thought.

218
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,382
Let's ask Director Lee
to give back one of his paintings.

219
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,092
If she does, it means

220
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,095
that she's acknowledging
that there was a ghost painter.

221
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,849
There's no way she'd take
that big of a risk.

222
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,311
-Darn it!
-Hey.

223
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,357
When you punched it,
you imagined it was my face, right?

224
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,450
Then I have no choice
but to get the media involved.

225
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,954
If we disclose
Kim Byeong-ho's videos online,

226
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,498
Britium will be an accomplice
in this grand fraud case

227
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,959
and face a huge monetary loss.

228
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,462
And I'm sure you will be
in a tight spot since you signed

229
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,880
an NDA with her.

230
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,299
"The grand fraud case…"

231
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,345
You don't have the videos, do you?

232
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,974
You didn't even watch the videos, did you?

233
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,142
The videos? I deleted all of them.

234
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,936
Every single one of them.

235
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,856
Ms. Hong told us to erase all of them
when she got us out.

236
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:20,195
Gosh. No way.
Do you think I'd bluff without the videos?

237
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,575
Come on.

238
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,455
Didn't you see the yellow ginkgo tree
in his painting?

239
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,791
He drew that in because his wife liked it.

240
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,042
But how can I…

241
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,630
Just think that you watched
a very sad movie.

242
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,009
As you can't change the plot of a movie,
there's nothing we can do.

243
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,137
He's already dead, anyway.

244
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,557
But Choi Ji-won is alive!

245
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,686
We don't do exorcisms
just for vengeful spirits,

246
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,230
but also for the people left behind.

247
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,734
They must go on with their lives.

248
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,822
Say something.

249
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,414
Darn it.

250
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,127
He was incredibly talented,

251
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,671
but he only led a life of suffering.

252
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,734
It's such a good deal,
and it's all thanks to you.

253
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,029
I'm just happy to do business with you.

254
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,032
It's an honor
that both of you are satisfied.

255
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,742
All right. I'll get going now.

256
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,662
Ms. Hong.
I'll count on you again next time.

257
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,794
I won't see you out, sir.

258
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,505
Good luck with your business.

259
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,557
I made sure the backed-up videos
were deleted.

260
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,186
It's up to you to decide
to delete these videos as well.

261
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,900
So you are telling me

262
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,570
that the vengeful spirit
will no longer show up here?

263
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,613
That's right.

264
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,282
I took care of it for good.

265
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,540
My husband wanted
to be a painter at first.

266
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,668
As he couldn't fulfill his dream,

267
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,797
he had a deep affection for Britium

268
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,050
And expanding the museum
was his last wish.

269
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,176
But,

270
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,054
he left too soon to see that.

271
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,937
Your husband had a happy life.

272
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:07,487
I know that you were hoping that
the vengeful spirit here was him.

273
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,285
I wanted to see him one last time

274
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,496
even if it was just his spirit.

275
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,915
But he didn't show up.

276
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,918
How cold-hearted.

277
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,589
People who led happy lives
don't remain as vengeful spirits.

278
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,301
The fact that you can't see his spirit

279
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,388
proves that he led a happy life with you.

280
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,441
They didn't register their marriage,
but they were married.

281
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,902
And his wife is very sick now.

282
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,781
Those paintings belong to Kim Byeong-ho.
I'm sure she will give one to his wife.

283
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,790
Mr. Kim had a wife.

284
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,716
Mr. Kim painted a yellow gingko tree
in many of his paintings

285
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,886
because it was his wife's favorite tree.

286
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:17,349
As for the self-portrait,
he painted it for himself.

287
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,186
Can you at least give it back to his wife?

288
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,404
That's all you have to say, right?

289
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,338
That was embarrassing.

290
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,841
This is all Oh In-beom's fault.
Why did I embarrass myself like that?

291
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,741
I would've gladly said yes to that price.

292
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,077
You should have told me.

293
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,287
I thought

294
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,666
you were waiting
for the price to fall further.

295
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,671
Then I assumed
you had missed your chance, Mr. Do.

296
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,174
Perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.

297
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,347
Please have your tea before it cools.

298
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,391
If you don't drink it at the right moment,

299
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,894
you can't fully
appreciate the taste of the tea.

300
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,786
It's bitter.

301
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,461
What is this?

302
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,927
In-beom, what are you doing?
You're scaring me.

303
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,351
Hey, don't come closer. Go away!

304
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,731
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

305
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,233
-Blood.
-Blood?

306
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,782
-What's going on?
-It's blood!

307
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,658
What's going on?

308
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,624
It's a side effect of being possessed.

309
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,710
How will you live like this?

310
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,215
-Wait a minute.
-What is it?

311
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,178
Just now, I've created a painting
of Kim Byeong-ho…

312
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,432
No, a painting by Cho Hyeon-seo,
the greatest painter of all time.

313
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,017
-Right?
-Right.

314
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,229
If it's a Cho Hyeon-seo piece…

315
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,523
That's amazing.

316
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,109
These side effects
aren't necessarily bad things.

317
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,320
With this, we can take care
of Ms. Choi's surgery.

318
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,697
Are you kidding me? Ms. Choi?

319
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,367
Why do we have to pay
for a stranger's surgery?

320
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,792
Because I have to take care
of that stranger for me to live on.

321
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,087
Whenever I picture that face,

322
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,382
my heart…

323
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,260
Here it comes again.

324
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,638
-The tears are streaming down.
-Anyway,

325
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,141
I have to do it to live.

326
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,351
And as for the painting,

327
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,645
I can just make another one.

328
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,856
That's true.

329
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,276
If you draw paintings with these hands…

330
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,653
You're a goose that lays the golden eggs!

331
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,495
Find an art lover
with most cash in this industry.

332
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,456
Okay, just wait a moment.

333
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,139
-Are you really not going?
-Go without me.

334
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,934
The more people,
the more vengeful spirits.

335
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,987
It's here.

336
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,031
Hey.

337
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,657
Hey.

338
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,666
Thank you.

339
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,718
In-beom's not doing
anything stupid, right?

340
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,636
He is.

341
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,347
He went to the museum to sell a painting.

342
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,140
He went to sell what?

343
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,565
The ambience is so classy here.

344
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,483
That's great.

345
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,920
-See you later.
-See you soon.

346
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,089
-All right.
-Goodbye.

347
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,595
-Long time no see, Hwa-jeong.
-Hello.

348
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,431
Do you still work at that old shop?
Any desire to come back?

349
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,349
What?

350
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,143
The work is just so fun.

351
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,438
I wonder, how did the CEO
manage to convince you?

352
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,774
What? you said you weren't coming.

353
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,068
-Have you seen Oh In-beom?
-No.

354
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,823
What?

355
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,742
Who is that beauty?

356
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,370
The CEO of our shabby shop.

357
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,291
Ms. Hong, fancy seeing you here.

358
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,085
Director Lee told me
it's been sorted out thanks to you.

359
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,169
Good work.

360
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,725
SPECIAL EXHIBITION OF KIM BYEONG-HO,
THE TRAGIC GENIUS

361
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,856
The painter Kim Byeong-ho
had no education and no connections.

362
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,402
He had to live for 20 years
as the ghost painter

363
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:49,157
of Cho Hyeon-seo, the well-educated
and well-connected artist.

364
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,082
-What is that?
-My gosh!

365
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,542
-What?
-Isn't that the painting?

366
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,711
She's saying he didn't paint them?

367
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,212
-What?
-What is this?

368
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:08,426
What? She said no so firmly,
but she convinced Director Lee in the end.

369
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,765
The truth

370
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,268
was only revealed
after the painter passed away.

371
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,520
I could endure that time
with love for my art,

372
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,272
and today, with this prize,

373
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,901
I feel I have been rewarded
for the time and effort

374
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,611
I have poured into my work.

375
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,075
This piece won Cho Hyeon-seo
the grand prize at an art contest.

376
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,202
But before that,

377
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,996
when it was submitted
under Kim Byeong-ho's name,

378
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,332
it did not even pass
the preliminary rounds.

379
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,670
We Britium,

380
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,172
even if we must reveal our own mistakes,

381
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,383
have decided to reveal the truth

382
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,303
to show respect
for the late artist though it's belated.

383
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,139
We sincerely apologize to everyone here,

384
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,809
as well as to artist Kim Byeong-ho.

385
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,229
-That was shocking.
-This is insane.

386
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,148
-I can't believe it.
-Really?

387
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,318
Cho Hyeon-seo fled.

388
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,406
It doesn't matter what country.

389
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,033
Just get one that leaves the soonest.

390
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,999
Fancy meeting you here,

391
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,250
Artist Cho.

392
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,292
Darn it.

393
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,878
Are you insane, you jerk?

394
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,007
Do you want to die?

395
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,216
Mr. Cho Hyeon-seo.

396
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,804
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kim Byeong-ho.

397
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,764
-Murder?
-What?

398
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,392
-Not fraud?
-Do you have proof?

399
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,353
Yes, we have video footage of you
killing Mr. Kim.

400
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,022
-A video?
-That's impossible.

401
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,356
I deleted everything.

402
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,524
What?

403
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,278
You want 200 million won?
You must be insane.

404
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,449
You're not in your right mind.
Are you gambling without me knowing?

405
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:58,369
I know my pieces
are worth at least that much.

406
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,954
"My pieces"?

407
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,957
You think that's the value of your work?

408
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,462
It's the value of my reputation,
the reputation of Cho Hyeon-seo.

409
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,549
If you try to sell them with your name,
you won't even get 200,000 won.

410
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,800
But I…

411
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,429
They say I'm in the final stages
of lung cancer.

412
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,891
I'm dying.

413
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,272
For old times' sake,

414
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,108
could you please pay me

415
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,904
the proper price for my work this once?

416
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,075
I really need that money.

417
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,659
Stage 4 lung cancer?

418
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,913
I want to spend
the rest of my time in my hometown

419
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,915
with my wife.

420
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,167
Hold on.

421
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,046
Lung cancer?

422
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,591
What will happen to me if you die?

423
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,759
What about me?

424
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,267
-What are you doing?
-Move aside. These are all mine.

425
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,731
Move. They're mine.

426
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,191
And…

427
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,945
-No, not this one.
-That's mine too. Nothing's yours.

428
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,989
No! Please! This is mine…

429
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,866
-No.
-Move! It's mine!

430
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,159
I said, move!

431
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,173
Hey.

432
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,303
Hey. What's wrong with you?

433
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,228
Darn it!

434
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,037
No. Wait.

435
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,331
That's not what happened. Wait.

436
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,838
I'd like to sincerely thank
all of you for coming.

437
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,806
She turned the worst case into
something favorable. She's indeed amazing.

438
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,271
Hello.

439
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,274
I didn't think you'd tell the truth.

440
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,651
I wasn't going to.

441
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,818
But…

442
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,447
Please.

443
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,869
What you said

444
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,580
reminded me of what my husband said.

445
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,002
Every time he saw Kim Byeong-ho's work,

446
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,505
he said it felt like a love letter

447
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,590
even though the painting

448
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,634
only showed scenery.

449
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,847
I didn't think too much of it
since he was an emotional person.

450
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,183
But after speaking with you,

451
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,938
I thought it was right to send those
letters back to the original recipient.

452
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,486
It seemed like the last favor
I could do for my husband.

453
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,197
The reporters are waiting.

454
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,576
Well, then. I hope you enjoy the party.

455
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,138
Did you know beforehand?

456
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,473
-Had you agreed on it?
-No.

457
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,059
-Oh In-beom.
-What?

458
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,564
He came here to sell the work
he painted with the spirit's memories.

459
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,898
Have you seen him?

460
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,486
He's gone totally insane.
How could he think of such a thing?

461
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,073
I'll kill him if I get him.
Where could he be?

462
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,241
Right!

463
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,370
I saw Chairman Han
of Masan Investment with an appraiser.

464
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,836
Among the video clips we found
was a recording of his murder.

465
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,173
-How did you miss that?
-There were 113 clips.

466
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,133
How could I have checked all of them?

467
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,343
We have decided to give

468
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,970
-Kim Byeong-ho's wife,
-Hold on.

469
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,889
-What is it?
-Ms. Choi Ji-won,

470
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,725
all of her late husband's work
without anything in return.

471
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:17,021
Hey, Britium announced that they'll give
Choi Ji-won all of her husband's work.

472
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,356
What?

473
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,192
She'll be filthy rich now!

474
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,861
That means she'll finally
be able to have surgery.

475
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,781
If we sell this painting,

476
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,784
we can have the money!

477
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,790
You better not back out
and say that your heart is breaking.

478
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,124
Don't you worry.

479
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,378
Check out the townhouse you wanted.
The biggest one at that.

480
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,879
Yes!

481
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,134
Living a righteous life has paid off.

482
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,000
It's authentic, sir.

483
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,802
You want cash, right?

484
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:32,930
Correct.

485
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,141
Here you go.

486
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,947
TO MY BELOVED WIFE, JI-WON

487
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,865
Here.

488
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,993
What are you doing?

489
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,411
Gosh, this is crazy.

490
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,580
When did I write that?

491
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,961
Let go of it.

492
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,923
-This is your only chance to sell this.
-What should I do?

493
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,189
Ms. Hong.

494
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,773
I'm sorry to tell you this, sir,

495
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,610
but the painting
you just purchased is fake.

496
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,321
What are you talking about?

497
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,199
Didn't you purchase
one of Kim Byeong-ho's paintings?

498
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,284
That lunatic refused to sell it and left.

499
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,676
You're…

500
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,179
finally home.

501
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,641
I'm sorry, Ji-won,

502
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,310
for taking so long.

503
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,971
YEAR 2021, 55, MULLAE-DONG

504
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,857
Is this it?

505
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,860
What's wrong with me?

506
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,280
It was so easy to paint last time.

507
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,117
You said it'd be easy
to paint another one.

508
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,536
You said it was a cakewalk.

509
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,495
So what…

510
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,167
What is this? Do something, will you?

511
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,794
Gosh. This can't be happening.

512
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,842
Short padded jackets
are in trend these days.

513
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,471
That's perfect in length.
Just what I needed.

514
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,683
OH IN-BEOM

515
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,353
We won't be having another deal.

516
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,563
-What is it?
-Why is the habit already gone?

517
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,898
It hasn't been a week.

518
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,233
You're complaining about that?

519
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,569
If that's all, hang up. I'm busy.

520
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,987
Wait!

521
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,616
Is there any way to get it back?
Perhaps, a spell or…

522
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,660
What's wrong with him?

523
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,286
-It's all sold out.
-It's sold out.

524
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,664
Great job. Congratulations to all.

525
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,749
I hope you wear them well.

526
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,918
Since it's sold out, this is it for today.

527
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,294
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

528
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,214
Oh In-beom, that little…

529
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,883
What? What did she say?

530
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,928
She hung up.

531
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,767
Let's ask Ms. Choi to give it back.

532
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,353
I'm sure she will
once she hears our story.

533
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,398
-She's rich now.
-How could I tell her

534
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,359
that her husband's posthumous painting
is a fake that I drew?

535
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,195
-Gosh. I can't tell her that.
-Then what are we going to do?

536
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,531
Without that, I won't be
able to buy a townhouse!

537
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,958
DAEBAK REALTY

538
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,052
Hello, Ms. Joo!

539
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,888
Don't act like a thug.

540
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,807
You saw the money I wired you, huh?

541
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,600
You look beautiful today as always.

542
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,481
You guys make a lot of money.
Why don't you install a smart lock?

543
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:35,983
Hey.

544
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,288
Gosh. Is this
where you keep all of your case files?

545
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:51,790
Why do you ask?

546
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,376
Just because.

547
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,046
They are important only to me.
They won't get you money.

548
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,217
I don't care for what you said.

549
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,887
I might scam, but I don't steal.

550
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,473
Frauds and thieves are the same.

551
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,558
They are totally different.

552
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,685
-How are they different?
-Look them up online.

553
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,353
Both of you, stop.

554
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,315
-You're being childish.
-I agree.

555
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,318
That's enough.

556
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,404
Let's have a get-together.
We just closed a big case.

557
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,198
I won't be attending.

558
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,282
No.

559
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,910
Let's go.

560
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,715
This is like a feast!

561
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,717
I should send a photo to my darling.

562
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,802
Darling?

563
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,097
You have a girlfriend?

564
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,974
How?

565
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:52,935
What do you mean?

566
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,485
Raise your glasses.

567
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,031
Ms. Hong. This is our first get-together.
Please make a toast.

568
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,075
Is she a principal or what?

569
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,161
No need to make a big speech
in front of three people.

570
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,414
When we die, let's hope
we don't become vengeful spirits.

571
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,624
Cheers.

572
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,560
Ms. Hong. I have a question.

573
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:41,024
The previous part-time psychic
got injured.

574
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,734
Could something bad happen to me

575
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,444
-even after an exorcism?
-Yes.

576
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,697
Really?

577
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,739
Some even die.

578
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:52,286
Ms. Hong, stop joking.
He'll believe you. You'll scare him away.

579
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,246
Gosh. Why would you lie about that?

580
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,706
I don't lie.

581
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,002
We deal with spirits.

582
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,797
Anyone can get hurt anytime because
of a variable we didn't see coming.

583
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,260
Anyone?

584
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,388
Does that mean neither the client

585
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,473
nor the exorcist is safe?

586
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,396
I mean--

587
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,231
What's up with so many questions?

588
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,613
I need to know these things.
We are partners.

589
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,990
We are not partners. The contract is over.

590
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,329
Over?

591
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,749
It was until you get 20 million won.
Don't you remember that?

592
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,335
This dinner was a farewell party,
not a welcome party.

593
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,128
Come on. Don't be so rash.

594
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,296
We made a good team.

595
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,717
Will you do an exorcism, shivering
in cold without this special psychic?

596
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,344
Don't be ridiculous.

597
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,304
I've been doing fine without you.

598
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,854
What about Chief Heo?

599
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:01,772
What?

600
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,109
You know what?

601
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,904
He was so happy that he was making money
with an honest job.

602
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,198
Do you want him to scam people again?

603
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,618
This is the first job I've ever had
I could tell my girlfriend about.

604
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,329
I'll work really hard.

605
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,164
Ms. Hong.

606
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,123
Don't cry.

607
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,377
They sound really desperate.
Let's work with them for one more month.

608
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,797
Not you too, Ms. Joo.

609
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,092
You're not the one
who has to find a new psychic.

610
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,139
Hyeong-sik's leg fracture
will heal in a month.

611
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,266
Let's work with them until then.

612
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:43,980
Just one more month.

613
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,233
-That's perfect.
-That's perfect.

614
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,609
Perfect.

615
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:51,363
Let me make a toast to celebrate
the extension of our contract.

616
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,700
Let's not be vengeful spirits
after we die.

617
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:59,454
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

618
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,561
Excuse me.

619
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,856
I want to put my house up for sale.

620
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,734
I'm sorry,
but we don't handle regular sales.

621
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,319
I was referred to you.

622
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,822
I heard that you help sell haunted houses.

623
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,700
Please have a seat.

624
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,919
Please tell us in detail.

625
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,841
Did someone die or did you
kill someone in your house recently?

626
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,135
-Pardon?
-Given the nature of our job,

627
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,971
we must ask this question.
I'm sure you'll understand.

628
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,891
I see.

629
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,769
From what I know,
nothing of the sort happened.

630
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,563
But a spirit keeps appearing.

631
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,983
My wife' having a hard time,
so I've decided to sell it.

632
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:22,073
One day, all the cabinet doors
under the sink and drawers were open.

633
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,701
That scared the wits out of me.

634
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,536
This house is new. It's nice.

635
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,705
If you sell the house
not long after buying it,

636
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,582
you'll end up paying taxes twice.

637
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,293
We're in our 60s
and this is the first house we've bought.

638
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,961
It's so upsetting.

639
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,964
Oh, right. Where are my manners?

640
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,591
I should serve you some drinks.

641
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,301
Let's go.

642
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,219
Already?

643
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,264
Are you leaving already?

644
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,600
Why don't you have some drinks
before you go?

645
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,774
That's so cold.

646
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,401
Your hand is freezing. What's going on?

647
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,864
-Is there a vengeful spirit?
-Why do you think I held your hand?

648
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,745
Some spirits…

649
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,459
don't even know they're dead.

650
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,785
Green Villa completed sales
of its units three months ago.

651
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,871
Before that, it was a mulberry field
for a long time.

652
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,624
I saw an advertisement for that place.

653
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,501
Dohak Construction?

654
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,837
Isn't it the one
redeveloping this whole area?

655
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,631
No one around the client
has died recently.

656
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,758
That's why I looked more
into the building.

657
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,135
It was quite messy.

658
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,554
I thought our client
was the first one to move in,

659
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,472
but some people had lived there.

660
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,141
Since it was vacant for so long,

661
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,811
they bought it at 30 percent off
from a secondary agency, Mirae Design.

662
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,897
But Dohak Construction,
the original owner, claimed

663
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,067
it was illegal
and forcibly evicted the residents.

664
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,404
So if any of the victims died,

665
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,323
there's a good chance
they became vengeful spirits.

666
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:31,911
But if we check the residents' accounts
that received money, won't it be solved?

667
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,205
It's not as easy as you think.

668
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,916
Mirae Design says they sent money
to Dohak Construction,

669
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,835
and Dohak says they didn't receive it,

670
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,295
so they sued each other.

671
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,089
But President Hwang
of Mirae Design disappeared,

672
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,216
so the trial has been suspended.

673
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,927
It must be President Hwang that lied.

674
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,972
What about the victims
waiting for the trial to end?

675
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,057
What a scumbag.

676
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,476
How many are the victims?

677
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,271
There are 50 victims from 12 households.

678
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,149
We'll have to find out
if any of them have died.

679
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,610
A day will be enough, right?

680
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,571
-For me?
-What?

681
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:10,450
Didn't you find out about
the world-star couple with their shadows?

682
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,578
Of course. I can do it.

683
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,546
DOHAK CONSTRUCTION

684
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,398
To the redevelopment area.

685
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,366
We'll die one way or another.

686
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,159
All right!

687
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,079
Guys!

688
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,705
The chairman is coming today,

689
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,958
so let's try our best!

690
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,126
-Yes, boss!
-Yes, boss!

691
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:08,341
DAEBAK REALTY

692
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,263
DAEBAK REALTY

693
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,765
Let's get the restaurant first.

694
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,183
All right.

695
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,936
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

696
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,609
I'm sorry.

697
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,284
Ji-cheol!

698
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,287
Who are you people?

699
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,164
Hey, it's me.

700
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:43,793
So you've been hiding
on my turf all along.

701
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,839
I'm not sure if that's bold or fearless.

702
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,883
Being bold is being fearless.

703
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,178
You're right.

704
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,222
Is this funny?

705
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,811
Why did you have to talk back to him?

706
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,272
I'm sorry.

707
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,733
What are we sorry for?

708
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,735
You should be sorry.

709
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,320
You scammed me.

710
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,991
When did I scam you?
I got rid of that ghost for you.

711
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,202
That ghost?

712
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,913
But you made up that ghost.

713
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,916
You should've paid the part-timer more.

714
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,293
The one who played the ghost
told me everything.

715
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,171
I told you we shouldn't use a part-timer.

716
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,797
She would never do that.

717
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,049
She definitely would.

718
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,259
-I knew it as soon as I saw her.
-Hey!

719
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,388
If you play around
in front of me from now on,

720
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:38,848
I'll kill you.

721
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,729
I'll return the 50 million
we got for that job.

722
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,106
-Give me your account number.
-What about interest?

723
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,858
How much is the interest?

724
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:53,279
Let me see.
The interest alone is 300 million won.

725
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,448
-That's robbery!
-Robbery?

726
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,867
Some people never accept this
without a beating.

727
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,953
Hey, help them accept it.

728
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,079
No, no.

729
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:04,123
-Ms. Hong!
-I won't buy it.

730
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,792
Get out of the way.

731
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:11,172
How dare you block my way to eat?

732
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,133
Hey!

733
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,094
What?

734
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,848
Those two

735
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,143
still have something to discuss with me.

736
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,479
-Ma'am!
-Go ahead.

737
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,815
We don't have anything
to discuss with you. Sir.

738
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,193
That punk.

739
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,778
The chairman is here.

740
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,791
Attention, greetings!

741
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,710
-Hello, Mr. Do!
-Hello, Mr. Do!

742
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,628
Hey.

743
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,006
Aren't you supposed
to be at the realty office?

744
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,300
Well…

745
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:59,304
She is Hong, the CEO of Daebak Realty.

746
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,820
Please help me.

747
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,216
Some spirits…

748
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,803
don't even know they're dead.

749
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,884
You want me
to look into your mother's last client?

750
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:20,927
Are you sure it was him?

751
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,345
How are you doing this for ten years?

752
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:24,263
I would have killed a few people already.

753
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,225
We should finish what we've started.

754
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,769
What is this?
Why are you singing a different tune?

755
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,604
Didn't you tell us
not to do anything before?

756
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,690
I'm preparing for the worst.

757
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,775
Since I suffered
because of some fraud recently.

758
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,152
Don't tell me you're talking about me.

759
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,946
Being a psychic must be really stressful.

760
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,156
And remember. Ms. Hong can't find it out.

761
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,700
I don't want to die.

762
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,576
-Found it.
-What are you doing in here?
