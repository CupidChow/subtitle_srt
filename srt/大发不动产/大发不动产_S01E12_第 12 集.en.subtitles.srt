1
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,753
Are you asking me to protect you
while you see Do Hak-seong?

2
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,088
After the exorcism ritual,

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,467
Do Hak-seong will try
to kill me and In-beom.

4
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,470
In that case,
you can just not do the exorcism.

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,097
After what happened in the cold room

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,266
and what happened to Ms. Joo,

7
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,018
why do you have to do it anyway?

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,440
The vengeful spirit haunting Do Hak-seong
is In-beom's uncle who died 20 years ago.

9
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,651
I can't let him stay like that.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,196
Fine.

11
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,532
I don't believe in spirits or exorcism.

12
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,077
I'm doing this because
I cannot turn down a citizen

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,369
who's asking for help.

14
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,931
Why are we staking out here tonight?

15
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,599
Because I received a tipoff.

16
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:43,019
A tipoff? On kidnapping? Burglary?

17
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,896
Let's wait and see.

18
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,282
You said you'd have it ready
after I took a nap.

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,037
Then you killed me. Why?

20
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:01,996
What?

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,374
Oh Seong-sik, you…

22
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,044
You! Give me my apartment!

23
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,468
Mr. Do!

24
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,823
Darn you!

25
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,252
In-beom!

26
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,615
Hey, call for backup.

27
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,118
Be careful!

28
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,220
Drop your weapons and step back.

29
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,556
Step back! The next one isn't a blank.

30
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,351
Ms. Hong, are you all right?

31
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,647
Ms. Hong!

32
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,448
It was him. It was Oh Seong-sik.

33
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,950
Pardon?

34
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,785
It was Oh Seong-sik!

35
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,078
Darn it.

36
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,414
That crazy bastard.

37
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,842
Run him over.
Just run him over, you idiot!

38
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,603
Those bastards.

39
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,272
-Run both of them over.
-Yes, sir.

40
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,815
Just run them over!

41
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,483
Run them over now!

42
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,656
Run them over, you idiot!
Where are you going?

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,686
-Please, no!
-You!

44
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,439
Please don't do this.

45
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,443
-Please stop…
-Stop talking.

46
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,903
-Seong-sik! Goodness.
-Who the hell are you?

47
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,238
Please stop.

48
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,033
You should've left
when we told you to get lost.

49
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,702
-We're humans too!
-But you're poor.

50
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,871
No one told you to live like beggars.

51
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,419
That's enough.

52
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,671
I said that's enough!

53
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,882
Darn it.

54
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,550
Hey. Move aside.

55
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,762
Goodness.

56
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,975
Are you all right? Let me see you.

57
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,145
Goodness, look at you.
Make a wise decision.

58
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,273
It's not like I'm asking you
to kill someone.

59
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,902
There are a few empty houses here,
so just set those on fire.

60
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,780
This is a great chance for you

61
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,033
to own an apartment unit
you couldn't dream of buying.

62
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,453
Will you let your old mother and nephew
live on the streets?

63
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,873
Yes, those eyes.

64
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,044
Write me a memorandum.

65
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,670
What?

66
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,089
That you'll give me

67
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,175
an apartment unit
if I set those houses on fire.

68
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,928
Write me a memorandum.

69
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,054
Write that down.

70
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,474
That's a written statement
that says you did it by yourself.

71
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,269
You need to give it to me
for me to believe you.

72
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,147
If you write that,
I'll still give you the apartment.

73
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,024
Really?

74
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,777
Okay. I'll do it right now.

75
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,869
THE FIRE AT YONGNAM VILLAGE
ON NOVEMBER 15 WAS MY DOING

76
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,749
Thank you, sir.

77
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,170
Don't worry about a thing, and rest up.

78
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,922
Dream about your new apartment.

79
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,049
I will. Thank you, sir.

80
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,635
Don't worry about it.

81
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,112
That was the house

82
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,659
for my mother and In-beom to live in.

83
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,667
The apartment unit.

84
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,757
Everything is over now.

85
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,759
Ji-a.

86
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,057
-My uncle.
-We have an emergency patient.

87
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,102
-Please send an ambulance.
-He did set the place on fire,

88
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,438
-We are at…
-but didn't kill himself.

89
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,442
He was killed…

90
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,904
by Do Hak-seong.

91
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,409
My uncle was going to turn himself in,

92
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,664
but Do Hak-seong fooled him, killed him,

93
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,459
then covered it up as a suicide.

94
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,088
Stop talking.

95
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,509
An ambulance will be here soon.

96
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,469
Hang in there.

97
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,698
Are the injuries severe?

98
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,039
Thankfully, your bones aren't broken.
You'll be discharged soon.

99
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,916
Not me.

100
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,834
What about you?

101
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,300
Did I do that to your arm?

102
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,551
No.

103
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,182
That's a relief.

104
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,811
I was scared

105
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,854
I'd hurt you.

106
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,405
I'm sorry.

107
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,120
My stubbornness put you

108
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,705
in danger.

109
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,876
No.

110
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,379
My uncle finally found peace.

111
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,006
Thank you.

112
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,851
Did you absorb

113
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,270
his memories?

114
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,649
Yes.

115
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,195
Did you see my mom?

116
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,120
Daebak Realty wasn't…

117
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,375
in his memories from 20 years ago.

118
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,086
And neither were you

119
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,465
nor your mom.

120
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,384
No.

121
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,095
That can't be.

122
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,974
Are you sure?

123
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,138
Like you said,

124
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,475
my mom wasn't in Oh Seong-sik's memories.

125
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,523
I thought I'd find a way
to give her peace this time around.

126
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,527
Stop trying to find
the truth about that day.

127
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,364
Your mom passed away
while trying to save a possessed child.

128
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,032
That's all.

129
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,368
That's what she was like.

130
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,369
No.

131
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,498
Had that been the case,
she wouldn't be still staying here.

132
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,126
You also don't know what happened to her
on the day she passed away.

133
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,629
I don't need to witness it
to know what happened.

134
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,923
Then do you know
why she's lingering around me?

135
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,182
Every day, I see my dead mom
before I go to bed

136
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,185
and as soon as I wake up.

137
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,315
You have no idea how that feels.

138
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:27,324
I know how painful it is to stay
in this world as a vengeful spirit.

139
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,912
But at times, I'm so happy

140
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,373
that I can still see her.

141
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,960
And then,

142
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,715
I hate myself for feeling that way.

143
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,760
Ms. Hong.

144
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,812
Ji-a.

145
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,147
JUNGBU POLICE STATION

146
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,441
You little…

147
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,277
We were just beaten up.
We didn't land a single hit.

148
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,946
Listen to me.

149
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,364
This is unfair.

150
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,783
-Hey, shut it!
-You bastard.

151
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,160
-This is so unfair!
-Don't you see this bruise?

152
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,954
We didn't hit anyone.

153
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,205
Answer me properly.

154
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,333
I know Do Hak-seong ordered you
to harm Ms. Hong from Daebak Realty

155
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,461
because she got in the way
of the redevelopment.

156
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,420
Am I wrong?

157
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,798
-Yes, you're wrong.
-You bastard!

158
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,844
Just let them go. These scumbags

159
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,513
won't spill anything.

160
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,810
Where are you going?

161
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,189
I'm sorry, but the chairman
doesn't want to meet with anyone today.

162
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,066
This is urgent.

163
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,442
It won't be long.

164
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,742
Fine. I'll come back later.

165
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,708
How does this make sense?

166
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,628
How could a guy
I killed 20 years ago reappear?

167
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,215
I told you, I don't want to see anyone!

168
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,386
A detective is here.

169
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,432
You must be busy.

170
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,851
You can go.

171
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,352
Yes, sir.

172
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,735
Who are you?

173
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,238
I'm Detective Kang Han-seok from Jungbu.

174
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,994
You seem to be busy,
so I'll just cut to the chase.

175
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,873
Didn't you hire some men to harm Ms. Hong
Ji-a yesterday evening in Bangso-dong?

176
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,044
-And you were there as well.
-Hong Ji-a? Who is that?

177
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,546
I wasn't even in that area yesterday.

178
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,797
I see.

179
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,593
But you see,
I happened to see you there yesterday.

180
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,096
Didn't you hire those men to threaten her

181
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,557
since Daebak was still
at the redevelopment area?

182
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,975
Threaten her?

183
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,896
Why would I go through that hassle
when the law will take care of it?

184
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,274
I don't know how businessmen do their job.

185
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,651
And you're known to clean out

186
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,863
redevelopment areas
even before the law takes action.

187
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,075
Yongnam Village was
burned down 20 years ago,

188
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,159
conveniently for you.

189
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,496
You police investigated
and closed the case!

190
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,247
Why are you bringing that up again?

191
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,333
You're right.

192
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,088
I should look into it again.

193
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,346
You were just discharged.
Shouldn't you take a rest?

194
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,806
I'm okay.

195
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,434
Gosh, this is frustrating.

196
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,021
We know the truth,
but there's nothing we can do.

197
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,441
We can't tell the police
that your late uncle tipped us off.

198
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,277
-But we have neither proof nor a witness.
-We do have proof.

199
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,697
-What?
-Uncle received a memorandum from him.

200
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,408
It even has
Do Hak-seong's thumbprint on it.

201
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,662
It's been 20 years already.
Do you think it's still around?

202
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,581
I'm sure Do Hak-seong
got rid of it already.

203
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:49,211
No, he hasn't found it yet.
That's why he rummaged through our van

204
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,130
and my grandma's house.

205
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,424
The memorandum?

206
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,718
That's it.

207
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,185
Why aren't you out delivering?

208
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,855
Gosh. I must've dozed off.

209
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,107
I should go now.

210
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,496
Are you going to the police station?

211
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,542
No, my grandma's.
I should find the memorandum.

212
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,004
And I should tell her that my uncle…

213
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,887
That her youngest son

214
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,639
didn't commit suicide.

215
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,686
Okay. Be safe.

216
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,566
Bye.

217
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,526
Grandma. It's me, In-beom.

218
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,198
Are you sleeping? I'm coming in.

219
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,081
Grandma!

220
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,127
Grandma.

221
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,129
Wake up. Grandma.

222
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,427
Wake up, Grandma.

223
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,099
I need to tell you something.

224
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,356
How could you do this to me?

225
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,650
You're being too cruel!

226
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,888
Grandma.

227
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,474
Let's go home.

228
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,437
What are you talking about?
I'll go bring the doctor.

229
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,233
I have my own house.
I don't want to die in the hospital.

230
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,321
Grandma.

231
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,818
Grandma.

232
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,781
The police called me.

233
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,699
Uncle

234
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,659
didn't commit suicide.

235
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,500
I knew it. There's no way
Seong-sik would do such a thing.

236
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,378
But,

237
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,631
Uncle…

238
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,927
He didn't die because of me either.

239
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,555
You told me

240
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,894
Mom, Dad, and Uncle…

241
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,732
all died because of me.

242
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,947
Why did you do that?

243
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,493
Why did you lie to me?

244
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,371
Why did you blame everything on me?

245
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:40,001
How could you do that
to your only family left?

246
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,963
Do you have any idea

247
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,509
how I've felt all my life?

248
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,210
It's delicious.

249
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,094
In-beom.

250
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,891
Once I pass,

251
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,730
everything I told you…

252
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,019
You're up, Mom.

253
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,491
Gosh, Mom.

254
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,285
You should've told me sooner
if this needed some fixing.

255
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,746
What are sons for?

256
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,333
It's all good.

257
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,252
What do you think?

258
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,048
Thank you.

259
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,205
DAEBAK REALTY

260
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,627
NAME: HONG JI-A

261
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,471
It would've been better for all of us
if you'd done this sooner.

262
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,020
So is your exorcism ritual over now?

263
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,732
Good work.

264
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,321
That's for you.

265
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,993
There's an evil spirit
called an egg ghost.

266
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,623
When there's an egg ghost,

267
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,918
people around the ghost are bound to die.

268
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,672
Some die in accidents.

269
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,008
Some die from illnesses.

270
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,260
Some commit suicide.

271
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,266
It's very difficult to get rid of,
so it's an irritating spirit.

272
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,603
What are you trying to say?

273
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,563
I realized just now

274
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,403
that you are
the living version of an egg ghost.

275
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,116
Wherever you go, people die.

276
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,956
There's a reason egg ghosts
turn out that way, at least.

277
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,545
It's a collection of spirits

278
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,716
of those who have died in great pain
without even knowing why.

279
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,426
So their resentment grows bigger.

280
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,470
But in your case,

281
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,808
it's your greed and selfish heart.

282
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:10,438
You killed innocent people
who were powerless like it was nothing.

283
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,985
Just for money.

284
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,406
"Just for money"?

285
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,036
I didn't kill those people.
They died because they didn't have money.

286
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:29,290
Money can either save or kill people.

287
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,583
And the same money

288
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,462
can kill you someday.

289
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,882
I'll look forward to it.

DAEBAK REALTY

291
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,527
That arrogant wench.

292
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,481
PSYCHIC, SPECIAL

293
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,235
It's me.

294
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,654
Could you do me a favor?

295
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,473
Is my grandma…

296
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,894
Is she here?

297
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,940
No, I think she left in peace.

298
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,452
I'm so relieved. What a relief.

299
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,097
What?

300
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,102
You're all coming?

301
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,397
Of course. We aren't strangers.

302
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,941
I heard he didn't have any relatives.

303
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,403
It'd be tough to have no one around
on a day like this.

304
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,116
Thank you.

305
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,287
Goodness, let's hurry.

306
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,329
Let's go.

307
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,889
Thank you.

308
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,682
This way, please.

309
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,524
You must be devastated, but be strong.

310
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,859
Thank you.

311
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,281
-I'm sure she's in a better place.
-Thank you.

312
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,033
-Eat up.
-Some more jeon, please.

313
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,328
Some more jeon? Is it good?
All right. Coming right up.

314
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,246
-Ma'am, we need more jeon.
-Okay.

315
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,540
People love these jeon.

316
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,752
We should sell these.

317
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,504
Here, have some more.

318
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,881
Eat up, sir.

319
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,467
-Goodness, we need soju.
-What?

320
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,968
-We're out of soju?
-Yes.

321
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,262
-What should we do?
-You'll find some out there.

322
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,597
Okay. Do we have more soup?

323
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,098
Yes, you can take this one.

324
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,393
Let me know if you need anything else.

325
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,561
This one is hot.

326
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,695
Thank you.

327
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,377
Where are you?

328
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,881
I have a feeling it's somewhere here.

329
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,403
Gosh.

330
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,122
Well, I was just…

331
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:22,959
You're asleep?

332
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,631
Why do you do this to me?

333
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,104
I'm going back now.

334
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,273
I hope the funeral ends well.

335
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,316
Okay.

336
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,823
Thank you for letting me

337
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,451
put my uncle to rest.

338
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,831
Thanks to you, I think
my grandma is able to rest in peace.

339
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,377
She had a great grandson.

340
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,674
Come to think about it, you're right.

341
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:16,179
What would she have done
if I weren't a psychic?

342
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,351
That's the only family photo
of our entire family.

343
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,899
She always made a fuss of this photo
whenever we moved house.

344
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,193
She always put it
where she could always see it,

345
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,571
but somewhere out of reach.

346
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,136
MEMORANDUM REGARDING APARTMENT

347
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,977
I, DO HAK-SEONG, WILL GIVE A UNIT
IN GOLDEN APARTMENT TO OH SEONG-SIK…

348
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,647
NOVEMBER 7, 2001,
SIGNED BY DO HAK-SEONG, OH SEONG-SIK

349
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,192
-He really had this.
-What are you going to do now?

350
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,530
This can prove
Do Hak-seong made your uncle set the fire.

351
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,616
But it can't prove he murdered him.

352
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,619
I know.

353
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,123
But it's better than nothing.

354
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,377
I'll try to find what I can do

355
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,671
with this.

356
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,049
What about you? What will you do now?

357
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,177
I'm not sure.

358
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,930
I don't know.

359
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,226
I really have no idea

360
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,187
what I should do now.

361
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,574
Instigating arson and murdering?

362
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,870
This is huge, isn't it?

363
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,266
He won't pick up.

364
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,729
The person you have called is unavailable.

365
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,911
Call him one more time.

366
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,245
He won't pick up.

367
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,581
Where did he go? Why is he still not here?

368
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,832
Who?

369
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,001
Who do you think? That thug.

370
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:55,504
-I thought he went to the bathroom.
-What? He's still taking a dump?

371
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,176
-The person you have reached…
-He won't pick up.

372
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,598
-It's gone.
-What is?

373
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,516
-The memorandum.
-What?

374
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,103
When did you last see Kim Tae-jin?

375
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,982
I haven't seen him since breakfast. Why?

376
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,447
MEMORANDUM REGARDING APARTMENT

377
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,783
This is it.

378
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,495
Yes!

379
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,498
I hit the jackpot!

380
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,125
This is like the winning lottery ticket!

381
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,296
GHOST FRAUD

382
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,221
You're here, sir.

383
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,932
Seon-nyeo, pay up.

384
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,267
Yes, sir.

385
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,185
How much is it?

386
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:58,651
Pay him nicely.
He drove a long way to get me here.

387
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,994
Oh In-beom.

388
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,497
I wasn't picking up.
Shouldn't you have taken the hint?

389
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,873
You know how it works.

390
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,293
What's with you? This is so not charming.

391
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,670
You're in front of Dohak Construction,
aren't you?

392
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,009
How did you know? Can you see me?

393
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,428
Do you think you'll get what you want

394
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,680
if you take that memorandum
to Do Hak-seong?

395
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,976
He never lets anyone live
who finds out about his weakness.

396
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,478
You of all people should know that.

397
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,023
Think carefully

398
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:42,028
about whom you should join hands with
to benefit more.

399
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:53,247
Aren't you going inside?
Chairman Do hates waiting.

400
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,001
I don't need
to hand it over to him just yet.

401
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,085
What?

402
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,546
Let's go.

403
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,298
Boss.

404
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,966
He's going to kill you.

405
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,801
-No, he's not.
-Boss!

406
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,724
Do you think he already gave it to him?

407
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,354
I don't think so.

408
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,317
Do you think this will work?

409
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,029
Do Hak-seong
almost killed Kim Tae-jin once.

410
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,114
I'm sure he has his doubts about him.

411
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,159
He'll think about it then call us.
Let's be patient.

412
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,205
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

413
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,249
It's not.

414
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,710
I encouraged you to trust him.

415
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,879
Darn it. I'm such an idiot.

416
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,425
Don't say that.
It's my fault for not keeping it safe.

417
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,433
Hello.

418
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,811
-Hello.
-Hey.

419
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,484
I just spoke with the doctor.

420
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,362
He said you're much better now.
You can leave tomorrow.

421
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,156
Really? That's great!

422
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,910
This place has been suffocating me.

423
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,704
Right. I need to bring some clothes.

424
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,290
This is totally not my style.

425
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:22,545
Then it's good that Ji-a went
to your house to bring some clothes.

426
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,256
Ji-a did?

427
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:38,686
She always nagged me for not cleaning up,
but her house is a pigpen too.

428
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,981
Where are her socks?

429
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,390
RECORD OF EXORCISM: 1979

430
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,020
RECORD OF EXORCISM: 1979

431
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,483
Why does she have this?

432
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,805
Explain.

433
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,902
Why was this at your house?

434
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,029
You said you didn't know.

435
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,784
When I said my grandma's
record of exorcism was missing,

436
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,286
you said you had no idea.

437
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,038
As if you didn't know about it.

438
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,502
Say something.

439
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,756
Make an excuse, at least.

440
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,593
Why do you have this, Aunt?

441
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,346
That was…

442
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,769
your mom's belonging that I received
from the police in your stead.

443
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,773
I was meaning to tell you
but kept putting it off.

444
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,901
I'm sorry you had to find out this way.

445
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,237
What are you talking about?

446
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,742
If it was my mom's,
why is there blood on it?

447
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,785
Whose blood is this?

448
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,080
Your mom's.

449
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,751
That's absurd.

450
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,213
She never bled that day.

451
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,840
Like you said before,

452
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,136
what you remember
about that day are not true.

453
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,515
You fabricated the memories
to protect yourself.

454
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,516
Don't you lie to me!

455
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,730
Ji-a, calm down.

456
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,279
How could you

457
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,035
deceive me for 20 years
as if you knew nothing?

458
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,496
I'll explain everything.

459
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,624
Not a single word.

460
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,669
I can no longer believe

461
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,796
anything you say.

462
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,551
I'll find out the truth myself.

463
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,554
Ji-a.

464
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,100
Don't come after me.

465
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,164
EGG GHOSTS

466
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,499
Egg ghosts

467
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,044
cannot be exorcized
through the common method.

468
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,672
But there is a way.

469
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,593
A spiritual needle without the spirit's
name on it can cause physical damage.

470
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:25,806
Stabbing the possessed psychic's heart
is the only way to exorcize it.

471
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:32,604
"Stabbing the possessed psychic's heart
is the only way to exorcize it."

472
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:50,289
"Exorcists can also be possessed."

473
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,917
EXORCISTS CAN ALSO BE POSSESSED

474
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,881
She knew she'd die but she still did it.

475
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,624
Until now,

476
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,752
I thought you died

477
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,672
because I hesitated and ruined everything.

478
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,594
I thought I was to blame.

479
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,690
But I was wrong.

480
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:04,196
You carried out the exorcism,
even knowing you'd die.

481
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,283
Did you choose to abandon me?

482
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,995
Then why are you still here?

483
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,499
You couldn't help but worry about me?
Is that why you haven't left?

484
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,627
You should've just ignored him!

485
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,798
You should've chosen me.

486
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,468
Why care about the child?

487
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,887
Why care about others dying?

488
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,724
You should've stayed by my side.

489
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,065
You're my mom.

490
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,110
You're…

491
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,407
You're my mom!

492
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,835
I must know the truth.

493
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,255
I'm going to see what happened that day

494
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,258
with my very own eyes.

495
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,815
HONG MI-JIN

496
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,758
Pull yourself together, Ji-a!

497
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,593
You have to do this.

498
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,511
Now.

499
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,058
I can't do it, Mom.

500
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,019
You can.

501
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,635
HONG MI-JIN

502
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,115
HONG MI-JIN

503
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,109
Stop it.

504
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,490
Stop it.

505
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,619
That's not what happened.

506
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,956
I made all of this up.

507
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,999
Or

508
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,335
did you make this up?

509
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,923
Why?

510
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,386
What are you trying to hide?

511
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,185
Mom!

512
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,280
CHANGHWA RESTAURANT

513
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,954
Gosh. Kim Tae-jin, that jerk.

514
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,752
DAEBAK REALTY

515
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,649
Ji-a, calm down.

516
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:19,070
I can no longer believe anything
you say. I'll find out the truth myself.

517
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,365
Stop it.

518
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,370
No.

519
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,707
I'll keep doing it…

520
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,004
until I see what really happened that day.

521
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,743
DAEBAK REALTY

522
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,647
Mom, what's wrong with his face?

523
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,441
I'll explain it later.

524
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:07,197
No matter what you hear,
do not come downstairs. Understood?

525
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,657
Hwa-jeong, listen carefully.

526
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,327
A child possessed by an egg ghost is here.

527
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,663
But egg ghosts can't be exorcised.

528
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:19,626
Killing the person that's been possessed
is the only way to dissipate the spirit.

529
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,960
What? Kill the child?

530
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,422
I don't see any way to save the child
and get rid of the spirit.

531
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,803
I plan to turn myself in
after the exorcism.

532
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,640
Please take good care of my daughter
while I'm gone.

533
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,017
Mi-jin. Hold on. Mi-jin.

534
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:52,283
In-beom, let's go.

535
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,379
-I heard what you said on your phone.
-Move.

536
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:09,509
If I don't perform an exorcism on him,
more people will die.

537
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,469
To stop that disaster,

538
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,596
we must sacrifice the boy.

539
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,682
What are you talking about?

540
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:20,103
A disaster or not,
I'll never let you kill In-beom!

541
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,361
You will never understand.

542
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:53,928
Ms. Hong?

543
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,441
My mom…

544
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,531
I…

545
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,743
killed my mom.

546
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,795
Ms. Hong!

547
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,422
No.

548
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,549
Ms. Hong!

549
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,550
Wake up.

550
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,260
Hong Ji-a!

551
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,432
It was odd she fought with Ms. Joo
as soon as she woke up.

552
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,601
Ms. Joo, you know
the truth of that day, don't you?

553
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,561
Don't make it sound so easy.

554
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,522
Did I get possessed
and kill Ms. Hong's mother?

555
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,107
How can I trust him?

556
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,900
She was bound to find out anyway.

557
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,610
Are you Chang-hwa?
The son of Changhwa Restaurant?

558
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,362
What do you mean,
you haven't found him yet?

559
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,738
That sly fox.

560
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,950
The only thing I can do for her
is disappear.

561
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:41,160
That's why she was still here.

562
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,162
I can see why she couldn't rest in peace.

563
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,081
It'll only be over once I disappear.

564
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,374
Right?
