00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,343
Hello.

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,511
How much did he drink?

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,930
He's not much of a drinker to begin with.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,098
He didn't drink that much.

5
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,349
I think it's because he hasn't been sleeping well.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,143
Thank you.

7
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,019
Woojin...

8
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,190
Please treat him well.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,984
He seems really hurt.

10
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,279
He feels that you've already lost interest...

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,032
...and he's been blaming himself for holding on.

12
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,828
I can be by his side when he's struggling...

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,040
...but what he needs right now isn't me, his friend...

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,249
...it seems to be you.

15
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,545
Not sleeping well...

16
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,839
...drinking when he doesn't usually.

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,592
This won't happen again.

18
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,177
That's a relief, then.

19
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,845
I'll get going.

20
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,765
I'm sorry, Woojin.

21
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,352
I'm sorry, Woojin.

22
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:54,864
It was all my fault.

23
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,827
Having you by my side...

24
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,539
...I took it for granted.

25
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,753
I didn't treasure you.

26
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,421
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,977
I'm sorry, Woojin.

28
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,078
Why am I here?

29
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,832
I...

30
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,292
...brought you here.

31
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,756
I'm leaving.

32
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,851
Why is this still...

33
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,605
My time...

34
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,482
...is still frozen on our 7th anniversary.

35
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,448
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,285
We broke up.

37
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,287
You were the one who wanted to end it.

38
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,165
It was my mistake.

39
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,960
I don't want to experience a life without you anymore.

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,004
Let's...

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,214
...start over.

42
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,216
No.

43
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,052
We're over.

44
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,720
You...

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,013
You hate me now.

46
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,517
I'm tired of it, too.

47
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,144
I don't want to be in pain anymore.

48
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,316
Let go.

49
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,193
Let go.

50
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,078
From today...

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,206
...let's start over.

52
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,501
From today...

53
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,254
...help me make time flow again, Woojin.

54
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,970
It's just going to end again anyway.

55
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,434
It has an expiration date.

56
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,980
It will just repeat.

57
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,734
You'll be cold to me...

58
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,822
...and I'll misunderstand small things and suffer.

59
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,701
Let it.

60
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,454
Whenever that happens, we can just start over again.

61
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,924
In my heart...

62
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,259
...I'll plant you anew.

63
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,056
Woojin.

64
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,100
Nothing lasts forever.

65
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,980
The day will come when we see the end.

66
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,358
That day...

67
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,319
...let's make it the day we start over.

68
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,868
I won't let go this time.

69
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,248
I won't doubt my feelings for you...

70
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:38,546
...and I won't be complacent, thinking you'll be by my side forever.

71
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,089
Hyung.

72
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,717
Just trust me one more time.

73
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,818
This was my real present.

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,200
This...

75
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,660
...it was our first couple bracelet.

76
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,871
I...

77
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,956
...said it was uncomfortable and barely wore it.

78
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,213
This time, I'll never take it off.

79
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,174
No matter what happens, I won't take it off.

80
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,761
This link between us...

81
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,471
...I'll never...

82
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,432
...be the one to break it.

83
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,310
So...

84
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,896
So please...

85
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,689
...forgive me just this once.

86
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,158
I'm sorry...

87
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,537
I'm the one who's sorry.

88
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,580
What do you have to be sorry for?

89
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,332
It was my fault.

90
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,584
I made you insecure.

91
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,462
I made you lonely.

92
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,924
No...

93
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,927
I...

94
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,805
...should have asked you how you felt.

95
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,724
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,741
Hyung.

97
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,078
Woojin-ah.
