1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,877
Hyung...

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,890
Where did it all go wrong?

3
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:24,524
How did we end up like this?

4
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,878
I have a company dinner today, so I'll be late.

5
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:53,386
Should I keep holding onto you?

6
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,824
Kang Woojin.

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,911
Make sure you eat before you study.

8
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,673
Eat this and cheer up.

9
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:08,503
This expired milk feels just like us.

10
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,769
My day begins with filling in empty boxes,

11
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,606
and ends with returning to an empty home.

12
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,902
And at the end of it all, I'm always waiting for the same person.

13
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,618
When you'll be home,

14
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,998
or what you're doing... if I'm curious, I can just call.

15
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,043
What am I even doing?

16
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,556
You never show that side to me.

17
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,185
I can't even remember the last time I saw you smile.

18
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,272
I'm not asking for a 'thank you'.

19
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,026
I just want you to say my name gently.

20
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,801
It's a gift.

21
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,487
Who is it?

22
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,907
I work with Team Leader Jaehyun.

23
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,242
My name is Kim Juhyuk.

24
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,118
Hello.

25
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,453
I've heard a lot about you.

26
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,163
You're his younger brother who lives with him, right?

27
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,457
Yes.

28
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,044
The younger brother he lives with.

29
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,718
It's gotten quite late, hasn't it?

30
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,886
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,431
The Team Leader kept insisting on one more drink.

32
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,851
By the way, how did you know the passcode?

33
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,770
He told me at the entrance.

34
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,231
You can change it if you're worried.

35
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,316
No, it's okay.

36
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,569
Thank you for bringing him home.

37
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,114
Not at all.

38
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,997
Well then, I'll be on my way.

39
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,749
Please take good care of the Team Leader.

40
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,504
Take care of him?

41
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,716
Why are you asking me to take care of him?

42
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,160
Stop it.

43
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,411
What now?

44
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,539
Let's talk when you're sober.

45
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,338
Do I look drunk to you right now?

46
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,050
You are.

47
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,595
You're so drunk you had to be carried home by another man.

48
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,388
Another ma...

49
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,894
Juhyuk...

50
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,731
Sorry for making him come all the way here.

51
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,945
Aren't you sorry to me?

52
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,283
I can be late sometimes because of work.

53
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,160
And I'm allowed to have a few drinks.

54
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,745
Is this such a sensitive issue?

55
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,164
Or what, should I apologize to you?

56
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:19,504
Have you ever once wondered what I'm thinking?

57
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,048
Have you ever thought about me waiting at home?

58
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,344
Right now,

59
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,430
do you even want to ask me how I'm feeling?

60
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,933
If you're going to talk like that, just stop.

61
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,060
You're going to ruin my mood.

62
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:43,569
Does talking about us ruin your mood?

63
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,203
Hyung.

64
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,459
Do you know what today is?

65
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,919
I don't.
