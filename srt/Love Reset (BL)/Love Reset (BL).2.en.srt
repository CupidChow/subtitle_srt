1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,423
Hyung, have you ever wondered what I'm thinking?

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,967
Have you ever thought about me waiting for you at home?

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,637
Do you even

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,349
want to ask me how I'm feeling right now?

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,852
If you're going to say things like that, just stop.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,895
You're going to ruin the mood.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,488
Does talking about us ruin your mood?

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,122
Hyung.

9
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,378
Do you know what day it is today?

10
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,755
I don't.

11
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:20,413
Did I make a mistake yesterday?

12
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:27,587
Whatever. I'll just act like I normally do.

13
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,183
Have you been crying?

14
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,645
Don't you remember yesterday?

15
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,314
No. Maybe it's because I drank too much yesterday.

16
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,149
My memory is hazy.

17
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,485
Did I do something wrong?

18
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,696
Something wrong?

19
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,910
No.

20
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,662
I don't think it was a mistake.

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,080
Kang Woojin.

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,832
Forget it.

23
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,794
You can get stressed out from work.

24
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,588
And you can say anything when you're drunk.

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,008
What did I say?

26
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:18,138
I need to know what you're thinking so I can clear up any misunderstanding.

27
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,434
No. There's nothing to clear up.

28
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,727
I'm late.

29
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,104
Hey, Kang Woojin.

30
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,900
Just as you have your life, Hyung,

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,862
I have my own.

32
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,824
I'll be late tonight.

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,577
Don't wait up.

34
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,920
You have your own life?

35
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,352
Hey, Kang Woojin.

36
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,188
What's with your eyes?

37
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:08,938
Is something wrong?

38
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,358
It's nothing...

39
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,068
I just didn't get enough sleep.

40
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,779
Don't tell me you two fought.

41
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:26,581
It was so tense, and now it's finally blown up.

42
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,833
Well, it's better to just shout and fight it out.

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:34,505
I don't know anymore. I don't know what's what.

44
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,424
I don't even know if it was a fight.

45
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,885
Because I'm the only one who's angry.

46
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,722
No. Just go and tell him what's on your mind.

47
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,474
Just scream and fight if you have to.

48
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,559
That's how everyone gets through it.

49
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,228
Do you think looking miserable will solve anything?

50
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,562
It's not like you're going to break up.

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,273
Woojin.

52
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,818
Go and talk to him today.

53
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,695
I'm sure he's not feeling great either.

54
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,696
Okay?

55
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,256
7th anniversary.

56
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:26,683
Hyung, do you know what day it is today?

57
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,312
I didn't know.

58
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,190
I completely forgot.

59
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,359
Team Leader, are you okay?

60
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,819
You have a hangover, right?

61
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,655
That's why I prepared this for you.

62
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,906
Have one of these.

63
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,369
Thanks, Juhyeok.

64
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,456
Wow, I almost died yesterday because of you, Team Leader.

65
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,465
Is something wrong?

66
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,053
Don't tell me you fought with your brother after I left yesterday.

67
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,139
You came over yesterday?

68
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,558
Yes. I took you home yesterday.

69
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,600
Don't you remember?

70
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,938
Well, you couldn't even stand up straight yesterday.

71
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,316
It's no wonder you blacked out.

72
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,401
What have I done?

73
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,487
7th anniversary?

74
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,864
What's today?

75
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,534
It's our 7th anniversary.

76
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,579
You have a boyfriend?

77
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,331
And it's your 7th anniversary?

78
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,249
You've been together for a long time.

79
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,129
Yeah... It's already been 7 years.

80
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,883
You went out drinking like that on your 7th anniversary?

81
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,927
I completely forgot.

82
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,181
I don't think he'll accept any gift from me now.

83
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,685
A boyfriend who got drunk and was out of touch on their anniversary...

84
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,937
Even I wouldn't be able to forgive that.

85
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,110
Should I help you out?

86
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,491
I'm as good at dating as I am at my job.

87
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,535
I'll help you pick out a gift your boyfriend will love.

88
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,412
You'll help me pick one out?

89
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,706
Buy me dinner in return.

90
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,834
To thank me for taking you home yesterday, too.

91
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,839
Thank you.

92
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,388
Something like perfume isn't a bad idea.

93
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,932
But he doesn't really have a signature scent.

94
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,227
I don't know what to get him.

95
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,104
What do you want for dinner?

96
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,563
You can choose whatever you want, Team Leader.

97
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,871
Sorry I'm late.

98
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,997
It's a gift.

99
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,261
You bought this for me?

100
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,264
Did you pick it out yourself, Hyung?

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,727
Yeah. They said it's a popular scent these days.

102
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm not sure if you'll like it, though.

103
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,193
You're giving me perfume when you don't even know what I like?

104
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,077
Did he pick it out?

105
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,204
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,958
That thing over there...

107
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,297
it's dead,

108
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,507
and so are we.

109
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,929
I'm no longer in your world, Hyung.

110
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,390
It's just full of your coworkers and new things.

111
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,893
Only I'm...

112
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,312
the only old thing left to you, Hyung.

113
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,314
Hey, Kang Woojin.

114
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,317
So what's the problem?

115
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:08,362
I said I was sorry and even brought you a gift.

116
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,323
What more do you want me to do?

117
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,867
Did I ask you to do anything?

118
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,744
Did I ask for anything?

119
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,038
I didn't ask you to buy me this stupid perfume.

120
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:17,997
Just...

121
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,298
I'm so tired of this.

122
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,262
I don't know what more I can do.

123
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,265
I'm trying to show you that I'm making an effort,

124
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,268
but you're not even looking at me properly.

125
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,812
What should I do?

126
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,522
Huh?

127
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:48,069
Just call my name affectionately one time.

128
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,906
Then everything will be okay.

129
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:56,035
Just hug me once.

130
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,788
Tell me you still love me.

131
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:03,543
Just one warm hug.

132
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,422
So what is it that you want?

133
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,675
Do you want to end this too?

134
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:16,389
Hyung...

135
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,307
You want to end this, don't you?

136
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,981
Let's stop.

137
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,359
Let's break up.
