1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:04,879
So, what is it that you want?

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,132
Do you want to end this too?

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:12,846
Hyung...

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,764
It seems like you want to end it.

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,438
Let's stop.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,776
Let's break up.

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,846
Hey, Woojin. Are you okay?

8
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,765
No.

9
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,643
Of course not. We were together for seven years.

10
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,521
Is seven years really a big deal?

11
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,859
How am I supposed to comfort you right now?

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,781
Just buy me a drink.

13
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,700
That's all I need.

14
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,331
Okay, I get it. Let's go up for now.

15
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,624
You look like you didn't sleep at all last night.

16
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,091
Seven years.

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,219
A length of time that should have felt familiar.

18
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,597
That's why I didn't even realize I was hurting him.

19
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,017
I felt relieved, thinking he would naturally be by my side forever.

20
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,855
Where did it all go wrong?

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,787
Hyung.

22
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,163
What's that?

23
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,961
A gift to celebrate us moving in together.

24
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,422
It won't die as long as you water it well.

25
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,843
Its name is Junior.

26
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,011
Junior...

27
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,693
Woojin.

28
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,861
Yeah?

29
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,114
Let's...

30
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,365
...be together...

31
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,449
...forever.

32
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,326
Okay.

33
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,964
You can kiss me.

34
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:10,565
Was the void you left behind that big?

35
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,798
Team Leader, you haven't left yet?

36
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,932
Don't tell me your gift was rejected.

37
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,228
Well, it's not something to be easily forgiven for.

38
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,855
You completely forgot your 7th anniversary.

39
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,817
I'm not in the mood to joke around, Juhyeok.

40
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,906
You didn't break up, did you?

41
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,494
Although you do look like you just got your heart broken.

42
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,290
But still, you wouldn't break up over something like this, right?

43
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,334
If you go and apologize, everything will be fine.

44
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,795
He still likes you a lot, Team Leader.

45
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,218
How would you know how I feel?

46
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,346
It's written all over your face.

47
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,224
And it's the first time I've ever seen you look this worn out.

48
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,228
Team Leader.

49
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,190
Even if you're going to regret it,

50
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,943
wouldn't it be better to regret it after trying to hold on?

51
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,673
Hey, shouldn't you get that?

52
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,346
Forget about you for a second,

53
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,181
he must be going crazy with worry.

54
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,520
He's probably not struggling at all.

55
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,148
Hey, how would you know that?

56
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,483
I know.

57
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:23,239
I know Hyung better than anyone.

58
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,536
You should stop drinking.

59
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,495
Why?

60
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,164
You said you'd comfort me.

61
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,874
Hey, I have no intention of letting a drunk into my house.

62
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,250
Drink in moderation.

63
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,254
And if you're going to cry, just let it all out.

64
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,256
Who's crying?

65
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,472
I'm not hurting at all.

66
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,014
I'm not hurting at all.

67
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,142
It's not like Hyung is the only person in the world.

68
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,146
It seems like he's the only person in the world to you right now.

69
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,857
No!

70
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:02,779
That's not true!

71
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,284
It's all my fault.

72
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,578
Kang Woojin.

73
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,916
It's my sin for holding onto someone who doesn't want me anymore.

74
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,251
If I had let him go earlier,

75
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,962
it wouldn't have been this painful.

76
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:24,342
Then for both Hyung and me,

77
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,178
it wouldn't have ended like this, in the worst way possible.

78
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,223
Hey, Woojin...

79
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,069
Hello?

80
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,654
Who is this?

81
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,322
I'm Woojin's friend.

82
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,492
He's with me right now.

83
00:06:59,085 --> 00:06:59,836
Hello.

84
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,003
How much did he drink?

85
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,423
He's not a heavy drinker to begin with.

86
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,590
He didn't drink much.

87
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,842
I think it's because he hasn't been sleeping well.

88
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,635
Thank you.

89
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,511
Woojin...

90
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,683
Please treat him well.

91
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,476
He seems to be very hurt.

92
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,771
Even though you've already lost feelings,

93
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,524
he was blaming himself, saying he was the one holding on.

94
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,320
I can be by Woojin's side when he's struggling,

95
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,532
but I think the person he needs right now isn't me, his friend,

96
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,741
but you.

97
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,037
Not sleeping well,

98
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,331
drinking when he usually doesn't...

99
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,084
It won't happen again.

100
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,669
I'm glad to hear that.

101
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,337
Let's go.
