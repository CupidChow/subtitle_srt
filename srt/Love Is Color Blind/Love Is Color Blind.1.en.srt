00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,564
I can decode all those blind items online.

109
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:42,527
It's just that there's no clue
on Ino's whereabouts.

110
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,444
[Candy] Oh, please.

111
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,239
What's the point
of practicing distancing here

112
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,407
if you can't even
distance yourselves from Ino?

121
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,489
You're not even wearing your uniform.

122

-And the bread!

123
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,616
[Cara] The bread should be here!

Why are you already back?

125
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,910

-you'll be staying in Hong Kong.
-So you could sleep all day here?

00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,667
[Vicky] Hey, Caramel!

129
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,169
You're back!

130
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,462
Yes.

131
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,797
Oh, Aunt Vicky, I have something for you.

132
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,798
Here!

133
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,384
Try it. It will look good on you.

134
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,552
See? It's really nice.

135
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,929
[Cara] Here you go.

136
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,350
You shouldn't have spent
your money on this.

137
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,561
And why are you already back?

138
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,397
Didn't we agree
that you'll apply for a job there?

139
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,149
I wasn't able to land one.

140
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,985
And I can't just leave Papa Bread behind.

141
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,529
And it's also hard to be away from you.

142
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,199
You might even get sick
because you have no one to scold.

143
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,993
Just try this out, Aunt Vicky!
It will look good on you!

144
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,328
[Cara] Look at this, Stephi girl.

145
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,496
[Stephi] It looks good, right?

146
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,414
Wow, madam! Try it on.
You'd look like a goddess.

147
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,665
Really?

148
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,709
Not really. [cackles]

149
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,253
I guess I'll just keep this.

150
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,755
[Vicky] You know, Caramel,

151
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,258
your older sister put in a lot of overtime

152
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,511
just to enroll you there in Hong Kong

153
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,263
so you could get a good opportunity.

154
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,140
You just wasted it.

155
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,767
[Candy] Auntie, it wasn't really a waste.

156
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,852
She gained additional credentials.

157
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,938
And she tried to apply for work there.

158
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,189
She was just not lucky enough
to get accepted.

159
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,982
Not even as a domestic helper?

160
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,277
Whatever, Caramel.

161
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,947
Why aren't you like your older sister?

162
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,450
She's always on her A-game.

163
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,286
What will my Brother Ber think in heaven?

164
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,081
I have this feeling
he's going to show up--

165
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,332
Hey! Caramel!

166
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,917
Caramel!

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,835
I hope your dad's ghost shows up

[Cara panting]

170
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,301
Thank you, sis.

171
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,803
[Candy] Cara, do you need anything else?

172
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,471
-I'm good.
-All your stuff is already here.

173
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,472
Get some rest.

174
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,143
Sis, how are you holding up?

175
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,770
I could hear Auntie's voice from here.

176
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,564
Huh?

177
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,315
What did you say?

178
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,110
Did you just become deaf
after being shouted at?

179
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,361
What are you up to, huh?

180
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,446
You keep on making TikTok's.
Don't you have school?

181
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,865
We only have online classes every Friday.

182
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,409
Really?

183
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,411
Papa Ber,

184
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,620
Mama Rhems,

185
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,913
I'm back!

186
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
I have something for you.

187
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,376
My stay in Hong Kong was okay,

188
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,253
but I prefer working here.

189
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,672
And I can't leave the bakery.

190
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,552
I love you.

191
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,598
[Kimmi] <i>At least Sky already messaged you.</i>

192
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,143
<i>Any signs from Ino?</i>

193
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,478
Hold on.

194
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,815
Still no reply?

195
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,151
What's happening to you, Domino?

196
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,737
<i>Now I remember!</i>

197
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,530
<i>He works in Ellaine's flower shop.</i>

198
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,325
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

199
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,036
<i>He gave a black rose to a customer</i>

200
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,787
<i>instead of a red rose.</i>

201
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,248
<i>I really don't get Ino.</i>

202
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,418
<i>He keeps getting jobs</i>
<i>but ends up getting fired.</i>

203
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,255
<i>Oh!</i>

204
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,966
<i>I just got word that he works</i>
<i>at a coffee shop in San Gabriel.</i>

205
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,343
<i>At least that's what Simon said.</i>

206
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,053
<i>Huh?</i>

207
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,640
<i>But Krizzy said Ino works</i>
<i>at Rigs' tattoo shop.</i>

208
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,435
Then I'll go to both places!

209
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,064
<i>What's with the energy?</i>

210
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,690
<i>Girl, relax.</i>

211
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,276
<i>He might think</i>
<i>you're very excited to see him.</i>

212
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,402
<i>That's right.</i>

213
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,821
<i>Just be cool about it.</i>

214
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:00,076
<i>Let's plan your first meeting with Ino.</i>

215
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,787
[Cara whispering] Kimmi, Nelly!

216
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,247
I've been here a while.
I don't think Ino is here.

217
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,458
[Nelly] <i>I think Ino</i>

-Are you sure Ino works here?
-[manager clears throat]

219
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,630
Excuse me.

220
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,673
Ready to order?

221
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,467
One Domino--

222
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,220
Is Ino here?

223
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,847
[manager] The thing is…

224
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,392
he's fired.

225
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,977
I fired him yesterday.

226
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,772
I'm sorry. It hurt, but I had to.

227
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,483
[manager blows nose]

228
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,818
Cancel order!

[upbeat music playing]

230
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,910
I don't see Ino here.

231
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,328
Ma'am.

232
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,871
Ma'am.

233
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,624
[beggar] Ma'am, can you spare me
some change? I'm really hungry.

234
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,191
[muffled screaming] Ino!

235
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,910
[Ino] Rigs.

236
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,412
[Rigs] Later, man!

238
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,863

I finally caught you.

243
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,865
Cara?

244
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,075
When did you arrive?

245
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,577
[grunts] Why are you hiding from me, huh?

246
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,246
Huh? What hiding?

247
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,957
Like this.

248
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,042
Sir, are you still going to ride?

249
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,002
Uh, let's just talk later.

250
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,046
Hey! Didn't you miss me?

251
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,589
No, I won't let you go.

252
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,590
Cara, I have something to do.

253
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,175
Take responsibility for what you did, Ino.

254
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,260
Hey!

255
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,761
There are so many people here.
What are you saying?

256
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,471
Take responsibility for not responding
to any of my messages to you.

257
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,889
So, no, I'm not going anywhere.

258
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,808
I'll go wherever you go.

Come on. Let me come with you.

-[Cara] Ino, since when--
-[Ino] When did you--

264
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,821
Ino, since when did you get into
this kind of work?

265
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,740
You know, I'm willing to help you.

266
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,949
I'm willing to send money again.

267
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,034
Huh?

268
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,704
What are you saying?

269
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,251
I came here for this.

270
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,258
Oh my gosh. You even have props.

271
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,468
[Ino] Silly.

272
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,719
I have a client.

273
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,012
She wants to get tattooed here.

274
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,603
[Cara] Ino.

00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,480
Will you please stop avoiding me?

276
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,483
On chat, you told me you're okay.

Hey!

278
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,116
Are you sure you are?

Oh my gosh!

281
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,507
Get a room!

282
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,718
Oh, right. This is a room.

283
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,054
[Cara] You're juggling jobs now

284
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,889
and you just moved into a new place.

285
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,599
Don't you get tired, Ino?

286
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,809
You've got a lot on your plate.

287
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,812
You might as well
carry the whole Philippines!

288
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,854
Stop exaggerating.

289
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,983
I'm just really busy,
that's why I couldn't reply.

290
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,276
[Cara] Hmm.

291
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,654
Did I offend you when I suggested

292
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,364
that you approach your dad?

293
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,700
Was it wrong for me to send you money?

294
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,410
Ouch, ouch!

295
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,911
-[client 2] It stings.
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

296
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,079
-[client 2] Ouch, ouch!
-I'm sorry.

297
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,164
Relax. Just relax.

298
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,917
Cara, I get that you just want to help.

299
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,253
Sorry if I did offend you.

300
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,464
I just feel bad that you lost your house

301
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,091
after it was foreclosed.

302
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,886
Ma'am, sorry if we're too loud here.

303
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,805
My best friend was gone for nine months,

304
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,016
and here she is, acting like
she was away for nine years.

305
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,642
Best friend?

306
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,310
So she's "frosted"?

307
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,938
"Friend-zoned and ghosted"?

308
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,358
About the house…

309
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,778
Cara, it's no longer practical
to stay there.

310
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,780
So where do you stay now?

311
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,199
That 2,000 pesos you sent me?

312
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,035
I'll just give it back to you.
Buy yourself someone to talk to.

313
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,453
You won't stop nagging!

314
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,373
[Cara] <i>Blue?</i>

315
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,418
<i>Red?</i>

316
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,462
Why don't you use it to buy socks instead?

317
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,755
Get a pair that matches.

318
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,298
It's called style.

319
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,761
Ino. Why don't we add some colors?

320
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,345
I saw your page.

321
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,389
Your paintings are very colorful.

322
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,851
[client 2] Color the tiger yellow.

323
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,543
Ma'am, I don't think that's a good idea.
Sorry, ma'am,

324
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,712
but Ino doesn't really paint anymore.

325
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,964
But don't worry, your butt looks fine.

326
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,466
I mean the tattoo.

327
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,634
It looks good even without any color,

328
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,886
thanks to your impressive butt.

329
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,056
How many squats do you do, ma'am?
Do you do squats?

330
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,017
[Cara] You know, Ino, I can't believe

331
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,602
I lasted nine months there with that girl.

332
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,604
She was unbearable!

333
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,902
Ino, that's mustard.

334
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,613
Here's the mayo.

335
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,741
I eat mustard. Didn't you know?

336
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,751
Let's make a toast first.

337
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,087
Welcome home.

338
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,755
Thanks for the treat, Domino.

339
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,423
[Ino] Just order whatever you want.

340
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,134
I told you I'm okay.

341
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,719
I was worried about you.

342
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,056
That's why I couldn't return
to Hong Kong right away

343
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,183
after your accident.

344
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,812
Do you remember that?

345
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,566
I came here for a week.

346
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,069
I came as soon as Jam called.

347
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,321
I booked a flight right away.

348
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,115
Man, Ino! I was so scared--

349
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,324
Cara, stop it.

350
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,742
I'm totally fine.

351
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,994
I'm alive.

352
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,954
It's your fault. You were such a jerk.

353
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,414
[Ino] Ouch. That hurts.

354
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,500
You kept arguing with me

355
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,586
when I told you
I wanted to drop my course.

356
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,588
Of course, Cara.
We're talking about Hong Kong here.

357
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,882
That was such a great opportunity.
Then what?

358
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,092
You'd drop it?
You wouldn't even finish it?

359
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,887
No wonder Ms. Vicky was fuming at you.

360
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,638
How was she fuming?

361
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,687
[Ino] So you won't go back to Hong Kong?

362
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,398
[Cara] It's so lonely there.

363
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,567
[Ino] Then what's your plan?

364
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,445
[Cara] Same as before.

365
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,866
Cara, don't tell me it's still Papa Bread?

366
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,867
What's the problem?

367
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,911
Aren't you guys losing so much money there

368
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,747
since that huge bakeshop opened?

369
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,999
We just need to do some makeover.

370
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,459
I'll try to earn extra money--

371
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,878
You know what? Just help me
with the renovation, okay?

372
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,006
I will help you, Cara.
I'm just saying be practical.

373
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,133
Focus on doing other things.

374
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,052
Like finding a more stable job.

375
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,054
Don't waste your talent.

376
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,348
[Ino] Tell me…

377
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,517
What happened to your dream of becoming
a best-selling author?

378
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,269
Silly! That's just a dream.

379
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,108
[sentimental music playing]

380
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,902
[Cara] How are your eyes?

381
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,239
[Ino] Same. I still have two.

382
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,573
[Cara] Obviously.

383
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,701
You know, not much has changed.

384
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,454
Cara, I still see everything in gray
all the time.

385
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,416
So there's no chance
that it'll go back to normal?

386
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,503
That's what the doctor said.

387
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,013
Can I see your new house?

388
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,269
[Cara] <i>So aside from working here,</i>

389
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,979
<i>you live here, too?</i>

390
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,398
<i>That's convenient!</i>

391
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,901
Wow!

392
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,238
You're so lucky to live in a penthouse!

393
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,834
More like a semi-penthouse.

394
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,920
It's still a penthouse.

395
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,423
It's relatively small.

396
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,758
Sorry for the mess.

397
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,386
It's just right.

398
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,054
Like a bachelor's pad.

399
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,441
[phone ringing]

400
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,735
Mr. Gary?

401
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,028
[Ino] Mr. Gary?

402
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,624
[Gary] <i>They need the money</i>
<i>as soon as possible,</i>

403
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,502
<i>so you have to fast-track</i>
<i>the opening of your mom's exhibit.</i>

404
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,962
I'm sorry, Mr. Gary.

405
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,424
I promise to pay in installments.

406
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,801
[Gary] <i>I wouldn't mind if it were only me.</i>

407
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,887
<i>But you owe money to the other collectors,</i>

408
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,931
<i>and the worst part is,</i>
<i>I'm the one dealing with them.</i>

409
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,558
I'm really sorry.

410
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,145
I'll do everything to give you that money.

411
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,648
I'll pay you back.

412
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,442
[Ino] I'm sorry.

413
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,819
All right.

414
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,000
Is everything okay?

415
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,795
Nosey, aren't you?

416
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,338
Any Hong Kong souvenirs?

417
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,881
Me!

418
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,841
Am I not enough?

419
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,427
Looks expensive!

420
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,305
Oh, please! Not only am I expensive,

421
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,015
I am also exclusively yours!

422
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,100
Kidding!

423
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,559
[Ino] Time to go home.

424
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,936
Ouch!

425
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,647
No need to send me off.

426
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,940
You might end up missing me more.

427
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,441
I don't plan to. Just leave.

428
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,403
But you did miss me, right?

429
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,572
[inhales deeply] Bye.

430
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,160
Seriously?

431
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,168
Last chance.

432
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,461
Nothing?

433
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,756
Okay.

434
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,679
Cara.

435
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,349
Yes?

436
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,184
I missed you.

437
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,354
I knew it.

438
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,106
Goodnight!

439
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,154
[student 1] Period stain!

440
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,199
-[student 2] She has a period stain.
-[student 3] Stop it! I feel bad for her.

441
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,617
[student 2] Ew, period stain!

442
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,578
[students jeering]

443
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,373
[students laughing]

444
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,418
You think it's disgusting?

445
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,211
Is it your first time to see blood?

446
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,547
Yuck!

447
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,340
Fine!

448
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,301
Since you guys are so noisy!

449
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,432
Wait! Why is Ino included?

450
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,516
He hasn't said a word.

451
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,561
Well, he's always late!

452
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,812
-[students jeering]
-[student 1] The audacity!

453
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,480
How did you know he's always late?

454
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,649
You just transferred here
in the star section.

455
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,445
Just leave! You don't belong here!

456
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,323
You deserve it.

457
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,824
Goodbye!

458
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,535
[Ino] Enough!

459
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,913
So what if she has a period stain?

460
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,415
[Sky] Do you have pads?

461
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,636
It was my first time to see blood.

462
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,639
Sorry, I didn't speak sooner.

463
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,807
See? You're even late about that.

464
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,727
This one's late too.

465
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,563
But thank you.

466
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,082
To be fair,
it's also my first time to see blood.

467
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,250
Last month,

468
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,169
when my father died in a plane crash,
there was no blood.

469
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,213
You know what I mean?

470
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,674
I didn't even get to say
goodbye to him properly

471
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,052
because I didn't want to see him leave.

472
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,222
I didn't even get to say, "I love you."

473
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,431
Sorry.

474
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,184
What for?

475
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,395
Were you the airplane?

476
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,813
No.

477
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,356
How could I be the airplane?

478
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,316
[Cara] Like this.

479
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,443
[Cara sniffles]

480
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,029
[Cara mimics airplane noises]

481
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,490
Up. Then down.

482
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,741
Then around.

483
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,414
[whooping, chuckling]

484
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,796
[stifled sob, chuckles]

485
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,266
-[mimics airplane noises]
-[chuckles]

486
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,146
Then up?

487
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,772
[Fidel] <i>You shouldn't have spent</i>
<i>the down payment</i>

488
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,483
if you're not going to do the commission.

489
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,111
[Ella] Is that the advice
of your special friend?

490
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,030
What's her name again?

491
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,489
Marie?

492
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,450
Dad.

493
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,120
-Ino.
-[Ino] Ma.

494
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,414
[Fidel] Why did you come home late?

495
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,916
I was with my friend.

496
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,626
My classmate, Cara.

497
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,920
Actually, something very
interesting happened today.

498
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,841
I saw a new color because of her.

499
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,052
Something close to red.

500
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,220
Are you in love, son?

501
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,056
Dad! I'm not.

502
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,224
I just saw a new shade of red.

503
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,601
Red is love.

504
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,479
That's why it's the first color
that we see.

505
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,273
Red is so powerful, they say,

506
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,734
that it can actually grant you a wish.

507
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,028
-Stop it, Dad!
-I'm serious.

508
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,196
There's this saying

509
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,865
that if you close your eyes
and you make a wish,

510
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,202
if red is the first color
you see when you open your eyes,

511
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,704
your wish will come true

512
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,039
and your life will change.

513
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,208
That's what they say.

514
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,795
But you know what else they say
about red, son?

515
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,424
Red could also mean destruction…

516
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,510
passion…

517
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,761
anger…

518
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,929
blood.

519
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,599
So don't be deceived by red.

520
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,856
[alarm blaring]

521
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,825
[phone chimes]

522
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,796
Yes, Ma.

523
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,923
I won't forget.

524
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,968
Let's proceed with Mom's exhibit.

525
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,721
[Gary] We need to include
that centerpiece.

526
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:47,142
It will help reduce
your mom's debts and interests.

527
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,103
But an unfinished artwork
has more novelty, Mr. Gary.

528
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,229
Yes.

529
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,149
It has cultural value if it is unfinished.

530
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,693
But the collectors
are thinking of another way.

531
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,027
Another angle.

532
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,280
[Ino] What do you mean?

533
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:06,453
You've been your mom's art apprentice
for so long, Ino.

534
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,080
So they all want to know…

535
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,374
When will you finish that centerpiece?

536
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,626
I can no longer paint.

537
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,088
And as long as I can't see color,
I won't be able to feel it.

538
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,965
Then don't use color.

539
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,301
It's art.

540
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,469
There are no rules.

541
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,138
Then it will no longer be
my mom's centerpiece.

542
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,974
I might just ruin it.

543
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,434
Actually,

544
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,646
they suggested another person
should finish the centerpiece.

545
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,233
[Fidel] Son.

546
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,656
What are you doing here?

547
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,408
I just want to help.

548
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,494
Or you just want to steal the spotlight?

549
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,247
Okay, Sky. I'll call you again.

550
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,082
Why will you paint again?

551
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,126
Isn't advertising your world now?

552
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,669
[Ino] That's where you're famous, right?

553
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,047
That's even where you had another family.

554
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,216
[Gary] Ino!

555
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,843
That centerpiece will be
the selling factor of our--

556
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,386
Then I'll do it!

557
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,096
[Ino] I'll finish that centerpiece.

558
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,973
And I don't need your help!

559
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,187
Ino, are you okay?

560
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,855
Ino.

561
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,107
Ino, wait!

562
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,651
[exhales sharply]

563
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:20,735
[Cara] Ino!

564
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,153
[Ella sobbing] No!

565
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,616
Stop it, Dad!

566
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,330
[Ino] Ma, are you okay?

567
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,750
I'm sorry, son.

568
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,378
I can't take this anymore.

569
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,006
[Ella] Don't.

570
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,399
[Cara] Ino!

571
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,776
Ino, wait! Ino!

572
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,992
[car horn honking]

573
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,493
[Cara] Ino!

574
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,330
[both panting]

575
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,124
You son of a bitch!
What were you thinking?

576
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,137
I'm really sorry, Cara.

577
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,104
Cara.

578
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,480
Cara, I'm really sorry.

579
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,190
Ino, I'm okay.

580
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,818
[Cara] What's not okay

581
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,154
is when you pretend that you're okay.

582
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,615
Ino, I know you're not okay.

583
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,117
I'm your best friend, Ino.

584
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,328
Let me help you.

585
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,999
Allow me to be your best friend.

586
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,920
Ino.

587
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,130
Can you paint, Cara?

588
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,050
What?

589
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,723
I'm so stupid!

590
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,394
When I saw my dad,
dammit, I'd rather do it.

591
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,355
I'd rather do it instead.

592
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,655
Now, I have to finish my mom's artwork.

593
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,115
Oh? Then finish it.

594
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,325
How?

595
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,911
I don't know how to paint anymore.

596
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,829
I haven't painted since Mom died.

597
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,457
Cara, I tried, but I really can't.

598
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,541
Ino.

599
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,961
So what if you can't see colors?

600
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,755
I can label each color for you.

601
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,423
I can dictate each of them for you.

602
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,883
Cara, it's not just about the colors!

603
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:49,968
Then what?

604
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,679
How will I paint if this doesn't want it?

605
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,641
Most especially this one.

606
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,901
But Ino.

607
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,988
Do you not want to do it,

608
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,156
or you just can't do it?

609
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,450
[Cara] Because those
are two different things.

610
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,078
If you don't want to,
there's nothing I can do about it.

611
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,956
But if you say you just can't do it,

612
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,709
I will help you do it.

613
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,087
Ever since you stopped seeing colors,

614
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,966
what's left in here?

615
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,803
Sadness.

616
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,933
I feel sad and dead.

617
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,442
Then let's bring back the joy.

618
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,612
Let's revive the dead! [whooping]

619
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,825
Why are we here, Cara?

620
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,161
Does the guard know about this?

621
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,288
Ino, you need to be confident
for you to paint again.

622
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,290
That's why I brought you here.

623
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,169
We're going to time travel.

624
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:12,133
Welcome back to year 2013!

625
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,429
Here.

626
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,978
No wonder you smell ancient.

627
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,646
When did you last wear that?

628
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,774
Excuse me! Come and smell me.

629
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,570
[sniffing]

630
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,036
Cara, what the hell?

631
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,079
Your saliva!

632
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,455
Saliva?

633
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,623
I was just smelling you.

634
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,541
I didn't kiss you!

635
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,710
This is what we really came here for.

636
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,508
Our Ecology Week
Poster Making Champion is…

637
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,551
Domino Urbano!

638
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,470
[Cara] See? It's just like
how you drew it before.

639
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,097
Are those hands or feet?

640
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,808
That's a far cry from my drawing.

641
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,477
Come on! At least appreciate the effort.

642
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,813
[Cara] You're so mean.
Let's just go around the campus

643
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,482
so you'll remember all your achievements
from seventh grade.

644
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,984
Huh? Seventh grade?

645
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,985
Huh?

646
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,238
We weren't classmates yet
in seventh grade.

647
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,449
[Ino] I knew it.

648
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,659
You've had a crush on me ever since.

649
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,290
[upbeat music playing]

650
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,376
[Cara] Excuse me. Where's the class--

651
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,587
Excuse me. Where's the class--

652
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,882
Excuse me.

653
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,967
[Ino] Dude!

654
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,635
What time is our practice later?

655
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,928
[student 4] It's at 6 p.m., after class.

656
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,847
-[Ino] At 6 p.m., not 5 p.m.?
-[student 4] Yup.

657
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,015
Excuse me. Where can I find
classroom "Love"?

658
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,726
Just go straight,

659
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,103
then turn left at the end.

660
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,855
Okay? "Love."

661
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,941
[student 5] Hey, Ino!
Ms. Ong is looking for you!

662
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,235
[Ino] Here goes Ms. Ong again.

663
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,486
-All good?
-Yeah.

664
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,418
Ino!

665
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:20,845
Please welcome our MVP, Domino Urbano!

666
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,097
Give me a Do.

667
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,432
Give me a Mi.

668
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,893
Give me a No.

669
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,561
Domino!

670
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,230
[whooping] Go, Domino! Go, Domino!

671
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,773
Go, Domino!

672
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,902
I don't think you saw
our championship game.

673
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,362
You were at the wedding booth.

674
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,823
You were with pimple-faced Sky.

675
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,950
Hey! Stop being a basher.

676
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,036
Why? Is it my fault that I'm so lovable?

677
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,497
Then why are you with me
and not with your husband?

678
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,957
Then marry me.

679
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,917
[thunder rumbling]

680
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,210
Stop the wedding!

681
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,587
-[ball dribbling]
-[awkward silence]

682
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,758
[indistinct chattering]

683
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,009
[student 6] Sorry, Ino!

684
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,302
The wedding's finished.

685
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,429
Cara was in such a hurry.

686
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,805
She wanted to catch your game.

687
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,432
Can't you guys extend for a bit?

688
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,850
Make my wedding with Cara happen. Please.

689
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,602
-You're late again, Urbano.
-[student 6] Sorry.

690
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,650
Do you really like her,

691
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,360
or you just don't want to lose to me?

692
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,028
Oh my God!

693
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,738
Sky versus Ino.

694
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,740
[student 1] The first honor candidates.

695
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,618
[Ino] Sky.

696
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,787
I won't be late next time.

697
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,667
Ino?

698
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,671
What? Such a coward.

699
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,172
Don't tell me I should have been the one
to propose to you.

700
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,258
I do, Cara.

701
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,344
I did.

702
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,516
I mean…

703
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,269
I mean, I've accepted you long ago.

704
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,937
In sickness and in health,

705
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,313
till death do us part,

706
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,690
as a friend.

707
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,150
As a best friend.

708
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,279
Why take it back?

709
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,199
I already caught you
before you left for Hong Kong.

710
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,285
[Cara] Ino, that's not true.

711
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,995
The Illuminati just made that up.

712
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,037
[Ino] Really?

713
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,956
Then why are you blushing all of a sudden?

714
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,166
[Ino] <i>Remember the Halloween Ball</i>
<i>that you missed?</i>

715
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,543
[Cara] <i>Yes. What about it?</i>

716
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,379
<i>You missed me so you brought</i>
<i>the ball to my house, right?</i>

717
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,464
[sighs in relief]

718
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,884
[farts]

719
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,638
[stomach rumbling]

720
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,307

[Cara] So you think Ino saw red

877
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,627
because you're connected
to Ms. Ella's paintings?

There has to be a connection
somewhere, somehow.

painting in the gallery,

on such a personal level.

and we still have to discuss
your mom's paintings.

Also, I still have to do a studio visit

890
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,071
because you haven't finished
the centerpiece yet?

891
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:54,454
Ino, I think, spending time with Iris

892
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,290
might be a good idea.

00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,046
I was just thinking

897
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,299
that if you stay close to Iris often,

898
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,800
maybe you'll see colors again.

899
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,600
Let's make a group chat!

900
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,728
[phone chimes]

901
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,647
FROM CARA
HOW'S THE WORKSHOP? ANY UPDATES?

902
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,316
[Iris] <i>Right away? We just got here.</i>

903
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,153
As you know, your mom's exhibit
is arranged thematically

904
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,113
to show the recurring elements

905
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,823
of her vision as an artist.

906
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,618
This centerpiece…

907
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,537
conveys the same emotions as the rest.

908
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,831
But it's so distinct.

909
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,709
It connects to me differently.

910
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,713
I also noticed the shift in her imagery.

911
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,925
Her, using white lines like this?

912
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,094
It's very unusual for her.

913
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,930
Did she tell you anything?

914
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,766
Nothing.

915
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,311
I didn't even see the studies
of her artworks.

916
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,897
She said she lost them.

917
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,153
[Ino] But I think this one right here,

918
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,739
I think it's a double rainbow.

919
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,534
I remember when I first saw this.

920
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,703
I was just so moved.

921
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,582
[clicks tongue]

922
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,335
Although…

923
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,171
it doesn't look the same anymore

924
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,507
now that all I see is gray.

925
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,219
I'm sorry.

926
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,305
I'm actually getting used to it.

927
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,350
So…

928
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,102
Why are you doing this exhibit?

929
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,773
I just want to clear her name.

930
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,860
I just want to show everyone, you know,

931
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,195
how good she was.

932
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,199
I don't want her to be remembered
for all her debts.

933
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,204
[Iris] You know,

934
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,499
I hold painting workshops.

935
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:05,794
And I use less technical methods
with my students.

936
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,756
If you want to try, you can.

937
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,594

Thank you.

941
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,607
Anytime, Arevalo.

942
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,527
Shall we discuss our article?

943
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,948
Sky?

944
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,159
[Sky] So after I came back
from the US last year,

945
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,493
I started working right away

946
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,996
since I graduated early.

947
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,373
Nice!

948
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,334
You're still the smart guy I knew.

949
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:52,090
By the way,
that article that we're going to write

950
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,968
is about pastries around the metro?

951
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:55,927
Yeah.

952
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,346
And how they're rising after the pandemic?

953
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,433
I told my editor you can write it
since you have your own bakery, right?

954
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,769
You still remember that?

955
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,396
Of course.

956
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,023
I love your cheese bread.

957
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,193
I'm sure you missed that
when you were in Hong Kong.

958
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,402
[Cara] Huh?

959
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,739
How did you know I was in Hong Kong?

960
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,828
You caught me.

00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,457
Of course, I'm still checking
your posts from time to time.

We got married in the wedding booth.

You were just in a hurry then

973
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,366
because you were going to see Urbano.

974
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,869
Wait.

00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,790
You're still best friends?

Of course.

1077
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,164
But if you love someone,
you'll fight for her.

1078
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,124
-[pounds the table]
-Don't back off!

1079
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,834
Fight! Fight!

1080
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,043
Fight!

1081
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,795
<i>Yes! Fight, fight, fight!</i>

1082
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,089
Oh my God! Cockroach!

1083
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,091
-Cockroach!
-[Sky] Cockroach?

1084
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,425
[Stephi] There's a cockroach!

1085
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,719
[Sky] Relax, I got this.

1086
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,971
[Iris] Cockroach!

1087
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,766
[man 2] Ouch.

1088
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,772
Do you still have bread?

1089
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,447
Finally, I've started
with your renovation, Papa Bread.

1090
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,952
Okay. So yellow…

1091
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,203
Guys, I'll order some snacks.

1092
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,163
-Do you want anything?
-I'll do it.

1093
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,289
I'll do it.

1094
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,799
I don't want anything.

1095
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,221
[Sky] Cara. Do you want some snacks?

1096
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,306
No, I'm okay.

1097
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,808
Guys, what do you want?

1098
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,018
Boba milk tea!

1099
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,478
With white cream cheese!

1100
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,354
[man 2] And pudding.

1101
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,066
Uh, I'll go ahead.

1102
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,737
[Iris] Bye, Cara.

1103
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,989
I'll just see her out.

1104
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,620
[Iris] Ino, I like you.

1105
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,500
And I know you like Cara.

1106
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,835
But since you weren't saying anything,

1107
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,171
I thought I might still have a chance.

1108
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,299
But…

1109
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,260
after today,
I realized that it's hopeless.

1110
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,804
I just wanted to put it out there.

1111
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,809
So, I'm deciding for myself that…

1112
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,186
let's just be friends.

1113
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,108
Iris.

1114
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,487
I appreciate your honesty.

1115
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,409
I wish I could be like you.

1116
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,833
What is holding you back?

1117
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,258
[Cara] <i>Ino,</i>

1118
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,426
<i>I know you're always late,</i>

1119
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,845
<i>but try to get here on time today.</i>
<i>We have a major exam.</i>

1120
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,889
Cara.

1121
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,391
I'm still sleepy.

1122
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,309
And don't worry,

1123
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,852
I can pass the make-up test.

1124
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,853
Chill.

1125
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,106
[Cara] <i>If I need to pick you up,</i>

1126
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,607
<i>I'll do it!</i>

1127
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,651
I'm still sleepy.

1128
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,695
Let me sleep first.

1129
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:37,198
Just focus on
how you're going to pass, okay?

1130
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,616
Okay, goodnight.

1131
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,828
[sighs deeply]

1132
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,080
[Ella] It sucks! It sucks!

1133
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,542
It sucks!

1134
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,669
It sucks! It sucks!

1135
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,421
It sucks!

It sucks!

1139
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,221
It sucks! It sucks!

-Ma.

1141
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,808
It sucks!

1142
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,018
Ma.

1143
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,769
[Ella] What a failure.

1144
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,023
-It's okay, Ma.
-[Ella] What a failure.

1145
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,109
[sobs, sniffles]

1146
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,781
Ma. Ma.

1147
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,907
Ma.

1148
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,576
You're not a failure, okay?

1149
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,577
No.

1150
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,995
We'll get through this, Ma.

1151
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,455
-Ma…
-No.

1152
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,041
-I'm here for you, okay?
-No.

1154
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,591
Cara, what are you doing here?

1155
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,427
Oh! You're already wearing
your uniform. Let's go!

1156
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,887
-Where's your bag?
-Cara! Cara, stop.

1157
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,347
-[Ino] Cara, wait.
-[Cara] Why?

1158
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,348
Is that your mom?

1159
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,932
[Ino] Cara.

1160
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,059
Cara.

1161
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,561
Hello, ma'am.

1162
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,896
Good morning.

1163
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,023
I'm Caramel, Ino's classmate.

1164
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,983
Ma'am, could you please tell Ino
to man up?

1165
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,777
He's always late
and he'd rather sleep today

1166
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,904
than take our major exam.

1167
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,199
Hi!

1168
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,992
Why don't you eat first?

1169
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,671
Oh, no need, ma'am. I'm good.

1170
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,214
Thank you.

1171
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,799
I'll go ahead.

1172
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,685
Ino.

1173
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,105
Don't worry.

1174
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,607
I'll back you up when you have to be late.

1175
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,530
Thank you, Cara.

1176
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,451
[Ino] Good evening.

1177
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,955
Today's test was so easy.

1178
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,916
Cara was just exaggerating.

1179
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,710
As usual.

1180
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,130
[Ella] I don't want anyone to get hurt,
Ino.

1181
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,589
You mean Cara?

1182
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,883
Ma, she's my best friend.

1183
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,386
Not just her.

1184
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,722
You too.

1185
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,308
And then you'll end up hurting her too.

1186
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,353
[Ella] Do me a favor.

1187
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,607
Don't fall in love with her.

1188
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,535
I will not hurt her, Ma.

1189
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,673
[phone chimes]

1190
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,100
[Ino] Iris, I understand that this
weekend is for our workshop.

1191
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,644
But Cara's presence
will really help me focus.

1192
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,105
That's why I invited her.

1193
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,231
[Iris] Focus?

1194
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,275
But you're going to book a tour?

1195
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,568
Tour?

1196
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,530
Tour? Did you say tour?

1197
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,324
Well! What tour do you want?

1198
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,493
[caretaker] We have a forest tour.

1199
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,913
Climbing tour. Walking tour. Mall tour.

1200
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,372
We also have a market tour here,

1201
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,499
especially if you're hungry.

1202
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,834
We have all sorts of tours here.

1203
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,128
Aside from being a caretaker,

1204
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,048
I'm also a certified tourist guide.

1205
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,926
Chief Pong at your service.

1206
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,930
We'll do it in our free time--

1207
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,014
Ino!

1208
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,434
Sky asked why I'm coming here.

1209
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,269
[Cara] He said we can write
about your mom's exhibit,

1210
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,979
that's why I let him tag along.

1211
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,064
It's like the stars have aligned.

1212
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,524
This is a great opportunity!

1213
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,443
Urbano. Iris.

1214
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,197
By the way, where do we check in?

1215
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,240
[Pong] Check in?

1216
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,950
Perfect!

1217
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,743
We still have one more vacant room.

1218
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,203
Can you still focus?

1219
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,292
Excuse me? I'm the best friend!

1220
01:03:58,376 --> 01:03:59,836
Kimmi, it was Ino who invited me,

1221
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,088
and I came here to show my support.

1222
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,259
[whispering] Stop nagging me.

1223
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,302
I'll call you again later. Bye.

1224
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:10,763
I don't know Sky,

1225
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,682
so you know I can't stay with him.

1226
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,433
[Cara chuckles awkwardly]

1227
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,231
Whoa, one item in her skincare routine?

1228
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,000
The slower, the classier.

1229
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,341
Ino,

1230
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:48,593
you told me you can't feel anything

1231
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,344
when you paint because
the colors are gone.

1232
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,014
So, our goal is to relate each color

1233
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,557
with feelings and emotions

1234
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,850
in hopes that it will help you

1235
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,059
finish your mom's artwork.

1236
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,979
-[Ino] I know.
-[Pong] I'm going to take you there.

1237
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,188
Close your eyes, Ino.

1238
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,316
Give me your hand.

1239
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,998
[Iris] How do you feel?

1240
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,500
Warm.

1241
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,463
So this is how we'll do it.

1242
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:26,881
Feel colors

1243
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,174
and then you try to paint them.

1244
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,595
Yellow.

1245
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:35,806
Warmth.

1246
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:44,607
[Cara] Ouch!

1247
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:46,484
Are you okay?

1248
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,860
[Pong] Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

1249
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,236
-First aid kit!
-[Cara] Ouch!

01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:27,724
Answer me, Ino!

1610
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:29,559
Sorry for the hassle.

1611
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:30,935
Go home, Cara.

1612
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,228
Forget about me.

1613
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,940
That's exactly what I'll do
once I get an answer.

1614
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,235
What's happening to you?

1615
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:41,779
Tell me!

1616
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,782
Answer me, Ino!

1617
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:45,783
Answer me!

1618
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,494
I will never see colors again, Cara.

1619
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:50,580
Says who? The doctor?

1620
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:51,706
Yes!

1621
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,673
So what?

1622
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,843
I don't want to be
a liability to you, Cara.

1623
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,346
I may be small,
but I can carry you if needed.

1624
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:09,057
I have nothing to offer, Cara.

1625
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,267
I'm not asking for anything, Ino!

1626
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:15,063
Cara, my future is so uncertain.

1627
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:16,314
Whose future is certain?

1628
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:17,774
Cara, you'll get tired of me!

1629
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:18,942
Then I'll rest!

1630
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:20,235
Cara, please!

1631
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:21,236
-[Cara] What? What, Ino?
-Please, Cara.

1632
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,488
What, Ino? Am I too persistent?

1633
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,949
Am I too eager?

1634
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,325
That's just who I am!

1635
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:29,953
That's how I love.

1636
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:33,289
[sobs] I will do anything

1637
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:36,125
just to show you how much I love you, Ino.

1638
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,338
All I know is,
there's nothing I won't do for you.

1639
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,882
Because I don't want to have any regrets.

1640
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:44,425
[Cara sobbing]

1641
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,677
How about you?

1642
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:47,929
How do you show your love?

1643
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,642
Cara, please. Cara--

1644
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:54,519
Enough with the "please."

1645
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,897
Let's get straight to the point.

1646
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:01,109
I love you.

1647
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:03,987
Do you love me or not?

1648
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,407
-Cara, you're my best friend.
-I don't want to be just your best friend.

1649
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,575
I love you.

1650
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,202
Do you love me or not?

1651
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,203
Cara, please!

1652
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,496
Stop it, please!

1653
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:14,914
Jesus, Ino! It's either a yes or a no!

1654
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:18,334
I love you.

1655
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,212
Do you love me or not?

1656
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:24,674
I don't deserve your love, Cara.

1657
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,592
[screams] I said I love you!

1658
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,803
Do you love me or--

1659
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,179
Cara, I killed her!

1660
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:31,973
I killed her!

1661
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:34,142
I killed my mother!

1662
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:37,103
How can you love someone like me?

1663
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,150
[sighs deeply]

1664
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:45,737
Ino.

1665
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,076
Your mom died in an accident, okay?

1666
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,456
Stop blaming yourself.

1667
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,209
But somehow I wanted it too, Cara.

1668
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,922
[Ella] <i>I feel nervous, son.</i>

1669
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,549
I feel like a first-timer.

1670
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:07,800
[chuckles]

1671
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,093
Mom,

1672
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,928
I'm so happy for you.

1673
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,221
I really am.

1674
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:14,098
Thank you, son.

1675
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,311
I just need to finish that centerpiece.

1676
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:20,021
But at least

1677
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:23,441
we secured an exhibit date with Mr. Gary.

1678
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,985
And I won't miss that.

1679
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,237
I'll fly back here to attend your exhibit.

1680
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:31,949
You'll still go to Hong Kong?

1681
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:38,289
Ma.

1682
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,583
We already agreed on this last month,

1683
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,959
remember?

1684
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:51,719
[Ella] Why?

1685
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,805
Is it because of Cara?

1686
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,348
It's Cara, right?

1687
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,976
You're only going there because of her!

1688
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:01,312
Art residency my foot!

1689
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:03,439
That's bullshit, Ino!

1690
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,441
You're in love with that woman!

1691
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:07,693
She's the reason
why you're leaving, right?

1692
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:09,153
Yes, it's because of Cara!

1693
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,238
She's the reason.

1694
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:11,948
[Ella] See! I am right!

1695
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:13,991
You're in love with that girl!

1696
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,368
Yes, I'm in love with her!

1697
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:19,163
[Ella] I told you
not to fall in love with her!

1698
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,041
How many times do I have to tell you?

1699
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,417
Why wouldn't you listen to me?

1700
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,962
-Ma!
-Look what happened?

1701
01:30:26,045 --> 01:30:27,755
She's taking you away from me.

1702
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:28,840
She's not, Ma!

1703
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,716
Yes, she is!

1704
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,845
[sobbing] I'm going to be alone.

1705
01:30:34,887 --> 01:30:37,265
And you don't care.

1706
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,017
You're so selfish.

1707
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:42,687
You are just like your father!

1708
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:44,272
Eight years!

1709
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:46,774
For eight years, it's all you!

1710
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,067
All of me serving you,

1711
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,527
and I'm the one who's selfish?

1712
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,656
[Ella] Then go ahead!

1713
01:30:53,739 --> 01:30:55,032
Leave!

1714
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,034
This is the first time
I asked anything from you.

1715
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,829
Let's see how far you'll go.

1716
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:00,913
[tires screeching]

1717
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,541
[Ella] Your trophies, your recognitions,

1718
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,126
your connections.

1719
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:07,336
They're all because of me!

1720
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,921
Enough!

1721
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:10,423
I'm so sick of you!

1722
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:13,718
I'm tired of being your son!

1723
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:15,553
[tires screeching]

1724
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:18,264
[truck horn honking]

1725
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:19,765
Ino!

-[truck horn honking]
-[tires screeching]

1727
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,147
[crashing]

1728
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:35,489
So you see, Cara?

1729
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:38,951
It's my fault.

1730
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,292
And I deserve all the shit
that happened after.

1731
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,297
This is my punishment, Cara.

1732
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,054
It's not that I don't love you, Cara.

1733
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:04,518
It's just that every time
I want to say "I love you",

1734
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,648
I wonder if you deserve the loser
that I've become.

1735
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:11,442
[sniffles]

1736
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:12,652
That's it.

1737
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:17,782
I'm done.

1738
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,955
I have nothing more to say.

1739
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:31,504
You have so many excuses
about why I can't love you.

1740
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:36,801
Cara, God knows how much I love you.

1741
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:41,555
But Sky is…

1742
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:44,183
But Sky is right.

1743
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:48,896
You deserve someone better.

1744
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,650
I see.

1745
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:55,736
So it's a no.

1746
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:00,908
Okay.

1747
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:04,537
Finally, you gave an answer.

1748
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,838
And by the way…

1749
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:17,842
no one gets to say who deserves my love.

1750
01:33:18,634 --> 01:33:19,927
Just me.

1751
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:26,309

1756
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,731
Looks like everyone in this town
is cutting down on carbs.

1757
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:15,483
We've got no customers.

1758
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:18,277
[whispering] What happened to her?
Is she sick?

1759
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,453
You're right, Auntie.

1760
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:29,455
I'm so stupid.

1761
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:32,541
Tell me, Brother Ber,

1762
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:36,545
what do we do with your favorite child?

1763
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,173
[Vicky] Can you be honest with me?

1764
01:34:39,882 --> 01:34:42,760
What have you done for Ino so far?

1765
01:34:48,682 --> 01:34:50,101
Everything.

1766
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:56,107
I've already done everything for Ino.

1767
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:01,153
I've been his number one supporter.

1768
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,947
His biggest fan.

1769
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,491
I always got his back.

1770
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:06,909
I always cover for him.

1771
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:09,620
I've done everything for Ino, Auntie.

1772
01:35:09,703 --> 01:35:10,663
Everything.

1773
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,666
If you say you've done everything,

1774
01:35:13,749 --> 01:35:15,084
what is all that's left to do?

1775
01:35:21,924 --> 01:35:23,134
Nothing.

1776
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,429
You've done your part, Cara.

1777
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,973
[Vicky] Just give him space.

1778
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:31,851
Let him figure things out
on his own for now.

1779
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:35,104
That's part of loving too.

1780
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:41,485
What do I do with all this love I have?

1781
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,237
[Vicky] Why?

1782
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,781
Is he the only person you can love?

1783
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:48,200
Maybe you're forgetting something.

1784
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:49,493
You guys?

1785
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,245
Aside from us.

1786
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:53,747
Who?

1787
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:56,000
You.

1788
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,377

[Vicky] Remember which one is yours, okay?

1816
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:24,463
[Stephi] Sure.

1817
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:25,589
[Vicky] Stephi, come here.

1818
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,966
-[Stephi] Yes, Queen?
-[Vicky] You see that?

1819
01:37:27,049 --> 01:37:28,634
We need to…

1820
01:37:28,717 --> 01:37:30,719
-Get rid of it.
-[Vicky] Correct.

1821
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:38,060
I also miss Papa.

1822
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:39,728
And I'm sure he's proud of you.

1823
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:41,021
For moving forward.

1824
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:55,286

I really just want to apologize.

1834
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:03,479
Apology accepted.

1835

How are you?

1836
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:13,739
I've been so worried about you, Cara.

1837

I'm leaving, Ino.

01:39:23,874 --> 01:39:25,542
Congratulations.

1844
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,878
I'm so happy for you, Cara.

1845
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,301
I came here because I remembered Papa.

1846
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:38,555
I regret not talking to him
before his flight.

1847
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:41,892
There were so many unspoken words,

1848
01:39:41,975 --> 01:39:44,019
and I don't want to make
that same mistake.

1849
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:47,147
Cara, I don't know what to do without you.

1850
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,067
All the more I have to leave.

1851

For us to figure things out.

1852
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:57,825
I'm sorry about your mom.

1853
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:03,414
I can't imagine what it's like
to carry that guilt,

1854
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,958
knowing what happened
between you and your mom.

1855
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,503
But is it really guilt?

1856
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:14,591
Or you just can't
accept the person you've become?

1857

1858
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:23,517
Your mom is gone, Ino.

But you?

1860
01:40:27,646 --> 01:40:29,898
You have a lifetime ahead of you.

1861
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:35,195
Loving you made me see what I'm capable of

1862
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,533
as well as my limits.

1863
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:46,915
I realized
that I cannot pick your life up.

1864
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:50,836
That I shouldn't.

1865
01:40:52,296 --> 01:40:54,548
Only you can do that for yourself.

1866
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:01,054

1876
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:32,896
I have something to tell you.

1877
01:42:36,066 --> 01:42:37,943
I did something bad.

1878
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:45,117
I did something so unforgivable.

1879
01:42:48,078 --> 01:42:49,496
So terrible.

1880
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:52,040
It's about Mom.

1881
01:42:54,918 --> 01:42:56,920
I got tired of loving her.

1882
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,339
It's okay, son.

1883
01:43:00,382 --> 01:43:01,508

01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,135
I know.

1885
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:07,389
But it doesn't mean
that we loved her less.

I'm here now, son.

1887

I can't do this alone, Dad.
