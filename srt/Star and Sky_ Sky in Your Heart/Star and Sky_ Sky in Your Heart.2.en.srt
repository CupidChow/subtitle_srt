Well then, I won't lend you my phone from now on.

- Hey, relax.
- Think about it.

168
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,700
You can choose to be lonely at night

169
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,730
or call your beloved brother sometimes.

170

There aren't any more patients, Khun,

Actually,

I haven't checked everyone yet.

Who is left?

176

The one in the mirror.

177
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:48,181
Why did you dilly-dally? You could have just said it.

178
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:53,423
Bring that chair and sit over here.

179

Open your mouth.

180

Everything seems fine.

181
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:33,400
Next... I'll check your heart.

182
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:46,394
Wait, Khun. What are you doing?

183
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:49,457
I'm going to listen to your heart.

00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:53,712
I won't hear it clearly through the shirt.

185

You were able to listen to other people's hearts through their shirts.

Well.

Everyone else got a basic check-up,

188

I'm not.

Are you crazy? Khru Prince? Who would like him?

196
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:05,118
Everyone who sees him will fall for him.

197
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,818
Even you.

198

You have a strong heart.

- What?

What does that have to do with anything?

202
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,432
The doctor asked you a question. You should just answer.

203
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,273
Why? Are you hitting on me?

Well.

You've been here for a while now.

207
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:42,580
It would be quite lonely living far from your lover.

208

I'm not dating anyone.

209

In case that's the answer that you want to know.

Let me tell you.

They used to have only him here.

But now, they have Dr. Fah up here too.

It's Khru Prince, of course.

Wow, I almost couldn't catch you!

That's right. Khru Prince is handsome, cute, and nice.

245
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:31,715
If 2 + 2 isn't 4, then what is it?

246
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:35,090
2 + 2 equals a rabbit.

Gosh! You caught on. It's no fun now!

Not only is he capable, he doesn't care about his image.

He's always like this. Drunk every day.

00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:39,524
Sometimes he sleeps in the water basin when drunk.

Everyone tries to make him quit.

He just won't listen.

313

I can't do anything more than give him treatment when he's ill.

Come with me. I will show you something.

Why did he stop?

00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,694
All he does is drink.

331
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,485
What's up with my patients these days?

332
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,598
When they get hurt, they get drunk. So bad.

333
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,209
Right? Just like someone around here, right?

334
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,905
Oops! Did I just call myself out?

335
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,952
I know it's hard.

336
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:06,852
But from now on, please take care of Loong Phang for us.

337
00:24:06,852 --> 00:24:10,684
You're probably the only person he'll listen to.

338
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,199
Village Headman, are you here to visit Loong Phang?

339
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:29,792
I am. It's good you're here. I have news for you.

340
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,328
What news?

341
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:35,695
There will be a pig slaughter ritual tomorrow in the village.

342
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:40,294
It is the pig named Gong, that the children raised.

343
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:44,452
So please inform the children for me.

344
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,021
Wow! That's a tough job too.

345
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,099
Good luck.

I have news for you.

348
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:30,428
Khru, my dad is ready for the slaughter.

349
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,601
What? Slaughter?

350
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,877
Oh, she meant rope. The Village Headman needs to use the rope for something.

351
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,597
Let's talk outside.

352
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,099
Why did you lie to the children?

353
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,364
Because I haven't told them yet.

354
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:04,721
Ai, you must tell them right away.

355
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:08,020
My dad says he's going to wash the pig soon.

356
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,872
He's ready to kill it.

357
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,301
Can you give me more time?

358
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:20,222
I'm afraid they will be shocked if I'm not careful.

359
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:23,079
Sure, I understand.

360
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,667
But please don't take too long, or my dad will yell at me.

Hey! How did you get here?

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,456
What is happening?

364
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:54,896
We overheard Khru Prince say that little Gong is about to be slaughtered.

Oh, really? Is it time?

366
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,983
Hearing that makes me hungry...

367
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,542
Hungry for some water. Why is there no water here?
(T/N: The word 'hungry' in Thai is used for both food and water)

368
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,341
So... why did you bring it here?

369
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:19,210
We wanted to hide him here. We heard that

370
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,780
people don't like to come here.

371
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,054
Khru Prince said he wouldn't come here if not necessary because Dr. Fah has bad behavior.

372
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:34,025
What? Did Khru Prince say that? Why did he say that?

373
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:36,028
Children. Where are you guys?

374

Hey, Khun. What are you doing here?

Where is Little Gong?

Gong? Do you mean the pig?

378
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,153
This is a health clinic. How can there be any pigs here?

379
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:13,657
Yes? Then what is it under the tablecloth?

Hey, Little Gong! When did you get here?

381
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:31,410
He must have flown here.

Please, Khru? He's so adorable.

Children, let me ask you something. What do you study for?

387
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:53,733
It's our duty. When we grow up, we can lighten our parents' burdens.

388
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:57,060
I want to study well so I can help my parents make money.

See? We all have our duties.

Little Gong has his duty, too.

391

The Village Headman raised Little Gong

392
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,770
so that one day he can be our food.

393

Aren't you going to let Little Gong

394

fulfill his duty?

423

that if P'Fah went over there, he would be able to spend more time alone?

492
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:08,376
Of course.

493
00:39:08,977 --> 00:39:13,333
You brought me here this evening. Don't you remember?

494
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:15,675
Really?

495
00:39:16,684 --> 00:39:18,660
I don't remember.

496
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,446
So… Did you just talk to your lover?

497
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,009
Why do you want to know?

498
00:39:27,009 --> 00:39:29,083
Are you hitting on me?

499
00:39:30,157 --> 00:39:31,957
That's not it.

500
00:39:31,957 --> 00:39:36,610
You talk to someone so sweetly every night.

501
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,733
I'm just curious.

502
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,619
For someone who fainted, you sure talk back well.

503
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,950
I guess you're feeling better.

504
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,348
Of course.

505
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,552
I ate Loong Phang's roasted pork,

506
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:54,712
therefore I'm completely healed.

507
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:56,478
That's good.

508
00:39:56,478 --> 00:40:00,084
Loong Phang said he'll quit drinking,

509
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:02,687
and you're fully recovered.

510
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:08,028
That means everyone in the village is healthy now.

511
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:12,783
Not yet. There's still one person left.

512
00:40:12,783 --> 00:40:14,383
Who?

513
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:22,768
Right here.

514
00:40:31,158 --> 00:40:33,124
Did you mean me?

515
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,242
Yes, of course.

516
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,230
You're taking care of everyone, but please try to take care of yourself too.

517
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:46,350
How will you convince the villagers to take care of themselves

518
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,154
if all you do is drink

519
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,371
and don't eat when you work.

520
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,774
I get it now.

521
00:40:57,774 --> 00:40:59,675
I will take care of myself, okay?

522
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,602
All right. Please excuse me now.

523
00:41:06,915 --> 00:41:11,110
Thanks for taking care of me when I passed out.

524
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,200
And I want to thank you as well...

525
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,190
for helping me do the check-ups the other day.

526
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:25,808
Hey! Hold on, Khun.

527
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,770
Well...

528
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,887
I saw that you had designer-brand cologne in your room.

529
00:41:37,887 --> 00:41:40,461
Is it yours?

530
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:43,460
What? You saw that?

531
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,731
Why?

532
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:47,229
Are you afraid people will know you're rich?

533
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:49,329
It's the opposite.

534
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:51,912
It's a fake one from a market.

535
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:53,840
It was only 300 baht.

536
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,106
I'm not supporting counterfeit products, but the merchant was very persistent.

537
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:01,568
Please excuse me, Khun.

538
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,980
I almost got found out.

539
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:54,160
When we find something that makes us feel at ease, we want to keep it for a long time.

540
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,445
[Next Episode]
The villagers say Dr. Fah and Khru Prince are dating.

541
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,428
The villagers are saying you're dating Khru Prince, is that true?

542
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:04,798
What?

543
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:06,939
If I really like Khru,

544
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:09,039
will you be mad at me?

545
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,904
I wish the pain…

546
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:16,415
Turns into butterflies and flies away.

547
