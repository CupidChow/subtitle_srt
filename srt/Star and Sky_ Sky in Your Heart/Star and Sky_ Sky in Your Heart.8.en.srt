You all did so well today.

166
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,513
I'm sure the real event will be just spectacular.

167
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:17,763
You all did well today.

168
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:21,083
Everyone can go home and rest now.

169
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:36,796
Prince, Dear.

170
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:39,104
Actually, since I'm here to get a medical check-up today,

171
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:41,779
you should get one, too.

172
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,903
That's all right. I'll get it some other time.

173
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,501
I don't think there's a problem.

174
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,201
Of course.

175
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:20,001
Coming to the hospital reminds me of Dr. Fah, doesn't it?

176
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,848
Do you still keep in touch with Dr. Fah?

177
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,219
No, I don't.

178
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,336
Why not?

179
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:32,297
I got his number from the Village Headman, but I can't reach him no matter how many times I've called.

180
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,709
He probably changed it.

181
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,060
Do you want me to help find Dr. Fah's phone number?

182
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,574
I'm sure he wants to reach out to you as well.

183
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:45,429
If he did, he would have called long ago.

184
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,968
Maybe he doesn't have your number, either.

185
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:54,128
If he called the Village Headman he would have gotten it right away.

186
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,532
Never mind him.

187
00:13:55,532 --> 00:14:00,410
He's probably so busy with work that he's forgotten me already.

188
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,490
Let's go, the elevator is here.

189

Fah.

190
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,553
There's a letter for you.

191
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:12,917
The credit card company?

192
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,755
I think I just paid them.

193
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:20,332
No. Look. It says here that it was sent from the mountain.

194
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:21,832
Really?

195
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:35,186
They've invited me to the ceremony for the donations of medical supplies.

196
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,560
Wait.

197
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,575
Why would they invite you?

198
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:43,418
Because I was the one who filed the request for the supplies.

199
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:47,874
Do you know how hard it is to make the request?

200
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:51,469
What a good heart you have.

201
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,117
Are you going?

202
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,377
I don't think I can.

203
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,596
I have work to do here.

204
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,001
Yes?

205
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:10,291
It's not because you don't have the guts to see the teacher up there?

206
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,991
Hold on. How did you know about this?

207
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:18,505
P'JJ and P'Mesa told me everything.

208
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:20,834
I think you should go.

209
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:24,273
At least you will get to say a proper goodbye.

210
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:26,504
Otherwise, you'll have unfinished matters.

- Hello.

212

I didn't think I would get to see you again this soon.

213
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,503
It's my day off, so I thought I should visit.

214
00:16:58,503 --> 00:16:59,803
Sure.

215
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,885
Khun, I brought some vitamin C for the chil—

216

Oh.

217
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,984
Khru Prince went to the restroom.

218
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,503
And what are you guys drawing?

219
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:42,556
Khru Prince told us to draw whatever we liked.

220
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:48,126
Viah, do you have some paper and colored pencils for me?

221
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:51,310
- I do.
- May I borrow them?

222

223
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,785
We are done.

224
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,702
If you're finished, hand it to me.

225

This is my assignment, Khru.

What are you doing?

227
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:31,094
I'm handing in the assignment you gave,

228
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:33,591
to draw whatever I like.

Why are you here alone?

Didn't Khru Prince come up with you?

233
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:24,962
I wanted return him the tote bag he forgot.

234
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:27,718
After we both went home, we never contacted each other.

235
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:32,093
Why? Did you fight?

236
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:36,021
Not exactly.

237
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:40,988
I think there is someone who can take better care of him than I can.

238
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,419
Gosh!

239
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,276
What? Are you giving up already?

240
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,230
I've thought it through, Yayah.

Do you know what?

242
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:57,159
Nong Pangam was going to make a more beautiful and bigger bag for Khru Prince.

243
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,020
But he didn't want it. Do you know why?

244
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,767
His reason was simple.

245
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,187
He said he just liked this embroidery.

246
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,337
Life is that simple.

247
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:15,958
Sometimes, you don't need reasons to like something.

248
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,640
But… I think it's too late, Yayah.

249
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:28,126
He probably has a new tote bag now.

I have time for Prince when he needs it.

Even so,

he doesn't seem happy.

00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:26,320
- Really?
- Yes.

331
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,665
So many coincidences in this world.

332
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:36,508
Your friend doesn't happen to be named Prince, right?

333
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:42,359
How did you know that?

334
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,677
Wait a minute.

335
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:49,991
Does your friend Prince have the last name of the northern monarch?

336
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,757
Bullseye!

337
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,475
That's correct, Phi!

338
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,045
How did you know that?

339
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:58,056
For real?

340
00:28:58,056 --> 00:29:00,501
Is this world really that small?

341
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:02,475
It's not just small, Fah.

342
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:04,716
Prince is also my and Kluen's friend.

343
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:05,741
What?

344
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:07,571
Wait, let's not get into that.

345
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:10,495
Ai Prince isn't in Germany right now.

346
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,893
He's a drum major right now at his university.

347
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:14,593
That's right, Fah.

348
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,515
Then, let me excuse myself.

349
00:29:18,515 --> 00:29:21,222
- What?
- Wait...

350
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:23,434
Is the world so small?

351
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:24,571
Keep going, Fah!

352
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:26,569
Find him!

353
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:28,681
Fighting!

354
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:33,104
That's why I am right here.

355
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:38,941
So… why do you want to see me?

356
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:42,137
I got something for you.

357
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:51,465
I chose the pink stone that brings good luck in love

358
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:55,009
so our love will go smoothly.

359
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:58,454
Aw!

360
00:29:58,454 --> 00:30:00,354
Let me put it on for you.

361
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:35,878
Will you be my boyfriend?

362
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:39,278
Say yes, say yes, say yes...

363
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,988
What are you even saying?

364
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,113
What do you say?

365
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:56,840
Yes! Yes! Yes!

366
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,540
Yes.

367
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:14,365
Don't leave me again.

368
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:20,579
Even if someone chases me away, I won't leave.

369
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:46,800
What are you doing?

370
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:50,582
Why? Because we're in public?

371
00:31:50,582 --> 00:31:52,799
Do you think I care?

372
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,740
Let's go.

373
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:20,708
Hello.

374
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,129
I didn't think we would meet again so soon for another round.

375

Did you know?

409
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:58,741
I used to be so afraid to climb the Himalayas.

410
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,143
The Himalayas?

411
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:06,618
It's a metaphor.

412
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,693
I compare the Himalayas to life achievement.

413
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:20,127
I used to dream of climbing the Himalayas with someone.

414
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:24,683
After my ex and I broke up,

415
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,485
I've been so afraid to climb it.

416
