Ai Fah, you're dating Khru Prince, aren't you?

2
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:04,732
If Khru Prince and I really became lovers,

00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:05,710
what would you say?

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:10,405
Marriage should be built on love. That way, they can live a long and happy married life.

5
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:13,160
I guess being at a wedding just triggered his misery.

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,592
Is it wrong to focus so much on building a life that I didn't have time for her?

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,603
Hey. We're done.

168
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:34,180
It wasn't that hard.

169
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,005
It wasn't,

170
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:39,427
compared to these five necklaces you ruined.

171
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:43,978
Come on. I'm a beginner.

172
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:47,348
This is great enough.

173
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:55,730
By the way, can you try it on for me?

174
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,054
My brother and you are around the same size.

175
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:25,288
So?

176
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:26,846
Do you like it?

177
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,131
I do.

178
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:38,100
Thank you so much.

179
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:51,427
We're all set, right?

180
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:55,525
Then I'll be out of your hair.

181
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,552
Hold on.

182
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:02,870
We're not done.

183
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:07,607
Why not?

184
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:11,879
Aren't we done already? What is there left to do?

185
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,963
There is one step left.

186
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,703
You have to let the stone bathe in the moonlight.

187
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,690
The locals believe that moon bathing it for an hour

188
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,320
will increase its charm power.

189
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,969
What are you laughing at?

190
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:56,016
I'm laughing at myself.

191
00:13:56,016 --> 00:14:01,901
I have never been so serious about making someone a gift like this.

192
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:06,051
Come on. I heard you dated lots of girls.

193
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:08,468
How have you never done this before?

194
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:12,030
When I had a girlfriend,

195
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,810
all I did was study and work.

196
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,885
Since we broke up, I've never gotten into a serious relationship.

197
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:23,643
It was all casual.

198
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:26,522
Did that help you forget?

199
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:31,260
If it did, do you think I would be here?

200
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:34,022
You have a point.

201
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:40,105
What about your story?

202
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:45,368
You always ask about mine. You never tell yours.

203
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:48,220
What do you want to know?

204
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,020
Well…

205
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,634
About your love life.

206
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:54,597
Like… your ex.

207
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:56,629
Let me guess.

208
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,397
You're a man with lots of experience.

209
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:02,039
That's how you know so much about love.

210
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,780
Haven't you heard

211
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,110
that we're always experts in other people's businesses?

212
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,692
I wouldn't be here if I were that good.

213
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,967
It's raining. We should find shelter in the school.

214
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,767
Sure, let's go.

Since it's pouring like this,

217
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:35,507
I don't think it will stop until the morning.

218
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:38,165
We can't bathe the stone in the moonlight now.

219
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,580
I'll just buy my brother something.

220
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,787
I need to leave tomorrow.

225

Hey!

226
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,400
What are you two doing?

227
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,826
I asked him to help me with my brother's present.

228
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,576
You guys were making it all night?

229
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,650
It was pouring last night. We couldn't leave the school.

230
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,050
Are we living on the same mountain here?

231
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,220
When did it rain?

232
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,819
I was dead to the world. I didn't know that.

233
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,319
Whatever.

234
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,949
I'll just leave.

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:29,286
I have to get ready to leave.

236
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:30,680
I'll go now, Khun.

237
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,683
Okay, then. See you later.

238
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:39,175
Wait!

239
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,287
What?

Bring me lots of snacks.

Wait.

245
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,529
Get home safe.

246
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:33,840
Gosh, it took you so long, Loong.

247
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,750
Oh! Khun!

248
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,140
I've brought you a food box,

249
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,074
in case you're hungry on the way down.

250
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:47,721
Is this from the Village Headman?

251
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:50,292
No. I made it.

252
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:53,839
Omelet and Rice that you've been wanting to eat.

253
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:57,143
Are you…

254
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,740
hitting on me?

255
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,947
What are you talking about? If you don't want it, give it back.

256
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,107
I do!

257
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,748
Thank you.

258
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,963
So when are you coming back?

259
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:18,383
I'll be back on Monday. I'll be gone for two days and will be back soon.

260
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:20,190
Are you sure?

261
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,190
Are you planning to run off and party?

262
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,349
I won't do that.

263
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:29,658
I promise that I'll be a good boy down there.

264

And?

265
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:36,332
And… And I'll behave.

266
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:39,982
I was just going to say...

267
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:41,915
And why are you telling me this?

268
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,128
We're not lovers.

269
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,569
How are we not?

270
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:53,326
Well, last night, we even slept together.

271
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,294
What are you saying?

272
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,640
I'll kick you!

273
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,970
Do it. The children here will know

274

how wicked their teacher is.

275
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,536
- I really will kick you.
- Go on.

276
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:08,644
Do it.

277
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:10,244
Ahem.

278
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:14,980
Oh, Loong. When did you get here?

279
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,744
I got here a while ago. I just didn't want to interrupt.

280
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:21,744
Being young is so nice.

281
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,488
Come on, get in.

282
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:30,536
He must be drunk. He's saying weird things.

283
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:33,830
Say no more. Get in already.

284
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,665
Bye bye.

285
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:41,074
- Bye bye.
- Just go.

286
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,343
- Really?
- Go.

287
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:43,675
- I'm going.
- Yes...

288
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,129
- I'm really going.
- Yes.

289
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:47,312
Bye bye.

290
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,912
Go already.

291
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,965
Goodbye.

292
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,538
Get home safely, Children.

293
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,813
Hey, Prince.

294
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,388
Are you all right?

295
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:17,825
I'm fine.

296
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:21,528
But you look pale. Do you have a fever?

297
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:23,128
Excuse me.

298
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:26,607
Prince, you're burning up.

299
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:29,596
Why didn't you tell me? Why did you come to work?

300
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:32,540
I'm okay. It must be because I got wet from the rain last night.

301
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,982
I should be fine after taking medicines.

302
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:37,139
I think I should take you home.

303
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,958
That's okay, Khun Mesa. I can take Nong Prince home.

304
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,455
- Come on, Prince.
- That's fine. I'll do it.

305
00:21:42,455 --> 00:21:44,624
Don't you get it? I said I will take him home.

306
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,517
What do you mean? I said I was going to send him home.

307
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:47,778
I have a car right here. Do you have one?

308
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,580
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

309
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,680
- Do you have a problem?
- Bring it on.

310
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,480
Is that how you want it? I said I'll take him home!

311
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,865
Hey!

312
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:59,296
- It's your fault! Hey, Prince?
- I told you I'd take him home.

313
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:01,217
- Prince, are you okay?
- Prince.

314
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:02,701
- You, move.
- You, let him go.

315
00:22:02,701 --> 00:22:03,803
You, let him go. I'll get him home.

316
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,166
Don't give me that crap!

317
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,157
What's your problem here?

318
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:09,813
- I'll take him home!
- I will!

319
00:22:14,494 --> 00:22:16,094
Khru Prince.

320
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:20,126
Get up slowly.

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,600
Sip some warm water so you can feel better.

322
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:32,928
Thank you.

323
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:35,301
I will continue to rest.

324
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:37,734
- I should feel better soon.
- I can't do that.

325
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,993
What if your fever gets worse?

326
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:44,716
I and my two henchmen will take care of you.

327
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:58,507
Can I borrow your phone?

328
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,824
Why did you bring three phones?

329
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:06,892
Well, choose one.

330
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:30,662
- Yes?
- Hi, Boss.

We have news for you.

00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:38,293
In short, Khru Prince is sick. Ai Aou took over and is nursing him in our place.

333
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,852
What? Don't let him.

334
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,294
Quickly interfere this instance.

335
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:43,793
What do you want us to do?

336
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:47,193
Well, bring him some congee or any kind of warm food.

337
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:51,516
Don't let him be alone with Ai Aou. Got it?

338
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,642
Y-Yes.

339
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:58,473
But why do you sound more irritated than us?

340
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm angry on behalf of Ai Mesa.

341
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,325
Okay, just hurry and do what I said.

342
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:06,457
Okay, then.

343
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:08,529
Angry for me, right?

344
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:23,315
Why are you annoyed?

345
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,354
Who's annoyed?

346
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:27,754
You are.

347
00:24:27,754 --> 00:24:30,838
I'm not. You're wrong.

348
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,227
Do you want to look in a mirror?

349
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,739
We're ready, P'Fah.

350
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:46,489
If you're done eating, we can head out.

351
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:48,189
To where?

352
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:53,702
You said we must buy you drinks when you're back in Bangkok.

353
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:58,293
You said you missed the nightlife and girls.

354
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:02,497
Really? I said that?

355
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:03,504
You did.

356
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:08,472
I reserved the table. I guarantee it has the best view.

357
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,900
I don't think I can go.

358
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,210
I feel like I have an upset stomach.

359
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,128
Come on, Ai Fah.

360
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:24,764
Kluen asked a favor from the club owner to get that VIP table.

361
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:25,956
Let's go, Fah.

362
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:28,196
It might lift your mood.

363
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:29,690
Please.

364
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,894
Khru Prince, I've brought you some warm rice porridge.

365
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:45,003
Hey. Someone got here first.

366
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:47,293
Sorry.

367
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:51,840
And thank you both for your concern.

368
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,356
How are you doing? Feeling better?

369
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:56,611
I've taken some medicines. I'm much better now.

370
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,216
I'm about to have dinner.

371
00:25:58,216 --> 00:26:02,641
That's right. I think you should quickly eat before it gets cold.

372
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:06,439
I also made you ginseng soup for your health.

373
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,167
Let me walk you out

374
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,671
so Khru Prince can eat comfortably.

375
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:15,273
We have so much food here. He can't finish all by himself.

376
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,177
That's right. You've brought a lot.

377
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:21,703
These are for us too, right? Thank you. How kind. Let me try some.

378
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:23,873
Oh, he's even hitting my hand...

379
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,376
These are for Khru Prince.

380
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:29,049
But I really can't finish them all, P'Aou.

381
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,113
See?

382
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:32,394
- Let's eat together.
- Right?

383
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:35,328
How generous. Thank you so much.

384
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:42,273
It would be nice if someone here was as generous as Khru Prince.

385
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:48,947
To P'Kuafah. Cheers.

386
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:59,692
Excuse me. Can I clink glasses with you?

387
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:01,411
No, I'd rather not.

388
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,486
I just love my boyfriend so much.

389
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:07,764
What are you doing? This is embarrassing.

390
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:09,964
But this guy is single.

391
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,841
Go ahead and make yourself comfortable.

392
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:18,009
You look familiar.

393
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:19,868
Do you come here a lot?

394
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:23,570
Hey, Kuafah. I haven't seen you in a while.

395
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,697
Oh, Fah.

396
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,800
Are you interested in coming to my place tonight?

397
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,653
No, I'll pass.

398
00:27:39,653 --> 00:27:42,194
I'm going to use the bathroom.

399
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:00,057
Why is there so much temptation here?

400
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,586
Kuafah, focus.

401
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:06,546
You gave him a promise.

402
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:19,011
I saw that, Fah.

403
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:22,795
Kitty. You saw what?

404
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:25,928
I saw Kuafah who changed.

405
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:30,390
You didn't flirt with anyone. You didn't drink with anyone.

406
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,605
It's like you're in a relationship.

407
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:36,253
I'm not.

408
00:28:41,028 --> 00:28:43,093
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

409
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:52,715
- Hi. What's up?
- Hey, hey, hey.

410
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,597
The situation is dire here.

411
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:58,894
We tried to block Ai Aou by having dinner with Khru Prince,

412
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,856
but he kicked us out after dinner.

413
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:05,785
He even said he'd spend the night at Khru Prince's place.

414
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,614
How could you guys let that happen?

415
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:09,433
Who said we did? We didn't,

416
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:12,267
but his men didn't let us in either.

417
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:15,570
And Khru Prince agrees to spend the night with him?

418
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,878
You know, Khru Prince has high respect for the Village Headman.

419
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:20,402
He wouldn't be able to decline the offer upfront.

420
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:23,904
Shit! We have to go now. His men are watching us.

421
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:27,154
Huh? Wait! Wait! Ai Mesa! Ai Mesa—

422
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:33,218
Ai Aou!

423
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,900
Got you. You must have called to report to your lover, didn't you?

424
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:47,833
I told you I'm single.

425
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,359
That's right.

426
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,214
Because Kuafah's motto is, "Never get serious with anyone."

427
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:56,796
Do you still live by that?

428
00:29:56,796 --> 00:30:01,284
Or maybe someone up on the mountain has changed you.

429
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:08,166
No one can change Kuafah.

430
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,413
Prove it then.

431
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:19,994
Sure.

432
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:23,801
Now that's the Kuafah I know.

433
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:35,082
Thank you all for your concern,

434
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:36,561
but I'm fine now.

435
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:38,003
Don't mind it, Khru Prince.

436
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,095
My men and I can guard your door.

437
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,793
That's okay.

438
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:46,408
It's late. You all should go home.

439
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:49,947
All right then. Please take care of yourself.

440
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:55,930
It's good he managed to decline the offer.

441
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:01,688
We should leave, too.

442
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:02,943
Bye.

443
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:04,687
Thank you.

444
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,032
Ai Mesa doesn't mind.

445
00:31:30,032 --> 00:31:32,633
He has three phones.

446
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:37,536
Okay. I have to go, Dao.

447
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:44,679
Hey, Khun.

448
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,509
It's too quiet here.

449
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:25,694
[Kuafah]

450
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:36,121
Hello.

451
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,043
Are you the one Kuafah met on the mountain?

452
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm Kitty, his girlfriend.

453
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,578
I see he's especially close to you,

454
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:50,060
so I called to let you know he's doing fine,

455
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,685
and he should be busy with me all night.

456
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:56,237
Don't call unless there's something necessary.

457
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:58,155
Goodnight.

458
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:06,583
Seriously, why did you bring three phones?

459
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:12,621
Khru Prince, is something wrong?

460
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,221
It's nothing.

461
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,809
Khun Kuafah's girlfriend just called.

462
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,698
Girlfriend? Kuafah doesn't have a girlfriend.

463
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:28,492
Someone like him must have girlfriends everywhere. You two just don't know about it.

464
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:34,072
Well, please excuse me.

465
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,196
Do you feel it, too?

466
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:48,853
I think Khru Prince is jealous.

467
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:50,859
That's possible.

468
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:53,230
Let's discuss this later. Let's go.

469
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,223
Dao.

470
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:24,133
Does he usually get this wasted?

471
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:28,543
No. This is unusual today.

472
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,100
How?

473
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,914
He normally drinks for the occasion

474
00:34:34,914 --> 00:34:36,827
and brings girls over.

475
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:42,256
But tonight, he only drank. He didn't bring any girl home.

476
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:48,487
By the way, when you went to get the car,

477
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,874
something weird happened.

478
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:52,642
How so?

479
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:56,154
I was carrying him at that time,

480
00:34:56,154 --> 00:34:58,707
and there was this girl.

481
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,628
She's the one P'Fah drank with.

482
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,628
She randomly asked him to go over to her place,

483
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:06,687
but P'Fah insisted on not going.

484
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,343
He wanted to come home with us.

485
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:15,189
It's like he became someone different after coming back from the mountain.

486
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:18,408
He must have met someone good there.

487
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,138
Yes?

488
00:35:48,138 --> 00:35:51,737
Ai Fah, you asshole. What did you do last night?

489
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:54,145
What?

490
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:56,390
Some girl suddenly called my number,

491
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,310
and do you know what's fucked up?

492
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,234
Khru Prince took the call.

493
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:02,544
It seems that girl claimed to be your girlfriend.

494
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:05,050
JJ and I tried to correct it.

495
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:10,824
Why do you keep staring at your phone? Are you expecting a call?

496
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,722
It's nothing.

497
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:14,343
Are you okay?

498
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:20,383
Are you the one Kuafah met on the mountain?

499
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:23,384
I'm Kitty, his girlfriend.

500
00:36:23,384 --> 00:36:24,879
Shit.

501
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:29,163
She must have used my phone when I was in the bathroom.

502
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:31,283
Are you with Khru Prince?

503
00:36:31,283 --> 00:36:32,466
Let me talk to him.

504
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:34,442
Why do you need to talk to him?

505
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:39,163
I don't want him to think I have a girlfriend.

506
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,843
Let me be frank here.

507
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:44,912
Do you like Khru Prince?

508
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,240
It's not that. It's just...

509
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,514
How long have we been friends?

510
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:52,550
Why wouldn't I be able to tell if you like someone?

511
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:59,033
I don't know if I like him.

512
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:02,906
I'm just happy to see him smile.

513
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,071
That isn't a necklace.

514
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:11,618
And I like to spend time with him.

515
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:16,753
Ai Mesa, I'm sorry.

516
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:18,847
Why are you apologizing?

517
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:23,046
Because I know you like him.

518
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:25,521
I shouldn't do this.

519
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:29,964
Honestly, I did like him at first,

520
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:36,360
but after a while, I realized I might just admire him.

521
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:38,612
So you've been playing me?

522
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:41,000
I noticed a while ago that you like him,

523
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,851
but I kept asking so you can realize your own feelings, that you like him.

524
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:50,314
It's good you finally realized it. Congratulations, my friend.

525
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:53,283
Yes. Thank yo so much.

526
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:56,643
But it would be better if you could help me set my record straight.

527
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:59,174
Why would I? It's your problem. You solve it.

528
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:01,116
Bye now. No more talking. I have a class to teach.

529
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,369
What? Ai Mesa, hold on.

530
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,472
Is he really on my side?

531
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:20,291
And I spilled half of my popcorn.

532
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:23,500
People were all staring at me.

533
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:27,231
Fah?

534
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:29,423
Fah, are you listening?

535
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:31,696
I am.

536
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:33,743
Where were we?

537
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,387
So you were stuck in the elevator and then what?

538
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:38,759
I spilled popcorn. I didn't get stuck in the elevator.

539
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:41,211
Are you really listening?

540
00:38:42,673 --> 00:38:44,730
Are you okay?

541
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:49,478
I'm fine. It's nothing.

542
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:52,221
Will you tell me, or do I need to pester you?

543
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:58,976
Dao.

544
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:05,930
Let's say one of your friends is having a fight with his lover.

545
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,108
Wait. Not lover.

546
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:09,923
He's having a fight with someone he's talking to.

547
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:15,032
He needs to make it up to that person, so he can't attend your birthday party.

548
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:17,048
Will you be mad at him?

549
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:22,652
Well... is the person he's talking to mad?

550
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,423
Yes, quite a bit.

551
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:27,745
And is my friend worried?

552
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:31,766
He is. He's very worried.

553
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:35,476
Then you should go, Fah.

554
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:37,980
Book a flight and go now.

555
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,784
But the friend…

556
00:39:39,784 --> 00:39:41,399
Wait a minute.

557
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:44,495
Why did you say it was me?

558
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:46,866
I was mentioning your friend.

559
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:53,555
You don't have to hypothesize. It's obviously about you.

560
00:39:56,952 --> 00:40:02,113
Will you be okay if I go?

561
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:04,909
I won't be at your birthday party.

562
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:08,727
I usually attend your birthday party every year.

563
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:10,327
That's right.

564
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:13,896
I'm not okay.

565
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,440
I brought you some food.

566
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:30,180
Actually, you don't need to attend the meeting today.

567
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,460
I will inform my dad about that.

568
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,868
That's all right. I'm feeling better now.

569
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:37,052
But I think we should…

570
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:38,954
No, I insist.

571
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:41,568
Please excuse me, I need to change my clothes.

572
00:40:41,568 --> 00:40:44,471
- Thank you so much, P'Aou.
- Sure.

573
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,972
I'm truly feeling better, P'Aou.

574
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:08,953
You.

575
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:11,333
Will you be okay if I go?

576
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,290
I'm not okay.

577
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,587
I'm not okay because you only care about me.

578
00:41:18,587 --> 00:41:21,719
You don't care about your own feelings.

579
00:41:22,544 --> 00:41:25,172
I'm worried about you.

580
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:29,320
My birthday party happens every year.

581
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,982
But if you let the one slip through your fingers,

582
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:35,112
you might never have another chance.

583
00:41:35,112 --> 00:41:40,188
I will be so happy if you can climb the Himalayas again.

584
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:44,693
- You remember that story?
- Yes.

585
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:48,597
You compare your life achievement to climbing the Himalayas.

586
00:41:48,597 --> 00:41:53,369
You want to take someone up there and share the view with you.

587
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:58,263
But after your heartbreak, you never mentioned any mountain again.

588
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:03,303
If that person can inspire you to climb again,

589
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,243
don't let the person go.

590
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:16,611
I'm back.

591
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:31,904
This is the first time in my life that I've been so concerned about someone.

592
00:42:31,904 --> 00:42:33,895
But it's all right.

593
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,785
[Next Week]
If you upset someone but don't apologize,

594
00:42:44,785 --> 00:42:47,590
you will grow up to be a bad adult.

595
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,634
Are you speaking of me?

596
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:50,318
You come when you feel like it.

597
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,750
The next minute, you go with someone else.

598
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,372
You refuse to express your feelings.

599
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:57,043
It's not always simple to speak up.

600
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:59,803
It's not always simple to wait either.

601
00:42:59,803 --> 00:43:04,703
From this moment on, may I pursue you?

602
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,240
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

603
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,210
♫ Even in your dreams every night ♫

604
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:20,420
♫ Love is still waiting for you to come and change your dreams ♫

605
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,070
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

606
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:28,250
♫ If you're the sea, I'll be like the sand ♫

607
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:34,480
♫ If you're the sky, please let me be the North Star ♫

608
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,700
♫ To guide your heart ♫

609
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:44,830
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫
