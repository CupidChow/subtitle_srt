I will be so happy if you can climb the Himalayas again.

Sompor, do you have anything to say to Viah?

I'm sorry, Viah.

I'm not wrong. Why should I say sorry?

36
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:24,265
Viah, I heard the story from Sompor.

37

She said you broke your word.

38

At first, you said you would buy her a birthday gift.

But you bought gifts for other girls, too. Is that right?

I didn't mean it that way.

00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:15,022
I just don't want you to be jealous over nonsense.

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,368
Hey. Khun!

167
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,630
[Ban Khun Om Haet Nok School]

168
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:41,300
P'Mesa, did you forget something?

169
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,609
No. I came to talk to you.

170
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:49,149
I heard you guys had a fight.

171
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:53,437
Yes. It's quite bad.

172
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,897
That's what I heard.

173
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:01,097
If you want my help, feel free to ask.

174
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:04,536
Are you sure?

175
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:07,519
Of course. I know both parties.

176
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,894
I don't want you guys to avoid each other.

177
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,569
I'd like to ask you one thing then.

178
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:27,029
Can you please hand this letter to the Village Headman for me?

179
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,086
Oh, wow. You wanted to write a letter to my friend so much—

180
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,991
Wait. The Village Headman?

181
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:40,125
That's right. I wrote a letter asking permission to organize a sports day event in the village.

182
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,583
A sports day?

183
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,834
Because of the fight between Viah and Sompor,

184
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:50,477
I got the idea to amend their relationship.

185
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:55,057
Then the fight you mentioned...

186
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:59,482
- It's between Viah and Sompor.
- Viah and Sompor?

187
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:00,982
Yes.

188
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:04,021
So is this the letter for the Village Headman?

189
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:05,884
Yes.

190
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,510
Got it.

191
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,080
I understand.

192
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:16,382
So Khru Prince is only concerned about the children fighting.

193
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:19,210
He doesn't even care about you at all.

194
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,438
Yes, damn it. I'm so pissed.

195
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:25,467
How do I patch things up with him?

196
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:26,806
I already faked my sickness.

197
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:30,049
How about you fake your death this time?

198
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,272
Maybe he'll forgive you.

199
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,475
Oh, yes. That's a smart idea.

200
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,500
Fah!

201
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,821
All right then.

202
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,524
How on earth did you come up with that?

203
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:44,046
One more scoop, please.

204
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:48,734
I think you should help him with the sports day thing.

205
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,593
That way you can be close to him.

206
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,277
That's right. Good idea.

207
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:56,246
Show him your hard work. He might come around.

208
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:57,746
That's right.

209
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,971
All right, I'll give it a try.

210
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:03,832
Thank you guys so much. Here is your reward.

211
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,421
The children should be so proud to have such a caring teacher.

212
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:16,384
No. You're the one who cares about them.

213
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:18,270
You've brought them lots of snacks.

214
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,417
They should be so happy.

215
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,820
I'm happy, too, to see you smile.

216
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:29,069
I mean I'm happy to see the children smile.

217
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:42,385
Excuse me. You've got the paint there.

218
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:52,397
Okay.

219
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:58,064
Hey, Dr. Fah.

220
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:01,145
Are you here to help?

221
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:03,729
Yes.

222
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,609
But I see you have enough people helping.

223
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:10,605
- You probably don't need me.
- It's not enough.

224
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,938
There's a lot left to do. Please come.

225
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:20,234
Here.

226
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:21,862
Sure.

227
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:24,823
Where should I paint?

228
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:27,479
That's not for painting. Please clean it for me.

229
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,895
I will change the colors to paint.

230
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,750
Let's not bother him.

231
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,650
He's a doctor.

232
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,444
He has to take care of many people.

233
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:41,894
I can do it.

234
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:44,933
Unless someone doesn't want me to.

235
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:47,350
Everyone wants your help.

236
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,624
There's a lot left to do. Please help.

237
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:52,523
Sure.

238
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:55,074
Thanks for having me.

239
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:01,347
Everyone has a piece of paper with the team color on it.

240
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:05,154
According to the lucky draw, there will be the blue and the white team.

241
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,910
Open it and see.

242
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:23,057
You can split into your teams and practice for the competition.

243
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,680
Hold on.

244
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,209
The children said they wanted you to compete, too.

245
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,810
- Would that be okay?
- Of course.

246
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,682
I will join, too. The more the merrier.

247
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:38,399
- Is that right?
- Right.

248
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,142
See?

249
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,580
That's good.

250
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,949
Ai JJ and I will also compete then.

251
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,697
You didn't even ask me.

252
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:51,082
Come on. Just help me.

253
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,614
All right then.

254
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,286
We have some papers left.

255
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:06,986
Please draw one.

256
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,870
Which color are you?

257
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,067
Blue. You?

258
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,616
I got blue, too.

259
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:23,389
We're on the same team.

260
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:26,469
Can I call it destiny?

261
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:30,975
This is not a very good start at all.

262
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:38,946
The sports day will be held next week, right?

263
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:42,005
It sounds really fun.

264
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:46,217
That's right. The children were so excited today.

265
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:49,134
But we're not on the same team.

266
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:50,834
What was that?

267
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:56,760
I mean... Viah and Sompor.

268
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,424
We want them to make up, but they are on different teams.

269
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:02,936
Who knows?

270
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:07,673
When two people compete, they might understand each other better.

271
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:10,822
I heard you guys are competing, too.

272
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:14,823
Dr. Fah's team will win for sure. Is that right?

273
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:18,369
Your body is fit and firm.

274
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,685
But Khru Prince won the soccer match against Dr. Fah.

275
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:24,566
So? There is no soccer game on the children's sports day.

276
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:27,160
I think Dr. Fah's team is going to win.

277
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,688
No, my team will.

278
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:32,828
Let's say the losing team must buy the winning team snacks. Deal?

279
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,894
Deal. I will even buy BBQ pork.

280
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:36,868
I think...

281
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:40,055
- This has gone a little too far.
- That's okay.

282
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,429
It's fun like this.

283
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:45,988
Can I join the BBQ pork party?

284
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,996
Now let's eat before the food gets cold. Eat first.

285
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,233
Eat first.

286
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,138
How is Fah doing?

287
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:13,140
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

288
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:17,200
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

289
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:22,395
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

290
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:26,791
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

291
00:20:27,814 --> 00:20:32,142
Happy birthday, my sunflower.

292
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:34,500
Thank you.

293
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,314
Make a wish.

294
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,586
It smells so nice.

295
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,615
Did you make it?

296
00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:03,561
It's Vanilla scent.

297
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,361
Do you like it?

298
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,923
Get home safe, Khun.

299
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:32,986
Well, how about I walk you home?

300
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,260
That's fine.

301
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,160
I can manage.

302
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:14,702
I knew this would happen.

303
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,922
Come on. Let me walk you home.

304
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,336
Thank you.

305
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:31,406
What's wrong?

306
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:34,084
You let out such a big sigh.

307
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:37,121
Do you not want to talk with me that much?

308
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:38,955
It's not that.

309
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:41,786
I'm worried about the sports day.

310
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:43,189
Why?

311
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:49,798
Actually, I never want the competition to get this serious.

312
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,796
But look what P'Aou and Yayah are doing.

313
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,045
I get you.

314
00:22:57,045 --> 00:23:00,005
You just want it to be fun, right?

315
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,594
Then let's help each other make it fun.

316
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:12,861
Don't make the event very competitive. I will help you with that.

317
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:15,614
Thank you for understanding.

318
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,085
- Khru Prince, have you competed in a running race before?
- I haven't.

319
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,803
Never? I'll guide you.

320
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:33,144
There are four steps.

321
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:35,991
First, get on your mark. Stand behind this line.

322
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:39,307
Okay. Next is to get set.

323
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:43,186
You will bend your knee in a sitting position. That's right.

324
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,336
Your hand can't go beyond this line.

325
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,578
Put it right here.

326
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:49,490
Your left hand as well. That's right.

327
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,850
In the third step, raise your body like this.

328
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,782
Yes, that's right. And you can lower yourself a bit.

329
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,862
Then look ahead.

330
00:23:57,862 --> 00:23:59,801
Do it like this.

331
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:04,647
Khru Prince, what are you doing?

332
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:08,407
I'm making cheerleading pom-poms with the children.

333
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,174
- Can I help?
- Of course.

334
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:16,230
- This team, too. Okay.
- One, two. One, two.

335
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,310
- Try lifting.
- One, two.

336
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,050
Go! Go!

337
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:28,707
Am I doing it right?

338
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:31,516
Yes. Keep making it into small pieces.

339
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:37,137
Khru Prince.

340
00:24:38,848 --> 00:24:40,348
Here's some food.

341
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:41,970
Thank you.

342
00:24:45,988 --> 00:24:48,622
There's grilled pork, too. Thank you.

343
00:24:58,937 --> 00:25:00,820
Did you pull a prank?

344
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:11,311
Hey.

345
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:15,031
The Village Headman asked me to bring you these sports jerseys.

346
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,163
Are you home?

347
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,811
Hey, what are you doing in the dark?

348
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:41,802
Nature calls?

349
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:45,327
Are you crazy? I'm searching for something.

350
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:47,004
Searching?

351
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,309
At night?

352
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,609
Why didn't you look in the daytime?

353
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:56,209
I know you're afraid of the dark.

354
00:25:56,209 --> 00:25:59,769
I'm not. You've mistaken me with someone else.

355
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,509
- Boo!
- Hey!

356
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:05,100
What the heck are you playing?

357
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:09,601
What am I playing?

358
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:14,709
I just wanted to see the reaction of someone so tight-lipped.

359
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:18,934
So what are you looking for?

360
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,521
The hair clip Viah gave to Sompor.

361
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,998
The one Sompor threw away?

362
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:33,951
Why? Do you want Viah to give it to her again?

363
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:35,978
Yes.

364
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:39,069
I've been looking since earlier.

365
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,436
But I can't find it no matter what.

366
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,969
Okay then. I will help.

367
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:49,740
It's okay. I can do it myself.

368
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,913
Hey.

369
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:55,826
When people offer their help,

370
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:58,432
you should learn to take it.

371
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,569
There's no need to handle everything yourself.

372
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,469
Here.

373
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:04,498
I'll help you find it.

374
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:12,880
Do you think those two will finally talk?

375
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:18,797
You might not know this, but I can see it.

376
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:21,801
Those two like each other very much.

377
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:24,323
Yes?

378
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:28,965
No wonder Sompor is so angry.

379
00:27:28,965 --> 00:27:30,946
Of course.

380
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:33,709
And Viah is a tight-lipped one.

381
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,908
He refuses to apologize.

382
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:38,808
He refuses to say he likes her.

383
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,483
He does things halfway.

384
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,492
That's why Sompor gets angry.

385
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:46,549
Oh, come on.

386
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:51,114
It's not always simple to speak up.

387
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:06,715
It's not always simple to wait either.

388
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:17,816
Are you saying you used to wait...

389
00:28:17,816 --> 00:28:19,716
It's late.

390
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:21,540
We should go home.

391
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,148
We need to get up early tomorrow.

392
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:38,958
As the Village Headman has urgent business to tend to,
[BAN KHUN OM HAET NOK SCHOOL SPORTS DAY]

393
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:42,078
I'm here to commence the event on his behalf.

394
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:47,295
The event wouldn't have happened without Khru Prince's creativity

395
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:50,117
and the donation from me.

396
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:53,774
Ever since the first day we met...

397
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:58,601
Does he think this is the wedding of him and Khru Prince?

398
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,868
Wow! Nice speech! So nice!

399
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:04,266
The opening ceremony has ended. Give him a big hand, guys.

400
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:05,339
Thank you.

401
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:08,709
We're about to start the first game of the day.

402
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:11,152
You're with me, the hottest MC.

403
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:12,636
January, no!

404
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,071
February, no!

405
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:15,392
March, no!

406
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,144
But it's April (Mesa)!

407
00:29:19,144 --> 00:29:21,623
And me, an MC who is hotter than mountain chillis.

408
00:29:21,623 --> 00:29:24,052
Yayah!

409
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:25,465
Dr. Fah.

410
00:29:25,465 --> 00:29:28,117
Let's make today a fun day.

411
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:31,627
The only fun thing I expect...

412
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:34,823
is to see you buy everyone BBQ pork.

413
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:36,455
Let's go, everyone.

414
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,438
We're starting our first game here.

415
00:29:38,438 --> 00:29:39,947
This game is easy.

416
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:44,171
Two people will be carrying the one on top.

417
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:49,510
The one on top has a paper hat on and must steal the hat from the opponents.

418
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,837
Ai Fah, why are you in a daze?

419
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:53,349
Let's steal more hats.

420
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,548
- Did we lose?
- Yes.

421
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:58,010
Dr. Fah, why are you absent-minded?

422
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,489
Wow! They're going all in. No one wants to lose here.

423
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:03,998
Go! Go! Go!

424
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:07,903
Viah, if we win, I'll buy you snacks for a whole month.

425
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:11,030
- Really?
- Come on! One, two, three!

426
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,400
Pull!

427
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:31,072
Hey.

428
00:30:31,072 --> 00:30:32,729
If you've fallen, get back up.

429
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:36,446
Or do you like sitting on me?

430
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,183
That's not it!

431
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,470
This game is called balloon stomp.

432
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,893
You sat on me in the last game.

433
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,193
It's time for me to step on your balloon now.

434
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:58,570
No way.

435
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,470
Are you sure?

436
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,909
Where are you going?

437
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,391
It hurts!

438
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,191
I'm sorry.

439
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,969
So is this how you want it? Fine.

440
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,530
Come on! Take that!

441
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,390
Take this!

442
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,790
There! Take that!

443
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:29,149
Now what?

444
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:38,999
Here's your food box.

445
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:41,354
Thank you.

446
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:44,911
I have a question.

447
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:48,071
Why are you and Khru Prince fighting?

448
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,779
It's nothing.

449
00:31:52,373 --> 00:31:54,963
I can tell even from the distance.

450
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:58,488
Don't tell me you're fighting over me.

451
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:00,943
I don't think so, Yayah.

452
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:04,437
It's a long story.

453
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:08,133
Go ahead and tell. I have time.

454
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,274
So is that what happened?

455
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:20,517
I actually understand you, Dr. Fah.

456
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,105
Really?

457
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,490
But I understand Khru Prince as well.

458
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,509
I feel sorry for him.

459
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:30,810
He's going through the same thing again.

460
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,582
No wonder why he's so down.

461
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:36,944
What do you mean, Yayah?

462
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,923
We've come to the last sport of the day, which is a triathlon.

463
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:59,004
That's right. It will be separated into three different types of sports.

464
00:32:59,004 --> 00:33:02,034
The first one is an eating challenge.

465
00:33:02,034 --> 00:33:05,337
The second sport is cycling.

466
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:08,200
And the last one is

467
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,100
a three-legged race.

468
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:14,248
Khru Prince, are you okay?

469
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:16,151
I am fine, Sompor.

470
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:17,441
I'm just warming up my leg.

471
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:21,374
The triathlon sports will happen consecutively.

472
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,959
The team that gets to the finish line first wins.

473
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,905
If you're ready,

474
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:32,509
three, two, one, go!

475
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:35,751
The game has started.

476
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:38,250
They are eating as fast as they can.

477
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,837
Go. Go. Go. Do your best, everyone!

478
00:33:46,145 --> 00:33:48,703
The blue team is in the lead.

479
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:53,743
The white team is tailing them so closely. So, so, so close.

480
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,608
Come on. Faster.

481
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:10,134
Tag my hand!

482
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:11,822
Let's go.

483
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:14,159
We've just started the second competition.

484
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,106
What a close game.

485
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:20,279
No way. The blue team is so much ahead.

486
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:22,535
Can the white team catch up?

487
00:34:22,535 --> 00:34:26,215
Keep going. Keep cycling, my friend.

488
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:32,117
It's your turn now, Khru Prince.

489
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:36,614
- The white team has reached the three-legged race now.
- Let's go, Sompor.

490
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:39,721
The blue team has just started.

491
00:34:39,721 --> 00:34:42,774
Will they catch up to the white team?

492
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:46,436
Khru Prince has gone so far now.

493
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:49,034
Khru Prince, are you all right?

494
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:54,201
Ai Fah, come on!

495
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:56,940
- Blue team!
- White team!

496
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,430
- White team!
- Blue team!

497
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:07,151
There's been a problem! What happened?

498
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:08,701
Khru Prince just fell all of a sudden.

499
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:12,200
Ai Fah, it's your chance now. Surpass him.

500
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,088
Dr. Fah, why are you stopping?

501
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:18,609
The blue team, keep going!

502
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,100
Let's help Khru Prince up.

503
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,175
Come on. Let's go to the finish line together.

504
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:47,201
Wow! Dr. Fah comes back and helps Khru Prince up.

505
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:52,460
What a lovely ship. No! I mean what an impressive race.

506
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:03,480
And they finally get to the finish line together! Wow!

507
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,400
Yes!

508
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:12,060
The blue and white teams finished at the same time as a result of today's competition.

509
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,310
We have a tie game.

510
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,404
Yes!

511
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:20,860
No matter who wins or loses,

512
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,860
every contestant will get a medal!

513
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:35,424
Khru Prince, is this the real gold?

514
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:38,774
It's a chocolate medal. So delicious.

515
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,421
That's only a consolation prize.

516
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:48,687
What you best deserve is this one.

517
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:50,397
You...

518
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:53,054
How did you get it?

519
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:58,637
Before the competition started, I went looking for it.

520
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:02,178
Besides, I know about everything, Viah.

521
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,513
Know what?

522
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,660
About the fact that you

523
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,360
gave plain hair clips to other girls.

524
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:15,148
But the one you gave Sompor was custom-made.

525
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:16,797
That's right.

526
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:22,364
I chose a pink hair clip because Sompor likes pink.

527
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:26,915
Why didn't you tell Sompor from the beginning?

528
00:37:26,915 --> 00:37:29,012
Because it's not cool.

529
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:36,658
But I think it's much cooler telling the truth.

530
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:40,431
It's not too late to tell her.

531
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:44,897
The sooner you tell, the sooner you'll look cool.

532
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:47,506
Go on.

533
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:49,217
Yes, sir.

534
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:01,721
How is your ankle?

535
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,909
I'm all right.

536
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,305
Thank you.

537
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:11,115
I think I'll take a look at it.

538
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:12,515
Come on.

539
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:23,617
[Medical Health Clinic]

540
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:31,118
You got a sprained ankle. You should be fine.

541
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:33,944
Next time, don't force it.

542
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:39,424
No wonder you looked in pain when you were running.

543
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:41,315
Thank you.

544
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:44,504
You're welcome.

545
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:48,427
It's a duty of a doctor to take care of his patients.

546
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:54,802
I mean thank you for taking me to the finish line with you.

547
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:58,065
And for finding the hair clip for Viah.

548
00:39:10,672 --> 00:39:12,572
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

549
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,946
You speak first.

550
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:22,870
I'm sorry for being unreasonable.

551
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:27,117
There's no reason for me to be angry at you about that night.

552
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,293
What if I say I understand?

553
00:39:34,045 --> 00:39:37,005
What do you mean?

554
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:41,769
Yayah told me what you've been through.

555
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:44,440
What do you mean, Yayah?

556
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,174
Khru Prince told me he had a terrible ex.

557
00:39:50,983 --> 00:39:54,687
That person couldn't provide him with clarity.

558
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:56,407
He came when he wanted to.

559
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:58,285
He went with someone else when he felt like it.

560
00:39:58,285 --> 00:40:00,067
Khru Prince couldn't even get jealous.

561
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,907
Because there was no established relationship.

562
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:06,233
What did Khru Prince do?

563
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:08,020
They were together for a brief period.

564
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,180
Khru Prince couldn't endure it at last. He broke up with that person.

565
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,447
And what you're doing is a repeat of what his ex did to him.

566
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:20,154
No wonder why he's angry.

567
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:23,460
He probably doesn't want to get hurt again.

568
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:32,750
I wasn't being clear with you not because I'm not serious.

569
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:40,470
But it's because I'm very serious that I'm afraid it's happening too soon.

570
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,556
I'd been with my ex for seven years, yet we couldn't make it.

571
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:48,244
That's why I don't want to rush things.

572
00:40:50,054 --> 00:40:53,254
But if my actions give you the wrong idea,

573
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,237
from this moment on,

574
00:41:11,857 --> 00:41:14,097
may I pursue you?

575
00:41:24,572 --> 00:41:28,325
Prince, I'm returning the cap gun I borrowed.

576
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:32,496
Am I interrupting?

577
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:34,696
No.

578
00:41:34,696 --> 00:41:37,643
Will you please excuse me?

579
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:45,232
Thank you.

580
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:56,237
What were you two talking about?

581
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,441
What was it?

582
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:03,720
It's nothing. I was just giving him first aid.

583
00:42:21,403 --> 00:42:23,509
Where are you going?

584
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:30,050
That gunshot was a signal to start.

585
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,540
This game isn't going to be as easy as the one we competed in today.

586
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,611
We'll see about that.

587
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:41,144
Because I've never lost to anyone.

588
00:42:59,187 --> 00:43:02,090
I just want to try hard.

589
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,154
I want to stop everything just to be with him.

590
00:43:10,669 --> 00:43:12,472
Hey! What are you doing?

591
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:14,395
You allowed me to pursue you.

592
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:18,151
From now on, I'll just pursue you non-stop.

593
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:20,140
Prepare yourself for that.

594
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,550
Can I put my hand right here until it gets warmer?

595
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,092
Prince, this way.

596
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:27,499
Khru Prince already has someone he's talking to.

597
00:43:27,499 --> 00:43:30,176
Don't worry. I'm not trying to steal him.

598
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:34,095
I just want him to meet someone who can take care of him better than me.

599
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:36,551
- What are you doing?
- Your friend should know

600
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:40,060
you have a doctor to take care of you up on the mountain.

601
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,910
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

602
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,880
♫ Even in your dreams every night ♫

603
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,070
♫ Love is still waiting for you to come and change your dreams ♫

604
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,770
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

605
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,940
♫ If you're the sea, I'll be like the sand ♫

606
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,120
♫ If you're the sky, please let me be ♫

607
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,380
♫ The North to guide your heart ♫

608
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:17,490
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫
