170
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,942
What is this?

171
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:20,007
A heart.

172
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,973
Come on. Let's take a photo.

173
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,195
Can we join?

174
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,099
What are you two doing?

175
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:38,210
♫ Nobody knows that our love is still waiting at the destination ♫

176
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,290
♫ Do you think that our love really exists? ♫

177
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,680
[Tha Phae Gate]

178
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:57,114
What are you doing?

179
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:00,895
I'm taking you traveling, but you're messing with me.

180
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,929
I'm not messing with you.

181
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,889
I just brought you a drink

182
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,508
as a thank you for taking me out.

183
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,491
Okay.

184
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,920
Let me feed you.

185
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,237
I can feed myself.

186
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:20,411
If you don't let me feed you,

187
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,283
I will...

188
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:24,083
You will what?

189
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,255
I will...

190
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:31,625
Shout "Khru Prince is so cute."

191
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,974
Do you think I won't do it?

192
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:37,678
Khru Prince—

193
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,339
You!

194
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,321
What is this? Are you shy?

195
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,829
Can't you tell the difference between annoyance and being shy?

196
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:20,213
He's so damn cute.

197
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,948
Do you still have a headache?

198
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,694
Just a little.

199
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:38,773
Are you sure?

200
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:42,927
I have such a caring doctor here. Of course, I would recover fast, right?

201
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,911
Here.

202
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,061
Next time, if you don't feel well, let me know.

203
00:15:51,061 --> 00:15:53,721
I don't want you to get this sick again.

204
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,192
Yes, I know.

205
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,942
You always make me worry.

206
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,279
Hey!

207
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:14,229
Yes!

208
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:17,222
This is a real paradise.

209
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:20,178
I will never leave this bed.

210
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:24,878
Ai Mesa, what about our trip to Chang Gate?

211
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,998
Damn you!

212
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,631
There's another bed available there.

213
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,746
Would you like to share it with me?

214
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:43,346
No.

215
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,180
Khun, I wasn't thinking of doing anything bad to you.

216
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,433
It's not that.

217
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,709
I'm meeting my friends tonight.

218
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,509
I want to go home to freshen up.

219
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,176
You're already cute.

220
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:15,065
There's no need to freshen up.

221
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,168
What the heck is up with you?

222
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,396
I'm leaving now.

223
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,128
Let me walk you out.

224
00:17:46,402 --> 00:17:48,002
Yes, Mom.

225
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:51,422
Yes. I took them to the hotel already.

226
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:57,558
Right now, Dr. Fah just walked me to the car.

227
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,335
What?

228
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:00,941
Are you serious?

229
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,249
Okay.

230
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,749
Sure.

231
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,772
What is it?

232
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:13,290
My mom... is inviting you to come over.

233
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,754
Really?

234
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:19,994
But... if you don't want to, it's fine.

235
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:21,794
I understand.

236
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,113
Sure, I'll go.

237
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,434
Let's go meet your mom.

238
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:29,378
Hey, Khun.

239
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:35,226
My house is probably unlike other houses.

240
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:39,631
I don't mind at all. No matter what it looks like,

241
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:44,385
I'm thankful you invited me.

242
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,243
We've arrived.

243
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,650
Wait, hold on.

244
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,621
Where are you taking me?

245
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:30,728
Hey. Where are we?

246
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:33,901
Don't tell me this is your house.

247
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,304
It is.

248
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:39,872
But it's not the main residence. It's being renovated.

249
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:05,749
Na Chiang Dao.

250
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:07,959
That sounds familiar.

251
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:12,091
It's the last name of the ancient monarch of the North.

252
00:20:14,943 --> 00:20:18,517
The last name of the ancient monarch of the North?

253
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:22,067
Are you descended from the Northern royalty?

254
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,485
Why didn't you tell me?

255
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,585
I could have dressed up more properly.

256
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:30,928
It's fine. We're a laid-back family.

257
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,558
Please have a seat.

258
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,750
Have you arrived, Dear?

259
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:05,020
Hello, Mom.
(T/N: Thai custom to greet a friend's mom as, 'mom')

260
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,052
Your house is beautiful.

261
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:17,480
Prince, didn't you tell your friend we don't speak the way other people do?

262
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,779
I'm so sorry, my lady.

263
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:22,855
My apologies.

264
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,166
I'm not familiar with this kind of stuff.

265
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:28,355
It wasn't my intention.

266
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:32,341
I was just kidding.

267
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,945
Please speak normally.

268
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,460
- Yes?
- Don't be shocked.

269
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,239
I said you can speak the standardized dialect.

270
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,646
I was just messing with you.

271
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,818
Please make yourself at home.

272
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:49,898
Where did you get this outfit from? It's gorgeous.

273
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:52,568
Let me tell you, I ordered it online.

274
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:55,302
There are so many to choose from and they are easy to wear.

275
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:58,051
I'm going to get changed now.

276
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,603
Please make yourself at home, all right.

277
00:21:59,603 --> 00:22:01,502
I'll be right back.

278
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,382
What is this? I'm so confused.

279
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:12,695
My mom loves to prank visitors.

280
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:15,754
I told you we're a laid-back family.

281
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,494
This is my office.

282
00:22:31,494 --> 00:22:35,678
I like to read and work here.

283
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:42,025
Wow. So you really are a prince, aren't you?

284
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:44,485
At first, I thought it was just your name.

285
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:49,198
On the contrary, "Prince" which means Jao Chai, is a real Prince.

286
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:51,441
It's not what you think.

287
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:54,442
I live a normal life.

288
00:22:54,442 --> 00:23:01,279
That means the perfume and the designer bag are authentic.

289
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,579
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:05,795
It's okay. I understand.

291
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:09,857
If I were you, I wouldn't want people to know, either.

292
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,630
Dr. Fah, I have a photo album of Prince as a kid to show you. Do you want to see?

293
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,792
Of course, I do.

294
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,655
Here, come look at this picture.

295
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,951
Prince was walking around the house naked.

296
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:30,085
Mom! Not that one.

297
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,492
Not this one?

298
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:32,735
How about this one then?

299
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:36,316
See this one, he just peed on his bed here.

300
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:37,902
Look. He's in a basket.

301
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:40,630
Mom, these photos are embarrassing.

302
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,989
Why are you showing them to him?

303
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:45,742
What's embarrassing, Dear?

304
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:49,287
What's there to be embarrassed about between lovers?

305
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,823
Do you think I can't tell?

306
00:23:50,823 --> 00:23:53,786
Every time you call back from the mountain,

307
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:57,246
you always say Dr. Fah this, Dr. Fah that.

308
00:23:57,246 --> 00:24:00,861
If you're not called lovers, then what are you two?

309
00:24:02,063 --> 00:24:03,718
You're misunderstanding, Mom!

310
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:04,746
How?

311
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:08,393
Come on and help me explain it to her.

312
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
So...

313
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:14,404
what did he say about me?

314
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:19,982
He called and told me...

315
00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:23,665
"Dr. Fah helped get the spider off my hair."

316
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:27,605
Or "Dr. Fah helped me when I passed out."

317
00:24:27,605 --> 00:24:29,655
And he said, "Dr. Fah—"

318
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:30,842
That's enough, Mom.

319
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,825
Come on. I need to go somewhere else.

320
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:35,125
Fine. Let's go then.

321
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:38,929
Are you shy?

322
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:39,895
Mom!

323
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,402
Dr. Fah, please take care of Prince up there.

324
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:44,902
Of course.

325
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:47,442
You, too, Prince.

326
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:52,510
If you want any help up there, send someone to inform me.

327
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,080
Yes, Mom.

328
00:24:58,204 --> 00:25:01,994
Let me go get the car for you

329
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:06,368
so mother and son can have more time to catch up.

330
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:10,202
Not only are you handsome, but you're also courteous.

331
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:12,605
Thank you so much.

332
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:14,400
You can follow the butler.

333
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,675
This way, please, Khun Kuafah.

334
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:18,127
Na Detch, do not get the truck.
(T/N: "Na" means uncle who's younger than your parents)

335
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:20,338
Chot will need the truck for farm work.

336
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,153
Of course, Ma'am.

337
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,992
You may follow him.

338
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,507
You made a great choice.

339
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:34,458
What are you saying?

340
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,188
That Dr. Fah.

341
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,772
I like him a lot.

342
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,106
When will you two start dating?

343
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,837
What dating, Mom?

344
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:46,214
Don't be shy.

345
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:51,268
Everyone can tell you guys are not just a ship.

346
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:52,786
You guys are a real couple.

347
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:53,785
Mom!

348
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,599
I hope you two start dating soon.

349
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,224
Okay? Don't be shy.

350
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:04,651
Wait! You have to meet up with your friends tonight, don't you?

351
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:05,767
Yes.

352
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:11,022
Ai Nott just got back from America, so we're gathering to welcome him home.

353
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:15,485
So that means you will have to meet Sincere there.

354
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:18,577
It's all right, Mom.

355
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:23,665
Sincere and I have nothing to do with each other anymore.

356
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:40,045
Loong Detch told me to take this car. Are you sure about this?

357
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:44,521
It's fine. I'm sorry about that. The other cars are getting washed.

358
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,615
Please drive safe, all right?

359
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:47,992
I'm leaving now, Mom.

360
00:26:47,992 --> 00:26:51,070
- I missed you.
- Of course.

361
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,352
I missed you, too, Dear.

362
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:56,456
Please drive back safely.

363
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:58,456
Please look out for him, Dr. Fah.

364
00:26:58,456 --> 00:26:59,956
Absolutely.

365
00:27:04,242 --> 00:27:06,957
- Bye bye.
- Goodbye.

366
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,860
For a meal to pass the time while waiting for my friends,

367
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,185
you didn't need to take me to a fancy restaurant.

368
00:27:20,185 --> 00:27:22,471
Consider it a treat.

369
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:24,233
Hey, Prince.

370
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,700
Are you here for Nott's party, too?

371
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:35,554
Yes.

372
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,420
Okay. It's great that you came.

373
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,219
It's convenient to talk to you then.

374
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:42,993
Do you mind leaving us, so we can have a private talk?

375
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,297
Just go ahead and say it, Sincere.

376
00:27:51,297 --> 00:27:52,596
You can stay.

377
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:55,690
Come on, Prince. We haven't met for so long.

378
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,285
I hope your friend won't be so mean.

379
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,100
Of course.

380
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,815
Since "old friends" get to meet once in a while.

381
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:29,205
What is it?

382
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:32,617
Wow. The way you speak sure is curt.

383
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:34,766
I just came to say hi.

384
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:39,646
My mom told me you're a volunteer teacher up on the mountain.

385
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:41,346
Yes.

386
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:44,852
How are you doing? Is the job okay?

387
00:28:44,852 --> 00:28:46,653
It's good.

388
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,630
The weather is nice.

389
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,997
Did you meet that guy up there?

390
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,518
Something like that.

391
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:07,138
I should go straight to the point.

392
00:29:07,138 --> 00:29:09,838
To be honest,

393
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:12,331
I still miss you, Prince.

394
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,492
I have always missed you.

395
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:17,445
Would it be okay if I wanted to get back...

396
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:23,017
Hey, you!

397
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,132
Let's go.

398
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:40,597
Calm down, Khun.

399
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:49,610
What are you doing?

400
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,185
I was trying to get us to be back together.

401
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,582
So you intended to make me jealous?

402
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,390
And did you get jealous?

403
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:05,745
I'm this jealous. Will you be able to make it up to me?

404
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,989
Is this good enough?

405
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:39,579
Well... my friends are expecting me.

406
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,228
I'm coming with you.

407
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:54,508
So that they know you have a doctor taking care of you up on the mountain.

408
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:58,845
Come on.

409
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,340
[Tn]

410
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,149
Prince, this way.

411
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:12,874
Hi, Prince.

412
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:15,033
Have a seat here. It's available.

413
00:31:23,476 --> 00:31:24,877
Hi, everyone.

414
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:27,130
I'm Kuafah,

415
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,470
Prince's close friend.

416
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,465
- Hi. Cheers!
- Cheers!

417
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:04,438
You sure made a big scene there.

418
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:13,106
In case someone around here doesn't know that Prince is seeing someone.

419
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:17,390
Don't worry. I'm not trying to steal Prince

420
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:22,442
because someone like him needs a guy who has time for him.

421
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,382
What do you mean?

422
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,319
I heard you're a doctor.

423
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,207
You must be very busy.

424
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,066
And?

425
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:36,201
It's nice when you're together,

426
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:39,243
but when you guys are apart,

427
00:32:39,243 --> 00:32:41,789
you won't have any free time at all.

428
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:44,771
I'm not criticizing you or anything.

429
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:50,408
I just want Prince to be with someone who has more time for him.

430
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:54,358
I hope you understand.

431
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:26,473
Hey. Hey.

432
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:28,359
Are you okay?

433
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:31,526
I'm fine.

434
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,516
Enjoy your drink.

435
00:33:45,745 --> 00:33:47,960
Let's drink.

436
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,221
Here's to Ai Nott who just got back and to Prince who is taking a break from the mountain.

437
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,094
No leaving until you're wasted!

438
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:57,585
Cheers!

439
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:01,990
How's your study?

440
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,627
- Is it good?
- It's terrible.

441
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:19,831
Please excuse me.

442
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,825
Yes?

443
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:37,687
Where are you? Ai JJ and I are dressing up for Chang Gate.

444
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:39,662
- You guys go ahead.
- What?

445
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,402
I don't feel like going.

446
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:43,388
Where are you?

447
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:48,331
It doesn't matter where I am. I'm going back to rest now.

448
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,130
Sure, yes.

449
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:56,574
Hey, you!

450
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,384
Are you okay?

451
00:34:58,384 --> 00:35:02,363
I can't... breathe.

452
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:04,557
Waiter! Waiter!

453
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,502
Is there something wrong?

454
00:35:06,502 --> 00:35:09,055
She can't breathe.

455
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:12,691
We can take her inside. There's a first aid room here.

456
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:19,567
Damn! Ai Prince is drunk already.

457
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,585
He's starting to move his hip.

458
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,391
I'm not drunk.

459
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,825
Bottoms up!

460
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:33,052
Hey!

461
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,752
Khun!

462
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,048
You can't even walk.

463
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:42,071
Stay here.

464
00:35:42,071 --> 00:35:44,771
But Kuafah...

465
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:48,475
I think that's his real behavior.

466
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:51,525
Let him go.

467
00:35:54,554 --> 00:35:55,624
Just drink.

468
00:35:55,624 --> 00:35:58,089
Cheers!

469
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:03,291
Can you take more?

470
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,742
Yes!

471
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,701
Keep going, Guys!

472
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,840
Cheers!

473
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,150
It's so good!

474
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,730
Another shot!

475
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,500
Come on!

476
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,168
Your pulse rate is getting better.

477
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:37,821
Don't drink so much next time, and get a good rest.

478
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,221
Okay.

479
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:40,322
Thank you, Phi.

480
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:42,329
We will take it from here.

481
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:43,414
Sure.

482
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:45,211
- Thank you.
- Of course.

483
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,538
Prince?

484
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:51,077
Prince.

485
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:54,675
You're really drunk.

486
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:58,784
Should we go home? You can crash with me tonight.

487
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,921
Where is Fah?

488
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:02,621
Fah?

489
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:06,298
I guess he's occupied.

490
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:09,598
He's probably having fun with the girl over there.

491
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:16,450
You better not say what you don't know.

492
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,695
Because if it's not true,

493
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,991
you'll just be embarrassed.

494
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:27,874
Thank you for saving my life.

495
00:37:38,064 --> 00:37:41,613
Jao Chai (Prince), let's go.

496
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:44,956
Go home? No, I won't!

497
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:47,045
Don't be stubborn. Come on.

498
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:50,021
I said I don't want to!

499
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:53,432
Please excuse me while I take Prince home.

500
00:37:54,223 --> 00:37:55,243
Sure.

501
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:57,424
Come on. Get up.

502
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:01,834
Bye bye!

503
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,834
Bye, Guys.

504
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:07,385
Bye.

505
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,898
Are you sure you're all right?

506
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:10,917
I'm not drunk!

507
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:47,509
Why did you come back?

508
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:50,649
Why didn't you spend more time with the girl back there?

509
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:54,935
She couldn't breathe, so I gave her first aid.

510
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:58,411
But you suddenly changed.

511
00:38:59,134 --> 00:39:03,622
I have something on my mind.

512
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:07,655
Don't you think our relationship is weird?

513
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:09,584
How is it weird?

514
00:39:09,584 --> 00:39:13,949
Like today, I just learned about your family,

515
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:17,126
and you know nothing about mine.

516
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:20,926
You have no idea what I am or what I do.

517
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:26,000
When we both go home one day, I might not have time to take care of you.

518
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,084
Can you handle that?

519
00:39:47,198 --> 00:39:50,976
You're making it complicated. It's hard to follow.

520
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:02,585
I also don't think I make any sense right now.

521
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:43,912
When I fall in love, I never have to do anything like this.

522
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:46,788
I've never felt the need to pursue anybody.

523
00:40:46,788 --> 00:40:51,553
He must be the first prey to make a tiger like me fall in love.

524
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,209
[Next Week] Since you returned from Bangkok, you guys have been lovey-dovey.

525
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:01,530
So are you two dating yet?

526
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,172
I haven't got a chance to say it yet.

527
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:05,601
I feel like things are going fast.

528
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,149
You two aren't dating yet?

529
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:10,731
You guys will leave this mountain in three days!

530
00:41:10,731 --> 00:41:11,998
Ai Fah, bad news!

531
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:14,677
The villagers are having bad diarrhea.

532
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:16,307
Hey Khun, your hand is burning hot.

533
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,051
You're feverish. Why didn't you tell me you're sick?

534
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:20,205
Why did you come back?

535
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:21,726
I came to find the medicine to treat Malaria.

536
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,137
If Prince doesn't get treated immediately, he might die.

537
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:25,593
Let me take care of Prince.

538
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:28,990
We can clearly see that you can't take care of him at all.

539
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,890
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

540
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,960
♫ Even in your dreams every night ♫

541
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,040
♫ Love is still waiting for you to come and change your dreams ♫

542
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,640
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

543
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,000
♫ If you're the sea, I will be the sand ♫

544
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,260
♫ If you're the sky, please let me be the North Star ♫

545
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,420
♫ To guide your heart ♫

546
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,700
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫
