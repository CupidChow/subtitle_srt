There are no bears on this mountain.

There are no bears here, only pigs.

I climbed that mountain to meet someone who was waiting for me.

Shouldn't I be the one to ask you instead?

163
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,001
Did you forget anything? You're about to hit the road.

164
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:00,007
Well, I'm worried about you.

165
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,940
Don't worry about me, Fah.

166
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,726
I have Khabkluen to take care of me here.

167
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:10,183
I'm worried because you're with him.

168
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,159
While I'm away,

169
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,203
take good care of my brother.

170
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:21,260
Don't let me find out you did anything bad.

171
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:25,144
What do you consider bad?

172
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:28,466
You know what I mean.

173
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:32,660
Is holding hands allowed?

174
00:11:33,978 --> 00:11:35,361
Sure. It's fine.

175
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,980
What about kissing on the cheek?

176
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,138
Twice a day is fine.

177
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:51,038
Then I've reached my quota.

178
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:55,842
- What about kissing on the lips?
- Kiss my foot!

179
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,852
Just because I trust you a bit, you're going too far.

180
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,115
I'm kidding, P'Fah.

181
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:02,831
I promise to take very good care of Dao.

182
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:05,336
I will definitely do something bad.

183
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:11,024
I will... not do anything bad for sure.

184
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:12,500
Okay.

185
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,868
Don't worry about me, Fah. Worry about yourself, too.

186
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,868
Take good care of yourself while you're there.

187
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:23,428
Take it as having some time for yourself.

188
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:27,050
Yes.

189
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:30,206
Take care.

190
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,920
Have a safe trip, P'Fah.

191
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,715
Dao,

192
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:49,420
can I go beyond my quota?

193
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:51,167
You can't.

194
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,979
Why not?

195
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:58,460
You've met all your quota for today, haven't you?

196
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,231
But…

197
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,405
I haven't.

198
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,716
Come on.

199
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:12,920
Let's go use up all the quota.

200
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:20,525
Hey. What are you daydreaming about?

201
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,261
Are you thinking of girls in Bangkok?

202
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,610
Yes, right.

203
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,881
I haven't scolded you two for ditching me.

204
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:28,319
We didn't ditch you.

205
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:30,219
We just went with the flow.

206
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:31,668
Yes. Whatever.

207
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm done with your excuses.

208
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm hungry. Let's find something to eat.

209
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,631
Perfect timing, Dude. The Village Headman invited us for dinner at his house.

210
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:41,531
Let's go have dinner.

211
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,243
What is on my face?

212
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,637
I told you to wash your face.

213
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,804
Are you only twenty-five and already a doctor?
[Village Headman Office]

214
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:53,069
He's a genius, Sir.

215
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:54,903
- He got a high school equivalency certificate at age sixteen.
- Sure.

216
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:57,823
He took a test for medicine school after that, and he was accepted.

217
00:13:57,823 --> 00:13:59,390
Since you're so great,

218
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,136
are the hospitals fighting over you?

219
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,608
What fighting over him?

220
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:06,284
All he does is drink and go to pubs.

221
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,070
- That's enough talking.
- You can say he's a spiritual doctor.

222
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,860
Spiritual doctor...

223
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,409
- Hello.
- Hi. Have a seat.

224
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,009
Sit here.

225
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,052
Is this your son?

226
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,860
No, he's not.

227
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,959
This is Khru Prince. He's one of the volunteer teachers here.

228
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,395
I invited him over since you all need to work together.

229
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,508
So you're a volunteer teacher?

230
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,302
I'm a volunteer teacher, too.

231
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:39,750
My name is Mesa. Nice to meet you.

232
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,017
Sure. I'm Prince.

233
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:46,424
Mesa, a person's name, not a month (April).

234
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,129
I'm JJ. A Maintenance Officer.

235
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,080
Gosh, you gave it such a fancy name.

236
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,156
Don't you just paint and repair houses?

237
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,488
A**hole.

238
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,452
Sorry.

239
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:01,800
And this foul-mouthed man is Kuafah.

240
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,693
- He's a…
- A burden, isn't he?

241
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:10,069
Have you two met?

242
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:14,427
We met while I was cleaning up the house.

243
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,910
Anyway, never mind that. It's a long story.

244
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,184
Let's eat.

245
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,875
All right. We should eat now.

246
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,669
Make yourself at home.

247
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:25,209
Can you please pass me those plates?

248
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,621
Let me help.

249
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:33,052
I'm helping here.

250
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:36,340
Please enjoy. Eat as much as you want.

251
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:52,422
Mom made extra food for the guests.

252
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,681
Put them right here.

253
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:22,392
This is Yayah, my daughter.

254
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:25,797
Wow! Beautiful.

255
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:30,361
Are all northern girls this pretty?

256
00:16:30,361 --> 00:16:33,361
Ai, you're flattering me.

257
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:43,835
Doctor, don't you like the food?

258
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:47,752
I do, but…

259
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:49,734
The food here is quite spicy.

260
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:51,819
I can't really eat spicy food.

261
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,854
My friend is a picky eater.

262
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:57,437
One thing he isn't picky about is girls.

263
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:59,716
You can shut it!

264
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,855
Make yourself at home.

265
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,874
Please excuse me while I use the restroom.

266
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:13,623
Pretty. Pretty, right?

267
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:16,260
Tell her that. Why are you telling me?

268
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:27,453
Is it true that you're not picky about girls?

269
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,988
True or not…

270
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:35,885
Depends on who is asking.

271
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:37,668
What if I'm the one asking?

272
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:40,210
Do I have a chance?

273
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:44,161
Yayah.

274
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:48,412
Come on. Can't I just make a joke?

275
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:51,689
Don't tell my dad, Khru Prince.

276
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:55,328
Please excuse me.

277
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,651
What is so funny?

278
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:01,161
I thought you said there wasn't any wifi in the mountains. She's faster than wifi.

279
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,798
It's you again, Dude.

280
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:06,148
As always, there's nothing for me.

281
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,920
Get home safe.

282
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,478
All right.

283
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:12,864
- Thank you, Sir.
- Thank you.

284
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,301
Village Headman,

285
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:31,600
the new volunteer seems kind of strange.

286
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,708
What is strange?

287
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:38,889
They don't seem like the other volunteer workers.

288
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,489
They look like they were forced to be here.

289
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:46,200
I don't want to say much,

290
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,738
but since you've mentioned it, I will tell you the truth.

291
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:55,574
Those three came to volunteer to perform a good cause (community service).

292
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:57,137
"To perform a good cause"?

293
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,788
Yes.

294
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,843
I heard they're high society people.

295
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:04,499
They must have been driving under the influence.

296
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:08,036
That's why they're doing the community service here.

297
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,816
Can they be trusted then?

298
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:15,968
That's my concern, too,

299
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,792
but I couldn't do anything.

300
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:21,138
They were sent here directly. I couldn't refuse.

301
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:27,065
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

302
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:33,074
If they do anything distrustful, I'll chase them away.

303
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,577
Of course.

304
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,555
Hey, Ai Fah.

305
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:44,715
We just departed. How come you miss us already?

306
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:48,860
Ai Mesa, can I borrow your phone?

307
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,202
Phone? Why mine? You have one.

308
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:54,254
My phone doesn't have any reception.

309
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:57,493
I noticed that your phone has reception in some places, right?

310
00:19:57,493 --> 00:20:00,313
Yes, some places, but not here.

311
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:04,210
And I've already walked around the whole village. There's no reception anywhere.

312
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,341
What the heck? They don't even have reception here.

313
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,398
Is there anything decent here at all?

314
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:12,992
Exactly. The weather is freezing.

315
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:14,978
And the food is so damn spicy.

316
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:17,536
There are also lots of mosquitoes at night.

317
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:24,453
- Ai Mesa.
- Yes?

318
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:27,063
Don't you have anything to complain about?

319
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:30,636
No. I can adapt easily.

320
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,824
"Adapt easily"?

321
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:34,439
Really?

322
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,573
What are you chewing?

323
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:39,195
Don't tell me…

324
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,591
- Give it here.
- Ai Mesa!

325
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,819
Wow!

326
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:44,354
Ai Mesa!

327
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:45,981
I knew it!

328
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,734
No wonder your backpack was bulky.

329
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:52,676
You can easily adapt, my a**!

330
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:55,856
Hey! Wait! Wait!

331
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,086
Now that we saw them.

332
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:03,379
You've prepared snacks, right? Good.

333
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:07,245
Because I've brought…

334
00:21:07,245 --> 00:21:10,880
- some alcohol too.
- What?

335
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,858
Let's drink what I brought with your snacks.

336
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,849
Sure. Here. Put them here.

337
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,959
Hi. I'm Prince.

338
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,834
Is Dr. Fah here?

339
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,713
I have to bring him to the clinic.

340
00:21:30,383 --> 00:21:32,107
Is anybody here?

341
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,475
Shit! It's late!

342
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,828
Hey! Khru Prince is here!

343
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,894
- Hey, wake up.
- Oh my!

344
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,764
If he sees us like this, we're done for!

345
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:42,353
Let's move. What are you hanging around for?

346
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:44,546
Hey, wait for me!

347
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:46,053
Hey, you!

348
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,837
Oh, hey!

349
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:54,845
What are you doing here?

350
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:57,333
What time do you think it is now?

351
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:00,947
I have no idea. You tell me.

352
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:03,433
There's no clock here.

353
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:13,489
Hey, why are you in such a hurry?

354
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:16,232
Can you wait until I get changed first?

355
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:17,823
Next time, don't wake up late.

356
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:20,126
I was nice enough to let you stop by your house.

357
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:21,753
Walk quickly. I'll be late to teach.

358
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:23,253
Wait.

359
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,452
Hold this.

360
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,718
Take it.

361
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:30,237
This too.

362
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,622
- It smells like alcohol.
- I'm sorry.

363
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:46,516
My friends spilled the drink on me.

364
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,510
Please hold on to that for now.

365
00:22:56,533 --> 00:23:02,130
Don't you have anything to do instead of leading the way for me?

366
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,353
Since I came here before you, I must give you pointers as your predecessor.

367
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,457
Walk faster. I must get to class on time.

368
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,104
How old does he think he is?

369
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:15,853
Acting like he's been here for ten years.

370
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,668
I heard that. Hurry!

371
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:20,044
Yes, Sir.

372

[Health Clinic]

373
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,339
It's here.

374
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,153
That's the check-up spot.

375
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:49,838
If you need anything else, you can look inside the room.

376
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:57,739
This is where to keep medications.

377
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:04,794
These cupboards are miscellaneous storage.

378
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:08,475
Hey, watch out!

379
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:42,009
That was close.

380
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:45,033
Who on earth stored things like that?

381
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:46,733
I guess…

382
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:51,220
It must've been the previous volunteer doctor. They weren't careful enough.

383
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:56,779
You can organize them then.

384

[Medical Storage Room]

385
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,340
So that's it.

386
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,138
Most of the supplies you need are here.

387
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:20,136
If you need anything else, you may inform the Village Headman.

388
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:26,864
Why are you staring at me?

389
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:31,293
Didn't you scold me yesterday for not giving you eye contact?

390
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:33,338
I'm doing that now.

391
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,687
If we're all set here, I'll head to the school now.

392
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:53,006
Thank you.

393
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,949
These medications have expired.

394
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:18,996
This is no good.

395
00:26:20,858 --> 00:26:22,770
Nothing here can be used.

396
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,063
Is this a health clinic or an abandoned house?

397
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:27,493
Doctor! We've got a problem!

398
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:28,573
Doctor!

399
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:31,725
I carried heavy items. My arms are sore.

400
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,413
I have a stomach ache!

401
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:35,248
- Stomachache!
- Here.

402
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:38,545
I think I have food poisoning.

403
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:40,174
Let's get you checked up.

404
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:41,759
Are you out of your mind?

405
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,880
What is this? What are you playing at?

406
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,893
Why? Wasn't it smooth?

407
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:48,704
Our acting was great.

408
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,439
I told you your plan wouldn't work.

409
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:54,954
Honestly, we're slacking off.

410
00:26:54,954 --> 00:26:56,914
- Slacking off?
- Yes.

411
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:59,771
They made us work so hard.

412
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:04,940
I was told to dig a water well, fix the roof, and mow the lawn.

413
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,354
And me, I was a tiger back in Bangkok.

414
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:12,013
Now I feel like I'm a puppy in the mountains!

415
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:14,715
Those kids picked on me. They're so naughty!

416
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:18,111
I have no idea how Khru Prince can get them to behave.

417
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:20,660
It's good you got work to do.

418
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,039
Look at me. No one has come here.

419
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,133
It's been eight hours now.

420
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:30,029
Ever since we started working up until now,

421
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:33,180
it's only been three hours, man.

422
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,029
- Three hours?
- Yes.

423
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,853
I felt like it was forever.

424
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,385
That's how it is, Dude.

425
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:42,796
Time goes by slowly when we are tortured.

426
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,911
I miss Facebook, Instagram.

427
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:48,065
I miss my bed.

428
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:51,114
- I miss everything.
- Dr. Fah.
- Yes.

429
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:53,914
I'm going down to the city. Do you need anything?

430
00:27:53,914 --> 00:27:57,679
Sure. Let me go along, too. I want to buy some food.

431
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,313
Hey! Who's going to take charge here?

432
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:04,453
The thing is Dr. Fah is in charge here.

433
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:07,273
And he has two dear friends.

434
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:08,594
That's you two!

435
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:12,006
Clean it up nicely for me. My beloved friends.

436
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,105
He loves me all of a sudden.

437
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:16,605
He loves me so suddenly!

438
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,462
Doctor, she fell and got a scratch on her knee.

439
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:24,362
So I…

440
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:34,155
Sompor, can you wait here?

441
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:35,655
Yes.

442
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,833
Khun. Khun.

443
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,100
Are you okay?

444
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,658
Where is Dr. Kuafah?

445
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:57,301
Ai Kuafah? He…

446
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,819
went…

447
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:01,271
Went where?

448
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,477
He had an errand to run nearby. He'll be back.

449
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:05,501
Please wait a little bit.

450
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:06,953
Sure.

451
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,695
Why is Kuafah taking so long to get food?

452
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:12,422
Will he bring us snacks, too?

453
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:19,235
So the errand he's running...

454
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,622
is buying food?

455
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,770
Maybe something else too.

456
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,353
Everyone, I'm back.

457
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:45,273
We have both rubbing alcohol and alcoholic beverages.

458
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,779
Wow! Why are you in such a rush?

459
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:54,885
What?

460
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:03,112
Did she scrape her knee? Let me take a look.

461
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:06,354
Never mind. I took care of it already.

462
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,005
Khun, I can explain.

463
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:12,411
I went down because...

464
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,964
If you came up here just to drink, I think you should go back.

465
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:22,974
You should at least respect the uniform you're wearing.

466
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:30,683
I get it.

467
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:32,353
I'm leaving.

468
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,341
Should we go too?

469
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:41,463
Are you waiting for him to splash the alcohol in your face?

470
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:43,163
Leave now.

471
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,410
Get home safe, everyone.

472
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:01,124
Thank you, Khun Khru.

473
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:18,005
Khru Prince.

474
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:22,329
How is the girl with the scraped knee doing?

475
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:25,275
She's a lot better now.

476
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:30,678
Actually, you're older than me. You don't need to address me so politely.

477
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:33,892
What should I call you then?

478
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:39,588
Hey, I noticed Khru—

479
00:31:39,588 --> 00:31:42,772
I see that you don't call Kuafah "Phi" either,

480
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:46,408
so I wasn't sure how to talk to you.

481
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:50,738
I will only address the people I respect as "Phi."

482
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,575
I must apologize on his behalf.

483
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:57,828
I know this might not help,

484
00:31:57,828 --> 00:32:03,032
but my friend is like this because he was hurt by his ex recently.

485
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:05,716
So he's acting a bit foolish these days.

486
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,373
He wasn't like this before.

487
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:10,775
How was he then?

488
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,118
He used to be very hard-working.

489
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:19,267
You can call him a workaholic.

490
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:21,446
But because all he did was work,

491
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:25,951
he got dumped without warning by his girlfriend of seven years.

492
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,780
After his heartbreak recovery, he was back again.

493
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,068
He pretended to forget his past.

494
00:32:38,068 --> 00:32:44,090
He began drinking, became a player, and wasn't serious with anyone just to make a mockery of life.

495
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,907
At one point, I thought he had moved on.

496
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:51,419
He even insisted on going to his ex's wedding.

497
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:54,199
- How did it go?
- It was bad.

498
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,843
In the end, JJ and I drank with him until we passed out.

499
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:03,228
Without knowing it, we were in a car he was driving.

500
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:07,070
It was strange that we almost made it to the condo,

501
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:11,068
but another car suddenly cut him off.

502
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:17,877
That night Ai Kuafah's car hit the side of the road.

503
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:19,845
Luckily, no one was injured.

504
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:22,753
But the police arrested him for a DUI.

505
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:26,108
As punishment, the court ordered that we all do community service.

506
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:31,050
Actually, Khuafah's dad could have helped in getting a lighter punishment,

507
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,330
but his dad wanted to teach him a lesson.

508
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,083
And that's why we are here.

509
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,650
It's true we're here because we did something bad.

510
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,923
But my friend isn't here just to find a place to drink as you thought.

511
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:50,581
He went out because he had other reasons.

512
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:05,109
It doesn't sting, does it little one?

513
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:09,028
- Actually, he didn't go out to buy drinks.
- No. It doesn't hurt at all.
- That's good.

514
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:11,861
He went to buy more medicine and medical supplies.

515
00:34:11,861 --> 00:34:14,397
I'm going to apply a plaster now.

516
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:17,850
I got you a piggy design plaster here. Isn't it nice?

517
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,569
Yes, it is.

518
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:22,494
The supplies at the health clinic are old.

519
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,972
Some medicines have expired.

520
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:31,829
Dr. Fah is sorry for coming back so late.

521
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:33,274
Will you forgive me?

522
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,756
I will.

523
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:39,161
But he also came back with liquor. That's why it looked quite bad.

524
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,495
Oh, Khun Khru.

525
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:20,335
So…

526
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:26,601
Do you have anything to say?

527
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,339
The design on your bag,

528
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,892
a Prince's crown,

529
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:39,323
did you make it yourself?

530
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:41,919
The students made it for me during art class.

531
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:45,248
I taught them what Prince meant.

532
00:35:45,248 --> 00:35:47,591
And they made me this.

533
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:51,419
How adorable.

534
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:52,796
Isn't it?

535
00:35:52,796 --> 00:35:54,362
I liked it the moment I saw it.

536
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,600
I meant you.

537
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,916
You must be so cute in their eyes for them to make this for you.

538
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:03,088
What are you saying?

539
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,817
Here. Take it.

540
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,538
A dinner box?

541
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,966
I made it.

542
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:20,901
It might not be as good as the food in Bangkok.

543
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:23,999
But it's not spicy. I think you can handle it.

544
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,799
Thank you.

545
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:31,608
Such a nice farewell dinner.

546
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,620
So…

547
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,856
when are you leaving?

548
00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:43,980
Well, probably tomorrow morning.

549
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:47,479
You don't have to chase me away so quickly.

550
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:50,056
I won't bother you for long.

551
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:53,939
Well, then.

552
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,413
Please excuse me.

553
00:37:07,915 --> 00:37:09,728
Thank you.

554
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:25,624
Mesa, can I borrow your phone?

555
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:30,468
Are you obsessed with my phone?

556
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:32,520
I told you there's no phone reception.

557
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,602
- Why do you still want it?
- Oh, come on.

558
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,125
I will try to call home.

559
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:39,313
In case they can find me a new volunteer location.

560
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:47,984
What the heck?

561
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:51,312
I explained to Khru Prince already that you went to the city to buy medicines.

562
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,149
Hasn't he forgiven you?

563
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,359
I guess he has.

564
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,245
But what am I supposed to do?

565
00:37:57,245 --> 00:38:03,265
You want me to tell him, "Oh! I changed my mind."

566
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:05,165
"I'm not leaving anymore." Like that?

567
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:06,399
That isn't cool.

568
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:09,046
Not cool? When did you say you're leaving?

569
00:38:09,046 --> 00:38:10,760
Tomorrow morning.

570
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:14,054
Wait a minute. Tomorrow morning?

571
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:15,235
Yes.

572
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:18,719
We haven't even unpacked everything from our bags. Is that cool enough?

573
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,779
Is this some kind of peeking tour? As soon as you get here, you want to leave?

574
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:26,400
Come on, Guys, don't complain. We can finally get out of here.

575
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,384
Give me your phone. I'll try to call home.

576
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:31,679
It's over there. Take it.

577
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,356
Good luck with the reception.

578
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:36,907
Is this one yours?

579
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:39,604
Yes. I just told you to grab it.

580
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:49,565
Come on! Is there no reception at all or what?

581
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:12,723
Hello, Dao. It's me, Fah.

582
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:15,818
I borrowed Mesa's phone.

583
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:18,284
I thought you forgot about your brother.

584
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:19,625
Sorry.

585
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,693
There's no phone signal up here.

586
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,568
I had to walk all over the mountain to get a signal.

587
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:27,779
How are you doing anyway?

588
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:29,742
It's not going very well.

589
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,054
That's why I called.

590
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:35,534
I have a favor to ask.

591
00:39:35,534 --> 00:39:41,310
Can you find me a new volunteer location? Somewhere not here.

592
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,706
I knew you'd call asking for this.

593
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:47,680
Actually, your dad said if you couldn't handle it,

594
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,020
you could come back to Bangkok to do community service.

595
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:53,770
Seriously? What service?

596
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,296
Cleaning the city intersections. Do you want that?

597
00:39:58,036 --> 00:40:02,276
No! Is there anything medical-related?

598
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:04,076
Aren't there any?

599
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:08,659
Dao, I have to go.

600
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,959
I guess I'm being too loud. The people here must be trying to chase me away.

601
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,210
I'll call you again when I go to Chiang Mai downtown.

602
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,295
Sure. See you later.

603
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,352
What the?

604
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:36,417
Haven't you two packed?

605
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:39,725
Ai Fah. Did you talk to Khru Prince last night?

606
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:43,194
No. Why?

607
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:45,764
Follow us and you'll see.

608
00:40:45,764 --> 00:40:48,779
- Hurry.
- Hurry! Why are you standing there?

609
00:41:09,063 --> 00:41:11,257
What is happening here?

610
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:16,069
Khru Prince had the children come help with the cleaning since dawn.

611
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,217
Did you tell him we're not leaving?

612
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:25,745
I noticed that this place is quite rundown.

613
00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:28,055
So I wanted to help you clean it up.

614
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:29,955
Right. We're doing our best.

615
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,379
Do you like it, Dr. Fah?

616
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:34,792
Oh…

617
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:38,296
The kids are helping here. Don't you like that?

618
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:43,453
I do. Of course.

619
00:41:43,453 --> 00:41:45,417
Thank you so much.

620
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:52,039
Dr. Fah, my plaster is about to come off.

621
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:55,413
Is it coming off because you were helping me clean up?

622
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,525
Yes.

623
00:41:56,525 --> 00:42:00,628
Then I'll apply you a new one.

624
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:02,999
- Okay.
- How about a kitty design plaster?

625
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,919
Sure!

626
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:18,769
From what I see, we don't need to hurry home anymore.

627
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:22,201
- I see that, too.
- Okay.

628
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:24,284
I will carefully remove the plaster.

629
00:42:24,284 --> 00:42:26,006
See what?

630
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:29,169
I see we'll be here for a long time.

631
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:34,588
Okay. And we're done.

632
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:37,461
Thank you, Dr. Fah.

633
00:42:49,072 --> 00:42:53,520
I won't tell the Village Headman about the other day,

634
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,356
but if you do anything awful again,

635
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:58,741
I won't let it go.

636
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:05,017
Please keep your eyes on me well, Khun Khru.

637
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:09,527
Please take care of me!

638
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:25,414
Everything about love, in my viewpoint, is chaotic.

639
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:30,422
[Next Week]
Hey! How did you get in here?

640
00:43:30,422 --> 00:43:32,247
Don't you have to conduct a health check-up on the villagers today?

641
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:34,105
I'm feeling hot.

642
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:35,783
If you don't believe me, feel it.

643
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:37,065
I like Khru Prince.

644
00:43:37,065 --> 00:43:39,746
Go and investigate for me to see if he's dating anyone.

645
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:42,523
Shit! I just stepped on pig dung!

646
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:44,454
Are you crazy? Why does it have to be me?

647
00:43:44,454 --> 00:43:46,379
Wait. What are you doing?

648
00:43:46,379 --> 00:43:48,782
Everyone else got a basic check-up.

649
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:52,078
But you get a special checkup.

650
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,760
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

651
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,740
♫ Even in your dreams every night ♫

652
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,910
♫ Love is still waiting for you to come and change your dreams ♫

653
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,570
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

654
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,810
♫ If you're the sea, I will be the sand ♫

655
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:24,000
♫ If you're the sky, please let me be the North star ♫

656
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,250
♫ To guide your heart ♫

657
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:34,360
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫
