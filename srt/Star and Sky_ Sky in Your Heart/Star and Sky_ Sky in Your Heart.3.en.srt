Thanks for taking care of me when I passed out.

- What?
- Really?

164
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:36,574
Oh, boy! This is big news.

165
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:40,533
Okay, Yai. These are your medications.
(T/N: 'Yai' means grandma in Thai but can be used to address elderly women)

166
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,822
I don't think there's any problem.

167
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,787
But I have a problem!

168
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:49,112
Is it true, Ai Fah?

169
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,169
What is it, Yayah?

170
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:54,959
Stop playing dumb. I know everything.

171
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,536
What an unfaithful man. I gave you all my heart.

172
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:02,431
You're actually just a lying city man.

173
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,971
What are you talking about, Yayah? I didn't do anything.

174
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:09,468
Are you a lying city man?

175
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:16,496
Nong Prince.

176
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:19,120
How could you do that to my heart?

177
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,364
What... did I do?

178
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:24,142
I was away for just a while. I trusted you.

179
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,162
Why did you fall for that sweet talker from the city?

180
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:27,538
I'm sad.

181
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,438
I'm so sad.

182
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,109
I'm sad. I'm sad.

183
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,238
Don't talk to me.

184
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:41,175
Goodbye, Khun Khru.

185
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,489
Khun. Khun.

186
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,070
I need to talk to you about something.

187
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,852
About what?

188
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,564
The villagers have been calling me weird names.

189
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:59,800
Really? Me too.

190
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,200
You too?

191
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,109
What is happening?

192
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:08,714
Look at that, being so sweet.

193
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:11,914
What do you mean, Sompor?

194
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:18,461
The villagers say Dr. Fah and Khru Prince are dating.

195
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:22,556
- That's not true.
- I've been observing.

196
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:26,444
Why do you like helping Dr. Fah with his work?

197
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:29,779
Because the Village Headman told me to.

198
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:35,785
Then why do you call Dr. Fah "Khun," but call other people Phi?

199
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:39,298
Well because...

200
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:49,896
Because Dr. Fah is someone special.

201
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,364
I mean… specially annoying.

202
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:58,474
He's specially spoiled.

203
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:01,199
And specially whiny.

204
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,951
That's why I address him that.

205
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,991
That means Dr. Fah isn't a good man, is he?

206
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:08,396
That's right. A very bad man.

207
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,679
Wait a minute.

208
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,318
What are you teaching the children?

209
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:13,885
I'll get out of your way then.

210
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,199
- Bye.
- Bye.

211
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,080
Get home safe.

212
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,509
A very bad man.

213
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,378
[Village Headman's Office]

214
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,851
Ai Fah. Ai Fah.

215
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:38,489
Why is he doing this to me?

216
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:42,397
Will you eat or cry? Choose one.

217
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:44,238
Well, I'm sad.

218
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:46,330
You don't understand a youngster's heart.

219
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,317
You don't get me.

220
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:53,635
Come on. I've had so much experience with love.

221
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,903
But don't be disappointed.

222
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,910
Because I just found you a perfect marriage prospect.

223
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,610
- What?
- Yes.

224
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,293
Here. Eat.

225
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,034
Hey, Fah. There you are.

226
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,379
Do you want a drink?

227
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:23,120
Hold on, master.

228
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,506
I have medical check-ups for the children tomorrow.

229
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:31,579
Are you really my friend Kuafah?

230
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,493
Who are you? Give me back my friend.

231
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:38,298
Are you crazy? Give back, my a**.

232
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:40,230
It's nothing.

233
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,598
I just don't want a problem with the teacher.

234
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,573
I'm tired of listening to his nagging.

235
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:48,473
Ai Fah, you're dating Khru Prince, aren't you?

236
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:51,496
What? What are you talking about?

237
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,820
The locals have been gossiping.

238
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,939
They even say you two are getting married in April.

239
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,554
That's absurd.

240
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:03,459
I was just annoyed with Ai Aou,

241
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:08,231
so I started a rumor that the teacher and you were lovers.

242
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:12,648
I don't know how the rumor switched up and became about me.

243
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:13,944
I get it now.

244
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:18,128
You reap what you sow, man.

245
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,982
I didn't sow anything.

246
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:23,540
I was trying to give my friend happiness.

247
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,590
Good then.

248
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,705
Oh, Ai Mesa.

249
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:34,867
If Khru Prince and I really became lovers,

250
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,433
- what would you say?
- A beating.

251
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,468
- Would you beat me up?
- No, beat up JJ!

252
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:42,150
- A****le.
- I'm just joking.

253
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:46,160
I think I should be okay with that.

254
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,460
At least it's you, not Ai Aou.

255
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,302
That's so true.

256
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:56,040
That Ai Aou guy is such a bragger.

257
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,907
Come on. Let's drink.

258
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,619
Good idea. Wait! No.

259
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,793
I told you I wouldn't drink.

260
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:06,048
You were so smooth just now.

261
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,464
Well, we always drink together.

262
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:11,470
Maybe next time. Bye.

263
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,280
Good luck, guys.

264
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:20,983
How did the rumor turn upside down?

265
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,017
Sorry. I've come to the wrong place.

266
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:34,981
This is my place.

267
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:37,107
Yayah?

268
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,928
Yayah, wake up.

269
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,318
How did you get here?

270
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:44,680
I walked here.

271
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,058
Don't bother me. I'm sleeping.

272
00:16:47,058 --> 00:16:48,574
Yayah, get up.

273
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,160
If people see us, they might get the wrong idea.

274
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,027
No. I won't go home.

275
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:55,741
- Yayah, get up.
- No. I won't.

276
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,900
I don't have anywhere else to go. No.

277
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,579
- Get up!
- No!

278
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:02,628
- I'm not going home.
- Get up!

279
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:04,606
What are you guys up to?

280
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,680
An arranged marriage?

281
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,832
Yes. He's the son of the chief from another village.

282
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:31,527
And why don't you like him? Is he a bad guy?

283
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:34,726
It's not like that. We knew each other as children.

284
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,364
I remember he wasn't good-looking.

285
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:39,957
And he liked snatching my snacks to eat so much he got a big belly.

286
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:43,418
Well, it's not that I like people for their outer appearance.

287
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:45,388
I like their personalities,

288
00:17:45,388 --> 00:17:49,737
their handsomeness and their muscles. Just like Ai Kuafah.

289
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:53,096
I should tell your dad you're here.

290
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:56,599
Please don't. I don't want to get married.

291
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,338
But we can't be alone together. It can be scandalous.

292
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:06,567
It's fine, Khun. Just let her stay.

293
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,041
I just said I couldn't be alone with her. It's not proper.

294
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,054
Who said it would just be you two?

295
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:30,798
Thank you for letting me stay over.

296
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,925
It's only for tonight.

297
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:37,345
We will discuss this again tomorrow.

298
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:45,433
Yayah, I have a question.

299
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:48,086
Why don't you meet him first?

300
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,897
Maybe you two will fall in love after spending time together.

301
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:54,875
Ai Prince, love isn't about time.

302
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,008
We can feel it once our eyes meet.

303
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:01,337
Right, Ai Kuafah?

304
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:12,863
I think I should sleep in the middle.

305
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,649
Otherwise, things might get messy.

306
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,438
Gosh, Ai Prince!

307
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:20,640
You're such a blocker.

308
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:23,368
Get some rest.

309
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:28,583
As for you, you need to work tomorrow.

310
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,420
♫ Taking a journey, no matter how far the horizon ♫

311
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:58,652
Love isn't about time.

312
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:01,010
We can feel it once our eyes meet.

313
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:08,880
♫ But in the end, it's too late, love vanished ♫

314
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,884
Haven't you found Yayah yet?

315
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,428
We haven't.

316
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:40,924
She might be at one of the relatives' houses as always.

317
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:45,439
She should be back once she gets over it.

318
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,302
Can I help you?

319
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:54,794
I heard Yayah ran away.

320
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,383
She did.

321
00:20:56,383 --> 00:21:00,160
She must've realized that she has to get married, so she's acting up.

322
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,260
I don't know what she's afraid of.

323
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,625
The groom is someone she's known since a young age.

324
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:13,003
It's so sudden. She wasn't prepared for it.

325
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:17,079
I think they should get to know each other more.

326
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,817
Then they can get married later.

327
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:21,441
We can't do that, Khru Prince.

328
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:26,428
When a man and a woman meet and don't get married, it violates our beliefs.

329
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:30,613
Besides, it's our tradition.

330
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,049
Tradition?

331
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:33,428
That's right.

332
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:37,905
For generations, our village and their village have bonded by marriage.

333
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:42,455
Yayah's mother is also from that village.

334
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,942
What he says is quite reasonable, Khun.

335
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:53,071
But it's a different era.

336
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:58,094
Marriage should be built on love.

337
00:21:58,094 --> 00:22:00,690
That way, they can live a long and happy married life.

338
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,976
Bravo. I agree with every word he said.

339
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:07,035
As someone who loves…

340
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:10,992
and understands Khru Prince,

341
00:22:10,992 --> 00:22:15,064
I support the idea of marrying someone we love.

342
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:17,064
Right, Dad?

343
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:19,634
And someone I want to marry is…

344
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:22,011
Hey!

345
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:26,095
I just realized that Khru Prince and I need to run an errand.

346
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,533
Will you please excuse me?

347
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:31,709
Wait. What errand?

348
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:36,222
Just go with it. There is something. Follow my lead.

349
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,689
See you later. Goodbye.

350
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:48,122
Khru Prince is shy because of me, right, Dad?

351
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:54,554
So we didn't get the conclusion because of Ai Aou, right?

352
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:56,470
Let me go scold him!

353
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,395
If you go right now, you'll be trapped into getting married.

354
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:01,933
Gosh! I forgot!

355
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:05,985
Go rest inside. We will try to find a way out.

356
00:23:19,376 --> 00:23:22,888
Seriously, why did you lie to her?

357
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:25,939
You know we can never change the Village Headman's mind.

358
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:28,077
What do you want me to do then?

359
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:29,732
Do you want me to send her home?

360
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:31,624
Yes.

361
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:39,015
Each place has its own tradition.

362
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:44,021
Can you take responsibility if something happens to Yayah?

363
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,110
Anyway...

364
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,760
I'll tell Village Headman to come and get her.

365
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,094
Khun, Yayah is gone!

366
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:35,609
Not yet, Dao. I need five more minutes of sleep.

367
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,509
Not that! Yayah disappeared!

368
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,579
"Yayah disappeared"?

369
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,763
She must have heard what we said last night and ran away.

370
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:46,625
It's not safe for a girl to travel alone.

371
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,080
Let's go find her.

372
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,992
Let's search separately.

373
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:52,792
I'll go look at the Village Headman's house.

374
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,123
You look around here.

375
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,900
Yayah.

376
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:08,894
Yayah.

377
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:12,821
Has Yayah not been back yet?

378
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,386
She hasn't.

379
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:18,846
Aou is now searching for her in our relatives' houses.

380
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:23,094
This daughter of mine always causes trouble.

381
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,554
Dad, I have bad news.

382
00:25:25,554 --> 00:25:27,674
The villagers said they saw Yayah running away from the village.

383
00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:31,225
What? Where? Let's go.

384
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:43,594
From what they said, she shouldn't be far from here.

385
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:47,676
How about we go different ways?

386
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,185
Sounds good.

387
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:55,681
- Hey! Yayah!
- Yayah!

388
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,485
- Where is Yayah?
- It hurts!

389
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:59,740
Dad. Are you okay?

390
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,078
I think I sprained my ankle.

391
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:03,639
Yayah!

392
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,591
Yayah. Yayah, stop running.

393
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:07,874
Yayah! Come here!

394
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,590
Khun.

395
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:30,573
Get up. You're heavy.

396
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:40,364
What are you doing?

397
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:44,469
I told you not to get involved with other people's business.

398
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,950
Yayah.

399
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,600
Are you here?

400
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,400
Yayah.

401
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:08,381
Yayah.

402
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:10,670
Are you in there?

403
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,165
This cat has such a high-pitched voice.

404
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:19,925
Show yourself.

405
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:28,789
How did you know?

406
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:30,452
Why are you running away?

407
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:33,720
I don't want to marry someone I don't love.

408
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,415
You guys are taking me home.

409
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:38,754
Why should I go home?

410
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:41,727
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:45,253
I have no clue what to do.

412
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:49,762
I know you're the only one who understands me.

413
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,315
Can I ask you a favor?

414
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,360
I feel sorry she's being forced against her will.

415
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,078
If you were her, would you do it?

416
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:08,854
Marrying someone you don't love.

417
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,632
You're talking about love again. Love. Love. Love. Love.

418
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:15,134
I don't believe in love.

419
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:19,489
Many couples declare their love but break up anyway.

420
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,934
It's not every couple, though.

421
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,388
True, it's not every couple.

422
00:28:23,388 --> 00:28:28,494
But what I meant was, in the end, people who love each other

423
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:32,273
don't always get a happy ending together.

424
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,701
Anyway, forget it.

425
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:41,257
You're still young.

426
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:43,619
You probably don't understand.

427
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,800
Why wouldn't I?

428
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:58,152
Let's talk about this in the village.

429
00:28:58,152 --> 00:29:01,337
It's about to rain. We should hurry back.

430
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,252
Why are you standing there?

431
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,554
Take me back to the village.

432
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,775
I kept running away from you.

433
00:29:21,463 --> 00:29:25,080
- I don't remember the way back now.
- What?

434
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,044
We are back in the same spot again. What the heck?

435
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:58,574
I thought I walked straight. Why do I end up in the same place?

436
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:02,011
I think we should go left.

437
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:03,659
Let's go right, Khun.

438
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,700
I have a feeling we just went that way.

439
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,300
Your feeling got us circling back three times already.

440
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,497
Is it somehow my fault?

441
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:19,570
Aren't you the one who dragged us out here?

442
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,238
Who would think you'd chase me this far?

443
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:28,795
I just wanted to buy Yayah more time, so she could get in Loong Phang's car.

444
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:31,011
Now I'm stuck in the woods with you. Just my bad luck.

445
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:33,561
- Hey!
- What?

446
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:35,130
What?

447
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,885
It's nothing.

448
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:41,272
I just wanted you to stop talking.

449
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:45,751
Have you ever got kicked by someone younger?

450
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:47,455
Bring it on.

451
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:51,307
Damn it!

452
00:30:52,664 --> 00:30:54,800
This time it wasn't me.

453
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,810
Yes, I know that.

454
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,910
It must have been the wind.

455
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:07,894
Let's keep walking.

456
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:18,107
I think we're nearly there.

457
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:21,397
If we turned right as you said, we'd be nowhere.

458
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:23,701
You talk too much.

459
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:28,360
Viah.

460
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,058
What are you doing in the woods?

461
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:32,787
It's not the woods. This is just behind the school.

462
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:35,870
What? Behind the school?

463
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,823
That means we're close to the village, aren't we?

464
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:41,563
By the way…

465
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:45,840
Are you picking up flowers for girls?

466
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,834
No, these are for the wedding decorations.

467
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:52,612
A wedding? Whose wedding?

468
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:56,080
It's P'Yayah's wedding. She finally agrees to the marriage.

469
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
What?

470
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,101
So did you meet your future husband?

471
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:09,595
That's correct!

472
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:14,631
He paid a visit, and we accidentally met in front of the village.

473
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:19,233
And how did you end up agreeing to the marriage?

474
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:23,735
After we talked, I knew right away he was a good man.

475
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,632
Unlike before.

476
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:29,063
Yes? How?

477
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:32,148
Well, his personality is handsome, and he's muscular.

478
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:35,012
He's such a sweet talker, too.

479
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:38,856
The second I looked into his eyes, I fell in love.

480
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,805
Gosh! Speaking about it makes me shy.

481
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:47,345
Those things don't sound like personalities, but congratulations, Yayah.

482
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:51,512
From now on, Ai Kuafah is free.

483
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:55,495
You can date Khru Prince. I don't mind.

484
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,587
Wait. Did you say date, Yayah?

485
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:03,707
Rumors say you two are dating. Is it true?

486
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:05,895
It's not true. That's nonsense.

487
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:10,820
They also say you two are getting married in April.

488
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,846
That's absurd, Yayah!

489
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:16,658
Khun, help me explain.

490
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,475
Be cool, Khun.

491
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:23,566
People will find out what's true and what's not eventually.

492
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:27,435
Why? Or do you want it to be true?

493
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:29,575
Come on!

494
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:34,343
To be honest, you look kind of cute in a sarong.

495
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:36,488
That's true!

496
00:33:51,691 --> 00:33:53,514
I wish you a loving union.

497
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:57,423
And I hope you're blessed with lots of children.

498
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,876
Please love her a lot.

499
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,604
You have a husband now. Please behave.

500
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:14,122
Take good care of each other.

501
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:22,009
Love and cherish each other.

502
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:24,924
Learn to forgive when needed.

503
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,973
Thank you guests who are here.

504
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:40,968
Welcome all of you to Buai and May's wedding.

505
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:45,993
I have a question for both the groom and the bride.

506
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:49,300
What I like the most about May

507
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,820
are her cuteness, her charms,

508
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,770
and her consistency.

509
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,885
It seems like someone is in pain.

510
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:13,726
I guess being at a wedding just triggered his misery.

511
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:17,276
Whatever. Just shut up.

512
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:19,178
Let's just drink.

513
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:23,140
You didn't learn your lesson, did you?

514
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,893
But we're safe here. We don't drive.

515
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:28,265
What are you waiting for? Cheers!

516
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:30,286
Cheers!

517
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:33,483
Get drunk all you want.

518
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:46,005
♪ Where could I move on to? ♪

519
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:53,359
♪ My heart is set on you ♪

520
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:59,395
Why did you bring me home?

521
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:03,612
I want to drink with JJ and Mesa.

522
00:36:03,612 --> 00:36:06,154
They both passed out.

523
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:09,315
They got carried home already.

524
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:13,378
Passed out? Those two lightweights.

525
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:14,995
Losers.

526
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:18,510
Lo-sers!

527
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,544
Before calling them names, you should see yourself.

528
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:25,435
Why? What's wrong with me?

529
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,558
I'm this way.

530
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:30,609
What's wrong with me?

531
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:33,654
I'm still cool.

532
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:36,043
I…

533
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:51,411
How did I get here?

534
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,017
Your bed is a mess because you threw up on it.

535
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:58,141
So I brought you here to sleep.

536
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:02,191
If you don't like it here, you can go to your friends'.

537
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:04,891
No. I'm too lazy.

538
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,810
I don't want to fight over a spot.

539
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,210
Here.

540
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:33,138
What happened? Why did you need to get so drunk?

541
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:36,104
Were you heartbroken from Yayah or what?

542
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,704
No.

543
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:41,715
I was just thinking about my ex.

544
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:48,694
Your friends told me about that.

545
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:51,364
I heard you went to her wedding.

546
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:56,286
Yes. How dumb, right?

547
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,980
No.

548
00:38:00,907 --> 00:38:02,961
At first,

549
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:06,195
I wanted to congratulate her.

550
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:12,786
Smile at her because she met a good person.

551
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:18,978
But in the end, I couldn't get over her.

552
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:23,354
May, do you remember the day we broke up?

553
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,333
Yes.

554
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:34,757
You asked me if I still needed you.

555
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:40,220
What if I say I still do?

556
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,302
You don't need me, Fah.

557
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:46,569
You just don't want to lose me.

558
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:54,893
Can I ask you a question?

559
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:57,201
Why are you marrying Ai Buai?

560
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:01,945
When we were in school, he was a burden to you.

561
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:03,809
He never worked on anything himself.

562
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:07,248
You were always the one helping him.

563
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:11,195
How is he better than me?

564
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:13,310
You're right.

565
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,640
He's not as good-looking as you are.

566
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,857
He's not as smart as you are.

567
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,195
He's not as rich as you are.

568
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:21,795
Then…

569
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,351
Why?

570
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:29,837
Because Buai can't live without me.

571
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:33,555
But you can live fine without me.

572
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:40,386
After hearing the answer,

573
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:43,013
I was sent to repent my sins here.

574
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:52,959
Is it wrong to be smart?

575
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:59,083
Is it wrong to focus so much on building a life that I didn't have time for her?

576
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:03,135
Is it wrong that I don't love myself

577
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:09,555
since I already gave her all my love.

578
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,694
You will get better.

579
00:40:53,972 --> 00:41:01,280
Abracadabra, I wish all your pain turns into butterflies and flies away.

580
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,619
This feeling is priceless.

581
00:41:56,619 --> 00:42:01,462
I just want to feel it and hang on to it for as long as I can.

582
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,492
I'm going back to see you on your birthday.

583
00:42:06,492 --> 00:42:10,936
These are the presents I gave my brother for his previous birthdays.

584
00:42:10,936 --> 00:42:13,159
Why don't you try making a handmade present this year?

585
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,663
Can you try it on for me?

586
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:17,550
My brother and you are around the same size.

587
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,355
P'Fah normally brings girls over.

588
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:23,657
But tonight, he only drank. He didn't bring any girl home.

589
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:27,736
It's like he became someone different after coming back from the mountain.

590
00:42:27,736 --> 00:42:28,908
Hey!

591
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:30,115
We have news for you.

592
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:32,220
Khru Prince is sick.

593
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,910
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

594
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,970
♫ Even in your dreams every night ♫

595
