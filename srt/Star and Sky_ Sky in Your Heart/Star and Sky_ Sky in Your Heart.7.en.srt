♫ And if I only could be there to hold you  ♫

163
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,550
♫ It feels like I stop breathing when you're around ♫

164
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:24,670
♫ I'm in love, there's something about you, I wish you were mine ♫

165
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,301
Wow!

166
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,393
This is more beautiful than I imagined.

167
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,735
What?

168
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:44,489
Is it also your first time here?

169
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:48,313
I'm just like you.

170
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:52,539
I always work. Where would I find the time to explore?

171
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:58,798
Then I'm going to take you on an extremely fun trip.

172
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,335
- Come here.
- Hey!

173
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,609
What are you doing?

174
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:04,663
- What are you going to do?
- Are you curious?

175
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:06,363
Hey!

176
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,770
♫ Do you think love is still waiting for you ♫

177
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:17,490
♫ Did you know I once gave up? How much I've cried for love ♫

178
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,968
- That's enough!
- Come here!

179
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,140
♫ Taking a journey, no matter how far the horizon ♫

180
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,417
♫ No matter how high or steep the mountain ♫

181
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,791
These are pretty.

182
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:38,131
Hey. Let me show you a magic trick.

183
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:39,729
Ta-da!

184
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:43,177
Hey, when did you pick it up?

185
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:57,042
So cute.

186
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:00,968
It's really easy.

187
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,250
♫ Nobody knows that our love is still waiting at the destination ♫

188
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,650
- Bye bye!
- Wait for me!

189
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:19,180
♫ Do you think that our love really exists? ♫

190
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:45,975
You look good in this outfit.

191
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:50,197
What are you saying?

192
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:52,465
I wore Yayah's outfit before.

193
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:54,520
They are similar.

194
00:16:56,863 --> 00:17:00,500
I didn't get a clear look at you back then.

195
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,996
Because...

196
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:04,716
I was on top of you.

197
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:08,313
What do you mean on top?

198
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:12,019
Let's go. The villagers are waiting for us.

199
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:15,695
The locals are so nice.

200
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:19,858
They threw us a welcome party.

201
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:21,743
Now that we're leaving,

202
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:24,223
they're throwing a farewell party for us again.

203
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,996
I'm starting to get why you love it here.

204
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,343
Come on.

205
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:13,521
On my first days here,

206
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:17,792
I always counted down the days I would get to leave,

207
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,563
but after I got to know everyone,

208
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,807
after I got to live here,

209
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,738
it makes me want to be a better person.

210
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:32,432
Surprisingly, I don't want to leave anymore.

211
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:36,890
If there's ever a chance, I hope we get to meet again.

212
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,197
Thank you so much for having me all this time.

213
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,938
Anything else you want to add, Dr. Fah?

214
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,817
What is it?

215
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:02,853
If you want to say anything to anyone in particular, do it now.

216
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:05,349
Everyone is waiting to hear it.

217
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:12,859
Well...

218
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,563
That's all that I wanted to say to everyone.

219
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:21,107
I should keep the rest personal.

220
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:23,740
Gosh! This is not fun at all.

221
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,408
Thank you.

222
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,501
Doctor, would you like to try this?

223
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:40,293
- What is it?
- Raw beef spicy salad.

224
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,263
I think I'll pass.

225
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,538
But thank you so much.

226
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:45,038
Doctor.

227
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:51,914
Thank you so much for taking care of the villagers' health.

228
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:55,556
We all wish you good luck in life.

229
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:56,741
Thank you very much.

230
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,965
Please enjoy the party.

231
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:02,223
Khru Prince, are you leaving?

232
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,418
When I'm away, don't be naughty, Viah.

233
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,477
Khru Prince.

234
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:17,845
Will you go for a walk with me?

235
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:20,745
Oh!

236
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:24,658
Can I borrow your teacher for a while?

237
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,458
You can take him.

238
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,672
Where are we going?

239
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:39,212
They say there's a nice place for watching fireflies up there.

240
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:41,112
I'm taking you there.

241
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:43,078
Be careful here.

242
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:47,086
Don't get lost in the woods like the last time.

243
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:52,678
I've studied the route.

244
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:56,996
I assure you we won't get lost this time.

245
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,657
Why?

246
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:02,249
Don't you trust me?

247
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,530
No.

248
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:13,734
You don't trust me.

249
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:15,627
Then why are you holding my hand?

250
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:18,305
If you do something bad,

251
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:21,758
I'll crush your hand until it's broken.

252
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,131
"Crush until it's broken"?

253
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,695
How strong. I'm so scared.

254
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,649
Ai Fah! Ai Fah!

255
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,549
Bad news!

256
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,473
The villagers are having bad diarrhea.

257
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:37,070
They all have a stomachache. Hurry, come take a look!

258
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,566
My stomach hurts.

259
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:48,261
From what I checked, I think they're having food poisoning.

260
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:51,026
Probably the spicy raw beef salad.

261
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,369
Did you eat it, Doctor?

262
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:55,786
No, I didn't. I was afraid of food poisoning.

263
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:59,452
Then we should separate who ate it.

264
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,647
Everyone is at risk.

265
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:03,363
That's right.

266
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:08,868
Please help take those who have serious symptoms to the health center.

267
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:11,758
Let's get moving.

268
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:14,484
If your symptoms are severe, proceed to the health center.

269
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:16,801
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

270
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,320
- The doctor is coming.
- Please wait a moment.

271
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,018
My stomach hurts!

272
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:23,576
You'll get better soon.

273
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,018
Please wait a moment for the Doctor.

274
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:26,022
Where is the pain?

275
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:27,700
You'll be given this first.

276
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,400
Please give the meds to these three patients.

277
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:33,620
How is this patient doing?

278
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,835
What do we do?

279
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:44,282
Your condition has improved.

280
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:49,676
Take these medicines home and get some rest.

281
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:51,739
Yes. Thank you so much.

282
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,338
Sorry. I fell asleep.

283
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:12,078
Did you get any sleep at all?

284
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:14,718
It's good you got to rest.

285
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:20,524
I always work the night shift like this. I am used to it.

286
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:29,242
Are you two traveling with me to Chiang Mai?

287
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,567
What's going on?

288
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:35,672
Your volunteer time is up.

289
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:38,617
We don't want to keep bothering you.

290
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,518
So I thought I'd bring you both down at the same time.

291
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:47,494
Not yet.

292
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:50,508
The villagers are still sick.

293
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:54,226
When they are fully recovered, I will go myself.

294
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,332
That's right.

295
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:57,521
I will stay and help him.

296
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:00,096
Thank you very much.

297
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:03,499
I'm going to run an errand in Chiang Mai then.

298
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:05,949
Sure. Thank you so much.

299
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,414
You're going home later than scheduled.

300
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:16,718
Will your mom be worried?

301
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:21,311
She will complain if I leave you behind.

302
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,724
That means your mom is starting to warm up to me, right?

303
00:24:27,724 --> 00:24:32,543
That means my mom teaches me to be nice.

304
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:36,335
Come on.

305
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:39,994
If you're worried about me, just admit it.

306
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,250
[Medication Room]

307
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,218
Khru Prince.

308
00:24:58,218 --> 00:25:00,118
Hey, Khun.

309
00:25:00,118 --> 00:25:01,536
Let's eat.

310
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:04,496
Loong Phang made us grilled pork and sticky rice.

311
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:10,448
You go ahead. I need to do prescriptions.

312
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:20,649
Eat first.

313
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:23,069
You haven't eaten anything since the morning, right?

314
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:24,869
Just a moment.

315
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,581
Here.

316
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:38,637
I told you you can take care of others, but don't forget to take care of yourself, too.

317
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:47,112
Why should I take care of myself...

318
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:50,716
when I have you to do it?

319
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:56,447
What are you saying? Eat it yourself.

320
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:59,239
What? What should I do?

321
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:02,842
I haven't eaten anything all day. I'm starving

322
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:04,642
My hands are full.

323
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:06,696
- What should I do?
- You!

324
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:09,662
Hurts! My stomach hurts.

325
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:11,231
I think I'm having gastritis.

326
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:13,412
Here.

327
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,920
Acting like a child.

328
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,685
Thank you.

329
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:36,045
So everyone is getting better.

330
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:38,091
What a relief.

331
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:39,944
That's right.

332
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:45,672
Should we continue where we left off?

333
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,127
What is it?

334
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:54,916
If we take a right turn here, we will reach the place to watch the fireflies.

335
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:59,419
Is it okay with you if we stop by for a little while?

336
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:03,916
Sure. Let's go.

337
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,356
Come on.

338
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,929
Hey Khun, your hand is burning hot.

339
00:27:15,543 --> 00:27:17,800
Maybe because the weather is hot.

340
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:21,448
That's not it. The weather isn't hot at all.

341
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,321
Are you sick?

342
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:25,448
That's nonsense.

343
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:28,691
I'm doing okay.

344
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:30,191
Khun!

345
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:33,569
This is not okay.

346
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:35,825
Gosh!

347
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,220
You're burning up.

348
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,847
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

349
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:43,811
Come on. Let's get back.

350
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,311
Can you walk?

351
00:28:03,757 --> 00:28:05,657
I'm sorry.

352
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:09,852
I didn't know it'd be this bad.

353
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:11,915
Of course, it's bad.

354
00:28:11,915 --> 00:28:14,362
You are burning up.

355
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:19,596
Next time, if you feel sick, let me know immediately.

356
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:25,622
You complain about me, but you don't take care of yourself, either.

357
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,977
I really want to spank you.

358
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,894
I'm sorry.

359
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:42,424
Get some rest. I'll take care of you.

360
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,939
Is Prince sick?

361
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:55,939
Yes. What is it?

362
00:28:55,939 --> 00:29:00,901
JJ asked me to come fetch you. There are more people having stomachaches.

363
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:02,944
- But I have to...
- You go.

364
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:04,765
I will watch Khru Prince here.

365
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,996
Hurry back when you're done.

366
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,845
Okay.

367
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:14,496
Khun, I'll be right back.

368
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,757
Go ahead.

369
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,926
I will get some sleep.

370
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,756
Please take care of him.

371
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:32,633
Just go.

372
00:29:38,831 --> 00:29:40,673
Damn it, Fah.

373
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:46,254
Seeing you now reminds me of the old you.

374
00:29:46,254 --> 00:29:48,213
How?

375
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,319
A workaholic.

376
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,862
All he did was work. He didn't even eat.

377
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,440
He barely went out to see his friends.

378
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:02,549
He didn't have time for his ex, either.

379
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,378
But it's in the past.

380
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:12,254
He's better now.

381
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:18,858
Sorry, I keep talking. You should get some rest.

382
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:31,036
[House of Soontaree Vechanont]

383
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,022
Hi.

384
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:42,601
- Hello, Madam.
- Hi, Village Headman.

385
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:44,436
Is this Sincere?

386
00:30:44,436 --> 00:30:46,536
That's right.

387
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:49,401
You've grown to be a handsome man.

388
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:54,046
Sincere, this is the Village Headman, who is taking care of Prince up on the mountain.

389
00:30:54,046 --> 00:30:57,046
Hello.

390
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:59,899
Khru Prince is very nice.

391
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,688
He takes care of the children and everyone so well.

392
00:31:03,688 --> 00:31:05,505
Really?

393
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:10,456
Recommending him to you was a great idea, wasn't it?

394
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,807
How is he doing?

395
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:14,786
He's doing fine.

396
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:17,017
He should be back in a couple of days.

397
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:23,616
The villagers had diarrhea, so Khru Prince volunteered to stay and help.

398
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:27,871
- Have you been doing well?
- I have.

399
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:29,450
What about you? Are you doing well?

400
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,920
I am.

401
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,028
Prince, are you okay?

402
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,828
What's going on?

403
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:41,358
I have no clue. His body is so cold.

404
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,369
- He's shivering non-stop.
- Let me see.

405
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,534
Khun.

406
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:47,780
Can you hear me?

407
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,184
I can.

408
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:54,310
Do you have a headache? Are you feeling nauseous?

409
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,396
A little.

410
00:31:56,396 --> 00:32:00,988
I wanted to throw up just now, but it wouldn't come out.

411
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:05,684
Is it...

412
00:32:07,745 --> 00:32:09,418
Ai Fah!

413
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:11,486
Ai Fah, where are you going?

414
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:23,631
Hey, why are you back here?

415
00:32:24,296 --> 00:32:26,496
I came to find the medicine.

416
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:28,161
What medicine?

417
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:32,055
If you're looking for antibiotics, I moved them to the other room.

418
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:35,526
Not that.

419
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:46,906
I came to find the medicine to treat Malaria.

420
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,480
The Mosquito-borne disease?

421
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,180
Don't tell me Khru Prince...

422
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,761
Yes.

423
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:00,602
If Prince doesn't get treated immediately,

424
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:02,981
he might die.

425
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:16,441
My car broke down. I'm still fixing it, Doctor.

426
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:19,681
Do we have any other cars?

427
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,489
I need to quickly send Khru Prince for treatment.

428
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,336
Village Headman has one,

429
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:27,253
but he's in Chiang Mai now.

430
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:32,315
How do we contact people outside the village?

431
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,933
Hello.

432
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,460
Where are you?

433
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,808
Are you somewhere my heart belongs?

434
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:42,321
That's right.

435
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,562
I'm right where your heart is at.

436
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:46,980
How are you doing over there?

437
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,535
I'm doing fine but missing you so much.

438
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:53,071
Yayah! Yayah!

439
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:55,401
What is it?

440
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,094
Can I borrow your walkie-talkie?

441
00:33:57,094 --> 00:33:58,340
What is happening?

442
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,446
- Khru Prince is deadly sick.
- What?

443
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:03,798
I'm going to contact someone to send an ambulance.

444
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:05,256
All right. Of course.

445
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:07,743
Ai Tonnam, talk to you later.

446
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:11,183
Thank you so much.

447
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:22,267
Hi. Is anyone there?

448
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,899
Hello.

449
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,219
Can anyone hear me?

450
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,649
Hello.

451
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,880
You haven't reached anyone down the mountain yet?

452
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:37,221
No.

453
00:34:37,968 --> 00:34:40,593
I asked Yayah's husband.

454
00:34:40,593 --> 00:34:43,097
There's no car in that village either.

455
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:46,736
Are you cold?

456
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:49,093
Let me get you a scarf.

457
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:05,863
This necklace...

458
00:35:05,863 --> 00:35:08,552
You haven't given it to the children yet?

459
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,461
I lied.

460
00:35:23,461 --> 00:35:27,863
I wasn't going to give it to the children.

461
00:35:27,863 --> 00:35:31,126
It's for you, but...

462
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:33,361
many things happened.

463
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,985
Well then...

464
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:47,596
Can I give it to you now?

465
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:52,171
In case my treatment is prolonged.

466
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:02,980
Thank you.

467
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,050
Here.

468
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:26,202
You must get well soon.

469
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:34,248
After your recovery, I have something for you as well.

470
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:37,755
Of course.

471
00:36:38,954 --> 00:36:41,183
Get some sleep.

472
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:46,121
Loong Phang should be done fixing his car by tomorrow morning.

473
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:15,877
Fah has been silent for two days.

474
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:18,157
I don't know if something happened to him.

475
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:20,033
Don't worry.

476
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:21,330
Let's do this.

477
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,775
If he doesn't reach out by tomorrow,

478
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,073
I'll take you to Chiang Mai to see him. Okay?

479
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:28,323
We don't have to do that.

480
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:30,920
Just stay with me.

481
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,150
Okay, let's eat then.

482
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:42,246
Good boy.

483
00:37:42,246 --> 00:37:45,741
You'll be rewarded when we're in our room.

484
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:51,490
Kluen! What did you say?

485
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:54,155
Why are you turning red?

486
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:58,172
I'm not.

487
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:02,902
I meant I'd kiss you on the cheek.

488
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:05,043
What were you thinking?

489
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,655
Nothing. I didn't think of anything.

490
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:11,365
Okay, fine. You didn't.

491
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:13,396
Let's just eat.

492
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,795
How is it going, Loong Phang?

493
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:23,472
The rain is pouring.

494
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:27,454
For me to get it done, the rain must stop first.

495
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:40,041
Khun! Khun!

496
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,815
We have no other options right now.

497
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:52,455
I'll carry you down the mountain.

498
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,566
Please bear with me a bit longer.

499
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:57,617
Will you be okay?

500
00:38:57,617 --> 00:39:00,238
I have to be.

501
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:04,259
If we delay any further, you can die.

502
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:08,202
You trust me, don't you?

503
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,501
I'm in your hand.

504
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:44,947
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

505
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:47,073
I am fine.

506
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:50,807
Why the hell is it raining right now?

507
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,784
Come on. Let's go.

508
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:01,380
I should walk on my own, so it's not too heavy for you.

509
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,180
Are you sure?

510
00:40:07,953 --> 00:40:09,390
Khun!

511
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:11,708
Khun!

512
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:15,498
- Prince!
- Prince!

513
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,466
What's happening to him?

514
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:22,227
He's got Malaria. He needs to go to a hospital now or he might die.

515
00:40:22,227 --> 00:40:23,639
Get in my car.

516
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,139
Quickly!

517
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:29,705
You're nearly there.

518
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,062
Hold on.

519
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:38,544
Let us travel alone.

520
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:39,835
Why?

521
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:41,081
Do you need to ask?

522
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:42,961
Look at him.

523
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:46,464
Do you have any idea how fragile he is?

524
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:49,421
I didn't intend for this to happen!

525
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,043
That's enough.

526
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:53,120
Let me take care of Prince.

527
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,939
We can clearly see that you can't take care of him at all.

528
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:03,710
Ai Fah, what are you doing here?

529
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,610
Pba Cham's condition is getting worse.

530
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,154
She throws up everything she eats.

531
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:10,354
Her grandchild is having the same symptoms.

532
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:13,481
I can't go, JJ. I'm sending Khru Prince to a hospital.

533
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:15,187
Just go on.

534
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:20,170
I'll be fine,

535
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,770
but the villagers might not be without you.

536
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,908
Because Buai can't live without me.

537
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:29,850
But without me, you'll be fine, Fah.

538
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,750
The Fah that I know always chooses work over me.

539
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,638
So no matter how many times we start over, you will choose work every time.

540
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:44,338
It's your job, after all.

541
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,941
Ai Fah!

542
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,565
Please take care of Khru Prince.

543
00:41:58,565 --> 00:42:00,833
I will. You don't need to tell me.

544
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:06,711
Hey!

545
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,060
I said this before, didn't I?

546
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,571
I might be climbing the Himalaya mountains to meet someone waiting up there.

547
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:15,453
Ai Fah.

548
00:42:15,453 --> 00:42:19,162
- And today, I realized...
- Hey! Come on.

549
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,880
the person up there is just me,

550
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,207
who has never changed.

551
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:36,486
[I will climb the Himalayas to see you once again.]

552
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,331
Do you realize you slept the whole day?

553
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:45,420
So where is Dr. Fah?

554
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,982
Dr. Fah left the mountain already.

555
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:48,798
He's probably on his way back to Bangkok.

556
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:50,669
Do you still keep in touch with Dr. Fah?

557
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,972
I got his number from the Village Headman, but I can't reach him no matter how many times I've called.

558
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:56,554
He's probably so busy with work that he's forgotten me already.

559
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,170
What? Are you giving up already?

560
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,597
Life is that simple.

561
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:04,107
You don't need reasons to like something.

562
00:43:04,107 --> 00:43:06,331
I just want Prince to meet a good person.

563
00:43:06,331 --> 00:43:07,800
Someone who can really take care of him.

564
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,845
From now on, please take care of him.

565
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:15,770
♫ Do you believe that there is still hope for your love? ♫

566
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:18,820
♫ Even in your dreams every night ♫

567
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,950
♫ Love is still waiting for you to come and change your dreams ♫

568
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,650
♫ So they can turn into reality ♫

569
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,810
♫ If you're the sea, I will be the sand ♫

570
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:38,040
♫ If you're the sky, please let me be the North Star ♫

571
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,300
♫ To guide your heart ♫

572
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,450
♫ To be next to mine, like the sky and starlight ♫
