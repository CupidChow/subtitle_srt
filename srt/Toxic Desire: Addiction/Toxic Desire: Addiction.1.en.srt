psychology with Doctor Choi

Didn't he used to be the
professor of Police University?

Hello

28
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:01,583
Doctor Choi is a former professor
and also a former profiler

29
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,875
He is currently a psychiatrist

30
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,958
As we said last week

31
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,166
This week's subject is
'Memories of Serial Murder'

32
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,750
'Professor Choi'

33
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:21,375
'Wife of former professor commits
suicide after sexual assault'

34
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,166
Serial murder is a memory to the killers

35
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,875
Some murders believe that
some victims wanted to be killed

36
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,791
They think that the victims thank them

37
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,791
It's a sort of mental conviction

38
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,333
I see

39
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,291
Fallacy of a human trash

40
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,916
I assume it's not easy to work as a profiler

41
00:06:53,916 --> 00:07:01,041
Profiling examines the method of killing of--

42
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,583
Profilers still don't know if they are normal humans

43
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,041
It is possible to execute serial killers

44
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,875
But in order stop serial murders completely

45
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,375
We have to know their
psychological motivation

46
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:24,833
Serial killers vindicate their act of killing

47
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,291
In this case, scientific basis are not enough

48
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,791

53
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,833

80
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,166
I don't like to stand out

81
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,291
When I walk out on the streets

82
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,416
Many guys stare at me

83
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,750
Whenever they do, I feel like peeing

84
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,958
Don't you guys know that feeling?

85
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,833
The exhilarating feeling when you
hold your pee for a long time

86
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,291
and then go to the bathroom

87
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,791
- I know
- It's like riding a viking

88
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,250
You know how it feels
when the viking comes down?

89
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,250
Guys who stare at me are disgusting

90
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,708
- Why?

91
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,541
Sometimes I imagine killing them all

92
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,333
I hold his head

93
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,625
Hold a knife

94
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,166
And I cut his neck

95
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,291
But when I wake up

96
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:56,000
I find myself lying on a
motel bed with a guy

97
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,708
I couldn't remember anything

98
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,375
That's my problem

99
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,875
I have short memories

100
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,500
I'm crying

101
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,375
- Can I use it too?
- Don't you have your own?

102
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,666
I think your estrogen levels are low

103
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:22,083
Don't talk like you will inject
estrogen for me

00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,750
It hurts!

105
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,875
I beat up a guy one day

106
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,291
He started to cry

107
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,666

But she's not my biological sister

She was adopted
when she was young

118

thousands of years to meet each other

After that day,
I always protected my sister

at her love towards me

But I never got jealous

163
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,166
I just kept an eye on her

164
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,000
Maybe I can call that as
'Giving her freedom'

- I'm sorry
- How dare you

176

Long time no talk

177
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,708
It was recorded on the victim's phone

178
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,250
We requested an analysis
at the National Forensic Service

179
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,125
But they failed to specify who it is

180
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,958
The offender's voice was not recorded

investigate on my patient?

What did you talk about?

186
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,916
Are you asking me to hand over
my patient's medical chart

187
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,125
without the patient's permission?

188

00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:40,416
Could you please
share her medical chart?

190
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,666
Weren't you also a police before?

191
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,125
I quitted long time ago

192
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,958
Alright

193
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,166
Doctor Choi isn't a person to do such thing

194
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's just have dinner together

195
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,333
I will be waiting

196
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,125
What a jerk

197
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,250
Do you think the
victim's girlfriend is the killer?

198
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,250
I'm not sure

199
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,625
But I can smell something

200
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,625
Of course you can

201
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,750
Pretty woman smells nice

202
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,083
Cut it off,
any results on fingerprints?

203
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,458
Why ask when you know

204
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:25,541
Forensic scientists
examined the scene but found nothing

205
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,583
The scene was completely cleaned

206
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,875
It was so clean that
it didn't look like a crime scene

207
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,791
Ji-Soo, the victim's girlfriend

208
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,833
Keep a close eye on her

209
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,041
Okay

210
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,875
Go home now

211
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,458
Yes ma'am!

212
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,583
Thank you!

213
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:56,916
The victim is the son of the
CEO of a conglomerate

214
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,958
I'm getting pressure
from the people above

215
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,333
Please help me

216
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,208
All three people who died until now
were related to Ji-Soo

217
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:19,541
Isn't it obvious that she killed them?

218
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:26,166
Don't you know that you need
physical evidence to arrest her?

219
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,750
Yes I do but--

220
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Anyways, I can't give you
her medical chart

221
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,750
I'm sure that you know it's illegal

222
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,500
Alright

223
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,541
By the way

224
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,166
You look very stressed

225
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,083
It's been 3 years already
since your wife died

226
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,541
It's time for you to get over with it

227
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,250
I think you are tipsy

228
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,708
Yes I am

229
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,875
But I want you to be happy

230
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,291
It wasn't even your fault

231
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,125
I'll get going first

232
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,041
Don't drink too much

233
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:21,958

That monster said to me

242
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,416
He said it's not your fault

243
00:24:58,708 --> 00:24:59,916
He said it

244
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,375

I'm so sorry for you

It's not your fault

250
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,416
It's not your fault

251
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,125
I know but--

252
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,500
My heart is tearing apart

253
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,875
It hurts inside here so much

I'm so sorry

'Psychiatrist - Doctor Choi'

264
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,416
Hello?

265
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,541
Your outfit is beautiful today

266
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,791
Thank you

267
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,875
You seem happy today

268
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:16,625
Have you had any
psychiatric treatment before?

269
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,458
Nope

270
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:23,625
Do you have something to say right now?

271
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:34,666
I feel that an imaginary person
watches me all the time

272
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,166
But people don't believe what I say

273
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,583
They say I'm crazy

274
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:47,166
Since when did the
imaginary person watch you?

275
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,708
10 years ago
When I was 18 years old

276
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:56,958
Since when my dad passed away
and my brother went missing

277
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:01,125
Since then,
I lived all by myself

278
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,916
That's when it started to watch me

279
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,458
That's why I have a hard time sleeping

280
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,750
I see

281
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:16,666
Do you always feel lonely?

282
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,833
Not always

283
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,875
Only when I have bad dreams
or scissors locked

284
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:34,958
Do you ever have bad dreams
or scissors locked?

285
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,083
Of course

286
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:42,875
I also have bad dreams
or get scissors locked occasionally

287
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:47,083
Then you should have a
hard time sleeping like me

288
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,875
Is it because of your wife?

289
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,166
I am not the patient

290
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,625
You're the patient and I'm the doctor

291
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,041
Excuse me?

292
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,375
Would you like a cigarette?

293
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,333
It helps you forget bad memories

294
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,791

295
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:43,250

Excuse me Ms. Ji-Soo?

It's my home address

00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:23,875

299
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,875
Don't you want to know what it is?

300
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,708
Did you ask the police to
investigate on that imaginary person?

301
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,125
Yes I did

302
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:44,333
The police tails me everyday
but found out nothing

303
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:52,958
But I think you can find out what it is

00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:56,625
Do you have any
good memories recently?

311
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:01,666
It's when I met Gun-Woo

312
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:07,291
Is he your boyfriend?

313
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,666
We never got into a relationship

314
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,000
We were just sex partners

315
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:17,833
How long was he your sex partner?

316
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,458
Do I have to answer?

317
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,833
Gun-Woo always made me
happy and kept me entertained

318
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,166
Okay

319
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:44,125

There is one!

sad except for me

00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,958

329
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,833

I love that person

330
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:36,333
Why did you just leave when you
came to my house yesterday?

331

courage to knock on the door?

332
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,625
Or did you not believe me?

333

334
00:35:57,166 --> 00:36:00,625

I hope you can cure me
so I can get sleep well

Why did you just leave when you
came to my house yesterday?

341
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:53,291
Did you not have the
courage to knock on the door?

Did you see who it is?

350

Is it someone that you know?

I don't know

Did you see how it came in?

Why not?

358
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:59,791
Don't you want to catch it?

359
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:06,625
Things will get complicated

00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:20,458
What if I do?

377
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,375
I will love you until I die

378
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,375
You seem to be in a good mood today

379
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:14,875
Doctor Choi

380
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,958
My sister got a new toy recently

381
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:26,375
But I think it's different
from the ones she have

382
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:32,416
But she'll get bored of it soon
like she normally does

383
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:36,416
About the promise that you
made with your sister--

384
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,625
The promise?

385
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,208
If she keeps the promise

386
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:45,208
I will let her love--

387
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:47,125
No

388
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:49,583
I will let her have sex with another guy

389
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,750
Just for 7 days

390
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:56,250
What if she breaks the promise?

391
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,291
- What will you do?
- Don't say that

392
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,250
She will never break the promise

393
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:06,208
Because she always listens to what I say

394
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:17,125
But if she breaks the promise by any chance

395
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,875
I will not let her play the game anymore

396
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:33,250
Alright

397
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:42,125
'Subin's Flower Garden'

398
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,291
You're going to come
to my place tonight, right?

399
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,791
Why do you think that I will go?

400
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,666
I am sure you will be
knocking on my door tonight

401
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:21,541
Make sure you bring some
whine and flower

402
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,375
100 red roses please

403
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,958
Are you sure that I will go tonight?

404
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,250
Of course

405
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:33,416
I can tell it from your eyes

406
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:20,833
[Eerie music]

407
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:20,291
The imaginary person
came to my house today

408
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,333
Really?

409
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,625
Did you see it?

410
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:31,041
It came when I was sleeping

411
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,458
I woke up from the door sound

412
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,583
I think it has the keys to my house

413
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,666
This is the imaginary person's trace

414
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,625
I believe it's not your hair

415
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:04,291
From now on,
I will stay with you all the time

416
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:10,250
Do you know it's your second time here?

417
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:14,458
Does that matter?

418
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:16,916
Our time to farewell got closer

419
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:21,000
It's only our second date

420
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,916
Why do you think about
breaking up already?

421
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,875
Everyone said
they will stay besides me forever

422
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:32,375
But they all eventually broke up with me

423
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:38,458
That's why I think that
"Our time to farewell is getting closer"

424
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:46,875
Rather than thinking that
"Our time to be together remains long"

425
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,083
No Ji-Soo

426
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,750
I will always be with you

427
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:14,125
I will always stay near you

428
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:28,958
I want to keep
each bits of you inside me

429
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,708
So that I can remember you forever

430
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,916
Seems like your busy these days

431
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:43,500
Yes I am

432
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,875
What brings you here?

433
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,916
You were out of office yesterday

434
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,083
I was out on business

435
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:51,916
Even the day before

436
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,166
Excuse me?

437
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:58,333
Are you stalking me?

438
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,666
Why do you keep visiting me?

439
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:03,166
Doctor Choi

440
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,375
Did you sleep with her?

441
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:09,750
What?

442
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,208
I guess you did

443
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,625
Now I get it

444
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,916
Bye

445
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
How can you do this to me?

446
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,500
That's enough

447
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,416
- It's none of your business
- What?

448
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:34,833
Do you really think like that?

449
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:40,083
I loved you for the past 10 years

450
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,041
Even after you got married

451
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:45,791
Then suddenly So-Won died

452
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:49,541
I know it's not right but I was relieved

453
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:52,291
How is this not business?

454
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:54,625
I'm tired

455
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,000
Let's talk later

456
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:57,708
Do you know what you're doing?

457
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:00,458
Don't you know that
all of her boyfriends died?

458
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,625
Do you want to die like them?

459
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,541
I think someone is stalking her

460
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:07,000
The stalker might be the killer

461
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,416
You're willing to risk your life
to stay with her?

462
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:14,166
Can you find some information about
her brother who went missing 10 years ago?

463
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,791
He might be the imaginary person

464
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,000
Are you serious?

465
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,375
Don't you feel sorry for me?

466
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:28,333
This was found in Ji-Soo's house

467
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,375
Test the DNA of it

468
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:24,583
Is it here?

469
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:27,000
Yeah

470
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,208
Let's go in

471
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,416
We might find some evidence

472
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:37,750
I never wanted to come here again

473
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,750
Ji-Soo

474
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:21,000
Turn back and look at daddy

475
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,083
Now!

476
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,083
Right now!

477
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,458
That's it

478
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,583
Keep looking here

479
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,541
You're such a good girl

480
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:36,625
Turn a little more!

481
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,791
That's it good girl

482
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:41,875
Turn a bit more
and keep looking at me

483
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:45,625
Lay down on the floor now

484
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,833
Move!

485
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,000
Hurry!

486
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:54,083
That's it

487
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,458
Daddy's asking you a favor

488
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,916
Lay down!

489
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:00,875
Right now!

490
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,083
That's it

491
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:08,000
Say 'Daddy'

492
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,958
Come on and say it

493
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,333
- Say it!
- Daddy

494
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:19,375
Daddy

495
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,833
- That's it
- Daddy!

496
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,708
- Keep going
- Daddy

497
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,916
Daddy

498
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,291
Good

499
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:30,375
- Daddy
- Daddy's here

500
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:37,625
Are you okay?

501
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:42,125
Close your eyes

502
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,125
Let's try a little more

503
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:51,250
We are now in the winter of 1999

504
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:55,458
You are adopted by a rich family

505
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,583
You have a new father and new brother

506
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,375
Do they like you?

507
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:06,416
Yes, I think so

508
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:11,708
Do you like your new brother?

509
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:13,958
A little bit

510
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:20,833
Now, you grew up
to a high school student

511
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:25,750
Tell me about your worries

512
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,291
My dad and brother fights everyday

513
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,708
Dad is hitting my brother

514
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,125
What do I do?

515
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:47,875
Time passed and
you are an adult now

516
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,875
Men are dying

517
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:01,541
Every man dad I love are dying

518
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:04,250
But I'm a nice person

519
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:08,541
I just wanted to do better

520
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,791
Ji-Soo!

521
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,125
It's not your fault

522
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:06,916
I don't like it

523
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:21,875
I think I am very sick

524
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:27,416
I didn't know before I met you

525
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,125
I think I am sick too

526
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,791
Because you are sick

527
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,791
Doctor Choi

528
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:50,666
Do you know it's your
fifth time coming to my house?

529
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,375
Well

530
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm not sure

531
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:01,583
Ji-Soo

532
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:05,500
There's no need to count

533
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:12,041
Because I will stay besides you forever

534
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:19,916
I will do so like we are now

535
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:24,041
So don't worry and have some sleep

536
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:29,666
Will you stay until I fall asleep?

537
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:33,125
Of course

538
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:37,500
I love watching you fall asleep

539
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,708
Are you leaving?

540
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:03,791
'This is my last warning,
stay away from Ji-Soo'

541
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:26,416
Now, time goes very slowly

542
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,125
You arrived at--

543
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:34,875
At the house that you
lived with your new family

544
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:37,666
10 years ago

545
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:42,666
What happened in that house?

546
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,583
I'm sorry dad

547
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:57,833
Please forgive me

548
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:02,250
I'm sorry so please forgive me

549
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,875
It hurts

550
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:09,083
I'm sorry dad, please stop

551
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,333
Please don't kill me

552
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:57,541
Please don't kill me

553
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,583
Please stop!

554
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,333
Please stop

555
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:07,375
Please don't

556
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,375
Stop!

557
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:24,083
Please stop

558
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,625
- Stop!
- Damn it!

559
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:43,458
You're a good girl

560
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:45,250
Start now

561
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,250
Damn it!

562
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:01,833
Why are you being a bad girl?

563
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,583
I'm sorry, please stop

564
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,625
Dad!

565
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,500
Die

566
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,083
Die

567
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:41,958
Die

568
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:46,541
Die!

569
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:53,583
Die

570
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,208
Ji-Soo!

571
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,833
- Detective Kim
- Yes ma'am

572
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:58,000
Find out about Ji-Hoon

573
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,541
Ji-Soo's brother?

574
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:01,541
Yeah

575
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:04,375
Did you get the results of the DNA test?

576
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:06,125
Let me see

577
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,958
Find his name, address,
or anything related to him

578
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:15,208
Also, Ji-Soo's stepfather
died 10 years ago

579
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,833
Find out about him too

580
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,875
Yes ma'am

581
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:42,958
Recently, my sister is giving love to the toy

582
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:45,416
This is not right

583
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:50,375
She was never like this before

584
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,125
To be honest

585
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:57,666
When I see my sister with a guy

586
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:02,666
I feel like killing them both

587
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:07,708
But I only think like this sometimes

588
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:14,208
Doctor Choi, my patience is wearing out

589
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:19,083
I really can't stand it this time

590
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:30,583
Why do you protect your sister
when she's a man-eater?

591
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,625
Come on Doctor!

592
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:36,875
My sister is not a man-eater

593
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:41,375
She is just like a child

594
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:45,125
Children get excited
when they get a new toy

595
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:50,125
But they eventually
get bored of it and find a new toy

596
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:54,291
One day, she will end up
coming back to me

597
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:59,666
I'm the only one who is her true love

598
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,500
Have you heard about voyeurism?

599
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,958
The victim never says okay to it

600
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:12,250
Have you ever dated a girl
apart from your sister?

601
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:15,625
No sir

602
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:20,708
My sister is my only love

603
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:27,375
Alright

604
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:42,500
It's freezing

605
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:15,291
As time goes,
you will be much happier

606
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:17,791
Really?

607
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:21,416
Would I really become happy?

608
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,125
Of course

609
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:28,375
Let's eat

610
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:33,708
Here!

611
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:41,541
Is it good?

612
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,791
It's really good

613
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:49,083
Our love will be as good as well

614
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:50,666
Maybe much better

615
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:59,458
Here, take my love too

616
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:05,083
It's so good

617
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:08,458
It is really good

618
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,875
Mr. Kyung-Cheol?

619
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:36,958
Isn't your appointment another day?

620
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,291
That's right

621
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,541
But I just came by

622
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:44,458
Because I don't think I can
come to see you anymore

623
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:48,791
Are you going somewhere?

624
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:50,833
Yeah

625
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,875
I'm going abroad

626
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:55,916
Together with my sister

627
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:00,291
Mr. Kyung-Cheol

628
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:04,500
Why don't you go by yourself?

629
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:09,625
I think it's better to give her
freedom and live her life

630
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:18,875
Bullshit

631
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:23,458
What the hell do you know?

632
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:31,458
What are you to tell me what to do?

633
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,208
Listen carefully

634
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:38,666
Me and my sister are inseparable

635
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,208
We die together

636
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,125
We live together

637
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,208
What are you doing!

638
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:53,125
My sister has only one man
and that's me

639
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:57,625
Do you think that she loves you?

640
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,833
What?

641
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:02,458
Your love towards her

642
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Might feel like hell to her

643
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,000
Listen carefully

644
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:18,583
If you keep interrupting
me and my sister's relationship

645
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:21,541
I am going to kill you

646
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:26,125
I will make you disappear from this world

647
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,666
Keep in mind

648
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,625
Did you find out anything?

649
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:48,083
Ji-Hoon is currently reported missing

650
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:52,875
His passport was cancelled 10 years ago

651
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:55,125
What do we do now

652
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,208
No idea

653
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,666
It's like finding a needle in a haystack

654
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:04,416
But I found out something about Ji-Soo

655
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:10,458
All 3 victims were Ji-Soo's boyfriend

656
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:17,791
There is a possibility that
Ji-Hoon killed them for Ji-Soo

657
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,291
That makes sense

658
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:21,916
That means Ji-Hoon is around Ji-Soo

659
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:11,625
I am Ji-Hoon

660
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:16,833
Are you really my brother Ji-Hoon?

661
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,416
Yeah

662
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,625
It's me, your first love

663
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:27,166
Stop it!

664
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,500
- Stop it
- I love you

665
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:35,208
- I love you
- Get away from me

666
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,041
Please stop

667
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,791
Why are you doing this?

668
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,250
I love you

669
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,625
I love you Ji-Soo

670
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,375
I love you Ji-Soo

671
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:22,750
Doctor Choi!

672
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:25,375
What do you mean that
Ji-Hoon is Kyung-Cheol?

673
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:26,750
Do you know Kyung-Cheol?

674
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,291
He was my patient until last week

675
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:31,458
Where is Ji-Soo?

676
01:22:31,666 --> 01:22:33,625
I don't know

677
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,208
She vanished

678
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,375
She won't pick up my call

679
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:40,541
That is Kyung-Cheol's house

680
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:42,708
Ma'am!

681
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,458
Yeah, did you find anything?

682
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,250
- Ji-Soo!
- Hello?

683
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,541
Where are you Ji-Soo?

684
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:52,000
I'm with Ji-Hoon

685
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,000
What?

686
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:57,041
Listen to me carefully Ji-Soo

687
01:22:57,208 --> 01:22:59,166
Don't do this to me!

688
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:04,000
Come to my old house on your own

689
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:42,041
Are you crazy?

690
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:45,750
You're worse than dad

691
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Ji-Soo, what's the matter?

692
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:51,583
You knew that I loved you
and you wanted my love

693
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:52,666
Let go!

694
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,416
Ji-Soo

695
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:58,041
Do you know how much I missed you?

696
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:01,625
- We're together now
- Let go!

697
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,916
- You are mine
- Stop it!

698
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:05,958
Let go!

699
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,125
Ji-Soo!

700
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:13,250
Don't come close

701
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:15,875
Stop it now

702
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,375
Let her go!

703
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,833
It's all over

704
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:23,625
Stop now Kyung-Cheol

705
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:25,916
Ji-Hoon

706
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,291
Your sister is in danger

707
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:32,750
Drop the knife and talk with me

708
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:36,583
It's all because of him

709
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:39,041
You changed too much

710
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,541
It's all because of him

711
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:45,541
Don't do this Ji-Hoon

712
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:48,291
Please stop

713
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:50,291
Drop your gun

714
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:53,250
Drop it right now!

715
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:59,250
Or else, my sister might get hurt

716
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:01,833
Drop it!

717
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:04,875
Ji-Soo

718
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:19,916
Ji-Soo

719
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:22,166
Just wait a little bit

720
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:34,625
Everything's fine if you die

721
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:38,416
Me and Ji-Soo can be together again

722
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:41,125
Ji-Soo is mine!

723
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:49,791
Stop it!

724
01:25:51,166 --> 01:25:52,250
Stop

725
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:54,500
Please stop

726
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:00,208
Drop the gun

727
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,125
Ji-Soo

728
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,375
Shoot him!

729
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:18,750
Drop the gun

730
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:20,375
Drop it!

731
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,166
Drop the gun

732
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:20,916
My father and brother was a pain for me

733
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:24,458
They both were monsters

734
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,333
Die

735
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:41,625
Get lost from this world

736
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,916
Die!

737
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:47,625
Get lost!

738
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,958
Die!

739
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:03,291
What do you want?

740
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,791
Ji-Soo

741
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:55,875
Ji-Soo

742
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:09,125
Ji-Soo

743
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:12,500
Ji-Soo

744
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:30,875
It's okay

745
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,916
Everything is fine now

746
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:40,666
Don't worry

747
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,250
Ji-Soo
