00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,869
(Stage Fighter)

2
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,341
Yes!

3
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,740
(Amazed)

4
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,281
(Stage Fighter is proud.)

5
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:23,910
(A beast is within me.)

6
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,011
(I did it better.)

7
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:26,410
("Oldboy" impressed everyone.)

8
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:27,950
(Team A's main lead role Kim Hye Hyun...)

9
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,321
(had no trouble doing the difficult techniques.)

10
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:30,751
(Hye Hyun is the best.)

11
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:32,620
(Team B's main lead role Kim Jong Cheol's...)

12
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:34,190
(techniques and expressions were as good.)

13
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,891
(Jong Cheol is also the best.)

14
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:37,791
(He's unbeatable.)

15
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:41,591
(Who will take the benefit after the intense performances?)

16
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,231
(The 2nd Class Movement Ceremony begins.)

17
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:46,771
(I want to get promoted to 2nd Class, at the least.)

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,071
(Let's not get demoted.)

19
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:51,910
(The dancers will get eliminated for the first time...)

20
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:53,671
(in this Class Movement Ceremony.)

21
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,380
(What is the result of the 2nd Class Movement Ceremony...)

22
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,210
(that shocks everyone?)

23
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:59,410
(The day of the K-Contents performances)

24
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:00,781
("Parasite," Team A: Choi Ho Jong, Ha Won Jun, Kim Young Woong)

25
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:02,050
(Team B: Kim Kyu Nyeon, Ryu Tae Young, Bang Seong Hyun)

26
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:05,122
(The main lead roles of "Parasite" are getting their makeup done.)

27
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:09,690
(Transforming into dukes)

28
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,592
The makeup is done. What do you think?

29
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:13,392
(Highly satisfied)

30
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:15,262
- We give off a different vibe. - Really?

31
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,601
(Different dukes with the same makeup)

32
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:19,771
You look like a real bully.

33
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,671
(Studying his face)

34
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:24,071
Kyu Nyeon looked cute.

35
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:28,141
Duke Ho Jong looked quite perverted.

36
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:29,641
(Being a monkey)

37
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:31,311
His eyes look lustful.

38
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:32,312
(Laughing)

39
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:34,850
(That's nonsense.)

40
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:37,982
I probably look like a delinquent duke.

41
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:40,320
We have totally different vibes.

42
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,821
I'll prove I'm as good as him.

43
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:43,320
("Oldboy," Team A: Kim Hye Hyun, Kim Kyung Won, Kim Jae Jin)

44
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,562
(Team B: Kim Jong Cheol, Yang Seong Yun, Ki Moo Gan)

45
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:46,630
(The two "Oldboy" main lead roles...)

46
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:47,691
(are turning into wild men.)

47
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:50,401
(Yang Seong Yun is getting his makeup done first.)

48
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:52,332
(Team A's main supporting roles sit next to him.)

49
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:54,702
- Are you nervous, Jae Jin? - No.

50
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,771
The stomach area of the outfit is exposed.

51
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:01,841
I checked their abs out first.

52
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:04,681
Jae Jin had some good abs.

53
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:08,311
We suit "Oldboy" the most.

54
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,582
(Of course.)

55
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:11,250
You came with a snobby mindset.

56
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,352
(Offended)

57
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,892
We had similar outfits and makeup,

58
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:18,362
but our teams had different vibes.

59
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,162
It didn't worry me that much.

60
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:21,990
(Team A: Park Jin Ho, Kim Yu Chan, Jang June Hyuk)

61
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,202
(Team B: Yun Hyeok Jung, Jung Hye Seong, Kim Tae Seok)

62
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:26,102
(The elite student main lead roles in "SKY Castle")

63
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:29,571
You look like a royal family kindergartener, not a delinquent.

64
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:32,041
You look cute. Really cute.

65
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,371
It's like you're wearing your son's uniform.

66
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,711
I'm in great shape today.

67
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,852
Not me.

68
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:41,612
It hurts less if you make up an excuse first.

69
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,582
Losing in a good condition sucks more.

70
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,991
I never lost when I was in great shape.

71
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:49,262
That must mean you were always in bad condition.

72
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:51,822
I feel bad for you.

73
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,491
("Squid Game" Team A, Team B)

74
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:57,301
- What's our concept today? - A baby.

75
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:58,832
A baby.

76
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:00,632
(Two babies with red cheeks)

77
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,602
Even with the same makeup and hairstyle,

78
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:06,112
Gyeong Ho and I looked very different.

79
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:07,542
An Arab and a tofu.

80
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:10,181
The supporting roles were different, too.

81
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,912
- We three have strong features. - I agree.

82
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,050
Team A leaves a strong impression.

83
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,451
Team B is shorties,

84
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:20,521
while Team A is buff. That's the difference.

85
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:22,491
Is that your provocation?

86
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,821
The visual plays an important role in dancing.

87
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:26,931
Team A has the upper hand in that element.

88
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,590
- In Team A, - Yes?

89
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,661
Only Gyeong Ho worries me.

90
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:32,931
The supporting roles are not worthy to keep in check.

91
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,102
Even Si Won?

92
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:36,901
Team B's supporting roles are First Classes.

93
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,912
Team A's supporting roles are Second Class and Under Class.

94
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,882
Rather than keeping them in check, I wanted them to do their best.

95
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,511
I'm surprised they're worried about us.

96
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:49,250
That team isn't worthy to be our opponent.

97
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:51,250
The supporting roles are in war.

98
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,922
- Let's take this on the stage. - Right.

99
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,422
(The sweet yet brutal makeup time is over.)

100
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,420
(Team "Oldboy" enters the waiting room.)

101
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,460
(Noticing something)

102
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:01,692
- What? - What are those?

103
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,031
Goodness.

104
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:06,900
- Look at that. - What is it?

105
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,970
What?

106
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:11,301
- This is legendary. - Our princesses.

107
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:13,270
- What? - What are those?

108
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,312
(What surprised the dancers?)

109
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,480
What are those?

110
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:17,081
(Ta-da)

111
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:19,581
(The waiting room is filled with the faces of the main lead roles.)

112
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:20,711
(The price is touched.)

113
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,221
- "Yun Hyeok Jung, are you a deer?" - What?

114
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,752
- "You are dear to me." - Is that okay?

115
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:28,090
I was expecting coffee trucks.

116
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,961
But we were welcomed by something else, which surprised me.

117
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,091
It still made me happy.

118
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,361
(Team "Parasite" enters the waiting room.)

119
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:38,600
Where did they get those phrases from?

120
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:39,670
What is that?

121
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:42,601
"The three great men. Taejong, Sejong, and Ho Jong."

122
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:43,970
You've become a king.

123
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,002
It was embarrassing.

124
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,871
Ho Jong is a king...

125
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:48,942
who pretends to be poor.

126
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,142
A king acting as a bum.

127
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,151
He'll get buried in Jongmyo Shrine.

128
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,452
"The year of Kyu Nyeon."

129
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:57,151
I got emotional.

130
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,351
- This is cool. Look at all of them. - Goodness.

131
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:01,952
"Kim Jong Cheol's face is in season."

132
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:04,761
"Baby Hye Hyun does great without crying."

133
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,790
(Hye Hyun is happy.)

134
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,262
I liked the part "Hye Hyun does great."

135
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:11,332
But me becoming a baby was embarrassing.

136
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:13,670
- What about the ensemble? - We don't get one.

137
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,872
The ensemble needs to photoshop our posters.

138
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:19,271
Looking at them made me bummed out.

139
00:05:20,512 --> 00:05:21,541
Those should be mine.

140
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,142
Gyeong Ho came out really well.

141
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:26,351
Was "sexy" Gyeong Ho's MBTI?

142
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:29,182
Jun Woo looks cool. He's the Shokupanman.

143
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:32,651
Why's mine "fly" when Gyeong Ho's is "sexy?"

144
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,691
"Fly, Shokupanman." Who wrote it?

145
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,762
(A bit disappointed)

146
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:39,691
You could've come up with a cooler phrase for Jun Woo.

147
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,832
It was a bit disappointing.

148
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:43,502
What's Gyeong Ho's MBTI?

149
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,002
Sexy.

150
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,502
- What's Jun Woo's MBTI? - Mine is cute.

151
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,171
It's cute versus sexy.

152
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:53,742
- The two have different vibes. - It's interesting.

153
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,711
Dancers, please be on standby.

154
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:58,642
- Really? - It's fantastic.

155
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:00,511
("Squid Game")

156
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:01,582
Nice.

157
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:03,650
- That's really tough. - I can tell.

158
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,682
("SKY Castle")

159
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,591
He's good at his choreography.

160
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,021
(Acing all of the genres)

161
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,220
Kick harder.

162
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,461
(The dancers do their best in their roles.)

163
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,161
(The K-Contents shoots are done.)

164
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:18,601
(It's finally the day of the class evaluation.)

165
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:21,132
(Who will survive the intense class battle?)

166
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,372
(The MC is here.)

167
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:23,601
He dyed his hair.

168
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,541
- Gosh. - You look cool!

169
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:27,970
The merciless class battle of dancers...

170
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,280
where they fight with their bodies. Stage Fighter.

171
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:31,512
Hi, I'm MC Kang Daniel.

172
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,812
(Cheering)

173
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,281
The K-Contents Mission class evaluation for Stage Fighter's...

174
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,122
Second Class Movement Ceremony will begin now.

175
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:44,520
For the first time, Stage Fighter received evaluations...

176
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,290
from the online public, masters,

177
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,731
coaches, choreographers, and rehearsal directors.

178
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,201
The team evaluations proceeded...

179
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,801
with Seat Class Evaluation by ticketing...

180
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,901
through Online Public Evaluation on Mnet Plus app.

181
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,941
With a limited 3,000 seats,

182
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:02,382
the classes were divided into four,

183
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,910
VIP seats, R seats, S seats, and A seats.

184
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,182
Scores have been tallied separately for each seat class.

185
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:11,480
The winning team's main lead role and main supporting roles...

186
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,322
will each get 1,000 points.

187
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:17,761
The losing team's main lead role and main supporting roles...

188
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:20,332
will each get 500 points.

189
00:07:20,432 --> 00:07:22,400
Although they performed on both teams,

190
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,960
each ensemble member who wasn't an evaluation subject...

191
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:28,400
will receive 300 points.

192
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,401
That's mean.

193
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,012
I realized the team score...

194
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:36,382
and benefit score are extremely important.

195
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:40,081
Furthermore, each choreographer, Stage Fighter's masters,

196
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:43,721
coaches, and rehearsal directors compared and evaluated...

197
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:47,021
Team A and Team B's dancers with the same role...

198
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:49,691
and chose the dancer who performed the role better.

199
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:53,062
Each dancer will get 500 points.

200
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,762
Five hundred points is a lot.

201
00:07:54,992 --> 00:07:57,530
Each dancer's final score is decided...

202
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:59,832
by adding the team benefit, role benefit,

203
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:02,502
and the dancer's individual points.

204
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:06,210
In the last episode, the subtitle that the views...

205
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:09,442
will be a part of the dancer's score was not included.

206
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,582
Noticing the omission, the information was revised...

207
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:15,312
and announced on the official YouTube channel right away.

208
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:19,091
The class has become much more crucial in this mission.

209
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:22,250
That is because the dancer's individual points,

210
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,591
the total number of likes and views on each solo video,

211
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:28,831
is a weighting factor of the class.

212
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,761
So each class has its own benefit, right?

213
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:33,332
The Second Class...

214
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:34,931
(Startled)

215
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,541
(Focused)

216
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,272
gets 1.3 times the points.

217
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:40,971
Gosh, that's a high number.

218
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:44,042
The First Class gets 1.5 times the points.

219
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,052
That's unbeatable.

220
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,282
Becoming First Class was going to be hard.

221
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,552
It was slightly out of reach now.

222
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,052
The Under Class...

223
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:56,162
(The Under Class is nervous.)

224
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:57,591
has no weighting factor.

225
00:08:58,662 --> 00:08:59,731
Has no weighting factor.

226
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:02,161
- How do we turn the tables? - We can't get promoted.

227
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:03,730
Can we even get promoted?

228
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:06,731
- It's telling us to leave. - Leave the room.

229
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:10,302
The Under Class is always the fifth wheel.

230
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,611
Dancer Jung Sung Wook of the First Class.

231
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,912
What did you think upon hearing the weighting factor?

232
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,042
Being First Class is nice.

233
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:22,082
(He can't do anything but laugh.)

234
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:25,952
It's only right for the First Class to get the benefit.

235
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,691
- How he spoke was very cunning. - Right?

236
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,922
- "It's only right." - He's sly.

237
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:35,491
Some dancers, who didn't get the class weighting factor...

238
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:39,001
but can gain points in their main role evaluations,

239
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,871
are in favorable positions.

240
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,401
- That's Jin Ho. - This is no joke.

241
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:47,510
He played the lead role but didn't get any benefits.

242
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,442
- Isn't he the biggest victim? - You're right.

243
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:53,481
They didn't get the class weighting factors for their individual points.

244
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:56,121
But they played a major role in the performance.

245
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:59,081
So the possibility they could've been chosen...

246
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,922
through the Online Public Evaluation is high.

247
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:04,822
The possibility of getting the team benefit and role benefit...

248
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:07,291
is also high. Compared to other ensemble dancers,

249
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,861
they are more likely to get promoted.

250
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,032
I envy you.

251
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:14,101
It was a short video, but I gave it my all.

252
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:17,241
Those who watched me dance until now...

253
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:19,871
could've felt my sincerity.

254
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:22,171
Here is the number of dancers...

255
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:25,812
for each new class completed by the Class Movement.

256
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:28,952
"New class"?

257
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:32,522
Don't you think there won't be many First Classes, Hyo Joon?

258
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,720
(STF Class Structure)

259
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:37,620
The Second Class has 15 dancers.

260
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:39,461
The First Class has 7 dancers.

261
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,131
One less Second Class, and one less First Class.

262
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,672
There were no numbers next to the Under Class.

263
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:49,942
That means there will be fewer ensemble dancers.

264
00:10:50,672 --> 00:10:52,370
With the Second Class Movement Ceremony,

265
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:55,812
dancers will get eliminated for the first time.

266
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,640
(Sighing)

267
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,011
It felt like the real game was on.

268
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,552
Today's goal is to survive.

269
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:06,351
I won't get eliminated.

270
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:09,522
Are all the Under Class dancers getting cut off?

271
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:12,291
I thought many Under Class dancers could get eliminated.

272
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,032
The entire ensemble might have to leave.

273
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,630
With the Second Class Movement Ceremony approaching,

274
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:17,860
where class is crucial,

275
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:20,572
who will survive, and who will be eliminated?

276
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:23,072
The first work for the class evaluation...

277
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:24,471
(Sighing deeply)

278
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:25,702
"Squid Game"?

279
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:26,772
Is "SKY Castle."

280
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,841
(Let's go, "SKY Castle.")

281
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:31,111
("SKY Castle" Class Evaluation)

282
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,282
Why is this nerve-racking?

283
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,720
The soundtrack and work concept of the drama...

284
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,620
"SKY Castle" is the motive...

285
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,451
choreographed by Luda Lee.

286
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:42,990
It's a work about the suppressed elite students...

287
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:45,321
trying to find themselves.

288
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:48,260
The main lead role of Team A is Park Jin Ho.

289
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:52,331
The main supporting roles go to Kim Yu Chan and Jang June Hyuk.

290
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:55,831
The main lead role of Team B is Yun Hyeok Jung.

291
00:11:55,832 --> 00:12:00,111
The main supporting roles are Jung Hye Seong and Kim Tae Seok.

292
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,980
I can tell from the casting board that the competition was fierce.

293
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:07,010
And check out the main supporting roles in Second.

294
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:09,110
Both teams have ballet and contemporary dancers,

295
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:10,120
which is interesting.

296
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,422
I can't wait to find out...

297
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:14,922
their chemistry.

298
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,590
Between Team A and Team B, which team will have...

299
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,491
more votes from the public?

300
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,760
We will now watch "SKY Castle" by Park Jin Ho, the main lead role,

301
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:24,401
and Kim Yu Chan and Jang June Hyuk,

302
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:26,131
the main supporting roles.

303
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:29,401
We will now watch "SKY Castle" by Park Jin Ho, the main lead role,

304
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:31,740
and Kim Yu Chan and Jang June Hyuk,

305
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:33,672
the main supporting roles.

306
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,611
("SKY Castle" Team A)

307
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:36,880
I'm so nervous.

308
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,411
I've never been this nervous...

309
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:40,711
before in my life.

310
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,720
This team looks interesting.

311
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,052
It's a battle between Under and First.

312
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:46,991
This should be fun.

313
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:50,220
I'm excited to see these dancers in a different light.

314
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:53,831
To see a little bit of their acting skills and performance.

315
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,061
That's what I'm excited about.

316
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:58,460
From this mission, the point will be...

317
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,531
about how they build their stories as artists.

318
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,942
- Story-telling. - I'm excited.

319
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,702
This should be fun. I can't wait to watch it.

320
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:07,912
I've been curious about this one.

321
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:09,140
(Appearing)

322
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:10,682
Handsome.

323
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,750
- Yu Chan! - That's cool.

324
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,781
(Charismatic)

325
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,851
- He looks like a student. - He looks determined.

326
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,390
The intro is so cool.

327
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:20,692
This is so cool.

328
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:23,192
- That's nice. - Beautiful.

329
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,561
It's the only one that looks like a legit show...

330
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:27,792
and not a Dance Film.

331
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:30,361
Yu Chan is pulling his hair.

332
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:31,931
He's got that desperate look.

333
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,802
I love the part where they hit their desks.

334
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:35,101
It looks like a musical.

335
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:36,902
How are they so cool?

336
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:40,740
- We were so in sync. - We did great.

337
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:41,841
That's insane.

338
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:43,812
Check out June Hyuk's energy.

339
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:45,240
(Who is this guy?)

340
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,011
- June Hyuk! - He's the best.

341
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,981
- I got chills. - Jin Ho looks...

342
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:52,121
He actually looks like a tormented student.

343
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,391
The Princess has arrived!

344
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,461
I got goosebumps.

345
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:00,991
That's fantastic.

346
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,702
- The bullies are bullying him. - That's amazing.

347
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:10,871
That was neat.

348
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:14,141
Yu Chan is good.

349
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:15,741
Yu Chan is so...

350
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,481
Yu Chan, the rebel.

351
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:20,651
His eyes!

352
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,082
The three look great together.

353
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:24,552
- They killed it. - That was a good trio.

354
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:26,221
They took his desk away.

355
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:27,952
It looks like Jin Ho is actually bullied.

356
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:29,822
Show them, Jin Ho!

357
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,261
There you go.

358
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,991
Jin Ho is looking good.

359
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,631
Look at his eyes and facial expressions.

360
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:38,802
- I love that look. - Lovely.

361
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:40,702
A perfect group dance.

362
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,432
Sexy.

363
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,741
He's got a great flow.

364
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:46,371
He perfectly controls his power.

365
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:49,341
I love Jin Ho's expressions.

366
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,311
The ensemble is doing well too.

367
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:52,341
They're doing their job.

368
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:56,551
That was a clean split.

369
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:57,681
I did that part better.

370
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:58,682
(Bothered)

371
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:02,620
The formation is gorgeous.

372
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:04,522
They must have practiced so hard.

373
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,261
That's awesome.

374
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,432
Only Jin Ho can pull off Hyeok Jung's choreography.

375
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:11,531
- Good. - His face!

376
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:12,801
Jin Ho is a great actor.

377
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:14,131
He can surely act with his facial expressions.

378
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:16,542
Check out Yu Chan's splits.

379
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,871
Their group dance looks amazing.

380
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:22,541
Let's go, Yu Chan and June Hyuk.

381
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,441
(Main supporting roles' choreography creative segment)

382
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:26,111
That was a good creative segment.

383
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,911
(In awe)

384
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,681
They look well together, these two.

385
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:30,921
(By Kim Yu Chan and Jang June Hyuk)

386
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:32,082
Floorwork versus standing moves.

387
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,620
- Yu Chan! - Look at his face!

388
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,651
(Main supporting roles' choreography creative segment)

389
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:37,691
(They crushed it.)

390
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:38,921
His leg lines...

391
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,691
(Main supporting roles' choreography creative segment)

392
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:41,792
How swift.

393
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:43,662
Yu Chan.

394
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:47,402
He doesn't look it, but Yu Chan is like a brat.

395
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,500
Here it comes.

396
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:53,841
- Come on out. - Everyone, come on!

397
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,581
He's ripping his shirt.

398
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,582
(Let's rip it apart.)

399
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,741
(Surprised)

400
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,051
- What was that? - "There's a beast in me!"

401
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:02,251
That has to be cheating.

402
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,120
Jin Ho! I just got chills.

403
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:11,161
Check out his body!

404
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:14,032
- He's so sexy. - That student is too sexy.

405
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:17,100
- Their energy is insane. - They're crushing it.

406
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,101
(Amazed)

407
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,671
He's dancing and telling a story with his whole body.

408
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:23,840
(Main supporting roles' choreography creative segment)

409
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:24,901
This is nice.

410
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,241
How is that the body of a top student?

411
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,241
They're so in sync.

412
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:31,181
They're good.

413
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,182
(And 1 dancer can't smile.)

414
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:33,282
This is so cool.

415
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,251
(He takes it off again?)

416
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:41,390
He keeps stripping!

417
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:42,522
Why do you keep stripping?

418
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,771
("SKY Castle" Team A's performance ends.)

419
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:56,071
- Bravo. - Nice.

420
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:58,001
(Giving them a look)

421
00:16:58,002 --> 00:16:59,911
(Cheering hard)

422
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:02,012
His last facial expression!

423
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,441
So striking.

424
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:05,941
The ending!

425
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,812
Ending Princess!

426
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,921
That was stunning!

427
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:13,921
(I'm the Ending Princess.)

428
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:15,391
You're like an idol singer.

429
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,792
- That was fabulous. - Indeed.

430
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,462
- That was a cool performance. - He looked like First Class.

431
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,791
That didn't look like a performance of Under Class.

432
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,231
Didn't Yu Chan stand out even among them?

433
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:26,472
Yes, he did.

434
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:28,002
So did June Hyuk.

435
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:29,700
The main supporting roles...

436
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:32,440
also did a fantastic job of portraying...

437
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:33,771
the tense male movements.

438
00:17:33,772 --> 00:17:37,140
Personally, Jin Ho's...

439
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:40,051
earnest look and energy...

440
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:42,081
touched my heart.

441
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:44,150
A dancer who dances on the stage...

442
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:47,420
by using 100 percent, 200 percent of his body...

443
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:50,461
touches your heart by itself.

444
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:53,832
And Jin Ho is a dancer who gives his whole body.

445
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:55,131
(Nodding)

446
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,731
We will now watch the video of "SKY Castle..."

447
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:00,601
by Yun Hyeok Jung, the main lead role,

448
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,631
and Jung Hye Seong and Kim Tae Seok, the main supporting roles.

449
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:04,302
(Excited about Team B as well)

450
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:06,512
- Let's go, Hyeok Jung. - I'm excited.

451
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,371
We'll be able to compare them better as it begins right after.

452
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:12,282
- I can't watch this. - We have to watch Hyeok Jung's abs.

453
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:13,782
I can't watch this.

454
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:15,910
Here comes the office worker.

455
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,522
Tae Seok performing as a student.

456
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:19,281
Among the supporting roles,

457
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:22,021
Hye Seong and Tae Seok have a huge height difference.

458
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:23,521
- Right. - I'm looking forward...

459
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:26,532
to see how they interpreted this choreography.

460
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:27,861
(Excited and curious)

461
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:31,201
He's a rebel.

462
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:32,802
He's an actual delinquent.

463
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:34,272
It looks like he was one.

464
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:35,601
How good-looking.

465
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:37,671
- He's good-looking. - Hyeok Jung is so good-looking.

466
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,171
He already looks angry.

467
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,542
He looks like an actual rebel.

468
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:44,911
That's cool

469
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:46,512
I love the beginning.

470
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:50,322
It's the same choreography, but it already looks different.

471
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:54,391
They're in sync.

472
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:56,522
That's nice.

473
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:58,262
I see their movements better than before.

474
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:02,032
They have better teamwork.

475
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:04,032
I love the introduction.

476
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:05,532
Let's go.

477
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:09,301
- That's what I'm talking about. - Hye Seong is an actual rebel.

478
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:10,371
He is.

479
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:15,641
I loved the way they dropped.

480
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,081
This team looks somewhat more stable.

481
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,212
- Their energy, right? - They all have similar energy.

482
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:24,851
Hye Seong can be flexible.

483
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:26,552
He looks like an actual rebel.

484
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:28,921
(Keeping Team A's rebel in check)

485
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:34,091
- His acting skills... - That acting!

486
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:35,832
Hyeok Jung is also a pretty good actor.

487
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,002
He's good.

488
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:42,870
Hyeok Jung is certainly strong.

489
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:44,440
The three have amazing chemistry.

490
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:46,572
The stage is so neat.

491
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:48,141
Here it comes.

492
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:49,941
(The class of the originator)

493
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:51,681
Show them!

494
00:19:52,012 --> 00:19:53,181
The originator.

495
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:54,680
It's different.

496
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:57,151
"This is my choreography!"

497
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:58,282
It's a totally different mood.

498
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:01,191
(The class of the originator)

499
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:04,262
I can see the choreography better.

500
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,262
Fantastic.

501
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,361
He created such a good choreography.

502
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:11,631
It's bolder.

503
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:13,671
Here it comes.

504
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,331
(That's what I'm talking about.)

505
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:16,542
What was that kick?

506
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:18,671
It's so stable.

507
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,910
- He's good. - He's going harder than anyone.

508
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:25,012
He doesn't stop.

509
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:27,851
They have great teamwork.

510
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,052
- The group dance is amazing. - I know, right?

511
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:33,751
The creative segment!

512
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,751
(Main supporting roles' choreography creative segment)

513
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:36,791
Show us!

514
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,421
Don't the two look like different types of rebels?

515
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,492
They made use of the ballet moves so well.

516
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:42,930
Like how he lifted him.

517
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,762
(Main supporting roles' choreography creative segment)

518
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:46,930
(That was wild.)

519
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:47,971
(Amazed)

520
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:49,600
Hye Seong must have been lifted so many times.

521
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,741
(Main supporting roles' choreography creative segment)

522
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:54,512
- Just lift him. - He wishes to be number one.

523
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,681
Hye Seong looks so determined right now.

524
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:58,611
- Here he comes. - Here he is.

525
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:02,951
- "Move!" - "Get out of the way!"

526
00:21:04,822 --> 00:21:06,380
(The long-awaited shirt rip)

527
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:08,920
(Make some noise!)

528
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:09,921
(Squealing)

529
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:11,360
There you go!

530
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:12,762
Why do they keep stripping?

531
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,361
He's like Gundam.

532
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,502
Are they all stripping?

533
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:22,131
- He's so in shape. - He attacked us with his abs!

534
00:21:22,401 --> 00:21:24,471
Hyeok Jung has that animal side.

535
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:26,141
He looks cool.

536
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,611
He's so in shape.

537
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,380
Look at his abs.

538
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:31,542
This is a battle of physique!

539
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,211
How rebellious do you have to be to turn into that?

540
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:35,482
Give us a good kick, Hyeok Jung!

541
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:37,522
(Give us a good kick, Hyeok Jung!)

542
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,891
(As expected, it's good.)

543
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:42,951
- So cool. - He's about to destroy his school.

544
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,822
- That's insane. - That's actually insane.

545
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:48,361
Students these days.

546
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:51,200
Maybe he's a PE applicant.

547
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:52,561
Is he a PE applicant?

548
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,700
"PE applicant."

549
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:55,201
"PE applicant!"

550
00:21:56,502 --> 00:21:58,002
- His eyes. - Tae Seok!

551
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,671
- I like this part. - I like this part.

552
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:07,552
That was amazing.

553
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:10,850
(The ending was perfect.)

554
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:11,851
(Loving it)

555
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:13,051
(He bursts into laughter.)

556
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:14,951
- That was so cool. - That was so cool.

557
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:16,691
Gosh.

558
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:20,391
(Intense)

559
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:25,562
His right side must be better.

560
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,532
I guess they look better from different sides.

561
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,972
(Exclaiming)

562
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,200
Women are going to love that.

563
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,140
You need to be handsome to play the main lead role.

564
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:37,111
I wish I hadn't seen that!

565
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:39,441
People will think that all students are like him.

566
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:42,082
Very nice.

567
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,051
The two performances looked completely different.

568
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:45,620
They looked like middle school students earlier,

569
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:47,222
and the next ones look like high school students.

570
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,890
Hyeok Jung is...

571
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:50,390
- built... - Right.

572
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:52,261
Like a wild horse that never gets tired.

573
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:54,991
He's a dancer who doesn't falter.

574
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:58,101
He gives off amazing energy when he swings and throws.

575
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,271
They were both good.

576
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:03,440
- I can't decide which was better. - We will now announce...

577
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:06,101
the evaluations of the opponents.

578
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,911
Team A's main lead, Yu Chan,

579
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:11,281
evaluated Team B's main supporting role, Tae Seok...

580
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:12,340
(Let's find out.)

581
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,481
as a lack of executing...

582
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,181
contemporary dance moves.

583
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:18,782
(Cheering)

584
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,292
Yu Chan!

585
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:21,991
"He seems to lack stamina."

586
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:23,251
(Excuse me?)

587
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,691
- "Lack of stamina." - "That's intense.

588
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:28,292
- He said he lacked stamina. - No!

589
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:29,890
(Sorry about that.)

590
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,301
- He said to a new groom... - No!

591
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:33,332
- that he lacked stamina. - "New groom."

592
00:23:33,572 --> 00:23:35,001
You can't stop time from passing.

593
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:36,531
I should give him some arginine supplements.

594
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:37,601
"Arginine!"

595
00:23:38,072 --> 00:23:39,301
(You know I love you, right?)

596
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:40,311
(A bitter smile)

597
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:41,772
Had I been seven years younger...

598
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:44,881
Time feels cruel.

599
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:48,911
I will now announce the result of the "SKY Castle" match.

600
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:51,281
Online Public Evaluation for this team match was...

601
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:53,120
done by ticketing...

602
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:55,491
through Seat Class Evaluation.

603
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,461
Which team between Team A and Team B...

604
00:23:57,462 --> 00:23:59,492
will have gotten more votes from the public?

605
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:01,562
- Oh, it's a team battle. - Yes.

606
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:04,860
Here's the result of the ticketing vote...

607
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,901
from Seat Class Evaluation.

608
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:09,231
Right away?

609
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:10,841
- Gosh. - It's revealed right away.

610
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,641
Who will it be?

611
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:15,312
- Please be Team A. - Please.

612
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,940
I hope it's us.

613
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,181
I can't predict the winner.

614
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:19,680
Here's the result.

615
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:22,552
I will now announce the ticketing vote...

616
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,380
the VIP seats, which are only 3,000,

617
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,822
for Team A.

618
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,292
I'm curious about the result.

619
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:30,920
(We're...)

620
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:31,921
(more curious.)

621
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:34,531
(3,000 seats)

622
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:35,991
- Sold out. - Sold out.

623
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,600
- Did we sell all the VIP seats? - Yes, we did.

624
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,900
- I see. - Team A led by Jin Ho...

625
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:43,170
has sold all 3,000 VIP seats.

626
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,271
(Team A, VIP seat, 3,000)

627
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:48,042
Next, here's the result of the ticketing vote for Team B.

628
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:50,042
I bet we both sold out the VIP seats.

629
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:51,541
(Are ours...)

630
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,982
(sold out as well?)

631
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:55,610
(Team "SKY Castle" B also sold all 3,000 VIP seats.)

632
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:57,282
Okay. They're both sold out.

633
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,322
- It's neck-and-neck so far. - Yes.

634
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:02,190
Team B led by Hyeok Jung...

635
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,462
has sold all 3,000 VIP seats.

636
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:07,431
We obviously have to secure the VIP seats.

637
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:11,701
Here's the voting result from the 4,000 R seats.

638
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:14,430
R seats and S seats also matter.

639
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,870
- They do. - When you look at it like that...

640
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:17,302
The R seats and S seats...

641
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:19,572
- will make a difference. - Yes.

642
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:21,670
Team A led by Jin Ho...

643
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:22,911
Did they sell out the R seats as well?

644
00:25:24,782 --> 00:25:26,610
(Team A, R seat, 4,000)

645
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:27,910
(Sold out again)

646
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:29,151
It's sold out.

647
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:31,121
Four thousand!

648
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:33,522
You've sold all 4,000 seats.

649
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:35,621
- Good. - That's incredible?

650
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:37,292
They have good eyes.

651
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:38,421
(Proud)

652
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:40,331
(Anxious)

653
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:44,562
Next, here's the ticketing result of Team B's R seats.

654
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:46,871
I have a feeling they also sold 4,000.

655
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:48,272
I bet they're sold out.

656
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:50,201
I think they're also sold out.

657
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:51,572
Please.

658
00:25:53,772 --> 00:25:55,610
(I'm begging as well.)

659
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,911
(Team B, R seat, 3,510)

660
00:25:58,441 --> 00:25:59,511
(Seriously?)

661
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:00,512
(Shocked)

662
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:01,512
It wasn't sold out!

663
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:03,582
What?

664
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:05,782
- Five hundred seats. - Five hundred.

665
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:08,291
- There's a difference in R seats? - No way.

666
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:10,292
I was sure that they were sold out.

667
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:13,121
This is a bit surprising.

668
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,731
Team B led by Hyeok Jung...

669
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:17,762
has sold 3,510 seats.

670
00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:19,930
Team A's R seats were sold out,

671
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:23,941
but Team B had 500 R seats empty.

672
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,042
(Exclaiming)

673
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:26,400
Is that 490 seats?

674
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:28,170
Doesn't that put them at a disadvantage?

675
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,481
But it is too soon to predict the winner.

676
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:33,180
From the remaining 5,000 S seats and unlimited A seats,

677
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:35,982
we don't know how the result changed.

678
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:37,522
This is tough to guess.

679
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:39,552
If there are far too many tickets from S seat,

680
00:26:39,782 --> 00:26:41,522
- we might change it. - We might.

681
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:43,620
The ticketing results of 5,000 S seats...

682
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:46,161
for Team A and Team B will be...

683
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:48,360
revealed simultaneously.

684
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,361
(Tense)

685
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:50,661
Will we turn it around here?

686
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:52,161
Show us the result.

687
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,832
(Please)

688
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,340
(Team A: 1,404 seats, Team B: 427 seats)

689
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:58,401
There.

690
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:00,272
Unbelievable.

691
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:01,911
It's an overwhelming difference.

692
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:03,841
Is there a celebrity on Team A?

693
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:05,340
Oh, they had Yu Chan.

694
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:07,311
He's got a large fandom.

695
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:08,911
- Oh, from the ballet world. - Yes.

696
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:12,722
We should have gotten on a truck and promoted ourselves.

697
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:16,251
Team A has sold 1,404 S seats,

698
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:18,721
and Team B has sold 427 S seats.

699
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:22,062
There was a huge difference in the S seats.

700
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:23,492
The difference is 1,500 seats.

701
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,661
It's bigger than I thought.

702
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,231
Lastly, I will announce...

703
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:31,502
the results A seats at once.

704
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:34,012
A seats could change the game.

705
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:35,641
There are no limits, after all.

706
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:38,681
We don't know how many people bought A seats.

707
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,282
So, there could be more than we expected.

708
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:42,881
Will there be a plot twist?

709
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:45,081
(I'm not sure.)

710
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,051
I still had hope.

711
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:49,751
(Can Team "SKY Castle" B turn it around with A seats?)

712
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,992
(Team A: 261 seats, Team B: 254 seats)

713
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:58,301
Team A has been voted by 8,665 seats.

714
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:02,400
Team B has been voted by 7,191 seats.

715
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:03,802
That was a crushing defeat.

716
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:06,440
With a difference of 1,474 votes,

717
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:10,011
Team A led by Park Jin Ho showed stronger drawing power...

718
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:12,312
and won the match. Congratulations.

719
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:15,482
Jin Ho has done it again.

720
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:17,851
Well done, guys.

721
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:21,721
The public wasn't wrong.

722
00:28:21,722 --> 00:28:23,451
They judged us precisely.

723
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:25,292
Thank you for that.

724
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:29,291
Jin Ho, the main lead role, and Yu Chan and June Hyuk,

725
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:32,801
the main supporting roles will be given 1,000 points each for winning.

726
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:35,231
Hyeok Jung, the main lead role, and Tae Seok and Hye Seong,

727
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:37,741
the main supporting roles will be given 500 points each,

728
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:39,941
although they have lost.

729
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:42,671
("SKY Castle" Team Score)

730
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:45,811
- That's huge. - A thousand points is huge.

731
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:46,880
That's a great benefit.

732
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:48,752
- Team A will be safe. - We fortunately have 1,000 points.

733
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,950
It's a 500-point difference.

734
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,651
- It's double. - Too bad.

735
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:54,921
That's too bad.

736
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:57,860
"If only I had done better..."

737
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,361
I could never get that thought out of my head.

738
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:01,991
(Sighing)

739
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,100
The ensemble, who wasn't evaluated,

740
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:06,332
will be given 300 points.

741
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:07,871
That's cruel.

742
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:09,831
It's still a lot. Three hundred.

743
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:10,840
Right.

744
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:12,572
But if they all get 300 points,

745
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:14,811
the difference isn't too big.

746
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:16,941
I know, right? It's pretty much the same.

747
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,110
The supporting roles are also in danger.

748
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:21,812
Right. In the losing team, at least.

749
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:26,650
I will now announce the benefit points...

750
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:29,291
from the comparative evaluation of the main roles in "SKY Castle..."

751
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,292
by the masters, coaches,

752
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:31,562
choreographers, and rehearsal directors.

753
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:33,930
Oh, right. We had this too.

754
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,291
This makes me worried. It's so scary.

755
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,931
I wasn't expecting that.

756
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:40,471
The Main Role Evaluation is a comparative evaluation...

757
00:29:40,472 --> 00:29:43,531
of the dancers who played the same roles in the same piece.

758
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,340
The benefit points will be given...

759
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,211
to the dancer who pulled it off better.

760
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:49,571
Which dancer will earn these benefit points...

761
00:29:49,572 --> 00:29:51,041
to have the upper hand...

762
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:53,341
in the second Class Movement Ceremony?

763
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,252
This is brutal.

764
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,081
I wonder how the judges saw it.

765
00:29:57,082 --> 00:29:58,421
It makes me wonder.

766
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:01,390
First, the main supporting roles of "SKY Castle,"

767
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:03,221
Yu Chan and June Hyuk from Team A...

768
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:04,721
and Tae Seok and Hye Seong from Team B.

769
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:07,462
Let's check out the result now.

770
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:09,262
I'm so nervous.

771
00:30:09,732 --> 00:30:12,801
As someone who observed their practice,

772
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:15,302
Yu Chan and Jun Hyuk...

773
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,041
never stopped practicing together...

774
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,741
so that they wouldn't miss even the tiniest detail.

775
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:22,170
I could tell...

776
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:26,281
how hard they practiced through the screen.

777
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,410
Yu Chan is a ballet dancer, and Jun Hyuk is a contemporary dancer,

778
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,650
so they did their best to combine...

779
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,321
floorwork and standing movements.

780
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:36,450
Because they were of different genres,

781
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:37,890
it really worked well.

782
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:39,661
Jin Ho cast them very well.

783
00:30:40,262 --> 00:30:41,891
He did a very good job casting.

784
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,160
But Team B did seem more stable.

785
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:48,471
Team B was clearer in that they performed...

786
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,971
in a calmer and more organized state.

787
00:30:50,972 --> 00:30:52,840
I feel like Team B...

788
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:55,441
They felt more mature, and they felt more professional.

789
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:57,711
I will announce the result of the comparative evaluation...

790
00:30:57,712 --> 00:31:00,651
for the main supporting roles in "SKY Castle."

791
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:05,180
The dancers to get benefit points...

792
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,591
for playing the main supporting roles better...

793
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:11,121
I believe we played the main supporting roles better.

794
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,360
I thought that we had a better performance...

795
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:15,691
and that we'd win.

796
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:19,700
They're Kim Yu Chan and Jang June Hyuk.

797
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:21,130
(Team A's Yu Chan and June Hyuk earn benefit points.)

798
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,131
(Good.)

799
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,640
Yu Chan and June Hyuk, the main supporting roles...

800
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:28,171
will be given 500 benefit points.

801
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,012
They're taking all the points.

802
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:31,610
Five hundred? That's huge.

803
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:32,741
Gosh. Five hundred.

804
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:33,880
(In awe)

805
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,552
They're getting a lot of points.

806
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:37,552
Naturally, I was over the moon.

807
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:39,551
I felt very grateful...

808
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,450
and realized that dance never lied.

809
00:31:41,451 --> 00:31:43,552
I learned that they could tell our teamwork and amount of practice.

810
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:46,921
"What was the problem? What did we do wrong?"

811
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:50,361
We did our best, but the result didn't reflect that.

812
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:52,062
It was...

813
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,431
the most upsetting.

814
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:57,140
Now, I'll announce...

815
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:59,901
the evaluation result on the male lead role.

816
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:02,472
(The main leads become nervous.)

817
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:05,441
Through Online Public Evaluation, the public chose...

818
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:06,782
Team A.

819
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:10,081
Will the main lead of Team A get chosen by the masters,

820
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:13,121
coaches, choreographers, and rehearsal directors as well?

821
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,792
I'll announce the result now.

822
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,522
I'm certain that I'll win.

823
00:32:18,322 --> 00:32:20,062
I must receive the benefit points.

824
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:22,890
In terms of the character, I thought...

825
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:25,101
- Hyeok Jung would be more fitting. - Same here.

826
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:27,900
But Jin Ho did much better...

827
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:28,972
with expressions.

828
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,742
There were two times the main lead moved backward.

829
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:33,742
Jin Ho kept eye contact until the end.

830
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:37,381
(Park Jin Ho kept eye contact even when he moved back.)

831
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,641
But Hyeok Jung was more focused on moving back.

832
00:32:39,911 --> 00:32:42,851
(The two main leads were different in the details of expressions.)

833
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:45,420
I preferred Hyeok Jung.

834
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,420
Jin Ho is giving me a lot of energy,

835
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:50,491
a lot of eye contact... And I'm waiting for something more.

836
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:53,722
While Hyeok Jung today gave me the physicality that I loved.

837
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:55,890
But he also gave me the performance quality...

838
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,201
that I've been looking for.

839
00:32:57,462 --> 00:33:00,231
Between the main leads of "SKY Castle," Park Jin Ho...

840
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:01,532
and Yun Hyeok Jung,

841
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:04,542
who will receive the benefit points?

842
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:06,670
Wouldn't it be Jin Ho?

843
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:10,012
Jin Ho expressed his emotions well in terms of acting.

844
00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:12,482
I think all the judges chose Hyeok Jung.

845
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:15,311
If Hyeok Jung receives the benefit points...

846
00:33:15,312 --> 00:33:17,321
If Hyeok Jung receives them, it'll be a tie.

847
00:33:17,322 --> 00:33:18,351
It'll be close to a tie.

848
00:33:18,522 --> 00:33:19,522
The main lead...

849
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:22,322
- Jin Ho? - Please let it be Jin Ho.

850
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:23,752
Yun Hyeok Jung.

851
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:26,491
Jin Ho? Hyeok Jung?

852
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:27,591
(Who will receive the benefit points for the main lead role?)

853
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:28,930
Dancer Park Jin Ho.

854
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:31,101
(Park Jin Ho wins the benefit points for the main lead role.)

855
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,401
(We're proud of our main lead.)

856
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,832
Nice.

857
00:33:34,032 --> 00:33:36,501
As for Hyeok Jung, he showed the correct flow of techniques...

858
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:38,502
in terms of movements.

859
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,411
But I couldn't feel what story he was trying to convey.

860
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:44,380
But as for Jin Ho, he was an artist.

861
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:47,450
I forgot that I was a judge for a second.

862
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:49,751
I could see a character...

863
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:51,422
in "SKY Castle."

864
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:54,991
- Isn't that what dance is about? - That's right.

865
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,621
Isn't it the revolt of the Under Class?

866
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:57,961
The revolt of the Under Class.

867
00:33:57,962 --> 00:33:59,192
(That's right. It's the revolt of the Under Class.)

868
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:00,390
(Main Lead Role, Park Jin Ho, 500 points)

869
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:02,132
The main lead, Dancer Park Jin Ho...

870
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:04,701
will receive 500 benefit points. Congratulations.

871
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,701
(Proud)

872
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,332
- They took all the benefit points. - Team A had a clean sweep.

873
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:11,571
Team A had a clean sweep.

874
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:14,071
Jin Ho will move up the class.

875
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,240
Jin Ho.

876
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,410
(You'll move up.)

877
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:18,411
Right?

878
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:20,812
We received all the benefit points.

879
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:23,351
I thought that they'd give us an advantage.

880
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:25,482
I think I can join the Second Class.

881
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:27,321
Oh, no.

882
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:31,191
I don't know if I can continue to be in the First Class.

883
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:32,261
(Troubled)

884
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:35,231
Now, I'll reveal the current rankings...

885
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:37,661
of the 16 dancers of "SKY Castle."

886
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:39,062
(Startled)

887
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,261
The current rankings?

888
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:42,201
- Will we get our rankings too? - I think so.

889
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:44,871
I think I'll be at the very bottom.

890
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,301
It's so cruel.

891
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:48,910
("SKY Castle" Current Rankings)

892
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:51,811
With 1,000 team points and 500 benefit points,

893
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:55,351
Dancer Park Jin Ho ranked first.

894
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:57,252
Gosh, 1,500 points is a lot.

895
00:34:57,621 --> 00:35:00,281
- Hyeok Jung ranked fourth. - The rankings are the same.

896
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:02,221
There's a difference of 1,000 points.

897
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:04,591
Group dancers who weren't evaluated...

898
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:07,761
ranked last with 300 points.

899
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:09,192
There's a big difference.

900
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,332
It's time for the group dancers to move up.

901
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:15,701
That's what happens if you don't receive any points.

902
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:17,341
(Shocked)

903
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:18,571
It's so hard to move up.

904
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:21,671
It's too early to be relieved or disappointed.

905
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:23,941
Individual points that are decided by the number of views and likes...

906
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:25,681
of a dancer's solo video...

907
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:27,652
haven't been added yet.

908
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,850
The number of views and the number of likes...

909
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:32,652
weren't always proportional.

910
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:35,351
We don't know the number of likes.

911
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,192
- The current points... - Will it change the result?

912
00:35:38,692 --> 00:35:40,221
Then the rankings can change any time.

913
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:43,161
The number of views and likes is very important.

914
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,501
(Thinking)

915
00:35:44,502 --> 00:35:46,362
That's a bit dangerous.

916
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:49,030
To the individual points of each dancer,

917
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,741
the weight factor will be applied.

918
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:52,600
First Class dancers' points will be multiplied by 1.5.

919
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:54,141
Second Class dancers' points, by 1.3.

920
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:55,411
- Did he say 1.3? - I envy them.

921
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:57,741
Under Class dancers' points won't be multiplied.

922
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,241
The weight factor is cruel.

923
00:36:00,482 --> 00:36:03,451
Jin Ho will have a disadvantage in that regard.

924
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:06,451
His points won't be multiplied.

925
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:08,152
I was nervous.

926
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:09,522
Even if the score is the same,

927
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:12,221
I'll remain in the Under Class...

928
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:14,292
if the 1st Class and 2nd Class get their points multiplied.

929
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:17,861
First Class got the points multiplied by 1.5.

930
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:20,661
I wondered if that would help me catch up.

931
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:23,070
The sum of all points...

932
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:25,101
will be the final score of the dancer.

933
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:28,241
This score will be reflected in the Second Class Movement Ceremony.

934
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:30,141
It's so cruel.

935
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:31,811
Among the "SKY Castle" dancers,

936
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:34,212
who will get promoted and who will get demoted?

937
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:37,112
Everything will be revealed soon.

938
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:40,181
Next Class Evaluation is "Oldboy."

939
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:41,890
("Oldboy" Class Evaluation)

940
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:43,522
- Yes. - All right.

941
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:45,562
I'm excited about this one.

942
00:36:45,891 --> 00:36:48,362
Gosh, my heart is pounding.

943
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:51,131
In Team A of "Oldboy," the main lead role is...

944
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:53,502
Kim Hye Hyun of the Second Class,

945
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:56,070
and the main supporting roles are Kim Kyung Won of the Second Class...

946
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:58,701
and Kim Jae Jin of the Under Class.

947
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:01,311
In Team B of "Oldboy," the main lead role is...

948
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,042
Kim Jong Cheol of the First Class,

949
00:37:03,141 --> 00:37:05,780
and the main supporting roles are Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun...

950
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:08,051
of the second class.

951
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:10,582
This match is neck-and-neck.

952
00:37:11,022 --> 00:37:12,281
That's right. Hye Hyun and Jong Cheol.

953
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:15,221
When I looked at the casting board,

954
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:18,422
both Team A and Team B are very strong.

955
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:22,292
These dancers have a unique character.

956
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:25,300
Both teams expressed "Oldboy..."

957
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:28,332
- with their unique colors. - Yes.

958
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:29,471
I can't wait.

959
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:30,772
(The shoot of "Oldboy" performance)

960
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:33,002
(The "Oldboy" teams are getting their hair and makeup done.)

961
00:37:33,772 --> 00:37:34,812
We'll beat you guys.

962
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:36,411
What was that?

963
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:37,911
We'll beat you guys.

964
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:39,911
He's full of himself.

965
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:41,252
What's your mindset?

966
00:37:42,382 --> 00:37:45,022
We're the most suited for "Oldboy."

967
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:48,521
I think Moo Gan and I were married in our past lives.

968
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:49,851
We have the best teamwork.

969
00:37:50,192 --> 00:37:52,022
You guys didn't have the best teamwork.

970
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:55,092
The practice didn't go smoothly.

971
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:56,862
There were many trials and errors.

972
00:37:58,062 --> 00:38:00,462
Since there were many lifting movements,

973
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:04,641
Jong Cheol struggled a lot.

974
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:06,341
(This is so hard.)

975
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:08,712
I was usually the one to lift someone up.

976
00:38:08,812 --> 00:38:10,981
Since I became the one to get lifted up,

977
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:13,812
I ended up showing many shortcomings.

978
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:20,082
(Team B struggled with teamwork throughout practice.)

979
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:22,821
If I don't dance properly,

980
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:24,391
the teamwork will get ruined.

981
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:25,761
I was nervous.

982
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:28,391
(The lifting section which brought many mistakes during practice)

983
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:29,862
Be careful.

984
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:31,732
(Startled)

985
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:34,772
I thought, "We're ruined." I was shocked.

986
00:38:35,002 --> 00:38:36,632
Their movements aren't in sync with the music.

987
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:39,502
They missed a step.

988
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:42,442
(Team B made mistakes frequently throughout the rehearsal.)

989
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:43,942
We couldn't even show...

990
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,612
one-fourth of the teamwork the three of us had.

991
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:49,680
What was that?

992
00:38:49,681 --> 00:38:50,752
(Team B is in a confused state.)

993
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:53,752
(Team A's rehearsal begins.)

994
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:56,521
(Unlike Team B, )

995
00:38:56,522 --> 00:38:57,522
Nice.

996
00:38:57,523 --> 00:38:59,891
(Team A pulls off the lifting move perfectly.)

997
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,391
(He forces a smile.)

998
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:02,962
They're so good.

999
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:06,732
(Extremely clean)

1000
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,901
When it comes to lifting,

1001
00:39:09,902 --> 00:39:11,902
we have a ballerino, Kyung Won.

1002
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:15,911
He led us well like a teacher.

1003
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,641
You blocked him then.

1004
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,511
You need to trust the others.

1005
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:22,851
I received feedback.

1006
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:25,781
I think we had better teamwork thanks to that.

1007
00:39:26,482 --> 00:39:28,421
I think I picked the best dancers...

1008
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:30,821
for the main supporting roles.

1009
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:32,862
How are they so good?

1010
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:34,161
This is bad.

1011
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:38,061
"How can that team dance so smoothly?"

1012
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:41,601
"Why do we feel uncomfortable?" I had such worries.

1013
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:43,301
Then I thought, "We can't suddenly do well."

1014
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:46,241
"Let's do the best we can do..."

1015
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:47,971
"in this situation."

1016
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:51,911
We decided to do a better job with expressing our emotions.

1017
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:54,451
We decided to focus on something else.

1018
00:39:55,082 --> 00:39:56,350
Honey, let's go.

1019
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,451
(Team B makes a choice and focuses on what they can do.)

1020
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,451
(With the renewed minds, Team B's performance begins.)

1021
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:02,891
Can the dancer who received the same work as me...

1022
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:05,092
express it as well as me?

1023
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:07,792
Jong Cheol has the best acting skills.

1024
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:11,931
Our team has the perfect expressions.

1025
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:14,672
It's really nice since their acting is exaggerated.

1026
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:17,132
(Team A's performance gets filmed next.)

1027
00:40:18,442 --> 00:40:20,141
Hye Hyun is always...

1028
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,571
How should I say it? He's very rational.

1029
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,341
That's right. He doesn't waver.

1030
00:40:24,342 --> 00:40:25,411
No.

1031
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:27,982
He's a machine.

1032
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:31,321
He does everything the same without wavering once.

1033
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:34,021
In terms of character,

1034
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:36,292
our team suited "Oldboy" better.

1035
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,321
Overall, we were the personification of "Oldboy."

1036
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:42,832
The three of us had incredible teamwork.

1037
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:45,562
We could use stronger expressions,

1038
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,531
but we wanted to show our dance more.

1039
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,502
(Team A had the dance skills and Team B had the expressions.)

1040
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:53,141
(Between Team A and Team B of "Oldboy," which team will win?)

1041
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:55,672
Based on the Seat Class ticketing votes,

1042
00:40:55,772 --> 00:40:59,241
VIP and R seats for both teams have been sold out.

1043
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,382
(That's impressive.)

1044
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:03,612
The difference in the number of seats...

1045
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:05,551
between Team A and Team B...

1046
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,851
is only 797.

1047
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,721
- It's a small difference. - I know.

1048
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:12,962
It was neck-and-neck.

1049
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:15,692
Which team will prove its strength in ticket sales...

1050
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:16,991
and win?

1051
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:19,401
Now, the main lead role, Kim Hye Hyun...

1052
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:20,632
and the main supporting roles,

1053
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:24,172
Kim Kyung Won and Kim Jae Jin's "Oldboy" will be revealed.

1054
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:29,842
(Their anxiety level is at its max.)

1055
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:31,442
It'll be fun.

1056
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,112
I'm excited for this one.

1057
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,582
(What will Team A's "Oldboy" look like?)

1058
00:41:35,712 --> 00:41:39,621
(Team "Oldboy" A)

1059
00:41:39,851 --> 00:41:40,951
(Eye-catching)

1060
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:43,022
It's beautiful already.

1061
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:44,522
He's totally locked up.

1062
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:50,862
(The one who's locked up tries to escape.)

1063
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:56,801
Look at those visuals.

1064
00:41:56,802 --> 00:41:58,641
It's my first time seeing Hye Hyun's acting.

1065
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:02,641
That scene is nice.

1066
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,582
The solitary Hye Hyun.

1067
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:08,911
Beautiful.

1068
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:09,911
I got goosebumps.

1069
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:16,592
- He chose the right dancers. - I know.

1070
00:42:16,752 --> 00:42:18,991
The two main supporting dancers have similar vibes.

1071
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:23,661
He picked two very strong partners.

1072
00:42:26,362 --> 00:42:27,562
That's insane.

1073
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:33,640
(Main Support Kim Kyung Won and Kim Jae Jin's choreography section)

1074
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:36,711
I loved how Kyung Won brought out the ballet moves...

1075
00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:37,882
for this section.

1076
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:39,511
Kyung Won.

1077
00:42:41,252 --> 00:42:42,681
Both of them dance beautifully.

1078
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:45,820
(The dark energy explodes.)

1079
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:47,082
(It's electrifying.)

1080
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:48,491
Let's go.

1081
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:49,850
(Let me smile too.)

1082
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:51,261
(Main Support Kim Kyung Won and Kim Jae Jin's choreography section)

1083
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:55,292
It's insane.

1084
00:42:55,732 --> 00:42:57,132
All three of them are visible.

1085
00:42:58,732 --> 00:42:59,761
This part is cool.

1086
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:03,970
They have excellent teamwork.

1087
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:05,071
Beautiful.

1088
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:09,471
- Jae Jin has an incredible body. - What's up with his body?

1089
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,082
It was clean.

1090
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:21,121
A lift.

1091
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:25,091
(The 1st lift brings the 1st surprise.)

1092
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:26,191
(The 2nd lift...)

1093
00:43:26,192 --> 00:43:27,421
(brings even more surprise.)

1094
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:28,891
(What's that?)

1095
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:30,332
It's so clean.

1096
00:43:30,462 --> 00:43:32,732
Hye Hyun looks so beautiful.

1097
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:36,801
(The three dancers' movements make them exclaim.)

1098
00:43:38,272 --> 00:43:39,272
What?

1099
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:41,772
He's flying.

1100
00:43:42,071 --> 00:43:43,641
- Hye Hyun, wasn't it fun? - Yes.

1101
00:43:47,212 --> 00:43:48,252
Is this a circus?

1102
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:50,612
Hye Hyun nailed it.

1103
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:53,082
Show us.

1104
00:43:55,692 --> 00:43:57,922
- That's Jong Cheol's choreography. - That's right.

1105
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,761
- Hye Hyun, you're so good. - Hye Hyun, you're insane.

1106
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:04,562
He would've become the main lead with this choreography too.

1107
00:44:07,632 --> 00:44:08,971
Crystal clear.

1108
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:16,241
What was that jump?

1109
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,681
Hye Hyun is so strong.

1110
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:22,582
His movements are so neat and clear.

1111
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:26,721
Jae Jin!

1112
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:33,062
- How scary. - That's strong.

1113
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:39,261
- He's such a technician. - So smooth.

1114
00:44:40,402 --> 00:44:42,031
I love such expressions.

1115
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:44,531
It's like a movie.

1116
00:44:45,741 --> 00:44:46,801
I love everything.

1117
00:44:52,511 --> 00:44:53,681
I got goosebumps.

1118
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:00,851
He can act too.

1119
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:04,021
Hye Hyun's acting improved even more.

1120
00:45:04,022 --> 00:45:05,062
(The acting fairy)

1121
00:45:15,772 --> 00:45:16,871
His acting is so nice.

1122
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,342
Hye Hyun is commanding the camera.

1123
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:24,781
This scene is so nice.

1124
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,482
I love the vibe.

1125
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:29,111
Hye Hyun is the genius of choreography.

1126
00:45:29,112 --> 00:45:32,551
(Main Lead Kim Hye Hyun's choreography section)

1127
00:45:33,882 --> 00:45:36,890
(Main Lead Kim Hye Hyun's choreography section)

1128
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:39,062
The ensemble is dancing diligently too.

1129
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:43,991
Hye Hyun comes up with great choreography.

1130
00:45:47,062 --> 00:45:49,531
He perfectly understands how his body moves.

1131
00:45:51,772 --> 00:45:53,701
He can act so well.

1132
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:55,641
The last part.

1133
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,982
I got goosebumps.

1134
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:06,151
- Abs. - What?

1135
00:46:06,152 --> 00:46:07,550
(Something other than the Ab Fairy surprised them.)

1136
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:09,022
He's the ending fairy.

1137
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,522
Why is he so sexy?

1138
00:46:11,891 --> 00:46:13,092
(Embarrassed)

1139
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:15,292
They nailed the performance.

1140
00:46:15,491 --> 00:46:17,192
- They nailed the performance. - Oh, my goodness.

1141
00:46:17,832 --> 00:46:21,161
(Team "Oldboy" A's performance is over.)

1142
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:22,871
It was so cool.

1143
00:46:23,732 --> 00:46:24,971
I have no words.

1144
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:27,201
What were those abs?

1145
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:29,240
He had an armor on his stomach.

1146
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:30,241
(His abs were like an armor.)

1147
00:46:30,242 --> 00:46:31,611
He's like a crustacean.

1148
00:46:31,612 --> 00:46:33,411
How could dark lips be so charming?

1149
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:35,111
It was so cool.

1150
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:36,112
(The main supporting dancers left linger impressions.)

1151
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:39,152
(They did so well.)

1152
00:46:39,482 --> 00:46:41,280
- Bravo. - Hye Hyun...

1153
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:42,990
isn't a tall dancer, right?

1154
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:45,962
But he suited the concept so well.

1155
00:46:46,022 --> 00:46:48,390
- Yes. The deities of revenge... - It worked.

1156
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:49,430
- Conceptually, it worked. - Yes.

1157
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,961
Just even seeing their height difference...

1158
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:54,101
You automatically felt for Hye Hyun.

1159
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,772
I felt that he did a good job of choosing the supporting dancers.

1160
00:46:58,002 --> 00:46:59,570
It was a good casting call.

1161
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:03,011
I was very moved and surprised by Hye Hyun.

1162
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:05,841
We knew that he was a talented dancer...

1163
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:08,581
in terms of techniques and movements.

1164
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:11,211
But we didn't know how much...

1165
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:13,082
Hye Hyun could produce himself.

1166
00:47:13,252 --> 00:47:15,591
We were worried about that.

1167
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:18,391
His performance almost made me tear up.

1168
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:21,631
I could feel the emotions in his movements.

1169
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:24,862
But he also acted with his facial expressions.

1170
00:47:26,462 --> 00:47:27,530
I suddenly feel sad.

1171
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:29,430
(Coach Choi Soo Jin got emotional from watching his performance.)

1172
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:31,740
There was an incredible synergy.

1173
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:33,342
It really moved me.

1174
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:35,471
The details and quality of the movements...

1175
00:47:36,342 --> 00:47:37,842
All three main dancers did well.

1176
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:39,842
All three of them did well.

1177
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:42,582
The lead and supporting dancers went well together.

1178
00:47:42,752 --> 00:47:47,450
The key points we worked hard on were captured in the video.

1179
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,692
So I thought, "We have a chance."

1180
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,851
I was confident.

1181
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:52,461
Now, the main lead role, Kim Jong Cheol...

1182
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:55,260
and the main supporting roles, Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun's...

1183
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:57,031
"Oldboy" will be revealed.

1184
00:47:57,692 --> 00:47:59,002
I'm excited about this one.

1185
00:47:59,402 --> 00:48:01,002
Let's go, Jong Cheol.

1186
00:48:01,132 --> 00:48:03,402
The supporting dancers have a strong image.

1187
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:04,942
They really seem like villains.

1188
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,542
I think I've seen them on news.

1189
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,411
I bet it'll be very different.

1190
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,241
It's very different.

1191
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:11,812
It'll be a lot of fun.

1192
00:48:11,911 --> 00:48:14,181
(Team "Oldboy" B)

1193
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,281
- It's different from the start. - Yes. There's heaviness.

1194
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:23,491
The acting is nice.

1195
00:48:24,422 --> 00:48:26,661
(His acting skills explode.)

1196
00:48:28,132 --> 00:48:29,132
(Absorbed)

1197
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:30,332
He can act well.

1198
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:33,002
- Jong Cheol has good expressions. - I know. His acting is nice.

1199
00:48:37,732 --> 00:48:39,101
They have a good atmosphere.

1200
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:41,141
It's like a scene of a drama.

1201
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:43,511
The acting is insane.

1202
00:48:46,582 --> 00:48:47,681
It's different.

1203
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:58,760
(Main Support Kim Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun's...)

1204
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,390
(choreography section)

1205
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:01,491
They're really good.

1206
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:02,761
(Glancing over)

1207
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:06,732
- They interpreted the music. - How delicate.

1208
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:14,502
- It's grotesque. - This pair is strong.

1209
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:18,410
The two of them make a good picture.

1210
00:49:18,411 --> 00:49:20,542
I feel like they're communicating.

1211
00:49:24,152 --> 00:49:25,482
Jong Cheol is good too.

1212
00:49:30,022 --> 00:49:32,192
Nice. This trio is nice.

1213
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:36,991
It really feels different.

1214
00:49:37,632 --> 00:49:38,632
They have good teamwork.

1215
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:53,542
I love this part.

1216
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:58,351
His facial expressions are incredible.

1217
00:49:59,022 --> 00:50:00,022
It's his choreography.

1218
00:50:01,821 --> 00:50:03,391
He's definitely good at his own choreography.

1219
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:08,862
It's nice.

1220
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:14,971
That's insane.

1221
00:50:15,232 --> 00:50:17,570
(Satisfied)

1222
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:19,042
That's insane.

1223
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:22,471
It's beautiful.

1224
00:50:23,011 --> 00:50:24,571
He's gentle and strong.

1225
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:26,581
I love the lethargic vibe.

1226
00:50:26,582 --> 00:50:27,781
I know. I love his expressions.

1227
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:29,551
How is he so detailed?

1228
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:33,252
(The deities of revenge enter once more.)

1229
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:35,720
(The madness is...)

1230
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,121
(insane.)

1231
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:42,062
I'll be so scared if the two of them come at me.

1232
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,632
Nice.

1233
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:52,772
I got goosebumps.

1234
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,141
I feel so bad for Jong Cheol. Oh, no.

1235
00:50:56,112 --> 00:50:57,871
His expressions are insane.

1236
00:51:02,551 --> 00:51:03,851
His facial expressions are insane.

1237
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:06,281
Jong Cheol's eyes are lively.

1238
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:14,321
How cool.

1239
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,201
It's cool.

1240
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:23,132
He's good.

1241
00:51:24,672 --> 00:51:26,402
His acting is incredible.

1242
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:28,141
(Absorbed)

1243
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:30,612
I like this part.

1244
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:32,542
His facial expression...

1245
00:51:34,482 --> 00:51:36,482
(Main Lead Kim Jong Cheol's choreography section)

1246
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:44,521
(The atmosphere is...)

1247
00:51:44,522 --> 00:51:46,191
(insane.)

1248
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:47,562
He pulled off the highlight well.

1249
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:50,092
Jong Cheol looks strong, too.

1250
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,261
He's laughing. That's so creepy.

1251
00:51:53,431 --> 00:51:54,431
(Laughter of madness)

1252
00:51:54,432 --> 00:51:56,970
(Main Lead Kim Jong Cheol's choreography section)

1253
00:51:56,971 --> 00:51:58,542
His acting is amazing.

1254
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:01,772
- He looks extremely sad. - Incredible.

1255
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:09,152
(Main Lead Kim Jong Cheol's choreography section)

1256
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:13,551
- I like Jong Cheol's acting. - I can feel how desperate he is.

1257
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:16,592
How is he so good at acting?

1258
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:18,891
It feels like I'm watching the movie.

1259
00:52:24,462 --> 00:52:27,531
(Team "Oldboy" B's performance is over.)

1260
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:32,171
(The deity of revenge seizes our attention.)

1261
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:34,201
(A huge fan of the deity of revenge)

1262
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:38,140
(We're the ending fairies in this part.)

1263
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:40,241
(That's what the last scene looked like.)

1264
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:42,582
It looks great.

1265
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,451
Their acting was amazing.

1266
00:52:44,582 --> 00:52:47,821
There's depth in Jong Cheol's expression.

1267
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:49,490
It's quite different.

1268
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:51,050
- Isn't it very different? - Oh, no.

1269
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:53,661
Team B is carefree and has a stronger personality.

1270
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:55,831
The lead role was visible when he danced.

1271
00:52:55,832 --> 00:52:58,862
The main supporting dancers were clearly visible when they danced.

1272
00:52:58,962 --> 00:53:01,361
Seat Class Evaluation for "Old Boy."

1273
00:53:01,362 --> 00:53:03,201
I'll announce the result now.

1274
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:05,171
("Old Boy" Seat Class Evaluation)

1275
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:07,171
Based on the Seat Class ticketing votes,

1276
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:10,841
VIP and R seats for both teams have been sold out.

1277
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:12,041
(3,000 VIP seats, 4,000 R seats for both teams)

1278
00:53:12,042 --> 00:53:14,140
(The war of tickets between two teams was intense.)

1279
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:15,511
It will be determined by the number of S seats.

1280
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:17,811
There's a limit of 5,000 S seats.

1281
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:20,752
I'll announce the result of the vote.

1282
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:22,821
Team A with Main Lead Kim Hye Hyun.

1283
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:26,191
My team showed better teamwork,

1284
00:53:26,192 --> 00:53:27,292
so I feel confident.

1285
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:28,692
Are they sold out?

1286
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:30,391
Kim Hye Hyun's team sold...

1287
00:53:30,632 --> 00:53:33,232
3,605 S seats.

1288
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,601
(Unfortunately, their S seats weren't sold out.)

1289
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:38,442
It was a bummer.

1290
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:42,171
(Surprised)

1291
00:53:42,172 --> 00:53:43,712
We definitely had a shot at winning.

1292
00:53:44,312 --> 00:53:48,042
Next, I'll announce the result for Team B.

1293
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:50,551
Moo Gan has strong power over the audience.

1294
00:53:50,882 --> 00:53:52,621
We could be superior to them.

1295
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:54,720
Kim Jong Cheol's team...

1296
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:56,221
(What will be the result of the S seat sales?)

1297
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:59,092
(Team B sold 4,344 S seats.)

1298
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:02,031
(Relieved)

1299
00:54:03,692 --> 00:54:04,962
(Disappointed)

1300
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:10,531
Team B with Main Lead Kim Jong Cheol.

1301
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:13,041
They sold 4,344 seats.

1302
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:16,011
Kim Jong Cheol's team sold more seats.

1303
00:54:16,672 --> 00:54:20,882
Team A's total number of tickets sold is 10,845 seats.

1304
00:54:21,281 --> 00:54:25,082
Team B's total number of tickets sold is 11,642 seats.

1305
00:54:25,422 --> 00:54:27,950
As a result, with a difference of 797 seats,

1306
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:30,251
Team B lead by Main Lead Kim Jong Cheol...

1307
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:32,220
is the winner.

1308
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:33,292
Congratulations.

1309
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:40,901
If I had worked harder, the result could've been different.

1310
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,431
I felt disappointed.

1311
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,002
I feel very happy.

1312
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:47,002
It was Seong Yun,

1313
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:50,671
so I knew he could lift me easily.

1314
00:54:50,672 --> 00:54:55,081
I believe that Moo Gan completed the choreography.

1315
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:58,951
I made a good choice on two supporting dancers.

1316
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:03,450
Now, I'll announce the benefit points...

1317
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:06,660
based on the masters, coaches, choreographers,

1318
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:08,862
and rehearsal directors' evaluation on main roles.

1319
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:12,201
"Old Boy" main supporting roles, Kim Kyung Won and Kim Jae Jin...

1320
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:14,361
versus Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun.

1321
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:17,070
Here's the result of the match of their roles.

1322
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:18,300
People think differently,

1323
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:20,401
but what they see is similar.

1324
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:21,740
We have a chance of winning.

1325
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:23,112
I was worried.

1326
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:25,680
However, our performance was...

1327
00:55:25,681 --> 00:55:28,752
much more superior to theirs.

1328
00:55:29,082 --> 00:55:31,381
Team A danced in sync...

1329
00:55:31,382 --> 00:55:33,451
with the drama of the story.

1330
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:36,451
However, their personality didn't stand out.

1331
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:39,791
Individual dancers on Team B showed...

1332
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:42,031
outstanding acting and dancing skills.

1333
00:55:42,562 --> 00:55:45,260
In order to compare them,

1334
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:48,401
I should consider the overall picture.

1335
00:55:48,402 --> 00:55:50,401
Which supporting dancers are in sync...

1336
00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:52,741
with both the main lead and the ensemble?

1337
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:54,240
For me, it was Team A.

1338
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:57,112
They're main supporting roles, not supporting roles.

1339
00:55:57,212 --> 00:56:00,842
They're given particular roles and characters.

1340
00:56:01,181 --> 00:56:03,280
How they play their role...

1341
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:05,180
and their creativity in movements.

1342
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:07,252
Those were important for me.

1343
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:09,950
In my opinion, Team B's...

1344
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:13,462
main supporting roles did a better job.

1345
00:56:13,821 --> 00:56:14,861
I see.

1346
00:56:14,862 --> 00:56:17,332
- Their charms are very different. - Definitely.

1347
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:19,530
Which dancers played main supporting roles better...

1348
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:21,732
and won benefit points?

1349
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:23,171
Who do you think they are?

1350
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,902
Yang and Ki for supporting roles.

1351
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,970
- Yang and Ki? - Main supporting dancers...

1352
00:56:26,971 --> 00:56:28,140
(The winner of main supporting roles)

1353
00:56:28,141 --> 00:56:30,212
Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun.

1354
00:56:30,442 --> 00:56:31,841
(Team B, Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun)

1355
00:56:31,842 --> 00:56:33,140
(They win main supporting role benefit points.)

1356
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:34,312
(Feeling bitter)

1357
00:56:36,112 --> 00:56:37,281
I was bummed out.

1358
00:56:37,482 --> 00:56:40,550
I don't think we did a bad job. It wasn't flawless,

1359
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:43,450
but Team B won due to the difference in preference.

1360
00:56:43,451 --> 00:56:45,861
To Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun,

1361
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:48,761
500 benefit points will be given. Congratulations.

1362
00:56:48,931 --> 00:56:50,491
("Old Boy" Main Role Benefit Points)

1363
00:56:50,862 --> 00:56:51,862
Thank you.

1364
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:55,061
Now, I'll announce the benefit points...

1365
00:56:55,062 --> 00:56:57,231
based on the masters, coaches, choreographers,

1366
00:56:57,232 --> 00:56:59,442
and rehearsal directors' evaluation on main lead roles.

1367
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,070
Team B with...

1368
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:03,971
Main Lead Kim Jong Cheol was chosen by the public.

1369
00:57:04,442 --> 00:57:06,611
Will Main Lead Kim Jong Cheol...

1370
00:57:06,612 --> 00:57:09,982
also be chosen by masters, coaches, and choreographers?

1371
00:57:10,212 --> 00:57:11,311
My pick is Jong Cheol.

1372
00:57:11,312 --> 00:57:14,021
In the first scene, I could almost hear...

1373
00:57:14,022 --> 00:57:16,551
Jong Cheol say, "Where am I?"

1374
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:20,660
From the beginning, he was saying a lot of things.

1375
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:24,291
It seems like he understands his role perfectly,

1376
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:26,331
and he knows how to express himself.

1377
00:57:26,332 --> 00:57:28,100
He's immersed in his role,

1378
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:29,930
and he's extremely focused.

1379
00:57:29,931 --> 00:57:31,632
Whereas with Kim Hye Hyun,

1380
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:34,601
I feel like I'm sitting in the theater watching his premier.

1381
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:38,112
In Hye Hyun, I see something very professional.

1382
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:40,881
He's expressing the emotions...

1383
00:57:40,882 --> 00:57:43,481
and the storyline through movement.

1384
00:57:43,482 --> 00:57:45,051
And expression.

1385
00:57:45,721 --> 00:57:47,151
Not just through his face.

1386
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:49,490
Between Kim Hye Hyun and Kim Jong Cheol,

1387
00:57:49,491 --> 00:57:51,450
which dancer will receive the benefit points?

1388
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:53,620
Our performance was good,

1389
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:55,461
so I thought that I'd win.

1390
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:56,631
Our team had lost,

1391
00:57:56,632 --> 00:57:59,661
but I was confident about winning the benefit points.

1392
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,200
Main lead role.

1393
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:02,871
(Which main lead role will win the benefit points?)

1394
00:58:03,132 --> 00:58:04,501
It's Kim Hye Hyun.

1395
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:06,942
(Team A Kim Hye Hyun wins the benefit points.)

1396
00:58:07,772 --> 00:58:11,772
Main Lead Kim Hye Hyun will be given 500 benefit points.

1397
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:12,881
(Disappointed)

1398
00:58:12,882 --> 00:58:13,982
Congratulations, Hye Hyun.

1399
00:58:14,112 --> 00:58:16,481
Both of them were outstanding with their own personality.

1400
00:58:16,482 --> 00:58:19,381
Technically, Hye Hyun was clean.

1401
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:21,280
Even his expression was natural...

1402
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,390
like flowing water.

1403
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:26,192
I believe that Hye Hyun was better.

1404
00:58:26,362 --> 00:58:27,761
I was disappointed,

1405
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:32,062
but I got to show that I like this type of expression.

1406
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,231
I'm content for today.

1407
00:58:34,232 --> 00:58:36,600
I will announce the current ranking...

1408
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:39,101
of 14 dancers in "Old Boy."

1409
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:41,271
("Old Boy" Current Ranking)

1410
00:58:41,272 --> 00:58:44,841
With 1,000 team points and 500 benefit points,

1411
00:58:44,842 --> 00:58:48,442
Ki Moo Gan and Yang Seong Yun are both in first place.

1412
00:58:48,781 --> 00:58:50,780
Group dancers who weren't evaluated...

1413
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:54,451
place last with 300 points.

1414
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:56,522
Both of them are in third place.

1415
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:57,950
With Kim Jong Cheol.

1416
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,260
(Kim Jong Cheol and Kim Hye Hyun are both in 3rd place.)

1417
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:01,721
It's really neck-and-neck.

1418
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,961
Among "Old Boy" dancers,

1419
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:06,701
who will be promoted and demoted?

1420
00:59:07,101 --> 00:59:08,301
It's hard to tell.

1421
00:59:08,871 --> 00:59:10,930
It will be revealed in a minute.

1422
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:12,571
Next Class Evaluation is...

1423
00:59:12,801 --> 00:59:13,841
(Nervous)

1424
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,001
We look forward to it.

1425
00:59:15,002 --> 00:59:16,471
(Could it be us?)

1426
00:59:17,172 --> 00:59:18,312
It's "Squid Game."

1427
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:20,081
("Squid Game" Class Evaluation)

1428
00:59:20,082 --> 00:59:21,341
(Let's do this.)

1429
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:23,781
- Squid. - Everyone, please scream.

1430
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:25,522
Please scream.

1431
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:27,350
I can't wait to watch this.

1432
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:31,651
It's based on the soundtrack and concept of "Squid Game."

1433
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,991
Choreographed by Jung Bo Kyung,

1434
00:59:34,062 --> 00:59:35,731
it's a story about contestants...

1435
00:59:35,732 --> 00:59:39,031
who get confused in the midst of competition and unity.

1436
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:42,101
Team A's main lead role is Kang Gyeong Ho.

1437
00:59:42,531 --> 00:59:46,601
Kim Si Won and Go Dong Hoon are cast for main supporting roles.

1438
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:49,911
Team B's main lead role is Park Jun Woo.

1439
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:54,112
Kim Hyun Ho and Kim Hyo Joon are cast for main supporting roles.

1440
00:59:54,312 --> 00:59:55,680
How did "Squid Game" go?

1441
00:59:55,681 --> 00:59:57,381
We covered the floor of the stage with earth.

1442
00:59:57,382 --> 00:59:59,422
- Seriously? - Yes, and so...

1443
00:59:59,951 --> 01:00:01,081
(Exclaiming)

1444
01:00:01,082 --> 01:00:02,082
What's this?

1445
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:03,091
(Jaws dropping)

1446
01:00:03,092 --> 01:00:05,051
- Dong Hoon, it's incredible. - I know.

1447
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:07,221
(Welcome to "Squid Game.")

1448
01:00:07,891 --> 01:00:09,732
(The stage recreated a scene from the drama)

1449
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:12,401
(The most spectacular ever)

1450
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:15,570
I was very surprised by the stage set.

1451
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:19,300
The vibe of "Squid Game" was recreated so well.

1452
01:00:19,301 --> 01:00:20,772
I was pleased with it.

1453
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:24,112
The floor was covered with real sand.

1454
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:26,011
It's firm...

1455
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:28,010
(It's not easy to dance barefoot with the sand.)

1456
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,252
- Will you be okay, Gyeong Ho? - It won't be easy.

1457
01:00:30,382 --> 01:00:32,851
It was quite hard to get used to the sand.

1458
01:00:33,582 --> 01:00:35,751
(It's hard to turn barefoot due to the sand.)

1459
01:00:35,752 --> 01:00:37,191
Don't you think that it's better to wear socks?

1460
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:38,192
Yes.

1461
01:00:38,193 --> 01:00:41,562
It was important to make Gyeong Ho visible.

1462
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:46,200
Main supporting dancer's role should support the main lead...

1463
01:00:46,201 --> 01:00:49,100
so that he can dance as much as he wants.

1464
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:50,672
Let's start.

1465
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:54,300
(Powerful jump)

1466
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:55,741
Gyeong Ho is very good...

1467
01:00:56,212 --> 01:00:58,410
at making such powerful moves.

1468
01:00:58,411 --> 01:01:00,081
Because each of those moves is noticed,

1469
01:01:00,082 --> 01:01:02,652
- they accumulate. - I agree.

1470
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:05,151
Gyeong Ho's solo part looked amazing.

1471
01:01:05,152 --> 01:01:08,321
You could see the style of ballet.

1472
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:11,022
I could only look at Gyeong Ho at that moment.

1473
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:14,462
I worked hard to make it memorable.

1474
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:16,562
I did enough to avoid feeling ashamed.

1475
01:01:16,732 --> 01:01:18,191
(The lifting part)

1476
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:19,402
(Perfect success)

1477
01:01:19,902 --> 01:01:21,300
(His lips are getting dry.)

1478
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:23,471
He was so good, so I felt anxious.

1479
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:26,300
To be perfectly honest,

1480
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,772
I thought that Jun Woo might not be able to pull it off.

1481
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:31,910
(1st try)

1482
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:33,740
(Failed)

1483
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:34,741
(2nd try)

1484
01:01:34,742 --> 01:01:36,180
(Failed)

1485
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:38,982
I was scared of being lifted.

1486
01:01:39,382 --> 01:01:41,021
Gyeong Ho was fearless.

1487
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:43,091
He was good at jumping.

1488
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:44,751
Be careful.

1489
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:46,021
Two, three.

1490
01:01:46,022 --> 01:01:47,022
(Success)

1491
01:01:47,023 --> 01:01:48,390
(Really in awe)

1492
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:50,490
At the end, he made it.

1493
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:52,301
It's fine as long as I do it better.

1494
01:01:52,601 --> 01:01:54,402
That's why I wasn't worried at all.

1495
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:58,002
(Team B rehearses the main lead's choreography section.)

1496
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:03,511
The spotlight looks great on him.

1497
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:07,011
- But it's not very impactful. - It looks good.

1498
01:02:07,112 --> 01:02:09,212
Hyun Ho and Hyo Joon's teamwork was good.

1499
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:12,251
- Let's try that from... - Do we have any advantage?

1500
01:02:12,252 --> 01:02:14,651
Hyun Ho made a special move,

1501
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:17,252
so we were very nervous.

1502
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:19,422
(Team B's main supporting roles' choreography section)

1503
01:02:23,462 --> 01:02:24,531
Goodness.

1504
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:26,362
Goodness.

1505
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:29,971
- It doesn't come out well. - It doesn't look special.

1506
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:31,471
On the sand,

1507
01:02:31,971 --> 01:02:34,641
there was too much friction.

1508
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:36,942
I kept changing it during the rehearsal.

1509
01:02:37,272 --> 01:02:40,842
Before the shoot, I kept working on it with Hyo Joon.

1510
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:42,180
Then go.

1511
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:44,212
(The sand on the floor made it different from practice.)

1512
01:02:44,652 --> 01:02:47,221
Not using the floor turned ou to be a good choice.

1513
01:02:47,321 --> 01:02:49,951
- I was against it when I found out. - Right.

1514
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:53,761
- One, two, three. - Nice.

1515
01:02:54,592 --> 01:02:55,691
(Exclaiming)

1516
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:59,461
- Wait. They made it. - Gosh, they pulled it off.

1517
01:02:59,462 --> 01:03:00,531
This isn't good.

1518
01:03:00,632 --> 01:03:01,701
Nice.

1519
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:05,071
I found some stability, so I was relieved.

1520
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:07,571
I picked amazing main supporting dancers.

1521
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,811
They did much more...

1522
01:03:10,812 --> 01:03:13,612
than what I hoped from them.

1523
01:03:13,882 --> 01:03:17,082
I started getting wary because I felt competitive.

1524
01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:19,422
You and I tried this before.

1525
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:22,620
- You should bump into you. - Sharply?

1526
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:23,922
- Instead of moving like a block? - Right.

1527
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:26,691
I wanted an overwhelming victory...

1528
01:03:26,692 --> 01:03:29,832
in both main lead and supporting roles.

1529
01:03:32,261 --> 01:03:33,332
Goodness.

1530
01:03:34,301 --> 01:03:36,172
They had to be in sync,

1531
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:38,402
but they were somewhat off.

1532
01:03:38,531 --> 01:03:42,141
Our main supporting dancers nail the choreography section.

1533
01:03:42,871 --> 01:03:45,510
We couldn't find the best solution...

1534
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:47,212
for both of us.

1535
01:03:47,712 --> 01:03:51,051
Main supporting dancers on my team went through a lot of conflict.

1536
01:03:51,152 --> 01:03:52,422
Because of the music,

1537
01:03:52,522 --> 01:03:56,021
- it can't be helped. - We should consider places too.

1538
01:03:56,022 --> 01:03:59,092
- The counts are important, but... - At that count...

1539
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:00,862
Things didn't go smoothly.

1540
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,732
The choreography kept changing.

1541
01:04:03,192 --> 01:04:05,632
We changed the choreography until the last day.

1542
01:04:06,962 --> 01:04:09,402
The costumes...

1543
01:04:10,772 --> 01:04:11,801
Right, no matter what.

1544
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:14,801
There were ideas about that scene.

1545
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:17,011
I just came up with this idea.

1546
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:19,281
It could look great if you lift it up like this.

1547
01:04:19,812 --> 01:04:22,141
No, he could look like a flasher.

1548
01:04:22,851 --> 01:04:24,082
Is that so?

1549
01:04:24,712 --> 01:04:26,551
(Team B keeps practicing the main supporting role's choreography.)

1550
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:29,521
- Ma'am, about this... - They're already doing it.

1551
01:04:29,522 --> 01:04:30,921
I just want to tell her this.

1552
01:04:30,922 --> 01:04:33,320
- They're doing it. She changed it. - Really?

1553
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:34,862
I just wanted to share some know-how.

1554
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:38,592
Both Dong Hoon and I have strong personality,

1555
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:40,902
so I didn't like that side of him.

1556
01:04:41,402 --> 01:04:43,600
We spent a lot of energy...

1557
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:45,371
on compromising with each other.

1558
01:04:45,672 --> 01:04:49,342
It's unfortunate that we couldn't express ourselves to its fullest.

1559
01:04:49,741 --> 01:04:52,712
(Which team will win the main role benefits?)

1560
01:04:53,082 --> 01:04:55,112
Now, Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho,

1561
01:04:55,442 --> 01:04:57,481
Main Supporting Role Kim Si Won and Go Dong Hoon's...

1562
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:59,011
"Squid Game" will be revealed.

1563
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:00,621
"Squid Game," let's go.

1564
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:02,851
(Exclaiming)

1565
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:04,591
(Team "Squid Game" A)

1566
01:05:04,592 --> 01:05:07,121
(Main lead, main supporting role, ensemble)

1567
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,431
It looks beautiful.

1568
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:12,632
- My gosh. - It's "Squid Game."

1569
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:16,272
My goodness.

1570
01:05:19,701 --> 01:05:20,701
Gosh.

1571
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:23,212
Goodness.

1572
01:05:23,871 --> 01:05:24,911
Hey.

1573
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:27,781
(Completely focused)

1574
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:31,982
The costumes look really nice.

1575
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:35,152
How can they dance on the sand?

1576
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:36,891
Goodness.

1577
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:38,051
Si Won looks strong.

1578
01:05:40,462 --> 01:05:41,721
The main supporting dancers are strong too.

1579
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:46,030
We're perfectly in sync.

1580
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:47,362
(Very focused)

1581
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,272
- Bang. - My goodness.

1582
01:05:56,712 --> 01:05:57,911
I love this part.

1583
01:05:59,342 --> 01:06:00,342
Gosh.

1584
01:06:01,141 --> 01:06:03,011
- Oh, my. - Look how cloudy it is.

1585
01:06:05,351 --> 01:06:06,382
Here it comes.

1586
01:06:06,781 --> 01:06:07,922
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1587
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,051
He's good.

1588
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:12,691
He's very sharp.

1589
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:13,692
(He's good.)

1590
01:06:14,321 --> 01:06:15,321
Gosh.

1591
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:21,031
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

1592
01:06:21,632 --> 01:06:23,571
Using the head doesn't look easy.

1593
01:06:24,931 --> 01:06:26,672
They used the costumes very well.

1594
01:06:31,272 --> 01:06:32,582
Gyeong Ho is good at the floor technique.

1595
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:35,582
Gyeong Ho is good.

1596
01:06:35,842 --> 01:06:36,911
(In awe)

1597
01:06:37,482 --> 01:06:38,551
He's good.

1598
01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:45,652
(In love with Gyeong Ho)

1599
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:46,922
He's attacking with his look.

1600
01:06:50,692 --> 01:06:51,962
(That's incredible.)

1601
01:06:52,132 --> 01:06:56,300
(Go Dong Hoon and Kim Si Won's choreography section)

1602
01:06:56,301 --> 01:06:59,902
"Squid Game" theme suits Dong Hoon very well.

1603
01:07:01,071 --> 01:07:02,711
- Gosh. - That's insane.

1604
01:07:02,712 --> 01:07:04,010
(That's me.)

1605
01:07:04,011 --> 01:07:05,011
Feels strange?

1606
01:07:05,012 --> 01:07:09,850
(Go Dong Hoon and Kim Si Won's choreography section)

1607
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:10,910
It's neat.

(Go Dong Hoon and Kim Si Won's choreography section)

1609
01:07:12,212 --> 01:07:13,281
Look at their acting.

(Go Dong Hoon and Kim Si Won's choreography section)

1611
01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:16,522
Look at that.

(Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho's choreography section)

1613
01:07:19,761 --> 01:07:21,891
- Gosh. - My goodness.

1614
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:23,791
He looks amazing.

1615
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,930
(Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho's choreography section)

1616
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:28,160
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1617
01:07:28,161 --> 01:07:29,471
He's got the right feeling.

1618
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:31,530
(Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho's choreography section)

1619
01:07:31,531 --> 01:07:33,942
- Gosh. - He jumped on that floor.

(Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho's choreography section)

1622
01:07:38,772 --> 01:07:39,811
He's good.

1623
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:41,342
(Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho's choreography section)

1624
01:07:44,082 --> 01:07:45,152
Look at the sand.

1625
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:47,882
They must have worked so hard.

1626
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:50,652
He looks good whenever I see him.

1627
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:54,562
Dong Hoon's expression is incredible.

1628
01:07:58,092 --> 01:07:59,802
Father, your acting is good.

1629
01:08:00,462 --> 01:08:01,531
(Surprised)

1630
01:08:01,701 --> 01:08:02,701
Gosh.

1631
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:11,741
They gave the ensemble a lot of opportunity.

1632
01:08:11,842 --> 01:08:12,911
It looks amazing.

1633
01:08:16,651 --> 01:08:17,712
Gyeong Ho.

1634
01:08:19,752 --> 01:08:21,382
Oh, my.

1635
01:08:23,252 --> 01:08:24,252
They're really good.

1636
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:27,521
Gyeong Ho looks incredible.

1637
01:08:39,472 --> 01:08:40,642
They worked hard.

1638
01:08:42,271 --> 01:08:45,570
Gyeong Ho is so overwhelming. He's so handsome.

1639
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:47,411
"Squid Game" looked amazing.

1640
01:08:48,182 --> 01:08:50,852
- The choreography was nice. - The choreography was amazing.

1641
01:08:51,281 --> 01:08:52,951
How is he handsome and good at dancing?

1642
01:08:53,222 --> 01:08:54,682
(Applauding)

1643
01:08:55,021 --> 01:08:57,191
- I got goosebumps. - Beautiful composition.

1644
01:08:57,991 --> 01:09:00,961
I couldn't take my eyes off of Gyeong Ho.

1645
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:02,832
- It really gave me goosebumps. - Right?

1646
01:09:03,031 --> 01:09:05,660
Throughout the choreography, he danced...

1647
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:08,061
with powerful and active accents.

1648
01:09:08,332 --> 01:09:13,771
(Kang Gyeong Ho caught our attention with overwhelming power and energy.)

1649
01:09:13,871 --> 01:09:16,712
What I'll say is that Gyeong Ho doesn't look like a ballet dancer,

1650
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:18,441
which is really impressive.

1651
01:09:18,642 --> 01:09:20,811
Right. In my opinion,

1652
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,110
- Gyeong Ho has many talents. - I agree.

1653
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:26,921
In other words, he's an all-around dancer.

1654
01:09:26,922 --> 01:09:29,691
I also thought that Dong Hoon's dancing...

1655
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:32,592
matched very well with "Squid Game" soundtrack.

1656
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:34,320
Again, I agree with you, Joo Won.

1657
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:35,991
I thought that Si Won was going to...

1658
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:39,502
take my breath my away, but Dong Hoon...

1659
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:41,801
When Dong Hoon dances,

1660
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,801
he's very skilled with showing his lines...

1661
01:09:44,802 --> 01:09:46,642
and executing techniques.

1662
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:48,701
While Gyeong Ho was acting,

1663
01:09:49,002 --> 01:09:51,542
I loved the moving energy beside him.

1664
01:09:52,111 --> 01:09:54,511
Now, Main Lead Park Jun Woo,

1665
01:09:54,512 --> 01:09:57,212
Main Supporting Role Kim Hyun Ho and Kim Hyo Joon's...

1666
01:09:57,311 --> 01:09:59,212
"Squid Game" will be revealed.

1667
01:09:59,311 --> 01:10:02,151
- Are we going to see Team B now? - I wonder how Team B did.

1668
01:10:02,382 --> 01:10:04,252
(Team "Squid Game" B)

1669
01:10:04,422 --> 01:10:07,361
- This will also be fun to watch. - They're good dancers too.

1670
01:10:08,222 --> 01:10:10,132
Both supporting dancers have played lead roles.

1671
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,831
(Second Class Cross)

1672
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,031

1673
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:15,602
The lights are so beautiful.

1674
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:18,502
The color is different. Theirs is blue.

1675
01:10:18,972 --> 01:10:21,302
- Gosh. - Oh, nice.

1676
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:22,542
Oh, my.

1677
01:10:22,842 --> 01:10:24,172
The acting toast bread.

1678
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:27,182
Gyeong Ho looked better in the first scene.

1679
01:10:34,552 --> 01:10:37,222
- Isn't it refreshing to watch? - He takes a lot of space.

1680
01:10:37,892 --> 01:10:38,892
Gosh, Hyo Joon.

1681
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:40,592
The supporting dancers are really strong.

1682
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:45,762
- Hyun Ho is good. - Supporting dancers are in sync.

1683
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:48,962
- The main lead is so good. - They have good teamwork.

1684
01:10:49,672 --> 01:10:51,071
- Hey. - Nice.

1685
01:10:53,472 --> 01:10:55,642
Gosh, Hyo Joon flew just now.

1686
01:10:56,472 --> 01:10:57,771
They look nice.

1687
01:10:58,371 --> 01:10:59,611
Hyo Joon is insane.

1688
01:11:00,642 --> 01:11:02,852
The choreography for the ensemble looks very intense.

1689
01:11:02,951 --> 01:11:04,311
It must have been hard for the ensemble.

1690
01:11:05,882 --> 01:11:06,922
Let's go, Jun Woo.

1691
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:08,021
Nice.

1692
01:11:08,022 --> 01:11:11,352
This is the biggest surprise he's shown so far. Jun Woo.

1693
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:14,061
Jun Woo has great presence.

1694
01:11:14,422 --> 01:11:15,422
Dancers in the back are flying.

1695
01:11:16,262 --> 01:11:18,392
- Brise vole. - He did a good job.

1696
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:22,731
Good job, Jun Woo.

1697
01:11:24,002 --> 01:11:25,371
He has beautiful lines because he's a Korean dancer.

1698
01:11:27,271 --> 01:11:28,401
(Focused)

1699
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:31,542
Beautiful.

1700
01:11:32,441 --> 01:11:33,512
It must be hard because of the sand.

1701
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:37,082
- It must be very difficult. - Because of the sand.

1702
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:38,651
Gosh.

1703
01:11:41,781 --> 01:11:44,451
- Hey. - All right.

1704
01:11:45,392 --> 01:11:46,462
(That looked amazing.)

1705
01:11:46,991 --> 01:11:48,221
He's angry.

1706
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:50,632
I like the look on Jun Woo's face.

1707
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:52,462
That's good.

1708
01:11:52,632 --> 01:11:54,731
I like their contact improvisation. It's fun.

1709
01:11:54,832 --> 01:11:56,301

01:11:56,302 --> 01:11:58,172
(Screaming)

1711
01:11:58,972 --> 01:12:00,172
They did it.

1712
01:12:00,701 --> 01:12:02,172
What kind of backward spin is that?

1713
01:12:02,441 --> 01:12:03,541
That's crazy.

(Kim Hyun Ho and Kim Hyo Joon's choreography section)

1715
01:12:04,941 --> 01:12:06,311
I like the choreography in the back.

1716
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:08,240
Their teamwork is...

1717
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,781
They work so well together.

1718
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:12,610
- Apartment. - Apartment, apartment

1719
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:14,082
They did such a great job.

1720
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,351
It's very creative.

1722

Look at Jun Woo.

1728
01:12:28,002 --> 01:12:29,701
I like his choreography section.

1729
01:12:30,132 --> 01:12:31,301
He has beautiful lines.

1730
01:12:31,302 --> 01:12:32,832
(In sync with Jun Woo)

1731
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:34,940
The look on his face...

1732
01:12:34,941 --> 01:12:36,142
How did he pull it off as a young person?

1733
01:12:36,441 --> 01:12:37,471
That's nice.

1734
01:12:37,472 --> 01:12:38,472
He did a good job.

1735
01:12:38,473 --> 01:12:41,111
I don't know who taught him, but he's a good dancer.

1736
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:43,011
His lines are so pretty.

1737
01:12:43,012 --> 01:12:44,450

1740
01:12:50,552 --> 01:12:52,721
The ensemble worked very hard.

1741
01:12:52,722 --> 01:12:54,421
The ensemble is impressive.

1742
01:12:54,422 --> 01:12:55,491
I love this part.

1743
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:01,030
- Hyun Ho. - Look at Hyun Ho's acting.

1744
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:02,031
(Laughing)

1745
01:13:02,032 --> 01:13:03,172
Hyun Ho.

1746
01:13:07,241 --> 01:13:08,441
That looks amazing.

01:13:14,512 --> 01:13:15,610
(Exclaiming)

1748
01:13:15,611 --> 01:13:17,611
His movement is so clear.

1749
01:13:18,651 --> 01:13:19,681
He's good.

1750
01:13:19,682 --> 01:13:21,852
This team dances much better.

1751
01:13:24,052 --> 01:13:25,292
(Concentrating)

1752
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:32,962
- It's Yo Han again. - Is it Yo Han again?

1753
01:13:33,632 --> 01:13:34,801
What's going on?

1754

Tiger Hyun Ho.

1755
01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:37,570
What?

1756
01:13:37,571 --> 01:13:38,901
Are they getting close?

1757
01:13:39,432 --> 01:13:41,200
It's dangerous.

1758
01:13:41,201 --> 01:13:42,501
(Screaming)

1759
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:43,910
(Staring)

1760
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:45,341
He's tilting his head.

1761
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:48,041
Why is he laughing?

1762
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:50,251
- Gosh. - Did Jun Woo's heart just flutter?

1763
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:52,651
Yo Han, whom do you pick? Jun Woo or Gyeong Ho?

1764
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,222
Didn't I look better?

1765
01:13:54,552 --> 01:13:55,721
(Holding his hand tightly)

1766
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:57,620
- "Didn't I look better?" - That's cute.

1767
01:13:57,621 --> 01:13:58,951
(Smiling Shokupanman)

1768
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:01,391
I liked Team B more.

1769
01:14:01,392 --> 01:14:02,860
Team B was fun to watch.

1770
01:14:02,861 --> 01:14:04,932
They have very different colors.

1771
01:14:05,262 --> 01:14:06,360
I mean, the main lead roles.

1772
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:09,102
Don't you think these main supporting dancers were better?

1773
01:14:09,231 --> 01:14:10,871
- Team A did a good job, too. - It's very difficult.

1774
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:13,541
Even the supporting dancers on Team B were excellent.

1775
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:15,370
Hyo Joon's dancing was neat.

1776
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:17,270
Hyun Ho was much more technical.

1777
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:20,410
However, the story told by Si Won and Dong Hoon...

1778
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:21,810
on Team A was much more clear.

1779
01:14:21,811 --> 01:14:23,411
See? It's interesting.

1780
01:14:24,151 --> 01:14:27,722
I feel the storyline much more with Hyun Ho and Hyo Joon.

1781
01:14:29,082 --> 01:14:31,690
And Jun Woo was so surprising.

1782
01:14:31,691 --> 01:14:33,261
To see him commanding the space.

1783
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:35,520
He was so clear and so specific.

1784
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:37,431
And the maturity of his movement...

1785
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:38,892
That's Jun Woo's strength.

1786
01:14:39,361 --> 01:14:42,302
Now, I'll announce the result of Seat Class Evaluation...

1787
01:14:42,832 --> 01:14:43,972
for "Squid Game."

1788
01:14:44,432 --> 01:14:47,641
("Squid Game" Seat Class Evaluation)

1789
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:49,241
Goodness.

1790
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:50,311
I can't wait to find out.

1791
01:14:50,972 --> 01:14:54,842
Based on the Seat Class ticketing votes,

1792
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:58,712
VIP and R seats for both teams have been sold out.

1793
01:14:58,951 --> 01:15:00,521
- Even R seats? - Even R seats?

1794
01:15:00,781 --> 01:15:02,921
(3,000 VIP seats, 4,000 R seats for both teams)

1795
01:15:02,922 --> 01:15:06,792
VIP seats for Team A lead by Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho...

1796
01:15:06,991 --> 01:15:10,061
were sold out within 54 minutes after the performance got aired.

1797
01:15:10,491 --> 01:15:12,990
(Everyone is surprised.)

1798
01:15:12,991 --> 01:15:14,462
- Kang Gyeong Ho. - He's a big star.

1799
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:16,031
That's crazy.

1800
01:15:16,531 --> 01:15:19,271
Won't Team A win based on the audience votes?

1801
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:21,542
- Gyeong Ho... - It'll be an overwhelming victory.

1802
01:15:21,602 --> 01:15:23,471
The remaining two seat classes...

1803
01:15:23,472 --> 01:15:25,411
will determine two team's fate.

1804
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,910
Which team sold more seats,

1805
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:30,111
and which team will win 1,000 points?

1806
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:32,882
Here's the result of votes for S seats.

1807
01:15:33,352 --> 01:15:34,781
This will determine who wins.

1808
01:15:35,082 --> 01:15:36,381
I bet they'll be sold out.

1809
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:37,722
(What's the S seat voting result for Team "Squid Game" A?)

1810
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:40,521
(Team A, 5,000 S seats)

1811
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:42,991
(As expected, they're sold out.)

1812
01:15:43,132 --> 01:15:44,632
That's incredible.

1813
01:15:44,892 --> 01:15:46,161
Gyeong Ho.

1814
01:15:46,762 --> 01:15:48,102
Dong Hoon.

1815
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:50,371
- That's amazing. - Good job, Gyeong Ho.

1816
01:15:50,472 --> 01:15:52,131
Team A's Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho,

1817
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:54,641
Main Supporting Dancer Kim Si Won and Go Dong Hoon...

1818
01:15:54,642 --> 01:15:57,211
sold all seats including S seats.

1819
01:15:57,212 --> 01:15:59,342
All their seats were sold out a day before the voting ended.

1820
01:15:59,411 --> 01:16:00,881
(Exclaiming)

1821
01:16:00,882 --> 01:16:02,241
Their ticketing power is unbelievable.

1822
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:05,851
Now, I'll announce the S seat voting result for Team B.

1823
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:06,981
Are they sold out too?

1824
01:16:07,182 --> 01:16:08,621
I bet they're sold out too.

1825
01:16:08,781 --> 01:16:10,051
Will the winner be determined now?

1826
01:16:10,052 --> 01:16:11,651
Please.

1827
01:16:12,352 --> 01:16:14,621
(Team B, 894 S seats)

1828
01:16:14,892 --> 01:16:17,332
(Shocked)

1829
01:16:18,691 --> 01:16:20,231
The difference is huge.

1830
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:22,832
How can the difference be so big?

1831
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,771
Our difference wasn't so big after all.

1832
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:29,972
There must be a lot of pressure on the main lead.

1833
01:16:30,241 --> 01:16:33,240
I thought that we were doing well against Kang Gyeong Ho.

1834
01:16:33,241 --> 01:16:35,941
We got behind pathetically in terms of S seats.

1835
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:38,610
Lastly, there's no limit to the number of A seats.

1836
01:16:38,611 --> 01:16:41,051
I'll announce the voting result...

1837
01:16:41,052 --> 01:16:42,620
at the same time.

1838
01:16:42,621 --> 01:16:43,792
I'm curious about this.

1839
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:47,320
(Team A: 1,562 A seats Team B: 345 A seats)

1840
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:49,320
(Mixed emotions of joy and sorrow)

1841
01:16:49,321 --> 01:16:52,161
Team A's number of A seats is 1,562.

1842
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:56,401
Team B's number of A seats is 345.

1843
01:16:56,632 --> 01:16:59,370
Their tickets were sold out, which proved their strength.

1844
01:16:59,371 --> 01:17:02,870
Team A lead by Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho is the winner.

1845
01:17:02,871 --> 01:17:04,070
Congratulations.

1846
01:17:04,071 --> 01:17:05,341
He's a celebrity.

1847
01:17:05,342 --> 01:17:08,142
- It was overwhelming. - He's an idol dancer.

1848
01:17:08,342 --> 01:17:09,712
Their ticketing power was amazing.

1849
01:17:10,311 --> 01:17:11,951
I overcame one step.

1850
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:14,682
Let's continue to climb up.

1851
01:17:14,882 --> 01:17:17,690
Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho,

1852
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:21,091
Main Supporting Dancer Kim Si Won and Go Dong Hoon won 1,000 points.

1853
01:17:21,092 --> 01:17:22,921
Main Lead Park Jun Woo,

1854
01:17:22,922 --> 01:17:25,060
Main Supporting Dancer Kim Hyun Ho and Kim Hyo Joon won...

1855
01:17:25,061 --> 01:17:27,900
500 points each.

1856
01:17:27,901 --> 01:17:30,070
Group dancers who weren't evaluated...

1857
01:17:30,071 --> 01:17:32,571
are given 300 points.

1858
01:17:32,632 --> 01:17:36,610
Now, I'll announce the benefit points based on...

1859
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:39,310
the masters, coaches, choreographers,

1860
01:17:39,311 --> 01:17:41,441
and rehearsal directors' evaluation on main roles.

1861
01:17:41,842 --> 01:17:43,751
I wonder how the judges evaluated us.

1862
01:17:43,752 --> 01:17:45,310
As I showed them a lot,

1863
01:17:45,311 --> 01:17:49,381
I expected them to give me a higher score.

1864
01:17:49,382 --> 01:17:51,551
As I had expected,

1865
01:17:51,552 --> 01:17:53,921
my interpretation of the role worked.

1866
01:17:53,922 --> 01:17:56,091
If they highly consider it,

1867
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:58,261
I might be able to win 500 points.

1868
01:17:58,262 --> 01:18:01,730
Which dancer will receive benefit points...

1869
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:05,400
and have an advantage during the Second Class Movement Ceremony?

1870
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:07,801
The energy of supporting dancers is very important...

1871
01:18:07,802 --> 01:18:09,002
for the main lead to stand out.

1872
01:18:09,172 --> 01:18:11,341
Their ability as an individual dancer is amazing,

1873
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:15,310
but dancing as a duet is one of the roles...

1874
01:18:15,311 --> 01:18:17,351
- of a supporting dancer. - Right.

1875
01:18:17,352 --> 01:18:18,780
A supporting dancer isn't...

1876
01:18:18,781 --> 01:18:20,081
- the main lead. - Right.

1877
01:18:20,082 --> 01:18:22,421
As soon as the supporting dancer starts getting greedy...

1878
01:18:22,422 --> 01:18:24,650
over the main lead role,

1879
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:26,351
- the balance breaks. - Exactly.

1880
01:18:26,352 --> 01:18:28,221
Team B supported...

1881
01:18:28,222 --> 01:18:31,160
Jun Woo completely.

1882
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:32,860
- Right. - Therefore, Jun Woo...

1883
01:18:32,861 --> 01:18:35,061
definitely received that energy.

1884
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:37,870
- They clearly showed competition. - Yes.

1885
01:18:37,871 --> 01:18:40,641
Team A's Si Won and Dong Hoon...

1886
01:18:40,642 --> 01:18:42,071
told their story more clearly.

1887
01:18:42,102 --> 01:18:46,110
Both Si Won and Dong Hoon have strong personalities,

1888
01:18:46,111 --> 01:18:49,311
so they made a lot of changes to compromise.

1889
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:52,251
I saw Si Won and Dong Hoon's energy...

1890
01:18:52,252 --> 01:18:54,980
multiply during their performance.

1891
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:58,021
- Shall we make a decision? - We have to.

1892
01:18:58,521 --> 01:19:00,892
- This is difficult. - It's very difficult.

1893
01:19:00,922 --> 01:19:03,121
Which dancer will win benefit points...

1894
01:19:03,561 --> 01:19:05,491
by playing the main supporting role better?

1895
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:07,601
(Which main supporting dancer will win benefit points?)

1896
01:19:07,602 --> 01:19:09,501
They're Kim Hyun Ho and Kim Hyo Joon.

1897
01:19:09,502 --> 01:19:10,530
(Team B Kim Hyo Joon and Kim Hyun Ho)

1898
01:19:10,531 --> 01:19:11,631
They did a good job.

1899
01:19:11,632 --> 01:19:13,371
(My team is the best.)

1900
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:16,001
Main Supporting Role Kim Hyun Ho and Kim Hyo Joon...

1901
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:18,771
will be given 500 benefit points. Congratulations.

1902
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:22,182
(Kim Hyun Ho, Kim Hyo Joon: 500 points)

1903
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:23,651
Although Jun Woo is younger than them,

1904
01:19:23,911 --> 01:19:26,280
these two dancers never forgot...

1905
01:19:26,281 --> 01:19:29,051
that Jun Woo was the main lead.

1906
01:19:29,052 --> 01:19:30,891
In their choreography,

1907
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:33,660
they never ignored the main lead.

1908
01:19:33,661 --> 01:19:36,261
- Right. - It's so clear in their dance.

1909
01:19:36,262 --> 01:19:37,792
Team B's main supporting roles were...

1910
01:19:38,292 --> 01:19:40,701
- very outstanding. - They were more...

1911
01:19:40,762 --> 01:19:41,932
Dong Hoon.

1912
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:43,931
Let's be closer friends.

1913
01:19:43,932 --> 01:19:46,001
(Good work.)

1914
01:19:46,002 --> 01:19:47,641
I'll reveal the result...

1915
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:49,802
of the evaluation on the main lead.

1916
01:19:50,111 --> 01:19:52,471
The public's choice online was...

1917
01:19:52,472 --> 01:19:54,610
Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho's team.

1918
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:56,650
Will he also be chosen...

1919
01:19:56,651 --> 01:20:00,251
by masters, coaches, and choreographers?

1920
01:20:00,252 --> 01:20:02,321
I will reveal the result now.

1921
01:20:03,121 --> 01:20:05,121
From the start, Jun Woo is overpowering.

1922
01:20:08,821 --> 01:20:11,030
Despite all the dancers in the ensemble,

1923
01:20:11,031 --> 01:20:12,531
I could only see Jun Woo.

1924
01:20:13,031 --> 01:20:17,501
However, during solo parts later in the choreography,

1925
01:20:17,502 --> 01:20:19,801
the story was focused more on Gyeong Ho.

1926
01:20:19,802 --> 01:20:22,870
As he's more intuitive and sensual,

1927
01:20:22,871 --> 01:20:24,310
he was more absorbing.

1928
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:27,881
When they were given the main lead choreography section,

1929
01:20:27,882 --> 01:20:31,450
Park Jun Woo tried to express psychological aspects.

1930
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:32,681
Kang Gyeong Ho thought...

1931
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:35,181
more about how to express himself as the main lead.

1932
01:20:35,182 --> 01:20:37,292
That was their focus.

1933
01:20:37,352 --> 01:20:39,592
- Their style is very different. - Right?

1934
01:20:39,951 --> 01:20:41,892
It's hard to decide.

1935
01:20:42,161 --> 01:20:43,730
Between "Squid Game" main lead roles...

1936
01:20:43,731 --> 01:20:46,461
Kang Gyeong Ho and Park Jun Woo,

1937
01:20:46,462 --> 01:20:48,701
who will receive benefit points?

1938
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:50,131
I can't tell.

1939
01:20:50,132 --> 01:20:51,632
Will it be Gyeong Ho?

1940
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:52,972
How about Jun Woo?

1941
01:20:53,102 --> 01:20:56,141
I'd love to get benefit points.

1942
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:58,172
I definitely want to win benefit points.

1943
01:20:58,441 --> 01:21:00,941
(Which main lead dancer will win benefit points?)

1944
01:21:01,012 --> 01:21:02,142
It's Main Lead...

1945
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:04,252
Kang Gyeong Ho.

1946
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:07,552
(Disappointed)

1947
01:21:07,722 --> 01:21:09,480
(Team "Squid Game" A Kang Gyeong Ho wins benefit points.)

1948
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:11,092
(Good job.)

1949
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:13,251
As the leader of the choreography,

1950
01:21:13,252 --> 01:21:17,191
he expressed the overall energy very well.

1951
01:21:17,361 --> 01:21:19,932
Yes, Gyeong Ho was very special.

1952
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:21,631
Main Lead Kang Gyeong Ho...

1953
01:21:21,632 --> 01:21:24,400
will receive 500 benefit points. Congratulations.

1954
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:26,431
I was happy and satisfied.

1955
01:21:26,432 --> 01:21:27,601
Let's go up.

1956
01:21:27,602 --> 01:21:29,641
I didn't get benefit points,

1957
01:21:29,642 --> 01:21:31,042
so I was worried.

1958
01:21:31,342 --> 01:21:33,440
I will announce the current ranking...

1959
01:21:33,441 --> 01:21:35,541
of "Squid Game" dancers.

1960
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:36,581
(Calculating)

1961
01:21:36,582 --> 01:21:38,381
("Squid Game" Current Ranking)

1962
01:21:38,382 --> 01:21:41,650
With 1,000 team points and 500 benefit points,

1963
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:44,451
Kang Gyeong Ho is ranked number one.

1964
01:21:45,252 --> 01:21:47,861
(Envious)

1965
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,792
Gyeong Ho will dominate at this rate, right?

1966
01:21:51,731 --> 01:21:53,531
Jun Woo is the main lead.

1967
01:21:54,802 --> 01:21:56,601
Jun Woo is in sixth place.

1968
01:21:56,602 --> 01:21:58,171
(Park Jun Woo, the main lead, is currently in 6th place...)

1969
01:21:58,172 --> 01:21:59,570
(in "Squid Game.")

1970
01:21:59,571 --> 01:22:02,642
I'm upset. I was very disappointed.

1971
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:04,911
He just has the basic 500 points.

1972
01:22:05,111 --> 01:22:07,611
Jun Woo is suddenly in the lower ranks.

1973
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,281
That must hurt his pride so much.

1974
01:22:09,981 --> 01:22:12,011
(What will be the result of the "Squid Game" team's class changes?)

1975
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:15,951
The last performance of the K-Contents Mission.

1976
01:22:16,352 --> 01:22:19,552
We will begin the class evaluations for "Parasite."

1977
01:22:19,621 --> 01:22:21,521
("Parasite" class evaluations)

1978
01:22:21,821 --> 01:22:23,591
- Ho Jong Ping. - Let's go.

1979
01:22:23,592 --> 01:22:25,031
(And this is Kyu Nyeon Ping, the other main lead.)

1980
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:26,690
This is the highlight of Stage Fighter.

1981
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:27,802
I'm the most curious about this team.

1982
01:22:27,932 --> 01:22:31,332
"Parasite," by choreographer An Nam Keun, with a motif...

1983
01:22:31,432 --> 01:22:33,901
based on the soundtrack and concept of the film, "Parasite."

1984
01:22:34,002 --> 01:22:35,940
This performance is about the class war...

1985
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:37,441
between a duke and his butler.

1986
01:22:37,512 --> 01:22:40,642
In the main lead role of Team A is First Class Choi Ho Jong.

1987
01:22:40,682 --> 01:22:43,310
In the main supporting roles are Second Class Kim Young Woong...

1988
01:22:43,311 --> 01:22:44,450
and Under Class Ha Won Jun.

1989
01:22:44,451 --> 01:22:47,352
In the main lead role of the B Team is Second Class Kim Kyu Nyeon.

1990
01:22:47,481 --> 01:22:49,581
In the main supporting roles are First Class Ryu Tae Young...

1991
01:22:49,582 --> 01:22:52,621
and Under Class Bang Seong Hyun.

1992
01:22:53,021 --> 01:22:54,021
("Parasite" Judging Zone)

1993
01:22:54,022 --> 01:22:55,691
Is it a competition between these two?

1994
01:22:55,962 --> 01:22:57,261
- Yes. - Nam Keun.

1995
01:22:57,262 --> 01:22:59,860
How was it? I'm so curious.

1996
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:02,060
I hear it was pretty much bloody.

1997
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:03,132
Really?

1998
01:23:03,832 --> 01:23:05,631
And they are teacher and student.

1999
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:07,371
- I heard that too. - Yes.

2000
01:23:07,642 --> 01:23:10,712
Will the student outperform his teacher?

2001
01:23:11,672 --> 01:23:12,811
I'm so curious.

2002
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,542
(Matthew is curious too.)

2003
01:23:15,342 --> 01:23:19,052
Let's have Team A's rehearsal with the music.

2004
01:23:19,981 --> 01:23:21,450
(The rehearsals for "Parasite" begin with Team A.)

2005
01:23:21,451 --> 01:23:23,051
(What will Team A's performance be like?)

2006
01:23:23,052 --> 01:23:25,520
There will be eliminations for the first time in this mission.

2007
01:23:25,521 --> 01:23:26,592
I thought I should do well.

2008
01:23:26,821 --> 01:23:27,991
(He's nervous too.)

2009
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:30,092
(Sighing)

2010
01:23:30,093 --> 01:23:31,161
I'm nervous.

2011
01:23:31,861 --> 01:23:35,632
Since I was competing against my teacher, Ho Jong, I was so nervous.

2012
01:23:36,462 --> 01:23:38,302
(Team "Parasite" A's rehearsal begins.)

2013
01:23:38,901 --> 01:23:42,401
(Neat)

2014
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:43,972
(Impressed)

2015
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:45,642
(Sighing)

2016
01:23:45,941 --> 01:23:48,741
Ho Jong has just swallowed a deity whole.

2017
01:23:49,842 --> 01:23:50,981
He's so good.

2018
01:23:51,352 --> 01:23:52,852
(Minding the reaction of the ensemble)

2019
01:23:53,352 --> 01:23:55,752
The ensemble was watching Ho Jong and were so impressed.

2020
01:23:56,182 --> 01:23:57,450
(My gosh)

2021
01:23:57,451 --> 01:23:58,951
I was really intimidated, to be honest.

2022
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:02,392
And the pressure started to build.

2023
01:24:02,491 --> 01:24:03,521
(Staring)

2024
01:24:05,432 --> 01:24:06,491
I wasn't able to dance well.

2025
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:08,160
(Team B's main lead Kyu Nyeon kept making mistakes in rehearsal.)

2026
01:24:08,161 --> 01:24:09,660
(Feeling sad for him)

2027
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:11,601
He looked like he was in a rush just to do the moves.

2028
01:24:11,602 --> 01:24:12,971
That was the feeling that I got.

2029
01:24:12,972 --> 01:24:13,972
Oh, dear.

2030
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:15,701
Kyu Nyeon forgot to do a move.

2031
01:24:15,901 --> 01:24:18,811
I could see him making several mistakes in a row.

2032
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,811
It seemed overwhelming for him overall.

2033
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:23,882
It was so hard that I thought, "What do I do?"

2034
01:24:24,682 --> 01:24:25,711
(Mixed feelings)

2035
01:24:25,712 --> 01:24:26,881
(Kyu Nyeon is very worried after his rehearsal.)

2036
01:24:26,882 --> 01:24:30,252
Kyu Nyeon found it hard to compete against Ho Jong.

2037
01:24:33,191 --> 01:24:35,262
I thought that I should give him some strength.

2038
01:24:36,762 --> 01:24:37,832
Nice.

2039
01:24:37,892 --> 01:24:39,791
I'm not lying. You can spend three more seconds on the full jump.

2040
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:41,131
- Okay. - Seriously.

2041
01:24:41,132 --> 01:24:43,462
- I'll get us back on beat later. - Thank you.

2042
01:24:43,972 --> 01:24:47,701
(Team B members rely on each other and encourage each other.)

2043
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:49,341
But we helped each other out...

2044
01:24:49,342 --> 01:24:51,671
and tried to do our very best.

2045
01:24:51,672 --> 01:24:53,141
The ensemble members are tired,

2046
01:24:53,142 --> 01:24:54,682
so we should be more energetic.

2047
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:56,041
Let's do this well.

2048
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:58,411
What are they? They're all just a piece of cake.

2049
01:24:58,811 --> 01:25:00,111
We're the best.

2050
01:25:00,382 --> 01:25:02,722
So, I trusted my team and gritted my teeth to do my best.

2051
01:25:03,651 --> 01:25:06,751
(Team A's rehearsal continues.)

2052
01:25:06,752 --> 01:25:08,762
Won Jun has to come in more.

2053
01:25:09,262 --> 01:25:10,762
Won Jun is off center.

2054
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:12,261
Won Jun, go out more.

2055
01:25:12,262 --> 01:25:13,360
(Wary of the attention)

2056
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:14,462
Move farther out.

2057
01:25:14,701 --> 01:25:15,701
(Go that way.)

2058
01:25:15,702 --> 01:25:16,901
(Wary of the attention again)

2059
01:25:18,172 --> 01:25:19,802
Why do you keep standing asymmetrically?

2060
01:25:20,002 --> 01:25:21,472
Why can't he get that right?

2061
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:24,711
(Team A monitors their rehearsal video.)

2062
01:25:24,712 --> 01:25:27,212
As long as I get my act together and stay on center...

2063
01:25:29,741 --> 01:25:31,852
Won Jun, do you get where we mean by the center?

2064
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:33,981
I'll really get my head in the game.

2065
01:25:35,752 --> 01:25:38,651
We have a limited amount of time, and there's a lot to do.

2066
01:25:39,121 --> 01:25:40,361
We need to get our acts together.

2067
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:43,792
So, I wanted to be sure to point out Won Jun's issues.

2068
01:25:44,262 --> 01:25:45,631
- Do you want to practice together? - Yes, that'd be great.

2069
01:25:45,632 --> 01:25:46,660
From here.

2070
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:48,200
(Won Jun and Young Woong practice together after rehearsal.)

2071
01:25:48,201 --> 01:25:49,931
- You can't be that slow. - Okay.

2072
01:25:49,932 --> 01:25:51,071
- You have to get up right away. - Right.

2073
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:52,501
(Sliding up)

2074
01:25:52,502 --> 01:25:54,101
You can't slide up like that.

2075
01:25:54,102 --> 01:25:55,941
- Oh, right. - You were always late like that.

2076
01:25:56,302 --> 01:25:59,071
After things are organized, can we practice the lift again?

2077
01:25:59,271 --> 01:26:00,271
(Laughing in exasperation)

2078
01:26:00,272 --> 01:26:01,281
I'm really sorry.

2079
01:26:02,382 --> 01:26:04,411
You should've practiced this a lot on a daily basis.

2080
01:26:05,082 --> 01:26:07,382
Honestly, I really wanted to go home.

2081
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:10,721
I was in a strange environment, and he was criticizing me,

2082
01:26:10,722 --> 01:26:13,422
but everything was so loud. I couldn't get my head in the game.

2083
01:26:13,592 --> 01:26:16,020
Since this was my first time as a supporting dancer,

2084
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:17,392
I felt so much pressure.

2085
01:26:17,892 --> 01:26:19,561
You can tell that Won Jun is unstable now.

2086
01:26:20,231 --> 01:26:22,730
Won Jun's eyes kept looking...

2087
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:24,870
toward Young Woong.

2088
01:26:24,871 --> 01:26:26,432
Was he worried about Young Woong's reaction?

2089
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:28,700
(He keeps reading Young Woong's face.)

2090
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:31,411
I felt that they didn't have very good teamwork.

2091
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:34,441
I thought that was why we had a fighting chance.

2092
01:26:35,411 --> 01:26:37,410
When we do this jump, you have to be over here.

2093
01:26:37,411 --> 01:26:39,110
- That's the middle, right? - No, not the middle.

2094
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:40,520
That's first, this is second.

2095
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:41,881
(Totally out of it)

2096
01:26:41,882 --> 01:26:44,490
Won Jun seemed to be having a hard time.

2097
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:46,252
So I was pretty worried.

2098
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:49,291
Check my position.

2099
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:51,060
(Our team's main supporting dancer, you can do it.)

2100
01:26:51,061 --> 01:26:53,092
I wanted to help him through that as much as I could.

2101
01:26:53,262 --> 01:26:55,502
Let's not cause my team any harm.

2102
01:26:55,901 --> 01:26:57,672
(Won Jun practices his moves repeatedly.)

2103
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:00,102
Let's really get my act together.

2104
01:27:00,441 --> 01:27:03,240
(What will the two teams' "Parasite" performance look like?)

2105
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:06,171
From now on, we will see the performance by Team "Parasite" A,

2106
01:27:06,172 --> 01:27:08,842
with main lead dancer Choi Ho Jong...

2107
01:27:08,941 --> 01:27:11,911
and main supporting dancers Kim Young Woong and Ha Won Jun.

2108
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:14,881
(Half expectant, half nervous)

2109
01:27:14,882 --> 01:27:16,082
Show them, Ho Jong!

2110
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:18,021
I bet this is a lot of fun.

2111
01:27:18,491 --> 01:27:19,792
I think it's over already.

2112
01:27:20,052 --> 01:27:21,091
I'm looking forward to this.

2113
01:27:21,092 --> 01:27:22,222
(Looking forward to it a lot)

2114
01:27:23,592 --> 01:27:24,592
Oh, beautiful.

2115
01:27:24,593 --> 01:27:25,860
(They look cool already.)

2116
01:27:25,861 --> 01:27:27,401
(Smiling)

2117
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:30,501
What's this? What's with his gaze? Why is Young Woong so innocent?

2118
01:27:30,502 --> 01:27:31,502
(An innocent gaze)

2119
01:27:31,503 --> 01:27:33,431
- So cute. - He's so adorable.

2120
01:27:33,432 --> 01:27:34,642
The boy butler.

2121
01:27:37,271 --> 01:27:40,071
- Oh, Ho Jong. - Charismatic.

2122
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:43,852
(Team "Parasite" A's performance begins.)

2123
01:27:45,352 --> 01:27:46,411
Charismatic.

2124
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:49,781
(Focused)

2125
01:27:51,752 --> 01:27:54,592
How can a person look so fine?

2126
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:56,161
(Impressed)

2127
01:27:57,632 --> 01:27:58,632
Nice.

2128
01:27:59,092 --> 01:28:00,730
How can he move like that?

2129
01:28:00,731 --> 01:28:02,361
He just moves differently.

2130
01:28:03,602 --> 01:28:04,901
(He can't look away.)

2131
01:28:11,441 --> 01:28:12,570
(Shocked)

2132
01:28:12,571 --> 01:28:13,672
This is crazy.

2133
01:28:14,611 --> 01:28:15,712
What's with that smile?

2134
01:28:16,311 --> 01:28:17,712
He has amazing facial expressions.

2135
01:28:17,951 --> 01:28:19,512
What do I do? I got goosebumps.

2136
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:20,621
(Main lead Choi Ho Jong's choreography creative segment)

2137
01:28:22,451 --> 01:28:24,190
(His facial expressions give you chills.)

2138
01:28:24,191 --> 01:28:25,221
Look at how relaxed he is.

2139
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:27,221
(Main lead Choi Ho Jong's choreography creative segment)

2140
01:28:27,222 --> 01:28:28,292
Won Jun.

2141
01:28:31,392 --> 01:28:33,861
- Look at Young Woong. - Was he doing that back there?

2142
01:28:36,701 --> 01:28:38,570
I'm holding my breath as I watch this.

2143
01:28:38,571 --> 01:28:41,701
(Main lead Choi Ho Jong's choreography creative segment)

2144
01:28:43,502 --> 01:28:44,541
It's so neat.

2145
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:45,542
(I'm becoming immersed.)

2146
01:28:49,411 --> 01:28:50,411
(Picking him up and putting him down)

2147
01:28:50,651 --> 01:28:51,651
Nice.

2148
01:28:52,651 --> 01:28:54,621
- It's so smooth. - That's sexy.

2149
01:29:01,321 --> 01:29:02,392
It's amazing, no matter how much I watch them.

2150
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:04,332
It's so cool.

2151
01:29:05,392 --> 01:29:06,432
This is crazy.

2152
01:29:11,571 --> 01:29:12,932
We need to pay to watch this.

2153
01:29:19,542 --> 01:29:21,642
(His acting raises the quality of the piece.)

2154
01:29:22,481 --> 01:29:23,712
This is seriously...

2155
01:29:24,512 --> 01:29:25,552
crazy.

2156
01:29:27,182 --> 01:29:29,651
(What is that?)

2157
01:29:32,321 --> 01:29:34,392
- It's amazing, every time I see it. - It makes no sense.

2158
01:29:37,161 --> 01:29:38,661
He just has a different aura.

2159
01:29:41,231 --> 01:29:42,401
The original sure is different.

2160
01:29:43,901 --> 01:29:45,071
(Thrilling)

2161
01:29:45,401 --> 01:29:46,432
It's so neat.

2162
01:29:46,972 --> 01:29:48,102
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2163
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:51,141
He even looks cool when he's just walking.

2164
01:29:51,142 --> 01:29:53,142
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2165
01:29:54,481 --> 01:29:58,780
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2166
01:29:58,781 --> 01:30:00,052
I like Young Woong's energy.

2167
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:05,722
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2168
01:30:06,191 --> 01:30:07,422
His eyes just went mad.

2169
01:30:09,962 --> 01:30:11,031
I like the ensemble.

2170
01:30:11,762 --> 01:30:13,161
(Simply impressed)

2171
01:30:16,701 --> 01:30:18,731
- The ensemble is so good. - They make good use of the floor.

2172
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:21,441
He just looks cool by standing there.

2173
01:30:21,701 --> 01:30:23,271
There's something about him that dominates the mood.

2174
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:32,611
Yes.

2175
01:30:35,481 --> 01:30:36,481
Nice.

2176
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,991
Oh, it's scary.

2177
01:30:43,661 --> 01:30:45,262
The final, lethal move.

2178
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:46,731
This part is cool.

2179
01:30:51,432 --> 01:30:52,602
This part is cool.

2180
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,071
It's like they're really being chased.

2181
01:30:55,302 --> 01:30:56,571
Gosh, they're so in sync.

2182
01:31:02,281 --> 01:31:03,342
My gosh.

2183
01:31:04,781 --> 01:31:05,811
I love their energy.

2184
01:31:08,321 --> 01:31:10,690
- He's a total technician. - This is great.

2185
01:31:10,691 --> 01:31:11,722
Beautiful.

2186
01:31:28,142 --> 01:31:30,602
(Team "Parasite" A's performance ends.)

2187
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:32,511
- Goodness. - Bravo!

2188
01:31:32,512 --> 01:31:33,512
(They ripped up the stage.)

2189
01:31:34,642 --> 01:31:35,941
(The performance leaves lingering feelings that won't go away easily.)

2190
01:31:37,682 --> 01:31:40,111
- That was a work of art. - Beautiful staging.

2191
01:31:40,481 --> 01:31:41,621
(Automatically clapping)

2192
01:31:42,052 --> 01:31:44,451
- Gosh, Nam Keun. That was so cool. - Nam Keun.

2193
01:31:44,552 --> 01:31:45,620
(The choreographer feels shy.)

2194
01:31:45,621 --> 01:31:46,621
That was so cool.

2195
01:31:46,722 --> 01:31:49,821
Ho Jong has a charisma that dominates everything.

2196
01:31:50,092 --> 01:31:51,730
- He has exceptional focus. - Yes.

2197
01:31:51,731 --> 01:31:53,832
But Ho Jong is...

2198
01:31:53,932 --> 01:31:55,901
a dancer we all admit is good.

2199
01:31:56,262 --> 01:31:58,432
So, I think we have to have high expectations for him.

2200
01:31:59,002 --> 01:32:01,241
I did think that he played it safe.

2201
01:32:02,042 --> 01:32:03,341
Perfect word. Safe.

2202
01:32:03,342 --> 01:32:04,441
(Admitting she's right.)

2203
01:32:05,142 --> 01:32:06,871
But it's somewhat disappointing.

2204
01:32:08,082 --> 01:32:10,882
I think Kyu Nyeon could have something a bit fresher.

2205
01:32:11,311 --> 01:32:13,650
Next, we will see the performance by Team "Parasite" B,

2206
01:32:13,651 --> 01:32:15,020
with main lead dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon...

2207
01:32:15,021 --> 01:32:17,821
and main supporting dancers Ryu Tae Young and Bang Seong Hyun.

2208
01:32:18,092 --> 01:32:20,691
- I was curious about this. - I think they did well too.

2209
01:32:21,561 --> 01:32:22,561
What will it be like?

2210
01:32:23,061 --> 01:32:24,091
The student.

2211
01:32:24,092 --> 01:32:27,161
You know what I was thinking, though. If Kyu Nyeon is his student,

2212
01:32:27,602 --> 01:32:29,601
that means he's done his choreography a lot...

2213
01:32:29,602 --> 01:32:33,070
and knows how to make it look good and knows the transitions.

2214
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:34,472
So, it could be exciting.

2215
01:32:35,071 --> 01:32:37,302
(Team "Parasite" B)

2216
01:32:37,512 --> 01:32:39,911
(Team "Parasite" B's performance begins.)

2217
01:32:40,012 --> 01:32:41,241
(Standing straight)

2218
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:42,582
Oh, they have a good vibe.

2219
01:32:43,082 --> 01:32:44,751
- Gosh. - My goodness.

2220
01:32:44,752 --> 01:32:46,781
(The blond duke, Kim Kyu Nyeon appears.)

2221
01:32:47,212 --> 01:32:48,280
Oh, the blond.

2222
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:49,281
(That looks good visually.)

2223
01:32:49,521 --> 01:32:50,582
(He feels embarrassed about it, though.)

2224
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:53,292
- Why is he so cute? - Isn't he a hamster?

2225
01:33:00,832 --> 01:33:01,832
Oh, he's good.

2226
01:33:04,701 --> 01:33:05,731
He's good.

2227
01:33:07,231 --> 01:33:08,972
- It's neat. - It's not bad.

2228
01:33:09,502 --> 01:33:11,642
- He has a different emotion. - Yes, totally different.

2229
01:33:13,871 --> 01:33:14,911
It's good.

2230
01:33:16,542 --> 01:33:17,611
Hey.

2231
01:33:18,451 --> 01:33:19,512
Hey.

2232
01:33:21,082 --> 01:33:22,082
Nice.

2233
01:33:23,552 --> 01:33:24,592
Hey.

2234
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:26,752
Gosh.

2235
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:29,892
Kyu Nyeon is good. We haven't seen this side of him before.

2236
01:33:29,991 --> 01:33:31,031
He's so good.

2237
01:33:32,991 --> 01:33:34,531
(Main lead Kim Kyu Nyeon's choreography creative segment)

2238
01:33:34,762 --> 01:33:35,801
Oh, my.

2239
01:33:35,802 --> 01:33:36,900
(Main lead Kim Kyu Nyeon's choreography creative segment)

2240
01:33:36,901 --> 01:33:37,932
Oh, this is nice.

2241
01:33:39,172 --> 01:33:41,240
- He looks pretty. - He does look like a noble.

2242
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:43,172
(Main lead Kim Kyu Nyeon's choreography creative segment)

2243
01:33:43,472 --> 01:33:44,512
Seong Hyun has good facial expressions.

2244
01:33:44,712 --> 01:33:45,712
(Main lead Kim Kyu Nyeon's choreography creative segment)

2245
01:33:45,713 --> 01:33:46,741
Hey.

2246
01:33:47,611 --> 01:33:48,841
He used way more movements.

2247
01:33:48,842 --> 01:33:50,951
(Main lead Kim Kyu Nyeon's choreography creative segment)

2248
01:33:54,582 --> 01:33:56,381
We can see the supporting dancers well here.

2249
01:33:56,382 --> 01:33:58,021
I love the supporting dancers images.

2250
01:34:01,722 --> 01:34:02,722
They did well.

2251
01:34:04,632 --> 01:34:05,661
Nice.

2252
01:34:05,792 --> 01:34:07,332
They're really good at controlling their speed.

2253
01:34:07,531 --> 01:34:08,602
Nice.

2254
01:34:10,462 --> 01:34:13,371
(Team B has good teamwork between the lead and supporting dancers.)

2255
01:34:13,832 --> 01:34:14,871
That was good.

2256
01:34:15,842 --> 01:34:16,871
He does have good strength.

2257
01:34:18,672 --> 01:34:19,712
Oh, he's enjoying it.

2258
01:34:24,382 --> 01:34:25,382
He looks cool.

2259
01:34:27,882 --> 01:34:29,052
(Detailed facial expressions)

2260
01:34:29,151 --> 01:34:30,182
Oh, gosh.

2261
01:34:31,092 --> 01:34:32,151
He's good.

2262
01:34:38,932 --> 01:34:40,061
Hey.

2263
01:34:42,102 --> 01:34:43,132
Hey.

2264
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:56,611
He's not as dominating, though.

2265
01:35:00,481 --> 01:35:03,181
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2266
01:35:03,182 --> 01:35:04,222
Hey.

2267
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:07,491
- Oh, nice. - Seong Hyun is good.

2268
01:35:08,392 --> 01:35:10,190
He has great facial expressions.

2269
01:35:10,191 --> 01:35:12,892
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2270
01:35:15,031 --> 01:35:19,771
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2271
01:35:19,871 --> 01:35:20,871
Oh, gosh.

2272
01:35:21,172 --> 01:35:23,941
- I like the supporting dancers. - They had good supporting dancers.

2273
01:35:24,311 --> 01:35:26,972
(Main supporting dancers' choreography creative segment)

2274
01:35:27,571 --> 01:35:29,712
- That was good. - Nice.

2275
01:35:30,611 --> 01:35:31,682
The ensemble looks cool.

2276
01:35:32,182 --> 01:35:34,352
This is beautiful choreography and staging.

2277
01:35:36,082 --> 01:35:37,151
Oh, that's good.

2278
01:35:39,222 --> 01:35:40,252
(The performance nears its climax.)

2279
01:35:44,731 --> 01:35:45,731
Let's go.

2280
01:35:47,932 --> 01:35:49,561
(Oh, no.)

2281
01:35:49,802 --> 01:35:52,332
That was a bit disappointing. They weren't in sync there.

2282
01:35:55,701 --> 01:35:56,701
Goodness.

2283
01:36:01,582 --> 01:36:02,642
Let's go.

2284
01:36:04,111 --> 01:36:05,111
Here they go.

2285
01:36:15,121 --> 01:36:16,222
They're very well in sync.

2286
01:36:18,392 --> 01:36:19,762
They have good teamwork with the ensemble.

2287
01:36:23,762 --> 01:36:24,802
Oh, that's cool.

2288
01:36:25,771 --> 01:36:26,832
Nice.

2289
01:36:33,972 --> 01:36:35,012
It's neat.

2290
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:49,061
(Team "Parasite" B's performance ends.)

2291
01:36:49,561 --> 01:36:51,231
(Good job, Kyu Nyeon.)

2292
01:36:51,361 --> 01:36:52,531
Nice.

2293
01:36:52,832 --> 01:36:54,031
(Finally taking a breath)

2294
01:36:55,531 --> 01:36:58,432
- Good job. - It was all right. Not bad.

2295
01:36:58,632 --> 01:37:00,632
They were very much in sync with the ensemble.

2296
01:37:01,042 --> 01:37:02,841
This team seemed to have...

2297
01:37:02,842 --> 01:37:05,440
a better harmony overall.

2298
01:37:05,441 --> 01:37:07,071
The dancers have a similar texture.

2299
01:37:07,371 --> 01:37:09,842
See, for me, I liked Team B's choreography.

2300
01:37:09,941 --> 01:37:12,752
There was something that felt fresh.

2301
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:15,252
In the trio segment,

2302
01:37:15,352 --> 01:37:17,682
the technical aspect was a little disappointing.

2303
01:37:19,252 --> 01:37:22,191
Then, I will reveal the other team's reviews first.

2304
01:37:22,292 --> 01:37:24,490
After watching Team A's performance by Choi Ho Jong,

2305
01:37:24,491 --> 01:37:26,292
- Kim Kyu Nyeon said... - What did he say?

2306
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:29,331
"It was disappointing as it could've been better if he had..."

2307
01:37:29,332 --> 01:37:31,771
"communicated with his supporting dancers more."

2308
01:37:32,102 --> 01:37:33,172
That was his review.

2309
01:37:35,002 --> 01:37:36,271
Why? What?

2310
01:37:36,542 --> 01:37:37,602
(Is he about to start a mutiny?)

2311
01:37:39,871 --> 01:37:41,911
- A teacher and student's... - A family feud.

2312
01:37:42,411 --> 01:37:43,411
Oh, what?

2313
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:48,150
(The mood gets fired up thanks to the spicy teacher and student.)

2314
01:37:48,151 --> 01:37:50,222
- Good job, Kyu Nyeon. - That was harsh.

2315
01:37:50,321 --> 01:37:52,691
After watching the performance by Kim Kyu Nyeon, Choi Ho Jong said,

2316
01:37:53,121 --> 01:37:54,691
"It was disappointing that he seemed overwhelmed."

2317
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:57,361
"He looks like he needs more preparation." That was his review.

2318
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:00,092
(Habitual mutiny)

2319
01:38:01,132 --> 01:38:02,802
(Kyu Nyeon, you're so cute.)

2320
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:05,471
Now, I will reveal the results of the Seat Class Evaluation...

2321
01:38:05,472 --> 01:38:06,832
for "Parasite."

2322
01:38:07,031 --> 01:38:08,972
The results of the Seat Ticketing Vote is...

2323
01:38:09,972 --> 01:38:13,141
that both teams' VIP tickets are sold out.

2324
01:38:13,142 --> 01:38:14,582
("Parasite" Seat Class Evaluation)

2325
01:38:14,781 --> 01:38:15,981
(Relieved)

2326
01:38:18,111 --> 01:38:20,711
Especially, Team A's VIP seats,

2327
01:38:20,712 --> 01:38:23,650
led by main lead dancer, Choi Ho Jong, sold out in 35 minutes...

2328
01:38:23,651 --> 01:38:25,490
(The seats sold out in 35 minutes after the show.)

2329
01:38:25,491 --> 01:38:27,352
after the show was over.

2330
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:29,660
He's on a whole other level.

2331
01:38:29,661 --> 01:38:30,991
(Thank you.)

2332
01:38:31,491 --> 01:38:33,761
- That's a huge record. - In the middle of the night?

2333
01:38:33,762 --> 01:38:34,832
That's insane.

2334
01:38:34,932 --> 01:38:38,432
What about the other seats? Let's find out.

2335
01:38:38,771 --> 01:38:40,770
Team A with main lead dancer Choi Ho Jong,

2336
01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:44,371
even for R and S seats with 4,000 and 5,000 limits...

2337
01:38:44,472 --> 01:38:46,472
R seats, sold out. S seats, sold out.

2338
01:38:46,972 --> 01:38:48,711
They sold out all of those seats as well.

2339
01:38:48,712 --> 01:38:50,882
(All seats sold out)

2340
01:38:51,012 --> 01:38:52,082
(Simply in awe)

2341
01:38:52,451 --> 01:38:53,512
That's awesome.

2342
01:38:53,951 --> 01:38:54,980
I'm not even surprised.

2343
01:38:54,981 --> 01:38:56,021
(Admitting it)

2344
01:38:56,121 --> 01:38:58,151
That means that people want to come and see us.

2345
01:38:59,151 --> 01:39:00,191
I felt so good.

2346
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:02,861
Next, Team B with main lead dancer...

2347
01:39:03,161 --> 01:39:05,061
Kim Kyu Nyeon...

2348
01:39:07,262 --> 01:39:08,360
(Team B)

2349
01:39:08,361 --> 01:39:11,401
(Team B didn't even sell out their tickets for R seats.)

2350
01:39:13,972 --> 01:39:15,241
Even this is a great feat.

2351
01:39:15,472 --> 01:39:17,271
The difference was this big?

2352
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:19,741
And lastly, with no seat limits,

2353
01:39:19,972 --> 01:39:22,842
the vote results for A seats will be revealed at once.

2354
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:25,181
I'm curious how many A seats Team A sold too.

2355
01:39:25,182 --> 01:39:27,081
- I think it'll be over 2,000. - Over 2,000?

2356
01:39:27,082 --> 01:39:28,821
Gyeong Ho's team was about 1,500.

2357
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:30,051
("Squid Game" Seat Class Evaluation)

2358
01:39:30,052 --> 01:39:31,291
(Kang Gyeong Ho's team sold the most A seat tickets so far.)

2359
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:32,592
They sold 1,562 seats.

2360
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:35,061
With no seat limits, A seats...

2361
01:39:35,361 --> 01:39:36,491
I think it'll be about 2,000 seats.

2362
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:38,591
I say 3,000.

2363
01:39:38,592 --> 01:39:39,660
(Team A: 2,821 seats, Team B: 516 seats)

2364
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:40,861
(Choi Ho Jong's team sold the most A seats.)

2365
01:39:42,031 --> 01:39:43,200
(Goodness)

2366
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:45,672
- No one can compete with that. - No way.

2367
01:39:46,071 --> 01:39:48,171
Like so, Team A, led by Choi Ho Jong,

2368
01:39:48,172 --> 01:39:50,102
will get 1,000 points each.

2369
01:39:50,172 --> 01:39:51,842
(Team A: 1,000, Team B: 500)

2370
01:39:52,672 --> 01:39:54,371
- They won by twice as many seats. - That's cruel.

2371
01:39:55,642 --> 01:39:56,711
Like the sky and the earth?

2372
01:39:56,712 --> 01:39:58,212
(Dejected)

2373
01:39:58,481 --> 01:39:59,552
Still, we fought well.

2374
01:40:00,712 --> 01:40:03,882
From now on, I will reveal the benefit points...

2375
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:06,352
through comparative evaluations in the main roles for "Parasite."

2376
01:40:07,052 --> 01:40:09,221
Which dancer will get benefit points...

2377
01:40:09,222 --> 01:40:12,332
and take the advantage in the second Class Movement Ceremony?

2378
01:40:13,031 --> 01:40:14,931
First, we'll check the main supporting roles'...

2379
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:17,102
competition results.

2380
01:40:17,901 --> 01:40:20,200
Evaluations from the master, coach, choreographer,

2381
01:40:20,201 --> 01:40:22,502
and rehearsal director will be revealed as well.

2382
01:40:23,042 --> 01:40:24,642
First, Master Kim Joo Won said...

2383
01:40:25,172 --> 01:40:28,241
When I watched Team A, the person who was supporting...

2384
01:40:28,342 --> 01:40:31,511
all of the techniques and holding the center was Young Woong.

2385
01:40:31,512 --> 01:40:33,081
- Yes. - Seeing that,

2386
01:40:33,082 --> 01:40:35,382
I could tell Young Woong played a very firm role.

2387
01:40:35,582 --> 01:40:38,020
With Team B, even when they formed the same shape,

2388
01:40:38,021 --> 01:40:41,091
- they had a good balance. - With Kyu Nyeon.

2389
01:40:41,092 --> 01:40:42,660
Won Jun seemed...

2390
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:45,531
to be following behind Young Woong.

2391
01:40:46,191 --> 01:40:47,690
(Staring)

2392
01:40:47,691 --> 01:40:50,231
To be honest, his balance...

2393
01:40:51,602 --> 01:40:53,672
Here is the result.

2394
01:40:54,071 --> 01:40:56,341
The dancer to receive the benefit...

2395
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:58,642
for pulling off the main supporting role is...

2396
01:40:58,811 --> 01:41:00,371
- What do you think? - Team A.

2397
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:02,681
I think it'll be different.

2398
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:03,741
- The score? - Yes.

2399
01:41:05,082 --> 01:41:06,712
I can't tell.

2400
01:41:06,882 --> 01:41:10,281
Since I'm in Under Class, I was desperate for it.

2401
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:11,551
The dancer to receive the benefit...

2402
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,651
(Who did the judges vote for?)

2403
01:41:14,191 --> 01:41:16,360
Ryu Tae Young and Bang Seong Hyun.

2404
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:17,361
(Ryu Tae Young and Bang Seong Hyun win the benefit.)

2405
01:41:17,462 --> 01:41:20,030
Ryu Tae Young and Bang Seong Hyun...

2406
01:41:20,031 --> 01:41:22,200
will receive the benefit of 500 points.

2407
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:23,860
Did the judges pick them?

2408
01:41:23,861 --> 01:41:25,401
What a twist.

2409
01:41:26,771 --> 01:41:27,901
(Ryu Tae Young, 500 points, Bang Seong Hyun, 500 points)

2410
01:41:28,002 --> 01:41:29,342
They both received it.

2411
01:41:30,142 --> 01:41:33,371
I see the chance to move to the Second Class.

2412
01:41:33,642 --> 01:41:35,382
It was a shame.

2413
01:41:35,781 --> 01:41:39,251
They have better harmony.

2414
01:41:39,252 --> 01:41:40,950
The dancers' texture.

2415
01:41:40,951 --> 01:41:43,450
They're good on their own or together.

2416
01:41:43,451 --> 01:41:44,921
Considering the overall picture,

2417
01:41:44,922 --> 01:41:48,160
Tae Young and Seong Hyun's energy played an integral role.

2418
01:41:48,161 --> 01:41:49,461
I will continue to reveal...

2419
01:41:49,462 --> 01:41:51,632
the evaluation on "Parasite" main lead role.

2420
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:52,931
Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2421
01:41:52,932 --> 01:41:54,360
- Choi Ho Jong. - Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2422
01:41:54,361 --> 01:41:57,001
I think I did well, so I decided to trust myself.

2423
01:41:57,002 --> 01:41:58,571
I think I'll win the benefit.

2424
01:41:58,901 --> 01:42:02,070
I can see that Ho Jong is an experienced and wise dancer...

2425
01:42:02,071 --> 01:42:03,801
because he knows how to distribute his energy.

2426
01:42:03,802 --> 01:42:06,641
Only special dancers can...

2427
01:42:06,642 --> 01:42:09,281
meet expectations in every performance.

2428
01:42:10,182 --> 01:42:14,051
Ho Jong, what I appreciate is that he was very...

2429
01:42:14,052 --> 01:42:17,382
His artistry is very distinct and individual...

2430
01:42:17,552 --> 01:42:20,252
and specific. And I see that again.

2431
01:42:20,292 --> 01:42:24,161
The downside about this is that I've seen this a lot now.

2432
01:42:24,621 --> 01:42:27,591
What I liked about Kim Kyu Nyeon's performance is...

2433
01:42:27,592 --> 01:42:29,502
that it had peaks and valleys.

2434
01:42:30,262 --> 01:42:33,700
(Kim Kyu Nyeon tries to break the frame.)

2435
01:42:33,701 --> 01:42:36,602
He showed different sides of his personality.

2436
01:42:37,002 --> 01:42:40,541
Between Choi Ho Jong and Kim Kyu Nyeon in the main lead role,

2437
01:42:40,542 --> 01:42:42,682
the dancer to take the benefit is...

2438
01:42:43,142 --> 01:42:44,542
There might be a twist.

2439
01:42:45,281 --> 01:42:48,752
It's Choi Ho Jong in the lead role.

2440
01:42:49,352 --> 01:42:51,221
Choi Ho Jong in the lead role...

2441
01:42:51,222 --> 01:42:54,292
will receive the benefit of 500 points. Congratulations.

2442
01:42:54,592 --> 01:42:56,320
(Grateful)

2443
01:42:56,321 --> 01:42:58,762
Because Ho Jong has a lot of experience,

2444
01:42:58,792 --> 01:43:00,591
he knows the overall flow.

2445
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:03,701
Kyu Nyeon didn't seem to immerse in the character.

2446
01:43:03,762 --> 01:43:06,001
To surpass his teacher,

2447
01:43:06,002 --> 01:43:08,201
- He wasn't good enough. - he lacked experience.

2448
01:43:08,602 --> 01:43:10,271
- It's his life homework. - Exactly.

2449
01:43:10,342 --> 01:43:11,740
To surpass his teacher.

2450
01:43:11,741 --> 01:43:14,271
But he'll make it happen one day.

2451
01:43:14,811 --> 01:43:18,351
One might think the match with my teacher didn't benefit me,

2452
01:43:18,352 --> 01:43:20,980
but I think it was a chance for me to grow.

2453
01:43:20,981 --> 01:43:22,821
I will move forward again.

2454
01:43:23,382 --> 01:43:25,422
We fought well together.

2455
01:43:25,592 --> 01:43:26,922
It was a nice competition.

2456
01:43:27,752 --> 01:43:31,592
I will reveal the current ranking of "Parasite" dancers.

2457
01:43:33,392 --> 01:43:35,861
Choi Ho Jong ranked first.

2458
01:43:36,332 --> 01:43:39,031
He played the lead role, but he placed the bottom.

2459
01:43:39,201 --> 01:43:40,900
Gosh, this is killing me.

2460
01:43:40,901 --> 01:43:41,901
(Kim Kyu Nyeon placed the bottom except group dancers.)

2461
01:43:42,401 --> 01:43:44,302
I might end up in Under Class.

2462
01:43:44,602 --> 01:43:46,241
Kyu Nyeon did his best.

2463
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:49,042
He wasn't lucky with his match.

2464
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:51,480
So the result for K-Contents Mission...

2465
01:43:51,481 --> 01:43:53,681
has been revealed.

2466
01:43:53,682 --> 01:43:56,650
In this mission, the first elimination...

2467
01:43:56,651 --> 01:43:57,852
in Stage Fighter will take place.

2468
01:43:58,552 --> 01:44:00,650
Now, we will begin...

2469
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:03,091
Stage Fighter's second Class Movement Ceremony.

2470
01:44:03,092 --> 01:44:06,660
Who will get to be promoted, and who will get to be demoted?

2471
01:44:06,661 --> 01:44:08,601
(Sighing)

2472
01:44:08,602 --> 01:44:10,102
(Sighing)

2473
01:44:10,361 --> 01:44:11,731
I'm so scared.

2474
01:44:12,071 --> 01:44:15,200
First Class will be reduced from 8 to 7,

2475
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:18,712
and who will land in that class?

2476
01:44:18,811 --> 01:44:21,141
Stage Fighter's second Class Movement Ceremony...

2477
01:44:21,142 --> 01:44:22,542
that's about to take place...

2478
01:44:22,741 --> 01:44:25,381
includes the team's score based on the online public evaluation,

2479
01:44:25,382 --> 01:44:28,011
the main lead role's benefit...

2480
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:30,020
evaluated by masters, coaches, choreographers,

2481
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:32,120
and rehearsal directors,

2482
01:44:32,121 --> 01:44:35,591
and the score after combining the number of views and likes...

2483
01:44:35,592 --> 01:44:38,391
of the dancer's solo video with the class weighting factor.

2484
01:44:38,392 --> 01:44:40,461
It's evaluated based on the dancer's final score...

2485
01:44:40,462 --> 01:44:43,061
after combining them all.

2486
01:44:43,262 --> 01:44:46,370
It will be easier for those who played the lead roles.

2487
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:47,802
Yes, clearly.

2488
01:44:48,571 --> 01:44:50,602
I hope I can maintain it.

2489
01:44:51,071 --> 01:44:52,971
After the second Class Movement Ceremony,

2490
01:44:52,972 --> 01:44:56,081
dancers in First Class will receive a benefit.

2491
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:57,181
I'm jealous.

2492
01:44:57,182 --> 01:45:00,511
Only seven people in First Class will...

2493
01:45:00,512 --> 01:45:03,451
have a famous fashion magazine shoot on behalf of Stage Fighter.

2494
01:45:03,552 --> 01:45:05,292
I wish I could do that.

2495
01:45:05,722 --> 01:45:07,051
That's not all.

2496
01:45:07,052 --> 01:45:09,690
After the Class Movement Ceremony,

2497
01:45:09,691 --> 01:45:12,560
there's another benefit for the only dancer...

2498
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:13,761
The only dancer?

2499
01:45:13,762 --> 01:45:17,361
For the only dancer who places 1st in 1st Class.

2500
01:45:17,861 --> 01:45:18,931
That's 64 versus 1.

2501
01:45:18,932 --> 01:45:20,401
- That is... - First of first.

2502
01:45:20,602 --> 01:45:22,070
(First of First Benefit, Branded Dance Film)

2503
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:23,200
What?

2504
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:24,271
Really?

2505
01:45:24,571 --> 01:45:25,672
- First... - That's terrific.

2506
01:45:25,811 --> 01:45:27,570
He will play the lead role in the branded dance film...

2507
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:30,980
using the smartphone.

2508
01:45:30,981 --> 01:45:33,011
- That's what you call a benefit. - Yes.

2509
01:45:33,012 --> 01:45:35,921
His name will be put forward as a director...

2510
01:45:35,922 --> 01:45:37,681
with the choreography and directing authority in the designated section.

2511
01:45:37,682 --> 01:45:41,052
Then now, we will begin the second Class Movement Ceremony.

2512
01:45:41,191 --> 01:45:42,491
Gosh, I'm so...

2513
01:45:44,462 --> 01:45:46,061
- nervous. - This is killing me.

2514
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:49,231
I'm scared. The air suddenly changed.

2515
01:45:51,332 --> 01:45:53,102
(Stage Fighter 2nd Class Movement Ceremony begins.)

2516
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:55,270
(This ceremony took place with observers in attendance.)

2517
01:45:55,271 --> 01:45:56,871
(Before the 2nd Class Movement Ceremony that will eliminate people)

2518
01:45:57,371 --> 01:46:00,211
I can't relax unlike other times.

2519
01:46:00,212 --> 01:46:01,981
- That's survival for you. - Yes.

2520
01:46:02,111 --> 01:46:04,280
There will be eliminations.

2521
01:46:04,281 --> 01:46:06,682
My goal today is survival.

2522
01:46:07,781 --> 01:46:09,051
(Deep sigh)

2523
01:46:09,052 --> 01:46:10,222
I'm so scared.

2524
01:46:10,552 --> 01:46:14,450
I don't have any weighting factors or benefits.

2525
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:16,620
I'm basically left out to die.

2526
01:46:16,621 --> 01:46:19,060
Class is what matters the most here.

2527
01:46:19,061 --> 01:46:21,391
I'm the weakest here.

2528
01:46:21,392 --> 01:46:23,231
If I have a problem, I have to move up.

2529
01:46:24,031 --> 01:46:26,230
(Second Class locker room)

2530
01:46:26,231 --> 01:46:27,602
I'm curious about the Second's result the most.

2531
01:46:28,231 --> 01:46:31,102
Go up or maintain it or be demoted.

2532
01:46:31,571 --> 01:46:35,211
I've been in Second since the first mission.

2533
01:46:35,212 --> 01:46:37,082
Of course I want to move up to First.

2534
01:46:37,512 --> 01:46:39,950
I only have one goal.

2535
01:46:39,951 --> 01:46:42,481
Let me get back in First.

2536
01:46:42,682 --> 01:46:44,382
(First Class locker room)

2537
01:46:44,682 --> 01:46:46,151
I don't want to go to Second.

2538
01:46:46,491 --> 01:46:48,991
It'll be the last time for all of us to be in First together.

2539
01:46:49,222 --> 01:46:51,060
I don't want to move out. Gosh.

2540
01:46:51,061 --> 01:46:53,660
I'm a bit worried.

2541
01:46:53,661 --> 01:46:56,462
Because it includes the public voting, I don't feel confident.

2542
01:46:57,262 --> 01:46:59,971
Why is my name tag so messy?

2543
01:46:59,972 --> 01:47:01,602
Gosh.

2544
01:47:02,172 --> 01:47:05,270
To be honest, I couldn't relax.

2545
01:47:05,271 --> 01:47:07,971
Because I wasn't aware of the individuals' voting result.

2546
01:47:07,972 --> 01:47:09,512
I had no clue.

2547
01:47:09,981 --> 01:47:12,311
I'm scared. My heart is pounding.

2548
01:47:12,552 --> 01:47:13,911
Don't be scared.

2549
01:47:14,212 --> 01:47:18,592
I was the only person who did the group dance in First.

2550
01:47:18,821 --> 01:47:22,792
When I saw the score result, I was made aware of the gap even more.

2551
01:47:22,962 --> 01:47:24,820
I'm unlikely to maintain it.

2552
01:47:24,821 --> 01:47:26,932
It's the toughest spot.

2553
01:47:28,092 --> 01:47:30,002
(Surprised)

2554
01:47:30,262 --> 01:47:31,972
(The 2nd Class Movement Ceremony begins.)

2555
01:47:32,172 --> 01:47:33,701
(Has it begun?)

2556
01:47:34,071 --> 01:47:35,871
(2nd Class Movement Ceremony)

2557
01:47:36,901 --> 01:47:40,810
When your name is called, get your stuff from the locker room,

2558
01:47:40,811 --> 01:47:44,682
and check your class in the Class Confirmation Zone.

2559
01:47:44,882 --> 01:47:48,481
(The 2nd Class Movement Ceremony is full of twists.)

2560
01:47:48,582 --> 01:47:49,681
My hands are trembling.

2561
01:47:49,682 --> 01:47:50,922
What am I going to do now?

2562
01:47:51,821 --> 01:47:53,521
Who will get to be promoted?

2563
01:47:54,722 --> 01:47:56,360
Welcome to the Second world.

2564
01:47:56,361 --> 01:47:57,521
It took a while.

2565
01:47:58,191 --> 01:47:59,991
Who will get to be demoted?

2566
01:48:00,731 --> 01:48:01,731
(Really?)

2567
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:02,731
He's demoted.

2568
01:48:02,732 --> 01:48:05,230
- I didn't see that coming. - That's shocking.

2569
01:48:05,231 --> 01:48:07,632
And who will be the first to be eliminated?

2570
01:48:07,771 --> 01:48:09,501
I did my best.

2571
01:48:09,502 --> 01:48:10,842
I want more.

2572
01:48:11,672 --> 01:48:13,042
(A series of twists)

2573
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:14,342
This makes no sense.

2574
01:48:14,441 --> 01:48:16,012
I never expected to be eliminated.

2575
01:48:16,342 --> 01:48:19,352
Then now, we will begin the second Class Movement Ceremony.

2576
01:48:19,552 --> 01:48:21,781
(Stage Fighter 2nd Class Movement Ceremony begins.)

2577
01:48:22,882 --> 01:48:23,882
(2nd Class Movement Ceremony)

2578
01:48:23,883 --> 01:48:25,120
- Is it on? - What's that?

2579
01:48:25,121 --> 01:48:26,991
- Maybe we get to see it. - Has it started?

2580
01:48:27,092 --> 01:48:28,092
(2nd Class Movement Ceremony, first dancer)

2581
01:48:28,093 --> 01:48:29,320
(Ha Won Jun)

2582
01:48:29,321 --> 01:48:30,821
I'll be watching.

2583
01:48:31,561 --> 01:48:35,631
Because I'm in Under Class, I was a little worried.

2584
01:48:35,632 --> 01:48:39,302
I can't wait to see the power of Choi Ho Jong's jewel box.

2585
01:48:39,632 --> 01:48:41,671
His individual score is very high.

2586
01:48:41,672 --> 01:48:43,770
- Mr. Ha. - He also had high views.

2587
01:48:43,771 --> 01:48:45,911
Is he older than you?

2588
01:48:45,941 --> 01:48:47,011
(I see.)

2589
01:48:47,012 --> 01:48:49,382
(Mature younger boy, playful older boy)

2590
01:48:49,842 --> 01:48:51,780
Let's see if the gemstone is polished.

2591
01:48:51,781 --> 01:48:52,882
Show us.

2592
01:48:53,451 --> 01:48:54,881
- Let's go, jewel box. - Let's go.

2593
01:48:54,882 --> 01:48:56,052
I might come back.

2594
01:48:56,182 --> 01:48:57,650
(The jewel is worried.)

2595
01:48:57,651 --> 01:49:01,450
I think the 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold weighting factor...

2596
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:03,990
will have big influence.

2597
01:49:03,991 --> 01:49:06,360
I don't even ask for a promotion.

2598
01:49:06,361 --> 01:49:07,391
(Class Confirmation Zone)

2599
01:49:07,392 --> 01:49:11,632
If I'm the first to be eliminated, it'll be embarrassing.

2600
01:49:11,972 --> 01:49:15,502
(Entering the Class Confirmation Zone with tension)

2601
01:49:17,302 --> 01:49:18,302
(Shaking)

2602
01:49:18,771 --> 01:49:21,741
What if there's nothing inside? I shook it.

2603
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:23,641
I didn't hear anything.

2604
01:49:23,642 --> 01:49:24,740
I'm eliminated.

2605
01:49:24,741 --> 01:49:25,911
When I opened it...

2606
01:49:26,411 --> 01:49:28,351
(Sighing)

2607
01:49:28,352 --> 01:49:31,081
I realized today that Class matters.

2608
01:49:31,082 --> 01:49:33,221
That the score increases by 1.3-fold.

2609
01:49:33,222 --> 01:49:35,990
Second Class has that at least.

2610
01:49:35,991 --> 01:49:38,190
That already means so much to us. And for Under Class...

2611
01:49:38,191 --> 01:49:39,792
- It's a wall. - They have nothing.

2612
01:49:39,892 --> 01:49:42,501
Under or Second?

2613
01:49:42,502 --> 01:49:43,860
(What's the result of Ha Won Jun's 2nd Class Movement Ceremony?)

2614
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:46,432
- Do you think he'll move up? - He received the team score.

2615
01:49:46,632 --> 01:49:48,031
I can never guess.

2616
01:49:48,741 --> 01:49:50,441
(Gently)

2617
01:49:54,271 --> 01:49:57,281
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2618
01:49:57,481 --> 01:49:58,711
(Welcome.)

2619
01:49:58,712 --> 01:50:01,280
He made it despite the 1.3-fold increase.

2620
01:50:01,281 --> 01:50:03,280
It's not easy to break the wall.

2621
01:50:03,281 --> 01:50:04,722
Won Jun is amazing.

2622
01:50:04,821 --> 01:50:06,990
Ho Jong's choice is proved.

2623
01:50:06,991 --> 01:50:08,621
(While checking his class)

2624
01:50:11,092 --> 01:50:14,261
(It's a promotion he had wished for.)

2625
01:50:14,262 --> 01:50:17,302
Thank you, Ho Jong.

2626
01:50:17,432 --> 01:50:21,671
During the practice, he was pointed out a lot by the choreographer.

2627
01:50:21,672 --> 01:50:25,641
But on the day of the performance, he proved himself.

2628
01:50:25,642 --> 01:50:27,512
It took four months.

2629
01:50:27,712 --> 01:50:32,111
I didn't expect moving one step up to take so long.

2630
01:50:32,981 --> 01:50:34,012
Second.

2631
01:50:34,382 --> 01:50:35,421
Hello.

2632
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:39,990
Just like my attitude toward K-Contents Mission,

2633
01:50:39,991 --> 01:50:43,021
I'll continue to do my best for the future missions.

2634
01:50:44,061 --> 01:50:46,262
(Ha Won Jun's 2nd Class Evaluation Result)

2635
01:50:47,031 --> 01:50:49,262
I think it's about time for us to move out.

2636
01:50:49,661 --> 01:50:50,901
It's about time for First to go.

2637
01:50:52,731 --> 01:50:54,332
That gave me the chills.

2638
01:50:54,802 --> 01:50:56,602
- That gave me the chills. - Unbelievable.

2639
01:50:56,771 --> 01:50:58,770
- Why am I up first? - As soon as he said it...

2640
01:50:58,771 --> 01:51:00,411
It's begun.

2641
01:51:00,672 --> 01:51:01,911
First from First.

2642
01:51:02,042 --> 01:51:03,940
We'll get to see how 1.5-fold plays.

2643
01:51:03,941 --> 01:51:06,951
We'll get to check how influential 1.5-fold is.

2644
01:51:07,981 --> 01:51:10,051
(Followed by Kim Hyun Ho's result in First)

2645
01:51:10,052 --> 01:51:11,082
Don't go.

2646
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:13,252
- It's First again. - I know.

2647
01:51:13,821 --> 01:51:16,060
So this is how it feels. I want to stay here.

2648
01:51:16,061 --> 01:51:17,061
(I don't want to leave.)

2649
01:51:17,292 --> 01:51:19,462
- Don't go. - Good luck.

2650
01:51:19,632 --> 01:51:20,990
- Come back. - See you again.

2651
01:51:20,991 --> 01:51:22,931
(Kim Hyun Ho leaves the locker room with a cheer.)

2652
01:51:22,932 --> 01:51:24,361
What's going to happen to Tae Young?

2653
01:51:24,762 --> 01:51:27,701
Didn't Tae Young win the benefit?

2654
01:51:27,832 --> 01:51:29,102
- For "Parasite." - For "Parasite."

2655
01:51:29,701 --> 01:51:32,741
Then he might get to stay in First.

2656
01:51:33,212 --> 01:51:35,780
I have a feeling he'll be demoted to Second.

2657
01:51:35,781 --> 01:51:36,841
He'll be demoted.

2658
01:51:36,842 --> 01:51:38,542
I think Tae Young will be sent to Second.

2659
01:51:38,811 --> 01:51:42,951
Will Hyun Ho make it in the top seven?

2660
01:51:43,121 --> 01:51:44,751
It's a bummer that he missed the lead role.

2661
01:51:44,752 --> 01:51:45,752
Right.

2662
01:51:45,753 --> 01:51:48,052
If Hyun Ho gets demoted, how far will I go down?

2663
01:51:48,392 --> 01:51:49,861
Don't say that.

2664
01:51:50,691 --> 01:51:51,821
Why am I getting nervous?

2665
01:51:52,861 --> 01:51:54,261
(Ryu Tae Young and Kim Hyun Ho...)

2666
01:51:54,262 --> 01:51:55,661
(finally enter the Class Confirmation Zone.)

2667
01:51:56,401 --> 01:51:58,701
(Will there be a change in their class?)

2668
01:51:59,901 --> 01:52:02,240
(Soon, the door opens.)

2669
01:52:02,241 --> 01:52:04,472
(Someone walks down the demotion stairs.)

2670
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:06,940
(What happened to Ryu Tae Young and Kim Hyun Ho?)

2671
01:52:06,941 --> 01:52:08,142
(Opening)

2672
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:12,681
(Who's back in First Class' locker room?)

2673
01:52:12,682 --> 01:52:13,712
That's crazy.

2674
01:52:14,451 --> 01:52:15,951
Congratulations.

2675
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:17,780
(Welcome back, Hyun Ho.)

2676
01:52:17,781 --> 01:52:19,491
- Well done. - Good job.

2677
01:52:20,222 --> 01:52:21,222
(Open)

2678
01:52:21,222 --> 01:52:22,222
(Gasping)

2679
01:52:22,223 --> 01:52:23,892
I was so happy.

2680
01:52:24,292 --> 01:52:26,731
First Class is always anxious.

2681
01:52:27,161 --> 01:52:31,160
Depending on how much you prove yourself and be approved,

2682
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:34,002
your rank keeps changing.

2683
01:52:34,371 --> 01:52:36,771
I'll put a lot of effort not to be defeated.

2684
01:52:37,271 --> 01:52:39,811
I was seriously ready to go down.

2685
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:42,042
- I'm jealous. - I'm jealous.

2686
01:52:42,411 --> 01:52:43,940
(Rank 6)

2687
01:52:43,941 --> 01:52:45,881
Sixth place?

2688
01:52:45,882 --> 01:52:47,481
He barely made it.

2689
01:52:47,852 --> 01:52:49,481
Sixth place means he barely made it.

2690
01:52:49,882 --> 01:52:51,722
Come to think of it, it's not that high.

2691
01:52:52,552 --> 01:52:54,351
(Ryu Tae Young from First checks his class.)

2692
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:56,060
I was thinking, "I never want to go down..."

2693
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:57,592
when I opened the box.

2694
01:52:58,121 --> 01:52:59,892
Then it said Second.

2695
01:53:00,491 --> 01:53:01,491
(Bitter)

2696
01:53:01,492 --> 01:53:04,061
I felt bitter at the time.

2697
01:53:05,061 --> 01:53:07,601
I will work harder...

2698
01:53:07,602 --> 01:53:09,142
to get it again.

2699
01:53:09,871 --> 01:53:11,771
(Surprised)

2700
01:53:12,012 --> 01:53:13,310
Hey.

2701
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:14,740
- Well done. - Well done.

2702
01:53:14,741 --> 01:53:16,881
(Well done.)

2703
01:53:16,882 --> 01:53:19,450
I miss the benefits I got...

2704
01:53:19,451 --> 01:53:22,150
in First.

2705
01:53:22,151 --> 01:53:24,851
And the future benefits to come.

2706
01:53:24,852 --> 01:53:26,121
That's what I regret.

2707
01:53:27,052 --> 01:53:28,321
He placed 12th.

2708
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:29,922
- He placed 12th? - He placed 12th?

2709
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:32,161
He even received the benefit for his role.

2710
01:53:32,531 --> 01:53:34,592
It must be so tough to move up.

2711
01:53:35,531 --> 01:53:37,461
(Next is Kang Gyeong Ho in Second.)

2712
01:53:37,462 --> 01:53:38,931
- Gyeong Ho. - Go, Gyeong Ho.

2713
01:53:38,932 --> 01:53:40,131
- Good luck. - Gyeong Ho.

2714
01:53:40,132 --> 01:53:41,632
Well done, Gyeong Ho.

2715
01:53:41,802 --> 01:53:43,371
Bye, Gyeong Ho.

2716
01:53:43,542 --> 01:53:45,811
He's the only one who can move up.

2717
01:53:46,712 --> 01:53:48,471
Good work, Gyeong Ho.

2718
01:53:48,472 --> 01:53:50,582
Gyeong Ho, you have to stay modest in this field.

2719
01:53:51,111 --> 01:53:52,551
Don't forget about us...

2720
01:53:52,552 --> 01:53:53,950
after you go back to First.

2721
01:53:53,951 --> 01:53:56,020
- I might come back. - What are you saying?

2722
01:53:56,021 --> 01:53:57,521
Don't even look back.

2723
01:53:58,121 --> 01:53:59,821
- Leave now. - Bye.

2724
01:54:01,392 --> 01:54:02,892
(Kang Gyeong Ho sets off to the Class Confirmation Zone.)

2725
01:54:05,021 --> 01:54:07,432
- Gyeong Ho will come up here. - He'll be here.

2726
01:54:07,531 --> 01:54:08,660
(The air is the same in First's locker room.)

2727
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:09,661
Oh, here...

2728
01:54:09,662 --> 01:54:12,002
I'm curious about his individual score.

2729
01:54:12,302 --> 01:54:14,332
He received the team score.

2730
01:54:14,632 --> 01:54:16,602
He also received the role benefit.

2731
01:54:18,172 --> 01:54:19,841
(With "Squid Game" Team A's high score...)

2732
01:54:19,842 --> 01:54:21,441
(and the main lead role's benefit, )

2733
01:54:21,941 --> 01:54:23,810
(Kang Gyeong Ho received 1,500 points so far.)

2734
01:54:23,811 --> 01:54:25,212
He either placed 2nd or 3rd.

2735
01:54:25,752 --> 01:54:27,451
I'm not worried at all.

2736
01:54:27,781 --> 01:54:29,052
Can we see it right away?

2737
01:54:30,121 --> 01:54:31,722
Honestly, I was so nervous.

2738
01:54:32,191 --> 01:54:35,251
My hands were sweating so much. I kept wiping my hands.

2739
01:54:35,252 --> 01:54:36,421
(Nervous)

2740
01:54:36,422 --> 01:54:38,020
I was desperate.

2741
01:54:38,021 --> 01:54:40,332
I was demoted to 2nd from 1st.

2742
01:54:40,661 --> 01:54:44,601
I wondered if I could go back to First.

2743
01:54:44,602 --> 01:54:47,332
(Will Kang Gyeong Ho be able to return to First?)

2744
01:54:50,502 --> 01:54:52,611
What if he returns to Second?

2745
01:54:52,941 --> 01:54:55,041
That means we have no chance of going up at all.

2746
01:54:55,042 --> 01:54:56,940
- No one can. - No one.

2747
01:54:56,941 --> 01:54:58,182
We'll be stuck here forever.

2748
01:54:58,512 --> 01:54:59,512
(Knocking)

2749
01:54:59,513 --> 01:55:00,611
- Yes? - Why is he knocking?

2750
01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:01,811
Come in.

2751
01:55:01,812 --> 01:55:04,020
(Gyeong Ho is here.)

2752
01:55:04,021 --> 01:55:05,650
(They saw it coming.)

2753
01:55:05,651 --> 01:55:06,922
I knew you were going to come.

2754
01:55:08,292 --> 01:55:09,820
(Kang Gyeong Ho is promoted from 2nd to 1st.)

2755
01:55:09,821 --> 01:55:11,592
I was so happy.

2756
01:55:12,392 --> 01:55:16,161
I put so much effort to move up.

2757
01:55:16,401 --> 01:55:18,661
I won't yield easily like before.

2758
01:55:20,271 --> 01:55:23,102
He received 5,300 points. Who placed second then?

2759
01:55:23,701 --> 01:55:25,042
Is it Jong Cheol?

2760
01:55:25,201 --> 01:55:26,941
Who placed second then?

2761
01:55:27,172 --> 01:55:29,382
I was expecting him to place second.

2762
01:55:29,542 --> 01:55:31,711
(Who placed 2nd?)

2763
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:33,481
Is it going to be First next?

2764
01:55:34,352 --> 01:55:35,621
It's about time.

2765
01:55:36,052 --> 01:55:37,121
This is crazy.

2766
01:55:37,621 --> 01:55:39,950
I didn't get high views.

2767
01:55:39,951 --> 01:55:44,191
I was worried about my individual score.

2768
01:55:45,462 --> 01:55:46,731
(What a timing.)

2769
01:55:47,132 --> 01:55:49,060
(Oh, my goodness.)

2770
01:55:49,061 --> 01:55:50,502
I hate to leave.

2771
01:55:51,201 --> 01:55:54,472
Gosh. This is so tense. It's making me nervous.

2772
01:55:56,102 --> 01:55:57,672
I want to take the First mark.

2773
01:55:58,802 --> 01:56:02,382
This emotion has been piling up.

2774
01:56:02,512 --> 01:56:04,111
I've always been nervous.

2775
01:56:04,712 --> 01:56:05,751
(During the Class Battle)

2776
01:56:05,752 --> 01:56:07,211
(Kim Yu Chan didn't get to keep First Class...)

2777
01:56:07,212 --> 01:56:08,712
(in the Class Battle.)

2778
01:56:09,651 --> 01:56:13,091
Among the missions I've completed,

2779
01:56:13,092 --> 01:56:15,661
it reduced my confidence.

2780
01:56:16,121 --> 01:56:18,860
I got the result that made me wonder...

2781
01:56:18,861 --> 01:56:21,432
if I deserved to be here.

2782
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:26,371
I had no faith in myself.

2783
01:56:26,932 --> 01:56:28,031
My hands are shaking.

2784
01:56:30,102 --> 01:56:33,142
(What's the result of Kim Yu Chan's 2nd Class Movement Ceremony?)

2785
01:56:37,241 --> 01:56:39,280
(Kim Yu Chan drops his head...)

2786
01:56:39,281 --> 01:56:41,111
(and stays in the Class Confirmation Zone for a while.)

2787
01:56:41,911 --> 01:56:43,082
Time has come.

2788
01:56:44,222 --> 01:56:45,481
I should face my destiny.

2789
01:56:46,151 --> 01:56:48,621
It's about time for him to be here. What's he taking so long?

2790
01:56:49,592 --> 01:56:50,721
(Did he...)

2791
01:56:50,722 --> 01:56:52,731
I think I felt someone's presence.

2792
01:56:54,361 --> 01:56:55,392
He's here.

2793
01:56:56,161 --> 01:56:59,271
(Kim Yu Chan maintains his First Class.)

2794
01:57:00,132 --> 01:57:01,431
(Kim Yu Chan)

2795
01:57:01,432 --> 01:57:02,941
(His hand is shaking.)

2796
01:57:03,271 --> 01:57:06,472
I was so shocked that my legs became jelly.

2797
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:08,070
It reminded me of the pressure...

2798
01:57:08,071 --> 01:57:11,142
and the moments I was disappointed in myself.

2799
01:57:11,481 --> 01:57:14,910
I was happy, yet I felt rewarded.

2800
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:17,752
I cried a bit.

2801
01:57:18,222 --> 01:57:19,950
(He may cry, yet he still shows it off.)

2802
01:57:19,951 --> 01:57:21,921
(Kim Yu Chan's 2nd Class Evaluation result)

2803
01:57:21,922 --> 01:57:22,922
Second.

2804
01:57:23,722 --> 01:57:24,921
(Jaw dropping)

2805
01:57:24,922 --> 01:57:26,462
- He placed second. - Second?

2806
01:57:26,592 --> 01:57:27,831
It's 4,125?

2807
01:57:27,832 --> 01:57:30,400
I'm totally off.

2808
01:57:30,401 --> 01:57:32,771
If Yu Chan placed second...

2809
01:57:33,972 --> 01:57:36,102
He had so many likes.

2810
01:57:36,401 --> 01:57:37,871
He received so many likes.

2811
01:57:38,502 --> 01:57:39,711
(Next is Kim Hyo Joon in First.)

2812
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,911
Oh, what? It's me?

2813
01:57:41,411 --> 01:57:43,480
- Good luck. - Good luck.

2814
01:57:43,481 --> 01:57:44,881
(Kim Hyo Joon gets ready to check his class.)

2815
01:57:44,882 --> 01:57:46,950
With the 1.5-fold,

2816
01:57:46,951 --> 01:57:48,951
I might have a slight chance.

2817
01:57:49,182 --> 01:57:51,752
I want to maintain First.

2818
01:57:53,392 --> 01:57:55,191
(Will Kim Hyo Joon be able to maintain his First Class?)

2819
01:57:55,621 --> 01:57:57,592
(Kim Hyo Joon is demoted to 2nd from 1st.)

2820
01:57:58,061 --> 01:57:59,291
(Groaning)

2821
01:57:59,292 --> 01:58:02,191
I expected it after checking the views.

2822
01:58:02,462 --> 01:58:06,201
Still, I had my hopes up. I couldn't let it go.

2823
01:58:07,201 --> 01:58:09,270
(Kim Hyo Joon is demoted to 2nd from 1st.)

2824
01:58:09,271 --> 01:58:11,302
(Kim Hyo Joon's 2nd Class Evaluation result)

2825
01:58:11,542 --> 01:58:12,610
(The next person to check is Jung Hye Seong.)

2826
01:58:12,611 --> 01:58:13,811
(Nervous)

2827
01:58:14,042 --> 01:58:15,142
Gosh.

2828
01:58:15,542 --> 01:58:17,641
Hye Seong will have no problem.

2829
01:58:17,642 --> 01:58:18,741
Hurry up.

2830
01:58:19,151 --> 01:58:20,581
- Hurry up. - See you soon.

2831
01:58:20,582 --> 01:58:21,582
Okay.

2832
01:58:22,521 --> 01:58:25,951
I have a 60 percent chance...

2833
01:58:26,252 --> 01:58:28,352
of moving to First.

2834
01:58:29,262 --> 01:58:30,421
Have we seen tenth place yet?

2835
01:58:30,422 --> 01:58:32,461
- We haven't, have we? - No.

2836
01:58:32,462 --> 01:58:34,031
Hye Seong doesn't have any benefits, does he?

2837
01:58:34,231 --> 01:58:35,832
He received 500 points for the supporting role.

2838
01:58:36,302 --> 01:58:39,371
He probably placed somewhere in tenth place.

2839
01:58:40,731 --> 01:58:42,672
(What's Jung Hye Seong's class?)

2840
01:58:43,701 --> 01:58:45,070
(Jung Hye Seong is demoted to Under from 2nd.)

2841
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:46,341
- What? - What?

2842
01:58:46,342 --> 01:58:47,642
Even with the benefit?

2843
01:58:47,712 --> 01:58:48,712
(Young Woong is shocked.)

2844
01:58:48,713 --> 01:58:49,910
Even with the benefit?

2845
01:58:49,911 --> 01:58:51,041
- What? - Hold on.

2846
01:58:51,042 --> 01:58:53,411
- That makes no sense. - That's crazy.

2847
01:58:53,512 --> 01:58:54,882
(Jung Hye Seong is demoted to Under from Second.)

2848
01:58:55,111 --> 01:58:59,221
I never imagined becoming Under.

2849
01:58:59,222 --> 01:59:01,521
I was flustered.

2850
01:59:02,292 --> 01:59:03,591
It's handmade.

2851
01:59:03,592 --> 01:59:04,660
(With shock and confusion)

2852
01:59:04,661 --> 01:59:05,791
No way.

2853
01:59:05,792 --> 01:59:07,892
- No way. - Unbelievable.

2854
01:59:08,332 --> 01:59:10,002
- Nice to meet you. - It's my first time in Under.

2855
01:59:10,701 --> 01:59:11,801
It's 23rd place.

2856
01:59:11,802 --> 01:59:13,001
(Jung Hye Seong's 2nd Class Evaluation result)

2857
01:59:13,002 --> 01:59:15,472
If you placed 22nd, you would've maintained your class.

2858
01:59:15,842 --> 01:59:17,271
The benefit was crucial.

2859
01:59:17,842 --> 01:59:19,410
It was a lot of stimulation.

2860
01:59:19,411 --> 01:59:20,940
Since I hit the rock bottom,

2861
01:59:20,941 --> 01:59:23,042
I might as well step hard on it and jump high.

2862
01:59:24,411 --> 01:59:26,211
Jin Ho.

2863
01:59:26,212 --> 01:59:27,711
The big one is coming.

2864
01:59:27,712 --> 01:59:29,751
Why are you leaving first?

2865
01:59:29,752 --> 01:59:32,020
- Hey. - Jin Ho, go to Mars.

2866
01:59:32,021 --> 01:59:34,052
This is tense. I hope you fly.

2867
01:59:34,422 --> 01:59:36,892
- Good luck. - You might as well move to First.

2868
01:59:37,321 --> 01:59:39,191
Show the underdog's rebellion.

2869
01:59:39,462 --> 01:59:40,690
I'll look forward to it.

2870
01:59:40,691 --> 01:59:42,191
Please make a drama.

2871
01:59:42,401 --> 01:59:43,531
Good luck.

2872
01:59:43,861 --> 01:59:45,201
He wouldn't come to First, would he?

2873
01:59:45,332 --> 01:59:47,602
But then he received 1,500.

2874
01:59:47,901 --> 01:59:49,701
He'd look awesome if he jumps two steps.

2875
01:59:50,042 --> 01:59:51,241
That's skyrocketing.

2876
01:59:51,542 --> 01:59:53,972
Seventh place is First, right?

2877
01:59:54,111 --> 01:59:55,141
He'll land on it.

2878
01:59:55,142 --> 01:59:57,082
Can someone jump two steps?

2879
01:59:57,411 --> 01:59:59,082
Then it's a drama.

2880
01:59:59,252 --> 02:00:02,110
Under doesn't have 1.5-fold.

2881
02:00:02,111 --> 02:00:03,821
How can he move up with the weight factor?

2882
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:07,352
At first, I just wanted to make it to Second.

2883
02:00:08,052 --> 02:00:10,591
But then I received 1,500 benefit points.

2884
02:00:10,592 --> 02:00:13,932
I might have a chance to be First.

2885
02:00:15,491 --> 02:00:16,932
I have to move up.

2886
02:00:18,462 --> 02:00:19,471
(Trembling)

2887
02:00:19,472 --> 02:00:20,571
Gosh, my hands are shaking.

2888
02:00:22,002 --> 02:00:24,602
(What's the result of Park Jin Ho's Class Movement?)

2889
02:00:25,102 --> 02:00:27,512
- He's guaranteed to move up. - Yes.

2890
02:00:30,611 --> 02:00:31,811
Someone's coming.

2891
02:00:32,241 --> 02:00:33,882
I think he'll enter here.

2892
02:00:36,582 --> 02:00:38,051
(The princess appears.)

2893
02:00:38,052 --> 02:00:39,392
Hello.

2894
02:00:39,621 --> 02:00:41,851
(Park Jin Ho is promoted to Second from Under.)

2895
02:00:41,852 --> 02:00:43,092
"Sky Castle."

2896
02:00:44,222 --> 02:00:45,222
(Groaning)

2897
02:00:45,223 --> 02:00:46,531
I'm in Second Class.

2898
02:00:46,691 --> 02:00:49,262
I wanted to be in First Class,

2899
02:00:49,462 --> 02:00:51,132
so it was a little disappointing,

2900
02:00:51,262 --> 02:00:54,302
but being in Second Class again feels like I'm back home.

2901
02:00:54,401 --> 02:00:56,441
I wore the badge happily.

2902
02:00:56,642 --> 02:00:59,842
I really don't want to go down now.

2903
02:01:00,142 --> 02:01:03,441
I want to go up to be in First Class.

2904
02:01:03,582 --> 02:01:04,682
I'm curious about his score.

2905
02:01:05,852 --> 02:01:07,051
- He placed 15th? - He placed 15th?

2906
02:01:07,052 --> 02:01:08,111
- What? - What?

2907
02:01:08,212 --> 02:01:10,082
- It's much lower than I thought. - It's too low.

2908
02:01:10,182 --> 02:01:12,320
You can't ignore the weighting factor of 1.3.

2909
02:01:12,321 --> 02:01:13,521
Oh, it's one for me.

2910
02:01:14,121 --> 02:01:15,861
It seems the weighting factor plays a big role.

2911
02:01:16,222 --> 02:01:17,561
Jin Ho did so well.

2912
02:01:18,092 --> 02:01:19,962
What if I can't move up to Second Class?

2913
02:01:20,432 --> 02:01:21,831
I suddenly feel like...

2914
02:01:21,832 --> 02:01:23,331
- I won't be able to go up. - No.

2915
02:01:23,332 --> 02:01:25,432
(Mental breakdown)

2916
02:01:25,632 --> 02:01:28,031
- I feel like you'll be next. - Yes. I think it'll be me.

2917
02:01:29,371 --> 02:01:30,802
(Next is Yun Hyeok Jung in First Class.)

2918
02:01:31,502 --> 02:01:33,142
I'll see you guys next time.

2919
02:01:33,972 --> 02:01:35,512
You'll come back.

2920
02:01:37,042 --> 02:01:38,182
(Hugging without a word)

2921
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:39,481
I'll give you my energy.

2922
02:01:41,212 --> 02:01:42,621
Why do I feel so bad for him?

2923
02:01:43,852 --> 02:01:46,092
Because there's a weight factor of 1.5,

2924
02:01:46,552 --> 02:01:48,792
I think he'll still rank higher than Jin Ho.

2925
02:01:49,292 --> 02:01:52,321
Don't you think Hyeok Jung will place seventh?

2926
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:55,691
No. I think Jong Cheol will place seventh.

2927
02:01:56,302 --> 02:01:57,531
I want Hyeok Jung to join Second Class with me.

2928
02:01:59,332 --> 02:02:02,302
I had hopes.

2929
02:02:03,042 --> 02:02:04,171
I wanted to place seventh.

2930
02:02:04,172 --> 02:02:05,571
(The lowest rank in First Class)

2931
02:02:05,941 --> 02:02:06,941
My gosh.

2932
02:02:07,972 --> 02:02:10,811
(What's the result for Yun Hyeok Jung in First Class?)

2933
02:02:12,441 --> 02:02:14,011
It's what I expected.

2934
02:02:14,012 --> 02:02:15,280
(Yun Hyeok Jung is demoted from 1st Class to 2nd Class.)

2935
02:02:15,281 --> 02:02:17,682
I really didn't want to go down the stairs.

2936
02:02:17,781 --> 02:02:19,792
I'm disappointed in myself.

2937
02:02:23,161 --> 02:02:24,722
(Hyeok Jung Jin Ho was waiting for is in the Second Class Locker Room.)

2938
02:02:24,962 --> 02:02:26,691
(The Princess is happy.)

2939
02:02:26,932 --> 02:02:28,561
Jin Ho likes it so much.

2940
02:02:28,962 --> 02:02:30,102
It's like reuniting with my family.

2941
02:02:30,561 --> 02:02:32,632
I feel a dopamine rush.

2942
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:35,901
Actually, I just hoped Jin Ho isn't ranked seventh.

2943
02:02:36,271 --> 02:02:38,941
- "I hope he doesn't place 7th." - "I hope he doesn't place 7th?"

2944
02:02:40,472 --> 02:02:43,111
- I'm ranked 14th. I knew it. - Like this?

2945
02:02:43,512 --> 02:02:45,641
Oh, there was no role benefit.

2946
02:02:45,642 --> 02:02:46,712
Because I lost.

2947
02:02:47,411 --> 02:02:48,451
The benefits play a big role.

2948
02:02:49,151 --> 02:02:52,450
Those in Under Class don't have a weight factor.

2949
02:02:52,451 --> 02:02:53,792
That's why it's really hard for them to go up.

2950
02:02:54,252 --> 02:02:55,521
The competition is too fierce.

2951
02:02:56,762 --> 02:02:57,821
Oh, gosh.

2952
02:02:59,432 --> 02:03:00,462
Oh, it's me.

2953
02:03:00,832 --> 02:03:03,631
- It's Go Dong Hoon. Let's go! - My gosh.

2954
02:03:03,632 --> 02:03:05,262
Go Dong Hoon!

2955
02:03:06,172 --> 02:03:07,172
Go.

2956
02:03:07,371 --> 02:03:10,371
- Bye. You go there first. - Don't come back.

2957
02:03:10,672 --> 02:03:12,001
It's like you're enlisting.

2958
02:03:12,002 --> 02:03:13,411
(It looks like he's enlisting.)

2959
02:03:13,642 --> 02:03:15,410
I'll survive and come back.

2960
02:03:15,411 --> 02:03:16,911
- Salute. - Bye.

2961
02:03:17,241 --> 02:03:19,382
Will Dong Hoon move up or not?

2962
02:03:19,811 --> 02:03:21,251
- I think he will. - I think he will.

2963
02:03:21,252 --> 02:03:22,281
He received a team benefit.

2964
02:03:22,512 --> 02:03:24,721
(Dong Hoon received 1,000 points as a team benefit.)

2965
02:03:24,722 --> 02:03:25,951
(Team "Squid Game" A)

2966
02:03:26,222 --> 02:03:27,552
All the main supporting dancers received 1,000 points.

2967
02:03:28,321 --> 02:03:29,621
We're all ranked second.

2968
02:03:30,592 --> 02:03:32,521
Dong Hoon did so well in "Squid Game."

2969
02:03:33,262 --> 02:03:35,161
He might be having some expectations.

2970
02:03:35,262 --> 02:03:37,361
I think he always had expectations.

2971
02:03:38,762 --> 02:03:41,401
But he doesn't have a weighting factor as he was in Under Class.

2972
02:03:42,132 --> 02:03:43,602
The result might've changed if there was a weighting factor.

2973
02:03:43,972 --> 02:03:45,870
If Dong Hoon...

2974
02:03:45,871 --> 02:03:49,071
is still in Under Class this time,

2975
02:03:49,342 --> 02:03:51,081
I'll feel bad for him.

2976
02:03:51,082 --> 02:03:53,151
(Kim Hyun Ho)

2977
02:03:54,212 --> 02:03:57,620
It was a very exciting and scary moment.

2978
02:03:57,621 --> 02:03:58,621
Is it here?

2979
02:03:59,521 --> 02:04:02,491
I thought I did my best,

2980
02:04:03,561 --> 02:04:06,931
but I thought I might encounter an obstacle...

2981
02:04:06,932 --> 02:04:09,861
and stay in the same class.

2982
02:04:10,701 --> 02:04:14,632
(Please)

2983
02:04:14,771 --> 02:04:16,142
I think I've come a long way.

2984
02:04:18,672 --> 02:04:20,871
(He opens the box to check his class.)

2985
02:04:20,941 --> 02:04:22,571
(Sighing)

2986
02:04:23,781 --> 02:04:27,611
(What's the result for Go Dong Hoon in Under Class?)

2987
02:04:27,951 --> 02:04:29,752
If he comes back,

2988
02:04:30,151 --> 02:04:32,481
I don't know how to react.

2989
02:04:32,852 --> 02:04:34,451
Shall we guess what he will say when entering the room?

2990
02:04:34,922 --> 02:04:36,422
"I came to where I belong."

2991
02:04:36,491 --> 02:04:39,060
- "Oh, my." - "It took a long time."

2992
02:04:39,061 --> 02:04:44,502
(People who are going to welcome him are...)

2993
02:04:45,132 --> 02:04:46,302
(Smiling)

2994
02:04:47,201 --> 02:04:49,542
(Welcome to the Second Class Locker Room.)

2995
02:04:50,071 --> 02:04:51,101
(Go Dong Hoon is promoted from Under Class to 2nd Class.)

2996
02:04:51,102 --> 02:04:52,102
Really?

2997
02:04:52,571 --> 02:04:53,712
Finally.

2998
02:04:54,371 --> 02:04:56,012
(Their predictions were right.)

2999
02:04:56,741 --> 02:04:57,781
(I was right.)

3000
02:04:58,182 --> 02:04:59,981
Can't you do something with your bag?

3001
02:05:00,582 --> 02:05:03,651
Wasn't he discharged from the military a while ago?

3002
02:05:04,422 --> 02:05:07,121
- You're in 2nd Class. - Welcome to the 2nd World.

3003
02:05:07,752 --> 02:05:10,320
It's just a class movement for others,

3004
02:05:10,321 --> 02:05:12,191
but I feel like I accomplished something big.

3005
02:05:12,661 --> 02:05:15,262
It was a really touching moment.

3006
02:05:15,962 --> 02:05:18,802
I could've moved up a long time ago, but it took a long time.

3007
02:05:19,132 --> 02:05:22,230
Taking the long way was a great learning experience for me,

3008
02:05:22,231 --> 02:05:25,701
and I was proud.

3009
02:05:27,741 --> 02:05:29,811
He was desperate to move up.

3010
02:05:30,411 --> 02:05:32,752
Look. His shoulders are rounded because he went through a lot.

3011
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:34,551
(Go Dong Hoon: From Under to 2nd, ranked 21st)

3012
02:05:34,552 --> 02:05:35,852
He's ranked 21st.

3013
02:05:36,182 --> 02:05:37,450
I'm thankful.

3014
02:05:37,451 --> 02:05:38,481
(He's just happy.)

3015
02:05:39,252 --> 02:05:40,552
(Next is Choi Ho Jong in First Class.)

3016
02:05:40,792 --> 02:05:43,462
- I'm not curious. - I just want to know his score.

3017
02:05:43,561 --> 02:05:44,591
(Choi Ho Jong maintains his position in First Class.)

3018
02:05:44,592 --> 02:05:45,892
The total score is 6,000 points.

3019
02:05:46,392 --> 02:05:47,991
It's like a prestigious university student's report card.

3020
02:05:48,462 --> 02:05:49,762
It's the perfect score of 6,000 points.

3021
02:05:50,302 --> 02:05:54,031
I think I'm ready to move up in First Class.

3022
02:05:54,132 --> 02:05:56,541
I think there's a next level...

3023
02:05:56,542 --> 02:05:59,301
I can handle and be responsible for.

3024
02:05:59,302 --> 02:06:02,012
I want to be at the top of the pyramid.

3025
02:06:04,142 --> 02:06:06,351
Hye Hyun.

3026
02:06:06,352 --> 02:06:07,711
- Finally. - Let's go!

3027
02:06:07,712 --> 02:06:08,752
Will he be in First Class?

3028
02:06:09,281 --> 02:06:10,481
I hope he comes back.

3029
02:06:10,682 --> 02:06:11,682
(He's serious.)

3030
02:06:11,781 --> 02:06:12,852
I'll see you again.

3031
02:06:14,092 --> 02:06:15,450
I'll see you again.

3032
02:06:15,451 --> 02:06:16,461
(He even takes a hanger and leaves the locker room.)

3033
02:06:16,462 --> 02:06:17,462
(Hanging)

3034
02:06:18,621 --> 02:06:19,631
Next is Jun Woo.

3035
02:06:19,632 --> 02:06:20,660
(Next is Park Jun Woo in Second Class.)

3036
02:06:20,661 --> 02:06:22,901
(Let's go!)

3037
02:06:23,401 --> 02:06:25,530
Why was he trying to charm me?

3038
02:06:25,531 --> 02:06:28,832
Did Jun Woo take arginine? He's suddenly excited.

3039
02:06:29,201 --> 02:06:30,270
Maybe.

3040
02:06:30,271 --> 02:06:31,901
There are 4th, 5th, and 7th places left.

3041
02:06:32,542 --> 02:06:35,642
He received 1,000 points as a team benefit and a role benefit, right?

3042
02:06:35,811 --> 02:06:37,082
- Yes. - I see.

3043
02:06:37,712 --> 02:06:41,082
Team B led by Kim Jong Cheol has won.

3044
02:06:41,451 --> 02:06:44,450
Kim Hye Hyun will receive the benefit points.

3045
02:06:44,451 --> 02:06:46,051
(Kim Hye Hyun received 1,000 points as the main role benefit.)

3046
02:06:46,052 --> 02:06:47,191
(Team benefit: 500 points, role benefit: 500 points)

3047
02:06:47,592 --> 02:06:48,722
He did really well.

3048
02:06:49,491 --> 02:06:50,491
I think...

3049
02:06:51,292 --> 02:06:52,722
Jun Woo might move up.

3050
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:56,031
His video had many views. You don't know.

3051
02:06:56,462 --> 02:06:59,332
(Kim Hye Hyun and Park Jun Woo enter the Class Confirmation Zone.)

3052
02:07:00,401 --> 02:07:03,701
(What are the results for the 2 dancers in 2nd Class?)

3053
02:07:04,342 --> 02:07:05,342
(Opening)

3054
02:07:05,343 --> 02:07:08,642
(The door opens, and someone is going up the promotion stairs.)

3055
02:07:09,042 --> 02:07:10,641
(They sensed an unusual energy.)

3056
02:07:10,642 --> 02:07:11,682
Someone is here.

3057
02:07:11,882 --> 02:07:12,951
It's a little...

3058
02:07:13,352 --> 02:07:14,381
Jun Woo?

3059
02:07:14,382 --> 02:07:15,682
(Who is the dancer promoted to First Class?)

3060
02:07:16,552 --> 02:07:18,182
Jun Woo?

3061
02:07:18,552 --> 02:07:19,621
Hello.

3062
02:07:22,651 --> 02:07:23,690
(Showing off he's in First Class)

3063
02:07:23,691 --> 02:07:25,161
(Kim Hye Hyun is promoted from 2nd Class to 1st Class.)

3064
02:07:25,422 --> 02:07:26,691
I'm promoted to First Class.

3065
02:07:27,962 --> 02:07:29,861
It was hard to be in First Class.

3066
02:07:29,962 --> 02:07:32,301
I think it's a chance...

3067
02:07:32,302 --> 02:07:34,502
to show more things.

3068
02:07:34,602 --> 02:07:36,771
I'll make the most of this opportunity.

3069
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:39,611
How do you feel about coming here?

3070
02:07:40,241 --> 02:07:42,211
(Looking around)

3071
02:07:42,212 --> 02:07:43,240
There aren't many people.

3072
02:07:43,241 --> 02:07:44,342
(Laughing)

3073
02:07:45,182 --> 02:07:46,911
(Why is he so cute?)

3074
02:07:48,212 --> 02:07:49,752
He placed seventh.

3075
02:07:49,981 --> 02:07:50,981
I'm the lowest rank here.

3076
02:07:50,982 --> 02:07:52,381
(I'm the lowest rank in First Class.)

3077
02:07:52,382 --> 02:07:53,651
(Congratulations)

3078
02:07:55,892 --> 02:07:57,821
(Park Jun Woo maintains his position in Second Class.)

3079
02:07:58,161 --> 02:07:59,361
I was always in Second Class.

3080
02:08:00,792 --> 02:08:01,861
I'm in Second Class again.

3081
02:08:03,031 --> 02:08:04,561
- He placed 18th. - He placed 18th?

3082
02:08:05,102 --> 02:08:08,701
The score is lower than I thought. It's unexpected.

3083
02:08:09,642 --> 02:08:11,101
(Next is Kim Jong Cheol in First Class.)

3084
02:08:11,102 --> 02:08:12,172
My gosh.

3085
02:08:12,571 --> 02:08:14,041
Let's do the ritual.

3086
02:08:14,042 --> 02:08:15,042
(I'm scared.)

3087
02:08:15,212 --> 02:08:16,280
Is there a ritual?

3088
02:08:16,281 --> 02:08:18,981
We give someone a hug before he leaves.

3089
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:21,712
It's so cute.

3090
02:08:22,411 --> 02:08:23,451
I hope you survive.

3091
02:08:24,752 --> 02:08:26,851
- He'll stay in First Class. - Yes.

3092
02:08:26,852 --> 02:08:28,821
- Did he receive a team benefit? - Yes, he did.

3093
02:08:29,191 --> 02:08:31,791
But he didn't receive a main role benefit.

3094
02:08:31,792 --> 02:08:34,092
So if you add 1,000 points to the individual points...

3095
02:08:34,691 --> 02:08:37,700
I think he'll still be in First Class.

3096
02:08:37,701 --> 02:08:38,701
He has a weighting factor of 1.5.

3097
02:08:40,071 --> 02:08:42,602
(Will Kim Jong Cheol stay in First Class?)

3098
02:08:43,102 --> 02:08:44,842
(Kim Jong Cheol maintains his position in First Class.)

3099
02:08:45,002 --> 02:08:46,842
Team "Oldboy" B, we got this.

3100
02:08:48,071 --> 02:08:49,142
Hye Hyun, you got this.

3101
02:08:50,781 --> 02:08:54,582
(He's back.)

3102
02:08:54,911 --> 02:08:57,382
You worked hard. You've been through a lot emotionally.

3103
02:08:58,451 --> 02:08:59,991
Let's see if he placed 4th or 5th.

3104
02:09:01,292 --> 02:09:03,392
- He placed 5th. - He placed 5th.

3105
02:09:04,361 --> 02:09:05,892
There's one spot left in First Class.

3106
02:09:06,632 --> 02:09:08,531
Fourth place is left.

3107
02:09:09,462 --> 02:09:11,700
- Three people are left now. - Moo Gan,

3108
02:09:11,701 --> 02:09:14,472
Sung Wook, and Kyu Nyeon are waiting for their results.

3109
02:09:14,972 --> 02:09:16,701
One of them will be in First Class.

3110
02:09:18,102 --> 02:09:19,910
(Next is Jung Sung Wook in First Class.)

3111
02:09:19,911 --> 02:09:20,911
Finally.

3112
02:09:21,712 --> 02:09:23,512
(Hugging)

3113
02:09:23,611 --> 02:09:25,042
Let go of me. I should go right now.

3114
02:09:26,611 --> 02:09:27,881
(Ki Moo Gan in Second Class is called next.)

3115
02:09:27,882 --> 02:09:29,512
Why did they call him suddenly? I guess it's simultaneous.

3116
02:09:31,082 --> 02:09:32,881
(Lastly, Kim Kyu Nyeon in Second Class sets off.)

3117
02:09:32,882 --> 02:09:34,451
- Go. - Oh, my gosh.

3118
02:09:35,752 --> 02:09:36,892
See you later.

3119
02:09:39,021 --> 02:09:41,892
I thought I might go down to Under Class.

3120
02:09:42,531 --> 02:09:43,560
(Team A: 2,821 seats, Team B: 516 seats)

3121
02:09:43,561 --> 02:09:46,632
Team A led by Choi Ho Jong has won.

3122
02:09:46,832 --> 02:09:48,171
It's Dancer Choi Ho Jong.

3123
02:09:48,172 --> 02:09:49,771
(Kim Kyu Nyeon didn't even receive a main role benefit.)

3124
02:09:50,271 --> 02:09:51,302
I'm in the lowest position.

3125
02:09:52,241 --> 02:09:54,042
I think I'll go down, Jun Woo.

3126
02:09:54,911 --> 02:09:57,582
I think I'll be in Under Class. I think I'll go down.

3127
02:09:58,642 --> 02:10:01,811
When I imagine I'll be in Under Class as the main lead,

3128
02:10:02,752 --> 02:10:05,320
I feel like I'm spiraling downwards, sinking deeper into a slump,

3129
02:10:05,321 --> 02:10:06,691
and heading toward an even lower point.

3130
02:10:06,922 --> 02:10:09,451
"What should I do to deal with it?" That's what I thought.

3131
02:10:11,491 --> 02:10:14,231
- Is Kyu Nyeon the last one? - He'll stay in Second Class.

3132
02:10:16,262 --> 02:10:20,771
(He heads toward the Second Class Locker Room.)

3133
02:10:21,031 --> 02:10:22,632
(A big smile)

3134
02:10:22,901 --> 02:10:25,102
Kyu Nyeon, you look happier.

3135
02:10:25,741 --> 02:10:27,871
- You're relieved, right? - You worked hard.

3136
02:10:28,441 --> 02:10:29,512
It's at an angle.

3137
02:10:29,811 --> 02:10:32,440
I was so happy.

3138
02:10:32,441 --> 02:10:34,682
I pretended to shoot a gun like Sang Gil.

3139
02:10:35,052 --> 02:10:36,311
That's how nervous I was.

3140
02:10:37,151 --> 02:10:40,221
Now, I have a more desperate goal...

3141
02:10:40,222 --> 02:10:41,422
to be in First Class.

3142
02:10:41,821 --> 02:10:42,892
He placed 19th.

3143
02:10:44,462 --> 02:10:47,961
(Now, Jung Sung Wook and Ki Moo Gan are left.)

3144
02:10:47,962 --> 02:10:49,901
Fourth place is still left.

3145
02:10:50,302 --> 02:10:51,832
- It's not set yet? - Not yet.

3146
02:10:52,262 --> 02:10:54,832
But Moo Gan has still a dominant place with his score of 1,500.

3147
02:10:55,972 --> 02:10:58,441
(As he performed well in the main supporting role in Team "Oldboy" B, )

3148
02:11:00,172 --> 02:11:03,481
(he received both team scores and main role benefits.)

3149
02:11:03,741 --> 02:11:05,512
Jung Sung Wook's score is 300.

3150
02:11:05,712 --> 02:11:07,512
TC The group dancer role was not beneficial to him.

3151
02:11:08,852 --> 02:11:12,052
(Despite being First Class, he took the group dance in Team "Oldboy,")

3152
02:11:14,092 --> 02:11:16,051
(and got a score of 300 without any chance of being evaluated.)

3153
02:11:16,052 --> 02:11:17,892
(Group Dancer Jung Sung Wook's score: 300)

3154
02:11:18,661 --> 02:11:20,392
But he receives a weighting factor of 1.5 thanks to his class.

3155
02:11:20,531 --> 02:11:22,030
He'll also receive many likes.

3156
02:11:22,031 --> 02:11:24,262
- The hits are also good enough. - Yes.

3157
02:11:24,502 --> 02:11:25,962
I'm not sure how this will end.

3158
02:11:27,531 --> 02:11:29,031
I was pretty scared.

3159
02:11:29,802 --> 02:11:34,042
I think I may be eliminated from First.

3160
02:11:34,771 --> 02:11:37,110
I just pray that the failed one won't be me.

3161
02:11:37,111 --> 02:11:39,481
(What will be the destiny of Sung Wook who's in First now?)

3162
02:11:39,811 --> 02:11:43,251
I got cold feet after being eliminated.

3163
02:11:43,252 --> 02:11:45,682
"Let's go back to where I am." That's what I thought of.

3164
02:11:47,792 --> 02:11:51,191
(Promotion or demotion. That's the sole path waiting for them.)

3165
02:11:52,422 --> 02:11:55,791
(Who will be able to open the gate to First Class?)

3166
02:11:55,792 --> 02:11:58,761
(To be continued)

3167
02:11:58,762 --> 02:12:01,002
(Class Confirmation Zone)

3168
02:12:01,502 --> 02:12:03,301
(They're at the crossroads of promotion or demotion.)

3169
02:12:03,302 --> 02:12:06,941
(Who will be First?)

3170
02:12:07,512 --> 02:12:09,142
(The footstep is getting bigger.)

3171
02:12:09,542 --> 02:12:11,542
(Who will it be?)

3172
02:12:11,582 --> 02:12:12,881
Who is it?

3173
02:12:12,882 --> 02:12:14,052
(Grinning)

3174
02:12:14,212 --> 02:12:15,781
(Who's the last First Class dancer entering the room?)

3175
02:12:17,281 --> 02:12:20,791
(Here comes Ki Moo Gan!)

3176
02:12:20,792 --> 02:12:21,922
You finally came!

3177
02:12:22,191 --> 02:12:23,360
(Welcome!)

3178
02:12:23,361 --> 02:12:25,821
This curved seat looks interesting.

3179
02:12:26,121 --> 02:12:27,561
Even that line shows who he is.

3180
02:12:28,991 --> 02:12:30,060
(As of now, this is my seat.)

3181
02:12:30,061 --> 02:12:31,601
(Ki Moo Gan)

3182
02:12:31,602 --> 02:12:33,061
I came here again.

3183
02:12:34,731 --> 02:12:37,871
(Dancer Ki Moo Gan is promoted to First from Second.)

3184
02:12:38,102 --> 02:12:39,771
I had a mixed feeling.

3185
02:12:40,472 --> 02:12:43,741
Many kept their ways and did excellently.

3186
02:12:44,142 --> 02:12:46,440
Thanks to their efforts,

3187
02:12:46,441 --> 02:12:48,981
I could come back to this place again.

3188
02:12:49,111 --> 02:12:52,582
And as I came back, I felt the need to prove myself again.

3189
02:12:54,722 --> 02:12:56,561
This place is pretty suffocating.

3190
02:12:57,061 --> 02:12:58,461
Hye Hyun, how do you feel?

3191
02:12:58,462 --> 02:13:00,761
I think I got adjusted to it.

3192
02:13:00,762 --> 02:13:01,991
(I think I got adjusted to it.)

3193
02:13:02,092 --> 02:13:03,301
Your ears get rosy.

3194
02:13:03,302 --> 02:13:04,331
(His ears feel still shy.)

3195
02:13:04,332 --> 02:13:05,861
(And now, Moo Gan's score is revealed.)

3196
02:13:06,231 --> 02:13:07,332
(I see.)

3197
02:13:07,432 --> 02:13:10,201
His team score and benefit score...

3198
02:13:10,271 --> 02:13:12,240
played a major role.

3199
02:13:12,241 --> 02:13:13,571
(Total score: 5205, Rank: 4th)

3200
02:13:14,472 --> 02:13:16,311
(Jung Sung Wook enters the Second Class Locker Room.)

3201
02:13:16,712 --> 02:13:18,810
(An amazing appearance!)

3202
02:13:18,811 --> 02:13:21,211
- You ballet boy! - Hey!

3203
02:13:21,212 --> 02:13:22,381
I was eliminated.

3204
02:13:22,382 --> 02:13:23,851
You came next to me.

3205
02:13:23,852 --> 02:13:24,881
(Dancer Jung Sung Wook is demoted to Second from First.)

3206
02:13:24,882 --> 02:13:25,882
Here again.

3207
02:13:25,883 --> 02:13:29,961
Although I felt I'd be eliminated, I felt very complicated...

3208
02:13:29,962 --> 02:13:33,021
once I came down here. I'm not sure how to step up again.

3209
02:13:35,832 --> 02:13:37,231
You're ranked tenth.

3210
02:13:37,832 --> 02:13:39,360
But it's pretty high.

3211
02:13:39,361 --> 02:13:41,972
He did the group dance but ranked tenth.

3212
02:13:42,231 --> 02:13:44,172
If he were to take the main supporting role...

3213
02:13:45,241 --> 02:13:46,501
If there's another chance,

3214
02:13:46,502 --> 02:13:51,182
I'll prove myself to everyone again...

3215
02:13:51,842 --> 02:13:54,311
and take my place back.

3216
02:13:55,682 --> 02:13:57,221
(Stage Fighter 2nd Class View: First Class)

3217
02:13:57,222 --> 02:13:58,521
(1st: Choi Ho Jong)

3218
02:13:58,752 --> 02:14:00,721
(Stage Fighter 2nd Class View: Second Class)

3219
02:14:00,722 --> 02:14:01,950
(8th: Kim Young Woong)

3220
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:03,360
(Stage Fighter 2nd Class View: Under Class)

3221
02:14:03,361 --> 02:14:05,061
(23rd: Jung Hye Seong)

3222
02:14:05,321 --> 02:14:06,762
Gosh! What's this all about?

3223
02:14:07,132 --> 02:14:08,892
- What are these? - Are these gifts?

3224
02:14:09,661 --> 02:14:11,431
(Gifts given to First Class)

3225
02:14:11,432 --> 02:14:13,871
(Full denim-style clothing)

3226
02:14:13,972 --> 02:14:16,271
(Touched)

3227
02:14:16,302 --> 02:14:17,771
First Class is treated differently, for sure.

3228
02:14:17,842 --> 02:14:19,502
These are premium lines!

3229
02:14:19,571 --> 02:14:21,842
Are these the vintage collection line?

3230
02:14:22,012 --> 02:14:23,841
This is one of my favorite.

3231
02:14:23,842 --> 02:14:25,641
Shall we change now?

3232
02:14:25,642 --> 02:14:26,780
It sounds cool.

3233
02:14:26,781 --> 02:14:28,780
(Stage Fighter Model Show, Kim Hyun Ho appears first.)

3234
02:14:28,781 --> 02:14:29,852
(Very satisfied)

3235
02:14:30,082 --> 02:14:31,351
(Nice!)

3236
02:14:31,352 --> 02:14:32,881
Gosh!

3237
02:14:32,882 --> 02:14:35,051
If you roll up a bit, they look very fashionable.

3238
02:14:35,052 --> 02:14:37,121
Rolling up was a good idea.

3239
02:14:37,561 --> 02:14:38,661
You're like an actor!

3240
02:14:38,991 --> 02:14:40,360
(After him, Model Moo Gan shows up!)

3241
02:14:40,361 --> 02:14:41,560
(Charismatic eyes)

3242
02:14:41,561 --> 02:14:44,200
(Lastly, Ho Jong and Yu Chan show up after wearing all.)

3243
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:47,131
Do you see the details of this jacket?

3244
02:14:47,132 --> 02:14:48,501
Look at this tiny part.

3245
02:14:48,502 --> 02:14:50,801
- The cut line is well designed. - I see.

3246
02:14:50,802 --> 02:14:51,901
It gives you different vibes.

3247
02:14:52,042 --> 02:14:53,870
Hyun Ho's style would fit well...

3248
02:14:53,871 --> 02:14:55,472
on the stage, right?

3249
02:14:56,271 --> 02:14:58,410
- Five, six, seven, eight! - Five, six, seven, eight!

3250
02:14:58,411 --> 02:15:00,150
(Yes!)

3251
02:15:00,151 --> 02:15:02,511
(Expressing his pleasure with full body)

3252
02:15:02,512 --> 02:15:03,722
Look at this!

3253
02:15:05,781 --> 02:15:07,221
(Startled)

3254
02:15:07,222 --> 02:15:09,150
Stage Choice by Public Mission.

3255
02:15:09,151 --> 02:15:11,091
We reveal the result now.

3256
02:15:11,092 --> 02:15:12,861
Who'd take the main lead role?

3257
02:15:13,121 --> 02:15:14,392
We know the result now.

3258
02:15:14,531 --> 02:15:15,892
Oh, they will announce the result?

3259
02:15:16,432 --> 02:15:17,730
I feel a headache.

3260
02:15:17,731 --> 02:15:18,762
(What's the new mission that gave dancers a headache?)

3261
02:15:19,002 --> 02:15:20,601
(In the waiting room after the K-Contents Mission filming)

3262
02:15:20,602 --> 02:15:21,770
Here it comes!

3263
02:15:21,771 --> 02:15:23,131
- "Stage Choice?" - "Stage Choice?"

3264
02:15:23,132 --> 02:15:24,542
- "Public?" - "Public Mission?"

3265
02:15:24,871 --> 02:15:26,542
(Stage Choice by Public)

3266
02:15:26,811 --> 02:15:28,341
"By the choice of the public?"

3267
02:15:28,342 --> 02:15:30,582
"A Casting Audition will proceed?"

3268
02:15:30,781 --> 02:15:32,741
The public will choose who fits for each role.

3269
02:15:32,911 --> 02:15:34,610
"Fortunately, you are First."

3270
02:15:34,611 --> 02:15:35,851
The public will do this.

3271
02:15:35,852 --> 02:15:37,551
I'm scared more than being evaluated by judges.

3272
02:15:37,552 --> 02:15:38,722
(His mouth is dry.)

3273
02:15:39,052 --> 02:15:41,092
(The Casting Audition chosen by the public)

3274
02:15:41,352 --> 02:15:45,091
Hits and likes on dancers' choreography videos will decide...

3275
02:15:45,092 --> 02:15:47,462
who takes the main lead role in this mission.

3276
02:15:48,061 --> 02:15:50,501
"To the dancer selected as the main lead role,"

3277
02:15:50,502 --> 02:15:52,601
"the right to create a choreography..."

3278
02:15:52,602 --> 02:15:54,102
"and direct the work will be given."

3279
02:15:54,271 --> 02:15:56,172
Right to create a choreography and direct.

3280
02:15:56,302 --> 02:15:57,740
This is the greatest!

3281
02:15:57,741 --> 02:16:00,740
Especially the directing part.

3282
02:16:00,741 --> 02:16:03,811
The person would wield absolute power.

3283
02:16:03,941 --> 02:16:07,150
When would I be able to get a chance to direct ballot dancers...

3284
02:16:07,151 --> 02:16:10,582
and Korean dancers, especially these kinds of experts?

3285
02:16:10,781 --> 02:16:12,682
The topic itself was very fascinating.

3286
02:16:12,722 --> 02:16:14,451
Hyun Ho, you suddenly feel greedy?

3287
02:16:14,452 --> 02:16:15,452
(Yes, that's for sure.)

3288
02:16:15,453 --> 02:16:16,591
I really wanted to take the chance.

3289
02:16:16,592 --> 02:16:20,291
"It should be enjoyable to the public too."

3290
02:16:20,391 --> 02:16:22,191
This is all about who catches the eye of all.

3291
02:16:22,192 --> 02:16:23,900
Movements should catch the eyes of all,

3292
02:16:23,901 --> 02:16:25,361
which is the way to gain popularity.

3293
02:16:25,362 --> 02:16:27,532
But what kind of audition will it be?

3294
02:16:28,131 --> 02:16:29,331
(Stage Choice by Public)

3295
02:16:29,332 --> 02:16:30,501
(Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

3296
02:16:30,502 --> 02:16:31,671
(Qualification for application: All dancers)

3297
02:16:31,672 --> 02:16:33,371
"Qualification for application is for all dancers."

3298
02:16:33,372 --> 02:16:35,970
"Among the 4 keywords, choose 1..."

3299
02:16:35,971 --> 02:16:37,182
It's all group dance.

3300
02:16:37,942 --> 02:16:39,741
Apart from the main lead role, others will be...

3301
02:16:39,942 --> 02:16:41,581
It's either the main lead role or the group dance?

3302
02:16:41,582 --> 02:16:44,221
Everyone is equal before the public.

3303
02:16:44,422 --> 02:16:46,651
This will be torturous.

3304
02:16:46,922 --> 02:16:49,150
There's no supporting or something. It's the only main lead role.

3305
02:16:49,151 --> 02:16:50,861
"I should take the throne."

3306
02:16:50,862 --> 02:16:51,990
(Concept keywords:)

3307
02:16:51,991 --> 02:16:53,191
(Addiction, dash, salvation, nightmare)

3308
02:16:53,192 --> 02:16:55,391
"Addiction, dash, salvation, and nightmare."

3309
02:16:55,561 --> 02:16:57,401
I guess each keyword has its own music.

3310
02:16:57,602 --> 02:16:59,831
Then, there are four keywords.

3311
02:16:59,832 --> 02:17:01,702
It may be swamped with one keyword.

3312
02:17:02,202 --> 02:17:04,970
It's all about reading the mood.

3313
02:17:04,971 --> 02:17:07,371
It's just luck. If there's no one, he should dance alone.

3314
02:17:07,372 --> 02:17:08,872
I should choose very carefully.

3315
02:17:09,172 --> 02:17:10,841
(The first keyword: Addiction)

3316
02:17:10,842 --> 02:17:12,740
"It's in a state of uncontrollable."

3317
02:17:12,741 --> 02:17:14,451
Maybe I should express the mood of a screwball.

3318
02:17:14,452 --> 02:17:17,050
A perverse one?

3319
02:17:17,051 --> 02:17:18,221
I'm also curious.

3320
02:17:18,352 --> 02:17:21,320
(Keyword Addiction music play)

3321
02:17:21,321 --> 02:17:23,820
- The music itself is pretty cool. - I like it too.

3322
02:17:23,821 --> 02:17:25,791
(Addicted to the music)

3323
02:17:26,592 --> 02:17:27,762
It's rather funky.

3324
02:17:28,362 --> 02:17:29,631
Kyu Nyeon would do well with this.

3325
02:17:29,891 --> 02:17:31,701
"This mission would be very interesting."

3326
02:17:31,702 --> 02:17:33,872
"I can express very well about what perverse means."

3327
02:17:34,432 --> 02:17:37,640
The music sounded like a cool guy.

3328
02:17:37,641 --> 02:17:39,501
I should create something cool, accordingly.

3329
02:17:39,502 --> 02:17:41,041
Somebody handsome would be a perfect role.

3330
02:17:41,311 --> 02:17:43,342
- You think so? - It's about moving up.

3331
02:17:43,512 --> 02:17:45,011
"I'm craving for you!"

3332
02:17:45,012 --> 02:17:46,411
You makes it somewhat scary.

3333
02:17:46,481 --> 02:17:47,481
That's it.

3334
02:17:47,482 --> 02:17:49,111
If I take this, it would be a nightmare.

3335
02:17:49,112 --> 02:17:50,820
(His look summons a nightmare.)

3336
02:17:50,821 --> 02:17:52,050
I should choose something else.

3337
02:17:52,051 --> 02:17:53,051
(He's very objective in self-rating.)

3338
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:54,051
(The second keyword: Dash)

3339
02:17:54,051 --> 02:17:55,051
Oh, "dash?"

3340
02:17:55,052 --> 02:17:58,261
"This music expresses the will to move straight forward to be..."

3341
02:17:58,262 --> 02:18:00,832
"the main character that shines brighter than a supporting role."

3342
02:18:00,932 --> 02:18:02,362
It will be tough.

3343
02:18:02,932 --> 02:18:04,031
(That's correct.)

3344
02:18:04,032 --> 02:18:05,161
This one is pretty powerful.

3345
02:18:05,432 --> 02:18:07,001
It's way too hard.

3346
02:18:07,002 --> 02:18:08,471
The beats are split and divided all along.

3347
02:18:08,832 --> 02:18:11,442
Once we join this, there will be no time to take a breath.

3348
02:18:11,571 --> 02:18:13,872
- I can't do this. - I give up!

3349
02:18:14,512 --> 02:18:16,910
But if we choose a not popular one, it will increase...

3350
02:18:16,911 --> 02:18:18,040
the chance of being selected.

3351
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:19,640
It sounds tough,

3352
02:18:19,641 --> 02:18:21,682
but once well prepared, it will be fun.

3353
02:18:21,981 --> 02:18:23,781
(The third keyword: Salvation)

3354
02:18:23,782 --> 02:18:25,721
This would be very touching.

3355
02:18:27,092 --> 02:18:28,221
It's good!

3356
02:18:28,592 --> 02:18:31,390
It will be a perfect match for my dance.

3357
02:18:31,391 --> 02:18:33,061
(Being sentimentalized)

3358
02:18:33,291 --> 02:18:34,932
This is for contemporary dance.

3359
02:18:35,262 --> 02:18:37,331
- Modern ballet would be good too. - Right.

3360
02:18:37,332 --> 02:18:38,800
Most of us choose this.

3361
02:18:38,801 --> 02:18:41,831
- Many will prefer this. - I gues so.

3362
02:18:41,832 --> 02:18:44,040
I thought it would be way too popular.

3363
02:18:44,041 --> 02:18:46,101
"I shouldn't choose this one."

3364
02:18:46,102 --> 02:18:48,740
(The last keyword: Nightmare)

3365
02:18:48,741 --> 02:18:51,442
(Its unique beat attracts many.)

3366
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:52,942
It's hard again.

3367
02:18:53,282 --> 02:18:54,551
It's for Hye Seong!

3368
02:18:54,981 --> 02:18:56,781
(It'll be a match for Hye Seong who prefers unique choreography.)

3369
02:18:56,782 --> 02:18:58,081
- It's for you! - It's made for you!

3370
02:18:58,082 --> 02:19:00,921
I feel like Ho Jong will like this type too.

3371
02:19:00,922 --> 02:19:02,021
Yes, it would be a good match.

3372
02:19:02,022 --> 02:19:03,022
(That's it!)

3373
02:19:03,023 --> 02:19:04,192
Oh, I feel something.

3374
02:19:04,422 --> 02:19:06,560
I could try something new with it.

3375
02:19:06,561 --> 02:19:09,592
I could even create new choreography on the spot.

3376
02:19:09,791 --> 02:19:12,201
(Dancers should choose 1 among 4 keywords.)

3377
02:19:12,202 --> 02:19:14,272
(All dancers made their choice.)

3378
02:19:14,401 --> 02:19:16,501
(The audition video filming day)

3379
02:19:16,502 --> 02:19:18,901
(Before the video filming, tension filled the entire stage.)

3380
02:19:18,942 --> 02:19:21,240
(Each one prepares for the audition in his own way.)

3381
02:19:21,241 --> 02:19:23,342
(Warming up)

3382
02:19:23,411 --> 02:19:25,241
- Is it slate? - It's slate!

3383
02:19:25,682 --> 02:19:27,311
- What's it? - What's happening?

3384
02:19:27,411 --> 02:19:28,981
Are they going to play a rock-paper-scissors?

3385
02:19:29,881 --> 02:19:32,281
- What are you two? - What's wrong with you?

3386
02:19:32,282 --> 02:19:33,481
You two are seeing!

3387
02:19:33,752 --> 02:19:35,352
Other stuff is the same too!

3388
02:19:35,791 --> 02:19:37,861
- You two are dating! - Was this a love variety show?

3389
02:19:37,862 --> 02:19:40,890
You two have a concept to share?

3390
02:19:40,891 --> 02:19:42,032
We had...

3391
02:19:42,161 --> 02:19:44,400
the same items. That's why...

3392
02:19:44,401 --> 02:19:45,831
we decided to wear matching clothes.

3393
02:19:45,832 --> 02:19:47,101
- Are you in love? - Are you in love?

3394
02:19:47,102 --> 02:19:49,471
- The atmosphere is weird. - Goodness me.

3395
02:19:49,702 --> 02:19:50,801
It's cute.

3396
02:19:51,172 --> 02:19:53,571
- Should we get matching clothes? - Let's get matching clothes.

3397
02:19:53,641 --> 02:19:55,571
What's going on between them? It's suspicious.

3398
02:19:56,172 --> 02:19:57,782
So what? We're wearing matching clothes too.

3399
02:19:58,082 --> 02:19:59,911
(The office worker look is just like the boys' matching clothes.)

3400
02:20:00,481 --> 02:20:02,050
(The dancers should film a video within a limited time...)

3401
02:20:02,051 --> 02:20:04,150
(during the audition.)

3402
02:20:04,151 --> 02:20:05,980
(They will watch the others and exchange feedback.)

3403
02:20:05,981 --> 02:20:08,490
(You can watch the main lead audition videos...)

3404
02:20:08,491 --> 02:20:10,490
(for the Stage Choice by Public on THE CHOOM.)

3405
02:20:10,491 --> 02:20:12,790
(Which dancer will be chosen by the public and take the main lead role?)

3406
02:20:12,791 --> 02:20:14,731
- You worked hard. - You worked hard.

3407
02:20:15,061 --> 02:20:16,762
I want to remove my makeup quickly.

3408
02:20:17,762 --> 02:20:20,501
There's a cleansing oil and cleansing foam over there.

3409
02:20:20,502 --> 02:20:21,630
Can we use them?

3410
02:20:21,631 --> 02:20:22,730
These are really good.

3411
02:20:22,731 --> 02:20:24,640
- I think this is cleansing foam. - This is cleansing foam?

3412
02:20:24,641 --> 02:20:25,801
This one is a cleansing oil.

3413
02:20:26,002 --> 02:20:27,612
Let's remove our makeup in the restroom.

3414
02:20:28,911 --> 02:20:29,942
(They're ready.)

3415
02:20:30,481 --> 02:20:31,481
(Pumping)

3416
02:20:31,482 --> 02:20:32,841
Thank you.

3417
02:20:32,842 --> 02:20:34,082
It feels much better.

3418
02:20:34,612 --> 02:20:35,952
It removes makeup easily.

3419
02:20:36,112 --> 02:20:37,221
(Skincare step 2)

3420
02:20:37,752 --> 02:20:40,022
It's moist. My skin isn't dry at all.

3421
02:20:41,291 --> 02:20:42,422
(Peekaboo)

3422
02:20:42,692 --> 02:20:45,660
(Their skin is getting smoother.)

3423
02:20:45,661 --> 02:20:46,692
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, my.

3424
02:20:47,032 --> 02:20:48,362
Look how clean it has become.

3425
02:20:48,561 --> 02:20:50,401
I think the makeup is removed perfectly.

3426
02:20:50,561 --> 02:20:52,300
- Shall we go finish up? - Let's do that.

3427
02:20:52,301 --> 02:20:53,331
(Finishing up)

3428
02:20:53,332 --> 02:20:54,932
(Skincare step 3)

3429
02:20:55,272 --> 02:20:57,070
It smells really nice.

3430
02:20:57,071 --> 02:20:59,942
I don't need anything other than this.

3431
02:21:00,172 --> 02:21:01,612
Can I touch your skin?

3432
02:21:01,842 --> 02:21:03,211
- My skin? - Yes.

3433
02:21:03,811 --> 02:21:05,040
I thought you were three years old.

3434
02:21:05,041 --> 02:21:06,581
(Ho Jong's skin age is 3 years old.)

3435
02:21:06,582 --> 02:21:07,681
That's unbelievable.

3436
02:21:07,682 --> 02:21:09,480
It was such a long day.

3437
02:21:09,481 --> 02:21:11,221
This is a nice way to finish the day.

3438
02:21:11,452 --> 02:21:12,752
Can I take these?

3439
02:21:13,891 --> 02:21:16,022
- The results are out today. - The results are out today.

3440
02:21:16,422 --> 02:21:18,220
We couldn't see the number of likes.

3441
02:21:18,221 --> 02:21:20,631
I know. I'm so curious about it.

3442
02:21:20,832 --> 02:21:22,790
The main lead role was determined...

3443
02:21:22,791 --> 02:21:24,361
based on the combined score of the views and the likes...

3444
02:21:24,362 --> 02:21:26,231
of the dance video.

3445
02:21:26,631 --> 02:21:28,630
Stage Choice by Public.

3446
02:21:28,631 --> 02:21:30,001
Who is chosen by the public...

3447
02:21:30,002 --> 02:21:32,342
and cast for the main lead role?

3448
02:21:32,502 --> 02:21:34,411
I did want to take the main lead role.

3449
02:21:34,612 --> 02:21:36,471
I think the odds are 80 percent.

3450
02:21:36,942 --> 02:21:39,140
The views of their videos were much higher.

3451
02:21:39,141 --> 02:21:40,651
Especially the four people sitting next to me.

3452
02:21:40,782 --> 02:21:41,951
(The videos of these four had the highest views for each theme.)

3453
02:21:41,952 --> 02:21:43,682
The views were absolutely high.

3454
02:21:44,352 --> 02:21:48,122
I have some expectations, which makes me nervous.

3455
02:21:48,692 --> 02:21:50,421
Given the big difference in views,

3456
02:21:50,422 --> 02:21:53,191
I thought I was the most likely candidate.

3457
02:21:53,192 --> 02:21:55,490
It might be different from the views on YouTube.

3458
02:21:55,491 --> 02:21:57,702
The likes aren't always proportional to the views.

3459
02:21:58,032 --> 02:21:59,661
We might see an unexpected result.

3460
02:21:59,961 --> 02:22:01,931
I think it'll go as we expected.

3461
02:22:01,932 --> 02:22:03,501
(What's the result of the audition for the main lead role?)

3462
02:22:03,502 --> 02:22:05,872
These are the main lead role candidates for Salvation.

3463
02:22:06,702 --> 02:22:08,811
The competition will be fierce as there are many people.

3464
02:22:09,442 --> 02:22:10,910
(Gyeong Ho, Si Won, Yu Chan, Hyo Joon, and Jun Woo)

3465
02:22:10,911 --> 02:22:12,381
The competition is fierce.

3466
02:22:12,711 --> 02:22:14,211
Many of them are Korean dancers.

3467
02:22:14,682 --> 02:22:17,551
But the ballet dancers are too strong.

3468
02:22:18,221 --> 02:22:19,521
(Will the ballet dancers whose videos had the highest views...)

3469
02:22:19,522 --> 02:22:20,790
(take the main lead role for Salvation?)

3470
02:22:20,791 --> 02:22:23,091
(Main lead role candidates for Dash)

3471
02:22:23,092 --> 02:22:25,060
(Kyung Won, Tae Seok, Hyun Ho, Hye Hyun, and Tae Young)

3472
02:22:25,061 --> 02:22:26,390
- Hye Hyun. - Hye Hyun is...

3473
02:22:26,391 --> 02:22:28,061
- Hye Hyun is dominating. - Hye Hyun is...

3474
02:22:28,161 --> 02:22:29,591
(Main lead role candidates for Addiction)

3475
02:22:29,592 --> 02:22:31,031
(Moo Gan, Kyu Nyeon, Seung Wook, Jong Cheol, and June Hyuk)

3476
02:22:31,032 --> 02:22:32,731
Seung Wook is one of the candidates?

3477
02:22:33,561 --> 02:22:34,702
- Oh, my. - Oh, yes.

3478
02:22:34,932 --> 02:22:36,971
(It's an honor.)

3479
02:22:37,301 --> 02:22:39,171
For Nightmare, it's definitely...

3480
02:22:39,172 --> 02:22:40,442
Ho Jong did Ho Jong.

3481
02:22:40,672 --> 02:22:43,272
The man with a trending video.

3482
02:22:43,471 --> 02:22:45,611
- I'm barely in the top 3. - You're barely in the top 3?

3483
02:22:45,612 --> 02:22:47,182
It was very close.

3484
02:22:47,381 --> 02:22:50,721
But there's no point in having candidates for Nightmare.

3485
02:22:51,321 --> 02:22:53,221
The views of Ho Jong's video are too high.

3486
02:22:54,092 --> 02:22:55,150
Well, I...

3487
02:22:55,151 --> 02:22:56,192
(Jung Sung Wook's video hit 170,064 views.)

3488
02:22:56,692 --> 02:22:58,522
How can we beat the trending video?

3489
02:22:59,961 --> 02:23:02,762
This is the casting result for Nightmare, as chosen by the public.

3490
02:23:03,061 --> 02:23:04,460
Nightmare.

3491
02:23:04,461 --> 02:23:05,661
- It's going to be Ho Jong again. - It's going to be Ho Jong again.

3492
02:23:06,362 --> 02:23:07,502
- What? - What?

3493
02:23:08,301 --> 02:23:10,400
Dancer Jung Sung Wook is cast.

3494
02:23:10,401 --> 02:23:11,701
(Everyone is shocked.)

3495
02:23:11,702 --> 02:23:12,702
(Speechless)

3496
02:23:12,942 --> 02:23:14,272
He beat Ho Jong?

3497
02:23:14,571 --> 02:23:16,341
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3498
02:23:16,342 --> 02:23:17,441
(Let's go, Second Class.)

3499
02:23:17,442 --> 02:23:20,040
- Let's go! - Stand up and celebrate it.

3500
02:23:20,041 --> 02:23:22,410
Take a picture.

3501
02:23:22,411 --> 02:23:23,411
Oh, my gosh.

3502
02:23:23,412 --> 02:23:26,422
(The unexpected result excites them in the Second Class Locker Room.)

3503
02:23:26,981 --> 02:23:28,592
Why are they shouting so much?

3504
02:23:29,092 --> 02:23:32,790
Dancer Jung Sung Wook is cast for the main lead role.

3505
02:23:32,791 --> 02:23:34,862
- What? - What?

3506
02:23:35,192 --> 02:23:36,591
(Blinking slowly)

3507
02:23:36,592 --> 02:23:37,630
(What?)

3508
02:23:37,631 --> 02:23:38,832
I didn't take the main lead role?

3509
02:23:39,762 --> 02:23:41,001
(What?)

3510
02:23:41,002 --> 02:23:42,532
I think that's why they screamed.

3511
02:23:43,842 --> 02:23:45,771
Ho Jong's videos had much higher views.

3512
02:23:45,772 --> 02:23:49,111
There's no way people didn't click the like button.

3513
02:23:49,112 --> 02:23:50,210
(Broken)

3514
02:23:50,211 --> 02:23:51,941
I did think the result might change...

3515
02:23:51,942 --> 02:23:54,012
because of the likes.

3516
02:23:54,252 --> 02:23:56,311
What? Ho Jong didn't make it?

3517
02:23:56,752 --> 02:23:58,380
Has this move gone?

3518
02:23:58,381 --> 02:24:00,592
You should do this.

3519
02:24:00,891 --> 02:24:02,592
I choreographed Nightmare.

3520
02:24:03,092 --> 02:24:04,720
If they can't watch it,

3521
02:24:04,721 --> 02:24:06,021
it's their loss.

3522
02:24:06,022 --> 02:24:07,091
(The main lead role for Salvation is revealed.)

3523
02:24:07,092 --> 02:24:08,832
This is the casting result for Salvation.

3524
02:24:09,231 --> 02:24:10,461
I'm the most curious about this.

3525
02:24:10,661 --> 02:24:12,130
They're strong too.

3526
02:24:12,131 --> 02:24:13,871
Hyo Joon's choreography was really good.

3527
02:24:13,872 --> 02:24:15,731
- Jun Woo's was good too. - I liked it.

3528
02:24:16,002 --> 02:24:17,702
Gyeong Ho's video has the highest views for Salvation.

3529
02:24:17,942 --> 02:24:20,612
I think the result might change because of the likes again.

3530
02:24:20,711 --> 02:24:22,772
Yu Chan might take the main lead role for Salvation.

3531
02:24:22,942 --> 02:24:24,241
Beating Gyeong Ho?

3532
02:24:24,481 --> 02:24:26,641
He placed second in the Class Movement Ceremony.

3533
02:24:27,852 --> 02:24:29,751
(Yu Chan placed 2nd in the 2nd Class Movement Ceremony...)

3534
02:24:29,752 --> 02:24:32,021
(with high individual points.)

3535
02:24:32,022 --> 02:24:34,151
Actually, anyone could make it.

3536
02:24:34,291 --> 02:24:37,022
But I still hope it's me.

3537
02:24:37,522 --> 02:24:39,022
The main lead dancer of Salvation...

3538
02:24:39,762 --> 02:24:43,191
is Dancer Kim Yu Chan.

3539
02:24:43,192 --> 02:24:44,400
(There's an eerie silence in the First Class Locker Room.)

3540
02:24:44,401 --> 02:24:46,201
(Glancing)

3541
02:24:46,202 --> 02:24:48,032
I went to school and worked hard on the choreography.

3542
02:24:50,272 --> 02:24:51,602
I was very disappointed.

3543
02:24:52,301 --> 02:24:54,641
All the results are unexpected.

3544
02:24:55,641 --> 02:24:57,111
- It's Dash. - It must be Hye Hyun.

3545
02:24:57,112 --> 02:24:58,641
It's definitely going to be Hye Hyun.

3546
02:24:59,582 --> 02:25:01,310
(There was a big gap between the views of their videos.)

3547
02:25:01,311 --> 02:25:02,751
If it's not Hye Hyun...

3548
02:25:02,752 --> 02:25:04,281
It should be Hye Hyun.

3549
02:25:04,282 --> 02:25:05,922
The main lead dancer...

3550
02:25:06,452 --> 02:25:08,522
is Dancer Kim Hyun Ho.

3551
02:25:08,922 --> 02:25:11,161
(Deeply perplexed)

3552
02:25:11,762 --> 02:25:14,791
- What? - There must be something.

3553
02:25:15,061 --> 02:25:16,390
- Yes. - Hold on.

3554
02:25:16,391 --> 02:25:19,431
- They're all unexpected. - What the...

3555
02:25:19,432 --> 02:25:21,531
I think I'll have a cognitive dissonance.

3556
02:25:21,532 --> 02:25:23,070
How did Hyun Ho make it?

3557
02:25:23,071 --> 02:25:24,872
Why is it not Hye Hyun?

3558
02:25:25,272 --> 02:25:27,971
I didn't make it. It was perplexing.

3559
02:25:28,411 --> 02:25:29,571
Or...

3560
02:25:30,471 --> 02:25:32,782
is there a new mission?

3561
02:25:33,381 --> 02:25:35,411
This is the casting result for Addiction.

3562
02:25:35,582 --> 02:25:37,211
I'm really curious about Addiction.

3563
02:25:37,582 --> 02:25:39,282
- No way. - It will be Jong Cheol.

3564
02:25:39,881 --> 02:25:41,952
Kyu Nyeon's video has a lot of views.

3565
02:25:42,422 --> 02:25:43,991
Moo Gan's video has a lot more views.

3566
02:25:44,721 --> 02:25:47,061
Will the likes change the result?

3567
02:25:47,631 --> 02:25:50,231
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon is cast.

3568
02:25:51,832 --> 02:25:52,960
(This is wonderful!)

3569
02:25:52,961 --> 02:25:54,272
(Thrilled)

3570
02:25:55,272 --> 02:25:56,331
(They're congratulating him first, but they think it's weird somehow.)

3571
02:25:56,332 --> 02:25:58,741
I think there's something. I'm serious.

3572
02:25:59,272 --> 02:26:00,941
(It's still silent in the First Class Locker Room.)

3573
02:26:00,942 --> 02:26:01,971
This is strange.

3574
02:26:02,711 --> 02:26:04,311
Is there an extra mission?

3575
02:26:04,782 --> 02:26:06,282
I guess there are other criteria.

3576
02:26:07,311 --> 02:26:09,012
Or there's more than one main lead dancer.

3577
02:26:09,211 --> 02:26:10,881
They might cast several main lead dancers.

3578
02:26:11,051 --> 02:26:12,880
They said everyone except for the main lead dancer...

3579
02:26:12,881 --> 02:26:14,691
would be an ensemble.

3580
02:26:14,692 --> 02:26:16,752
But they didn't say there would be only one main lead dancer.

3581
02:26:17,151 --> 02:26:19,490
(Right then)

3582
02:26:19,491 --> 02:26:22,130
This is the casting result for Nightmare, as chosen by the public.

3583
02:26:22,131 --> 02:26:23,660
- What? - The casting result for Nightmare?

3584
02:26:23,661 --> 02:26:25,502
- It was announced earlier. - Didn't he say "choreography?"

3585
02:26:26,362 --> 02:26:27,502
What's going on?

3586
02:26:27,901 --> 02:26:29,130
(Main lead dancers for Nightmare: Jung Sung Wook, Choi Ho Jong)

3587
02:26:29,131 --> 02:26:31,502
Dancer Choi Ho Jong is cast.

3588
02:26:31,942 --> 02:26:33,400
- What? - There are two main lead dancers.

3589
02:26:33,401 --> 02:26:34,772
There are two main lead dancers?

3590
02:26:35,311 --> 02:26:36,811
(Secretly relieved)

3591
02:26:37,141 --> 02:26:39,311
- It's understandable then. - Then...

3592
02:26:39,512 --> 02:26:40,811
You took a picture.

3593
02:26:40,981 --> 02:26:43,112
We were like, "He caught the boss monster."

3594
02:26:43,481 --> 02:26:45,251
(Congratulating Sung Wook for taking the main lead role)

3595
02:26:45,252 --> 02:26:46,351
I caught the boss!

3596
02:26:46,352 --> 02:26:47,490
(I caught the boss!)

3597
02:26:47,491 --> 02:26:48,591
You caught the boss.

3598
02:26:48,592 --> 02:26:51,192
- You got too excited. - Please forget what you saw.

3599
02:26:51,961 --> 02:26:53,262
It feels like I lost somehow.

3600
02:26:53,961 --> 02:26:56,692
This is the casting result for Salvation, as chosen by the public.

3601
02:26:57,161 --> 02:26:59,061
(Main lead dancers for Salvation: Kim Yu Chan, Kang Gyeong Ho)

3602
02:26:59,561 --> 02:27:00,901
Both of them are ballet dancers.

3603
02:27:01,372 --> 02:27:02,671
If it's Gyeong Ho and Yu Chan,

3604
02:27:02,672 --> 02:27:04,241
- we'll have a dopamine rush. - Yes. It's going to be fun.

3605
02:27:04,471 --> 02:27:07,541
I'm half worried, half excited, and half happy.

3606
02:27:07,711 --> 02:27:09,342
Oh, there are three halves then.

3607
02:27:10,112 --> 02:27:11,640
(Main lead dancers for Dash: Kim Hyun Ho, Kim Hye Hyun)

3608
02:27:11,641 --> 02:27:13,140
(Main lead dancers for Dash: Kim Hyun Ho, Kim Hye Hyun)

3609
02:27:13,141 --> 02:27:14,481
It's a competition between the contemporary dancers.

3610
02:27:14,952 --> 02:27:16,281
I'm confident.

3611
02:27:16,282 --> 02:27:18,151
I'm so curious about Addiction.

3612
02:27:18,422 --> 02:27:19,851
(Main lead dancers for Addiction: Kim Kyu Nyeon, Ki Moo Gan)

3613
02:27:19,852 --> 02:27:21,220
(Main lead dancers for Addiction: Kim Kyu Nyeon, Ki Moo Gan)

3614
02:27:21,221 --> 02:27:22,421
Moo Gan's choreographies are good.

3615
02:27:22,422 --> 02:27:24,362
Kyu Nyeon only competes against strong opponents.

3616
02:27:24,622 --> 02:27:27,891
After beating Ho Jong, I have to compete against Moo Gan.

3617
02:27:28,391 --> 02:27:30,391
Everyone would've had to shave their heads if I had been cast.

3618
02:27:30,961 --> 02:27:32,701
(The casting result for the main lead roles)

3619
02:27:32,702 --> 02:27:34,171
(Salvation: Gyeong Ho, Yu Chan, Nightmare: Sung Wook, Ho Jong)

3620
02:27:34,172 --> 02:27:35,970
(Addiction: Moo Gan, Kyu Nyeon, Dash: Hyun Ho, Hye Hyun)

3621
02:27:35,971 --> 02:27:37,970
(The final result for Salvation)

3622
02:27:37,971 --> 02:27:39,941
(The final result for Addiction)

3623
02:27:39,942 --> 02:27:41,970
(The final result for Dash)

3624
02:27:41,971 --> 02:27:43,872
(The final result for Nightmare)

3625
02:27:44,282 --> 02:27:45,781
Mnet Stage Fighter.

3626
02:27:45,782 --> 02:27:47,651
The Stage Choice by Public Mission.

3627
02:27:47,811 --> 02:27:49,851
The dancers who are cast as the main lead dancers...

3628
02:27:49,852 --> 02:27:51,182
based on the public's choice...

3629
02:27:51,381 --> 02:27:53,320
will complete their respective performances...

3630
02:27:53,321 --> 02:27:54,790
with the given directing authority.

3631
02:27:54,791 --> 02:27:55,791
They'll compete...

3632
02:27:55,792 --> 02:27:58,021
through the Team Battle and the Role Evaluation.

3633
02:27:58,022 --> 02:28:00,060
Voting for the Stage Choice by Public Mission,

3634
02:28:00,061 --> 02:28:01,831
which determines the results of the third Class Movement Ceremony...

3635
02:28:01,832 --> 02:28:03,660
and the finalists...

3636
02:28:03,661 --> 02:28:06,501
will take place on THE CHOOM and Mnet Plus.

by watching the full video of the Stage Choice by Public Mission.

3645
02:28:24,952 --> 02:28:28,091
The Seat Class Evaluation will be conducted...

02:28:28,092 --> 02:28:29,922
through full videos of 8 performances with 4 themes.

3647

by booking the Seat Class of your choice.

3657
02:28:57,752 --> 02:29:01,091
(The dancers are sad to leave the STF Dance Company.)

3658
02:29:01,092 --> 02:29:04,522
It's sad, but this is the end of my journey in Stage Fighter.

3659
02:29:06,022 --> 02:29:07,121
I did my best.

3660
02:29:07,122 --> 02:29:08,491
(They're returning their nametags they've had since the beginning.)

3661
02:29:08,731 --> 02:29:11,201
Every day felt like a dream.

3662
02:29:11,202 --> 02:29:12,960
It was a difficult challenge,

3663
02:29:12,961 --> 02:29:16,231
but I'm happy about the great experience.

3664
02:29:16,702 --> 02:29:19,571
My life will change after Stage Fighter.

3665
02:29:19,942 --> 02:29:22,612
One thing is for sure. I won't regret it.

3666
02:29:23,041 --> 02:29:26,341
I could be people who love dance.

3667
02:29:26,342 --> 02:29:28,881
I was happy to dance with you guys.

3668
02:29:29,252 --> 02:29:31,150
I'll practice hard...

3669
02:29:31,151 --> 02:29:34,192
to be like the older dancers and return.

3670
02:29:34,352 --> 02:29:37,821
As I was eliminated, I'll be watching afar,

3671
02:29:38,022 --> 02:29:39,960
but I hope they show us great performances.

3672
02:29:39,961 --> 02:29:43,061
Please support the remaining dancers.

3673
02:29:43,192 --> 02:29:44,601
I'll become a better dancer...

3674
02:29:44,602 --> 02:29:47,060
and see you all on stage.

3675
02:29:47,061 --> 02:29:51,301
(24 dancers bid their farewells and left the STF Dance Company.)

3676
02:29:51,641 --> 02:29:55,512
(Goodbye, Stage Fighter.)

3677

(Final rankings of the eliminated dancers from the K-Contents Mission)
