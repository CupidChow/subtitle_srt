(A Casting Audition was held...)

3
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:21,117
(for the Mega Stage main lead role.)

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,527
(I should pick dancers I can surpass.)

5
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:24,787
(In the 1st Round, dancers chose...)

6
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:26,027
(sub lead roles to make them shine.)

7
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:27,397
(Look. He didn't dance like that earlier!)

8
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:30,226
(After intense strategic battles,)

9
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:31,266
(the 3 were cast as sub lead roles.)

10
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,366
(Kim Hyun Ho, Ryu Tae Young, Jung Sung Wook)

11
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,937
(The 2nd Round for the remaining 5 was interpretative choreography.)

12
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:37,538
(I had the confidence to become the main lead role.)

13
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,037
(His eyes are crazy!)

14
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,707
(Arming themselves with various techniques and expressions)

(Cheering)

16
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:44,707
(The performances shocked everyone.)

17
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,847
(Getting goosebumps)

18
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:47,176
(After the intense and tight matches,)

19
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:49,346
(the 3 were cast as the Mega Stage main lead roles.)

20
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:55,117
(How did their Mega Stage turn out?)

21
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:56,126
(STF Dance Company)

22
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:58,287
- Hi. - Hi.

23
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:00,858
This spot feels empty.

24
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,097
- You're right. - The main lead roles are missing.

25
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,896
Not being cast as the main supporting role...

26
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:08,138
made me furious.

27
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:09,637
(I'm more furious than you.)

28
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:12,277
In the last mission, I realized...

29
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,677
the sub roles have no special parts.

30
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,906
I can't be satisfied with a sub lead role.

31
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:17,907
(Agreeing)

32
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,317
Are there more missions?

33
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:22,787
I believe everyone has a role now.

34
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,816
(Mega Stage Mission Double Casting Audition)

35
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:25,918
It's up.

39
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:31,588
- What? - What?

40
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:33,296
What does "Double Casting Audition" mean?

41
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:35,926
If any of the three main lead roles get hurt,

42
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:37,896
that dancer takes his place.

43
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,667
Take me as an example.

44
00:01:39,668 --> 00:01:41,797
It's to prepare for any situation.

45
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:43,167
Double casting.

46
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,236
When the first cast suddenly can't make the performance,

47
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:48,837
a second cast is there to replace the role.

48
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:51,108
Injuries are very common.

49
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:53,276
(Casting Change Announcement)

50
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:56,747
Double casting is nothing out of the ordinary in dance companies.

51
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,516
(Double Casting Audition Notice)

52
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:00,116
(Qualification: All dancers aside from the main roles)

53
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:01,717
It's a double for the main lead role.

54
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,687
Does that mean there will be three more dancers...

55
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:05,926
along with the three main lead roles?

56
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:06,956
Yes.

57
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,457
Does the ensemble have double casting too?

58
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,728
Please.

59
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,366
Sub lead roles, sub supporting roles,

60
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,597
and ensemble, aside from the main roles.

61
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,167
(The ensemble is surprised.)

62
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,766
What? Doesn't that mean we can get the main lead role?

63
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,377
We've been given the chance to become the main lead role.

64
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:22,847
The Under Class can be cast as the lead role?

65
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,948
It's possible.

66
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,247
Can our status rise?

67
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,216
Even the Under Class can jump up status.

68
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:30,587
When one door closes, another one opens.

69
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,116
It's a great opportunity.

70
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:33,788
I'm fired up.

71
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,388
- Take this off right now. - For real?

72
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,587
It's an opportunity for us.

73
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,957
It's my chance to prove myself.

74
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:43,366
What will the fixed choreography be?

75
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,267
Is the fixed choreography the one from yesterday?

76
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:47,396
(This one?)

77
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:48,736
(Revealing the double casting fixed choreography)

78
00:02:48,737 --> 00:02:49,938
Here it is.

79
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,408
Okay.

80
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:52,908
My heart is pounding.

81
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,508
(The choreography starts with a ballet move.)

82
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,777
It looks like a swan.

83
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,478
The moves are very contemporary.

84
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:03,487
(Adding Korean dance)

85
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,617
This is Korean dance.

86
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,557
It doesn't look that hard.

87
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:09,258
There are many arm movements.

88
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,188
(The arm moves are the highlight.)

89
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:16,366
(An impressive ending)

90
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,197
(Everyone tries the ending pose.)

91
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,697
It's a mix of the three genres.

92
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:20,866
It's quite contemporary.

93
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,408
There was one hand move.

94
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,568
The choreography screams contemporary ballet.

95
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,538
The first part is ballet.

96
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:31,177
I can express myself as a ballerino well.

97
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,948
Honestly, I'm confident.

98
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,086
The majority of the moves focused on the upper body.

99
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,617
I simply need to show what I'm good at.

100
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:41,417
The choreography requires basic skills.

101
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:44,688
The moves will be tough if not prepared in advance.

102
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:46,857
Everyone must be determined.

103
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:49,597
The Second Class will most likely be the most determined.

104
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:51,527
- For sure. - They're only a class difference.

105
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,037
(Taking off his cast)

106
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:54,138
Tae Seok?

107
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:55,806
I'm applying to it.

108
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:58,667
I can't let the sub lead roles that take as well.

109
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,777
We should beat the First Class.

110
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,147
This is an opportunity for me.

111
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,346
I will get a good role.

112
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:07,846
I'm pumped up.

113
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,188
I will give it my 100 percent. Even 200 percent.

114
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,917
The Under Class will go all out.

115
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,586
They'll take it as their last chance...

116
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,057
and fight to the death for it.

117
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:16,657
- I'll give it my everything. - Yes.

118
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:18,558
It's now or never to climb up the class.

119
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:21,097
It'll be amazing if any of the ensemble dancers get it.

120
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,497
But the mighty dancers are in the First Class.

121
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,068
Getting up here won't be easy.

122
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,667
We'll stop them.

123
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:30,237
Let's show them how much better we are.

124
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:31,466
(Yes.)

125
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,378
I'm burning with passion again.

126
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,178
I want it to start this instant.

127
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:39,747
(Meanwhile, the 3 main lead roles...)

128
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:42,448
(don't know about the situation.)

129
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,188
What's going on?

130
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:46,758
What are we doing? Why were we gathered here?

131
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:49,758
Maybe we'll be shown something.

132
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,988
(Double Casting Audition Notice)

133
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,328
- What? - What does that mean?

134
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,727
"Double casting?"

135
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,498
We can lose our main lead roles.

136
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,967
It was hard to get this role. But to give it away so easily?

137
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:02,266
I hated even the slightest possibility...

138
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,238
that I might lose my role.

139
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,807
I shouldn't feel relieved to be the main lead role.

140
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,577
Someone will be after my role.

141
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:09,847
No. Come at me.

142
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:11,807
As a competition in good faith,

143
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:14,248
it's a great system.

144
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,048
Can we be replaced?

145
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:20,357
But it's hard to imagine that someone will take my role.

146
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,227
I'm actually quite confident.

147
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:24,888
I must apologize for saying this,

148
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,428
but it wasn't threatening.

149
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:29,568
Take a shot.

150
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:33,266
Whoever competes for my role, I'll protect it.

151
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,097
I'm determined.

152
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:37,207
It's a war.

153
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,337
(Each class starts practicing.)

154
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,137
(First and Second Classes practice...)

155
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:42,406
(for the audition in the same room.)

156
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:46,248
The First Class is more of a nervous wreck.

157
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,987
Second Class and Under Class...

158
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,948
seemed very prepared.

159
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:54,786
The other classes got the chance...

160
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,187
only the First Class could normally get.

161
00:05:57,188 --> 00:06:01,857
There can be a dancer who suddenly exceeds the First Class dancers.

162
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,367
(The First Class...)

163
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:04,766
(watches the Second Class practice.)

164
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,138
I analyzed the dancers.

165
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,267
I get they're very energetic.

166
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:12,007
But if I calmly execute the choreography,

167
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:13,438
I can beat them all.

168
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,948
I can't back down now.

169
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:18,776
I didn't get the main lead role for the Dance Film.

170
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,448
Nor did I get it for the Mega Stage.

171
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,847
If I can't even get the double casting,

172
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,688
I'll stop thinking of myself as First Class.

173
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:30,357
I needed to be cast as the double.

174
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,957
I'm in First Class. Let's prove it to them.

175
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:36,767
I'm most confident in Hyo Joon's role.

176
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,997
I'm well aware that Jong Cheol is a great dancer.

177
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,368
He is my competition.

178
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:45,037
It was hard to get this role. But to give it away so easily?

179
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,178
- It's my role. - Right?

180
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,977
There could be a line of dancers behind you.

181
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:54,217
If Hyeok Jung goes for my role, I'll have to keep him in check.

182
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:56,547
Hyeok Jung got the sub lead role.

183
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,688
He'd want to make up for it.

184
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,618
It's an opportunity from the deity.

185
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:03,787
I can kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

186
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:05,927
I can go after the main lead role.

187
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:08,558
It is my chance to prove myself.

188
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:10,368
To compete against me,

189
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:13,637
the ballet dancers are...

190
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:14,738
They're after your role.

191
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:18,407
I feel betrayed, thinking they're determined to take my role.

192
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:22,808
Yu Chan got the main lead role.

193
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:25,077
Someone younger made a remarkable accomplishment.

194
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,118
As the older one, I can't lose to him.

195
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:31,087
(The Double Casting Audition is a matter of their goal and pride.)

196
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,087
Can you think of...

197
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,857
a contemporary Under Class dancer who will ace it?

198
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:37,587
Dong Hoon.

199
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,888
Go Dong Hoon?

200
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:40,998
He's motivated to climb up from Under Class.

201
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:43,827
It's a generous audition if even...

202
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:46,497
the Under Class gets an opportunity. Don't you agree?

203
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:48,597
They suddenly become the lead role from Under Class.

204
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:51,238
I also had such an experience.

205
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,836
I was in the ensemble but was cast as a double...

206
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:56,976
and got many chances as a soloist.

207
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,207
The ensemble dancers must be going all out.

208
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,476
They'll dance like crazy.

209
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,417
(Under Class Practice Room 1)

210
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:05,247
(The room is filled with heavy breathing.)

211
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:07,287
(The two ensemble leaders are practicing hard.)

212
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,927
With the need to focus on myself,

213
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,558
I locked myself in my very own room.

214
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:18,126
Despite his strong characteristics,

215
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:19,836
Go Dong Hoon needed to blend in with the ensemble.

216
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,397
So he had killed his color.

217
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,837
He'll do everything to seize the opportunity.

218
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,007
Dong Hoon must be filled with spirit.

219
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:29,307
I let go of my colors during the group dance.

220
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,747
But this is a solo audition.

221
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:33,617
It's my chance to prove...

222
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:35,377
who I am.

223
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,417
Treating me like an Under Class...

224
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,117
hurt my pride.

225
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,257
My plan is to make up for it.

226
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,688
It's my chance. Let's do this.

227
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,997
Dong Hoon would've made more jokes and stuff.

228
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:50,068
But he was really in his zone today.

229
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:51,767
(What's going on, Leader?)

230
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,037
(To the worried fellow dancer,)

231
00:08:53,038 --> 00:08:56,636
(Dong Hoon smiles and goes back to practice.)

232
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,337
Let's focus. That's the most important.

233
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,807
(The other dancers are as motivated as him.)

234
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,877
I became dead serious.

235
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:06,716
Simply because I'm in Under Class, I've been forgotten.

236
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:09,887
It's time to show myself and remind the judges of the Under Class.

237
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:12,788
I was only after the main lead role.

238
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:14,288
I'll dance like I did in the Class Battle.

239
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:16,428
I had my own strategy.

240
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:18,986
To stand out among the crowd,

241
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:20,828
I had to use my energy.

242
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,997
We need to bend to stand out in contemporary dance.

243
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,898
Our stamina came first.

244
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,367
It's a battle of stamina. I shouldn't go all out.

245
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,737
It's no use if you get hurt.

246
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,977
I kept warming up during the breaks.

247
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:36,048
(Park Jin Ho took great care of his condition.)

248
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:37,908
Let's pour my everything onstage.

249
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:41,818
(Under Class Practice Room 1 is filled with quiet determination.)

250
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:46,018
An Under Class dancer could even jump status with the audition.

251
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,818
Anyone would be desperate.

252
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:49,558
I was really desperate. But...

253
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:52,126
(Studying)

254
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,657
There were moves I wasn't familiar with, which worried me.

255
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,466
(When the choreography was revealed)

256
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:00,798
It's a mix of ballet, contemporary dance, and Korean dance.

257
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:03,366
There were moves from different genres.

258
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,568
To execute the moves flawlessly,

259
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,837
I needed a strategy. It's called a Ditto strategy.

260
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:10,177
(Scanning)

261
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:11,247
I'll just copy them.

262
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,246
There are ballerinos...

263
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,277
and Korean dancers.

264
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:16,448
There's no reason I can't ask them.

265
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,716
- Hey. I have a question. - Okay.

266
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:19,857
After the passe jump,

267
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,356
where do my feet go?

268
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,886
- You have to straighten your leg. - I do?

269
00:10:23,887 --> 00:10:25,527
Your weight is on the back leg.

270
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:28,057
- If you have any questions... - Okay, I'll ask later.

271
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,158
Okay. Thank you.

272
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:31,328
Come in and contract.

273
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:33,236
Gather and spread.

274
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:35,866
(Kim Do Hyun watches the two dancers.)

275
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:36,938
Like this.

276
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:38,807
Yes, but your fingers...

277
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,107
- I'm sorry, but... - Yes?

278
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:43,077
- This is how I dance. - Can I ask about ballet?

279
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:44,078
- Of course. - One.

280
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,678
This is so contemporary. Right?

281
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:49,887
Everyone copied the moves really well.

282
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,687
All the dancers had the same spirit.

283
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,716
Let's gather useful information,

284
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,857
grow, and advance.

285
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,357
(The ensemble quickly got the choreography down.)

286
00:10:58,688 --> 00:10:59,997
Kyu Tae is amazing.

287
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,967
I was not going to miss this chance.

288
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:04,727
Give me a tip, and I'll give you one too.

289
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,297
(Choi Kyu Tae learned aggressively...)

290
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:10,136
(and kept practicing during practice hours.)

291
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,938
I want to dance well...

292
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,278
and get cast in 1 of the 3 roles.

293
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,677
It could be my last opportunity.

294
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,408
That thought didn't leave my head.

295
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,578
I poured my everything into it.

296
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:27,658
(Who are the winners among the 55 dancers to get the 3 roles?)

297
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,486
(They have gathered for the Main Lead Role Double Casting Audition.)

298
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,456
(Matthew, Choi Soo Jin, Han Seong Woo, Jung Bo Kyung)

299
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:37,327
Today is the Double Casting Audition...

300
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:40,898
for Stage Fighter's Mega Stage Mission's three main lead roles.

301
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:43,908
As all the dancers here may already know,

302
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:47,678
double casting is necessary in any ballet and dance company.

303
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:50,346
As for double casting...

304
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:53,647
When the lead dancer gets hurt...

305
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,277
Or if something urgent comes up,

306
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:57,746
we always need someone prepared...

307
00:11:57,747 --> 00:12:00,116
to replace that very dancer.

308
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:03,557
It's to select a dancer who has the choreography memorized...

309
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,726
to use whenever possible.

310
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:07,757
It's a candidate. It's backup candidate number one.

311
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,297
To ensure the quality...

312
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:11,866
of Stage Fighter's performance,

313
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:14,467
we will proceed with a double casting audition.

314
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,736
The dancers selected as the three main lead roles' doubles...

315
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,907
will also get the chance to replace...

316
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,578
the main lead role dancers.

317
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:24,307
The choreographer can decide...

318
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:27,447
whether to replace the main lead role dancer...

319
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:29,477
with the double-cast dancer.

320
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,147
I don't think there are any dancers...

321
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:33,457
who can replace me.

322
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,456
There's more.

323
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:37,856
The three dancers selected as the double casts...

324
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,126
can perform the main lead roles like the main lead role dancers...

325
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,996
in the fixed section.

326
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:44,927
The three doubles...

327
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:48,538
will also get the same benefit of selecting the main roles...

328
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:51,437
in the next mission,

329
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,438
just like the main lead role dancers.

330
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:56,246
If I get cast,

331
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:58,547
I will get the benefit.

332
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:00,818
I had to become a double cast.

333
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:03,086
Let me explain...

334
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:05,117
how the Double Casting Audition will proceed.

335
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,956
The dancers will be split into three groups...

336
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:10,487
and have two auditions in total.

337
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:12,856
The first round is a fixed choreography audition.

338
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:16,467
The dancers in one group will dance together.

339
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:18,798
The coaches will evaluate as the dancers perform...

340
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,336
and touch the dancers in person.

341
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,767
The touched dancers...

342
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:26,006
are cut out from the casting audition.

343
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:28,908
They must stop dancing and leave at once.

344
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,078
Is it a touch-out?

345
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,948
This is incredibly cruel.

346
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:36,448
Once only the dancers with the possibility of being cast are left,

347
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:38,887
the first round of auditions ends.

348
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:43,027
After the 1st round is completed by the 3 groups,

349
00:13:43,028 --> 00:13:44,356
the remaining dancers...

350
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,827
will move on to the second round,

351
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:47,457
the Formation and Choreography Audition.

352
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:49,456
The dancers will receive...

353
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:52,767
the fixed choreography with a formation on the spot.

354
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:55,836
They will have another round of auditions with that choreography.

355
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:56,907
(Sighing)

356
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:58,038
This is nuts.

357
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,877
It won't be an easy audition.

358
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:02,737
Go Dong Hoon from the ensemble.

359
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:05,746
Which of the three main lead roles...

360
00:14:05,747 --> 00:14:08,418
do you think you’d be best at performing?

361
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,787
I want to be cast as the one opposing death,

362
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:13,217
Kim Hyo Joon's role.

363
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:15,818
I believe he's more than capable.

364
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:17,157
But...

365
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:18,158
(But...)

366
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:22,126
it's too bad that I have the main lead role.

367
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,996
(Receiving a heavy blow)

368
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,298
(Relaxed)

369
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:27,596
I will not let anyone take it.

370
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:30,438
Whoever comes at me, I won't let them take it from me.

371
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:31,568
They are all fighters.

372
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:34,808
Sub supporting role, Kim Si Won.

373
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,246
Is there a role out of...

374
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:39,778
the three main lead roles you think belongs to you?

375
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:42,346
I want to be double-cast...

376
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,116
for Kim Yu Chan's role.

377
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,918
(Thinking)

378
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,188
I'm guessing...

379
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:50,558
the dancers don't know who I am.

380
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,127
(His words stir up the room.)

381
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:56,097
I'm always up for the challenge.

382
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,367
He's scary.

383
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,466
Everyone is qualified to take this role.

384
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,667
But because you didn't prove yourselves well,

385
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:05,937
you're in your positions.

386
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,007
(That hurts.)

387
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,506
He's tough.

388
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,977
That really hurt.

389
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:13,116
I'm always prepared to battle.

390
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:14,977
No opponent scares me.

391
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:18,547
Is no one keeping Choi Ho Jong...

392
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,288
in check?

393
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:23,788
(Raising his hand)

394
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:26,327
(Who is it?)

395
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:28,327
(Second Class Korean Dancer Kim Sang Gil)

396
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,457
Please elaborate.

397
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:33,398
When it comes to the one consoling death,

398
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,136
no one other than me...

399
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:38,168
can replace Choi Ho Jong.

400
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:41,178
If you become my double cast,

401
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:44,447
I hope you learn and grow...

402
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:48,117
from how I play the role flawlessly.

403
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,586
- Goodness. - That's scary.

404
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,117
(The First Class dignity can be felt from his words.)

405
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,717
It's pumping me up.

406
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,616
Taking my role?

407
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:58,227
It's close to impossible.

408
00:15:58,387 --> 00:15:59,428
It's a long shot.

409
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,097
All right. We will now begin...

410
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,827
the Double Casting Audition.

411
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,496
(Let's battle it out.)

412
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:08,567
Okay.

413
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,438
The dancers in Group 1 will start 1st.

414
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,067
(Double Casting Audition Grouping, Group 1 OAP)

415
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,277
Where you stand...

416
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:17,178
has been decided according to your class.

417
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:20,617
(Group 1 dancers are warming up before the audition.)

418
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:22,847
This is a tough group.

419
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:24,818
It's already intense.

420
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:27,087
I can tell who'll survive.

421
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:28,986
Ki Moo Gan.

422
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,887
He looks extremely determined.

423
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:36,357
In the Casting Audition, I made a huge mistake.

424
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:41,768
(Ki Moo Gan made a mistake in the additional audition and failed.)

425
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,908
I have to do my best this time. I'll excel in it.

426
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:46,677
I need to stay wide awake.

427
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:49,577
The Under Class might stand out if they do well.

428
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:50,578
Right.

429
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:53,547
They never had the chance to prove themselves.

430
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:56,278
Won't the judges focus on them more?

431
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,248
I thought it was my chance.

432
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,518
Even in the Technique Audition...

433
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,117
and the Class Mission...

434
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,787
(Kim In Su didn't do well enough and became Under Class.)

435
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,827
I could have done better in every mission.

436
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,696
I've always been a part of the ensemble,

437
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,697
so I wasn't able to express my unique style.

438
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,808
Naturally, I wanted to do well in the Double Casting Audition.

439
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,507
There were many parts that I could pull off...

440
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:22,738
in terms of Korean dance.

441
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,278
I was confident.

442
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:27,416
(Following)

443
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,946
(Kim In Su, 19 years old, confident and curious)

444
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:33,288
(The 19-year-old dancer has a lot to ask the older dancers.)

445
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,586
I'm the youngest, after all,

446
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:39,058
so I practiced right next to them.

447
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:41,457
(Breaktime for the Under Class)

448
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,557
But if they're casting three dancers...

449
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:43,797
(Worried)

450
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:44,927
You just need to work hard.

451
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,137
I won't leave any regrets.

452
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:49,767
I wanted to prove myself as the youngest...

453
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,037
and the Under Class of Korean dance.

454
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,238
(Ready to prove himself)

455
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,548
(Jae Jin is lost in his practice next to the confident youngest.)

456
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:57,977
I do regret things...

457
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,308
about the evaluation of the Dance Film.

458
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:01,846
(Jae Jin was demoted to Under Class for his attitude.)

459
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,687
Jae Jin was the only one wearing a cap.

460
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:07,518
That means that he's not willing to concentrate.

461
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:11,356
I wasn't humble enough to participate in a competition,

462
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,828
so I figured that was the reason I got bad results.

463
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,797
(He endlessly repeated the same move...)

464
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,696
(and even practiced during breaktime.)

465
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:24,068
Jae Jin was practicing so hard while sweating.

466
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,008
Enthusiastic Jae Jin.

467
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,107
Passionate Jae Jin.

468
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,137
When wasn't I passionate?

469
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:31,347
I've always worked hard.

470
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:32,808
Right.

471
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,218
It's a chance to play the main role.

472
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:39,048
I'll do my best in this mission.

473
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:43,386
Mega Stage Mission, Wihonmu.

474
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:47,126
The Double Casting Audition for the three main lead roles.

475
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,856
The moment you stop dancing,

476
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:52,396
you're eliminated from the Double Casting Audition.

477
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,397
(You're eliminated once you stop dancing.)

478
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:54,897
I was determined to show them.

479
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:57,367
I'll risk my life for the main lead role.

480
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,666
Stage Fighter,

481
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,308
the Mega Stage Mission Double Casting Audition begins now.

482
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,478
First position.

483
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:06,778
Music, start.

484
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,217
(Let's check out the audition of the determined dancers.)

485
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:12,988
Three, two, one. Go.

486
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:20,426
I had repeated it countless times, so I knew I could pull it off.

487
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,828
(Watching intently)

488
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:24,867
Tae Seok isn't dancing so hard, right?

489
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:26,367
His feet hurt.

490
00:19:29,397 --> 00:19:31,568
I only see Hyeok Jung.

491
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,107
I'll have to show them what differentiates me.

492
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:35,808
Hyeok Jung...

493
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,748
- He's dancing in the original way. - Right.

494
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:42,278
Hyeok Jung is insanely good.

495
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:43,947
(Coach Choi Soo Jin gets closer for an accurate evaluation.)

496
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,917
I was aiming for the chance to be promoted.

497
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,457
(Looking closely)

498
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,856
He's got a gentle style, so...

499
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:54,027
It's not bad,

500
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,968
but I doubt it's the vibe that Soo Jin wants.

501
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,467
(The Double Casting Audition continues without a break.)

502
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:01,968
(Getting himself ready)

503
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,767
(Slipping)

504
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,008
(Spotting his mistake)

505
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:11,078
I Ban isn't so stable when he lands.

506
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,018
I want to do it energetically so that I won't regret it.

507
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:19,788
In Su!

508
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:21,157
How is In Su so good?

509
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,718
(Interested)

510
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,328
Come on, Tae Hu.

511
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:31,827
Tae Hu is still like a baby.

512
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:33,126
Yes, he's like a baby.

513
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:34,166
(Matthew and Soo Jin move...)

514
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,597
(to observe the details.)

515
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,867
I was going to stay wide awake and go all out.

516
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,808
I was thinking, "Please look at me."

517
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,147
Jae Jin has beautiful lines.

518
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:52,446
Nice, long limbs. He has nice proportions.

519
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:53,586
The one way in the back...

520
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:54,818
Jeong Bin?

521
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:57,828
I was so desperate.

522
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,498
- He's... - I'm surprised.

523
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:03,867
I told myself, "I can do this."

524
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:12,637
- They're so desperate. - It seems arduous.

525
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,278
Aren't their moves all so desperate?

526
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,048
I can feel their emotions.

527
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,177
Five,

528
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:19,946
- four, three, - This was my last chance,

529
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,217
- two, - and I was going to give it my all.

530
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,916
one. Go.

531
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:26,048
(The two coaches move to decide who to eliminate.)

532
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:28,988
Matthew looks so scary.

533
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:32,427
Too weak.

534
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:35,157
(Kim Min Suk in Under is out.)

535
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,637
(Jeon Tae Hu in Under is out.)

536
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:44,137
(Moon Jun On in Under is out.)

537
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,376
(Kim Hyun Ho in First is out.)

538
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,377
(Everyone is shocked.)

539
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,778
- What? - Hyun Ho!

540
00:21:56,788 --> 00:21:58,018
I guess I saw it coming.

541
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:00,116
(After Hyun Ho in First is eliminated,)

542
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:01,518
(Moo Gan in Second is also eliminated.)

543
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,917
Oh, no.

544
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:06,488
(Ki Moo Gan in Second is out.)

545
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:07,728
What's happening?

546
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,768
I'm so ashamed to be dancing in front of 60 people.

547
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,896
(Kim Tae Seok in Second is out.)

548
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,667
- Ten, nine, - It hurt my pride.

549
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:16,836
- eight... - They're eliminated?

550
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,607
(The eliminated dancers swarm in due to cold-hearted evaluations.)

551
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:19,906
Five,

552
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:22,337
- four, three, two... - It was no joke.

553
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:25,248
I looked back, and there were only a few left.

554
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:27,116
I thought, "Let's keep going. You've got this."

555
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:29,077
- Four, three, - I was dying out there.

556
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:31,346
- two, one. Go. - But I still wanted to pull it off.

557
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:33,048
- Go. - Let's go, In Su!

558
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,558
(The last screening of Group 1)

559
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,426
Okay!

560
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,728
They shouted and cheered for me.

561
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:42,998
That motivated me.

562
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:44,228
In Su is good.

563
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:48,068
Let's go!

564
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:49,437
I need to win this part like my life depends on it.

565
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:52,468
- He's good, right? - It's so hard.

566
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,778
I didn't want to be eliminated.

567
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,947
Jae Jin!

568
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:06,488
- Why does this make me so sad? - I know, right?

569
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:09,657
(Everyone sighs.)

570
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:11,157
I don't like the one in the back.

571
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:15,327
(Han Jeong Bin in Under is out.)

572
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:16,396
Close enough.

573
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:18,468
(The Main Lead Role Double Casting Audition for Group 1 ends.)

574
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,538
In Su survived!

575
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,538
Jae Jin made it.

576
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,268
Jae Jin was amazing.

577
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:27,038
In Su's desperation...

578
00:23:27,437 --> 00:23:28,507
I know, right?

579
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:29,937
(In Su is proud.)

580
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,978
- Hyeok Jung is certainly good. - Absolutely.

581
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,147
I got one more chance.

582
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:37,318
I'll win the main lead role.

583
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,988
I think I have a shot.

584
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:42,386
(The candidates are Jae Jin, Hyeok Jung, and In Su.)

585
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,587
Group Two, please begin.

586
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:45,827
(Jung Sung Wook, Ryu Tae Young, Kim Si Won, Kang Yun Gu,)

587
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:47,057
(Go Dong Hoon, Ha Won Jun, Park Jin Ho, Kim Tae Gang,)

588
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,096
(Choi Ji Won, Kang Seong Bae, Lee Young Woo, Han Sang Ik...)

589
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:49,328
This is so nerve-racking.

590
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:51,427
They all practiced so hard.

591
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,096
I think Jin Ho will advance.

592
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,308
Jin Ho is the standard of a neat style.

593
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:00,208
I wonder what will happen to Dong Hoon.

594
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:02,407
I hope he gets picked.

595
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:05,248
I personally want him to advance.

596
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:08,377
Don't you think Si Won has a chance?

597
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,117
He did so well during practice too.

598
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,318
Seven, eight.

599
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,117
(First and Second practiced together in the same room.)

600
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:18,787
When I lost the main supporting role last time,

601
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:20,758
I was very disappointed.

602
00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:24,728
(Si Won lost to Hye Seong in the Main Supporting Role Audition.)

603
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,396
(You have not been cast.)

604
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:28,937
I realized that I was in trouble.

605
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:31,406
I was aiming to be in the First Class,

606
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,707
and if the competition kept getting fiercer like this,

607
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,837
it would be more difficult for me.

608
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:39,308
I didn't want to miss this opportunity.

609
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:41,646
(Si Won watches the First dancers practicing.)

610
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,946
(Looking closely)

611
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:45,817
He certainly uses his body well. Was it Hyeok Jung?

612
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,587
The muscular one in the middle.

613
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,827
Watching Sung Wook in First, who's a great ballerino,

614
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,527
and Hyeok Jung, who has great fundamentals,

615
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,626
I decided to copy their styles.

616
00:24:59,627 --> 00:25:02,696
Hyeok Jung, do you swing your arm after this?

617
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:03,707
- I... - It's so pretty.

618
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,336
I think I kick like this.

619
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,337
(Learning Hyeok Jung's kick)

620
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,538
When you do a jump like that,

621
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,677
it's like a passe in the air.

622
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,008
You know, like this.

623
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,176
- Like this? - That's what I'm picturing.

624
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:17,187
And I wanted to express it to suit my character.

625
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:19,788
It's like I'm trying to intimidate people with my eyes.

626
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,557
(Lost in practice)

627
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:23,727
- Si Won... - It's like he has a competition.

628
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:25,857
(Si Won is practicing as if he has a competition soon.)

629
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:28,498
My tummy always hurts on the day of the competition.

630
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,696
- Does this feel like a competition? - It does.

631
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:31,697
(This guy is as nervous as on the day of a dance contest.)

632
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:32,828
It's like a jinx of mine.

633
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,896
I knew that it'd be my last opportunity.

634
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:38,237
I wanted to give my all...

635
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:40,538
and pull it off in my own style.

636
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,277
The beast in me came out.

637
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:43,637
I'm no longer a princess.

638
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,147
I'm going to make it energetic, no matter what.

639
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,547
We'll be doing the same dance moves, right?

640
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,217
I had to go hard...

641
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,116
to stand out among them.

642
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,117
(The wind sound is a given.)

643
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,217
Okay.

644
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:55,218
(Jin Ho's loud practice continues with the noises of victory.)

645
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,087
Five, six, seven, eight.

646
00:25:58,427 --> 00:25:59,427
That's cool.

647
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,298
Why is Dong Hoon working so hard?

648
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:02,697
He must want to advance.

649
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,768
(Dong Hoon concentrates on practicing in the corner.)

650
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:10,507
I thought I needed to focus on myself today,

651
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:12,937
so I formed an invisible room for myself.

652
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:16,137
My primary goal is to be promoted from Under.

653
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:18,406
(In the Class Battle for contemporary dancers,)

654
00:26:18,407 --> 00:26:19,547
(he got the Under Class.)

655
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:20,577
(In the 1st Class Movement Ceremony,)

656
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,578
(he got the Under Class once again.)

657
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,447
I got the Under Class twice after getting the First Class.

658
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:25,548
And kick!

659
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,957
And I was acknowledged for my leadership,

660
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:30,157
rather than my dancing skills.

661
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:32,227
This is an opportunity.

662
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:35,127
So, if I can be respected and acknowledged,

663
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,367
that's what matters to me the most.

664
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:40,467
I wanted to add...

665
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:42,738
some of my interpretation of the moves.

666
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:47,208
Death is urgent, and I'm desperate,

667
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:49,508
so I wanted to add that vibe.

668
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:52,508
What I'm good at and what I like.

669
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,877
I think it's fair that I show them that so that I won't regret it.

670
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:02,317
The audition will continue only until we have...

671
00:27:02,318 --> 00:27:04,728
the dancers who are likely to be cast.

672
00:27:06,228 --> 00:27:07,357
First position.

673
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,927
Music, start.

674
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:12,626
- This part is so nerve-racking. - Two, one.

675
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:14,167
- I hope Jin Ho gets it. - Music, start.

676
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:15,937
- Jin Ho. - Five,

677
00:27:16,097 --> 00:27:17,808
- I'm going to watch Min Chan. - four,

678
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,778
- three, two, one. - Good luck, Young Woo.

679
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:22,278
Go.

680
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,478
(The Main Lead Role Double Casting Audition for Group 2 begins.)

681
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,778
(Observing him carefully)

682
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:31,747
I thought it'd be better to show them my style...

683
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:32,788
from the front row.

684
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:37,018
(Smiling)

685
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:38,887
Si Won stands out too.

686
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:45,567
Sung Wook does the port de bras in the ballet style...

687
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:46,998
without changing the moves too much.

688
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:49,897
- Sung Wook's moves are neat. - That's why he stands out.

689
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,808
(Catching everyone's attention)

690
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:54,607
Min Kwon...

691
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,308
Min Kwon made too many mistakes.

692
00:27:58,578 --> 00:27:59,578
Oh, no.

693
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:00,818
(It seems like Min Kwon didn't practice the moves enough.)

694
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,518
(An intense ending)

695
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:06,586
- Five, four, - Si Won is pretty good.

696
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:09,186
- Yes. - three, two, one.

697
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,126
(Getting himself ready)

698
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:12,127
Go.

699
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:20,998
The one in the gray sleeveless shirt.

700
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:22,867
The one behind Si Won.

701
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,268
(Matthew spots him.)

702
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:29,508
I meant to give it my all so that I could dominate everyone.

703
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,377
(His eyes change.)

704
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,977
(Jin Ho's movements certainly stand out.)

705
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,647
Jin Ho is different, indeed.

706
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,647
I shot laser beams with my eyes, going, "Please pick me."

707
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:39,917
"I'm desperate."

708
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:43,586
(They made eye contact.)

709
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,758
The thing about dance is...

710
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:48,997
Well, in this situation,

711
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:52,498
you can feel their passion from their eyes.

712
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:55,768
Five, four,

713
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,437
three, two, one. Go.

714
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:01,238
(He goes twice as hard.)

715
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:04,507
(Coach Han moves to the right.)

716
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:05,508
(Noticing him)

717
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,978
There's no contraction in the upper body for Yun Gu.

718
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:11,387
It's too weak.

719
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:16,458
The coaches came and looked straight at me.

720
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:20,758
I wanted to dominate them and crush them.

721
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:23,897
Like, "This is my dance, so pay attention to me."

722
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:27,197
(Focusing)

723
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:28,768
I love his expressions.

724
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,336
Ten, nine,

725
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:36,837
- Dong Hoon might die. - eight...

726
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,347
- Dong Hoon. - Ten, nine,

727
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,717
- He certainly added his style. - eight, seven,

728
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:42,777
six,

729
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,846
- five, four, - I decided to trust myself...

730
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:47,457
- and not be intimidated. - three, two, one.

731
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,458
(Thinking)

732
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:51,357
- What do I do? It's so scary. - Two, one. Go.

733
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,356
(The coaches and the rehearsal director...)

734
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:54,697
(move to eliminate the dancers.)

735
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,927
(I'm so scared!)

736
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,328
I was terrified.

737
00:30:01,937 --> 00:30:02,937
(Looking closely)

738
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:05,137
(Kang Seong Bae in Under is out.)

739
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:07,677
(An Si On and Kim Tae Yeon in Under are out.)

740
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:10,277
- Tae Gang? - Sang Ik, no!

741
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:12,647
(The dancers in Under are eliminated 1 by 1.)

742
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,018
Dong Hoon!

743
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,146
As they were tagged out,

744
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:20,117
I found the confidence and thought that I might make it.

745
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:23,117
(The remaining dancers give their all.)

746
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,788
(And Coach Jung Bo Kyung observes the dancers.)

747
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,258
(Glancing)

748
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:30,798
I was almost done with the moves, so I thought she'd walk away.

749
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,067
(The final tap)

750
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:37,808
(Go Dong Hoon in Under is out.)

751
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,537
- Even Dong Hoon? - Ten,

752
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,738
- Oh, Dong Hoon. - nine, eight, seven,

753
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:44,107
- six, five, - Good work.

754
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:45,778
- four, three, - It's tough.

755
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:47,917
two, one.

756
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:50,318
I guess I failed again.

757
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:53,288
(The final 3 dancers in Group 2 to advance to Round 2.)

758
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:54,788
Si Won did great.

759
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:56,758
I was one step closer.

760
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:58,488
How come Sung Wook is so pretty?

761
00:30:58,728 --> 00:31:00,926
I was representing the ballet dancers,

762
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,097
so I was exhilarated.

763
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,397
We have a ballerino left!

764
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:06,127
Nice, Jin Ho.

765
00:31:06,697 --> 00:31:07,837
He survived.

766
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:10,538
Although I was in my element, I wasn't going to let my guard down.

767
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:12,667
Kim Si Won.

768
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,077
Park Jin Ho.

769
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:16,136
(Watching the dancers advance to Round 2...)

770
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:20,047
Jung Sung Wook. These three members have survived.

771
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:21,117
Congratulations.

772
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,048
I thought, "Why? Why can't I be picked?"

773
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:26,487
Well done, Sung Wook!

774
00:31:26,488 --> 00:31:28,058
- Jin Ho did great. - Good job.

775
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:30,828
Good work.

776
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,058
I failed again. This is making me mad.

777
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:41,568
Judging by the outcome, I've always been at the bottom.

778
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,397
That gets me worried,

779
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,366
and it also makes me worry...

780
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,078
that I might beat myself up too much because of this.

781
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,748
I just...

782
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,578
(Dong Hoon can't speak for a while.)

783
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,416
(He feels powerless...)

784
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,488
(as he's more desperate than anyone else.)

785
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,087
I'm sorry.

786
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,366
(During the Class Battle)

787
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,968
(Dong Hoon got the Under Class.)

788
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,336
(He performed with resilience...)

789
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,906
(and gave his best in his class more than anyone else.)

790
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:27,107
(and gave his best in his class more than anyone else.)

791
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:29,317
Let's go, guys!

792
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:32,146
(He strived for a better performance...)

793
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:34,288
(and looked after others before himself.)

794
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:41,127
I've been dancing until now because I loved it so much.

795
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:47,228
I couldn't give up as I couldn't forget about performing.

796
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,437
But it doesn't feel...

797
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:53,667
like my hard work and efforts are acknowledged.

798
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:00,048
I guess I was too eager today.

799
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:03,947
My passion and enthusiasm...

800
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:07,017
have not been satiated, so it was a shock.

801
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,687
It was a bummer, indeed.

802
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:12,087
I like to think...

803
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:15,558
that I'm being crumpled harder...

804
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:19,597
to be a paper ball that flies farther.

805
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,468
Group Three, please begin.

806
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:28,137
(Double Casting Audition)

807
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:32,877
Look at him using his facial expressions.

808
00:33:33,008 --> 00:33:34,447
I love his image and all.

809
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:37,018
He's spiteful.

810
00:33:37,718 --> 00:33:39,548
- What? - I like Kyu Tae's eyes.

811
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:41,718
He's very determined.

812
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,458
I think neat moves stand out better.

813
00:33:47,597 --> 00:33:50,357
(Kwon Yo Han, the contemporary dancer, dances neatly.)

814
00:33:50,358 --> 00:33:54,337
Kim Jong Cheol, Choi Kyu Tae, and Kwon Yo Han.

815
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:56,998
These three dancers have survived. Congratulations.

816
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,037
(Kim Jong Cheol, Yun Hyeok Jung, Jung Sung Wook, Kim Si Won,)

817
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,437
(Kwon Yo Han, Kim In Su, Kim Jae Jin, Park Jin Ho, Choi Kyu Tae)

818
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,378
In the second round, Formation and Choreography Audition,

819
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:06,007
we will reevaluate you with choreography...

820
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:09,747
that includes formations for the first audition's routine...

821
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:13,816
to assess not just basic choreography skills...

822
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:15,757
but also stage presence and expressiveness.

823
00:34:16,018 --> 00:34:18,927
You will be given only 30 minutes...

824
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:23,657
to pull off this choreography and formation in your style.

825
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:29,538
(The choreographer demonstrates the formations.)

826
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:34,407
This should be easy.

827
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,137
And then...

828
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:39,677
Six, seven, eight.

829
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,478
But you need to beware...

830
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,177
It wasn't that difficult.

831
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:46,316
I was confident.

832
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,357
I was still First, though I didn't get the main lead role,

833
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:49,858
so I wanted to prove myself.

834
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,327
Shall we try again?

835
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:55,058
Do I look straight ahead in this part?

836
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:56,828
That's the original choreography.

837
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:01,297
Do I need to look up when I swing my arms?

838
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:03,168
I was eager to win.

839
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,268
Being in the Under Class doesn't exactly mean that you're Under.

840
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:10,636
I finally had this opportunity, so I wasn't going to lose it.

841
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:11,748
Okay.

842
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:13,446
- I need to bet my life on it. - What?

843
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:14,547
I'm betting my life.

844
00:35:15,018 --> 00:35:17,247
I'm going to pour my everything into it...

845
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,688
and survive.

846
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:22,156
(Kyu Tae in Under is practicing, and...)

847
00:35:22,157 --> 00:35:24,217
- And your hand... - I got a cramp.

848
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:25,657
My left leg.

849
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:27,897
(They apply emergency measures.)

850
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:30,756
I got a serious cramp during practice,

851
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:32,168
so I was worried.

852
00:35:32,768 --> 00:35:34,937
I'll go back to practice when I'm good to go.

853
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:37,097
I need to memorize the choreography.

854
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,707
(He goes back to practice...)

855
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,808
(as he only has 30 minutes.)

856
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:45,547
Shoot.

857
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:51,486
(Kyu Tae falls due to severe pain.)

858
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:53,918
(He's back out for treatment.)

859
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:55,217
Gosh.

860
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:58,328
Then, come right up.

861
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:01,756
(He's upset that his body can't keep up with his enthusiasm...)

862
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:06,297
(and that he won't get this kind of opportunity again.)

863
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:11,137
I finally got the chance to show them my dance,

864
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,208
but I kept getting cramps during practice.

865
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,007
It was so hard to get this opportunity.

866
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,308
I was disappointed and angry.

867
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,587
Even if I have to roll out of the stage due to the cramp,

868
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:25,617
I'll give it a go.

869
00:36:26,188 --> 00:36:28,257
I'd be too frustrated to walk away.

870
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:32,386
I'll go.

871
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:34,558
(Can he finish the audition safely?)

872
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,597
For the Main Lead Role Double Casting,

873
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:40,426
the second round, Formation and Choreography Audition,

874
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:41,768
will begin now.

875
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:43,938
I want to maintain the dignity of the First Class.

876
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,938
I'm going to prove them wrong as the Under Class.

877
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:47,808
I'm sure I'll win.

878
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:49,737
First position.

879
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,708
Music, start.

880
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,676
(Choi Kyu Tae, ensemble, Yun Hyeok Jung, sub lead role,)

881
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,148
(and Kim Si Won, sub supporting role)

882
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:56,817
Go.

883
00:36:57,018 --> 00:37:00,347
(They put everything into their movements to get cast.)

884
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:03,217
Gosh.

885
00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:12,168
It's too bad that he has a calf injury.

886
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:16,137
Hyeok Jung makes me go, "That's how a dancer should be."

887
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:18,768
(Very satisfied)

888
00:37:24,237 --> 00:37:25,276
(Charging forward)

889
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:27,947
- All right. - The middle one is good.

890
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:40,128
(They end the choreography with their respective ending poses.)

891
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,397
Ten, nine...

892
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:45,097
- They're good. - Hyeok Jung is unrivaled.

893
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:46,597
He's a beast.

894
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:48,997
(The next group's choreography follows right away.)

895
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:50,437
(Kim Jae Jin, ensemble, Kim Jong Cheol, sub lead role,)

896
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:51,467
(Park Jin Ho, ensemble)

897
00:37:52,308 --> 00:37:53,338
Go.

898
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:02,217
Jong Cheol is good.

899
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:06,688
Jin Ho isn't bad either.

900
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:15,627
(They show their characters with their gaits.)

901
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:17,998
- Okay. - The look in his eyes is insane.

902
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,668
He's doing a great job with the expression.

903
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:23,367
(Walking forward)

904
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,237
Nice.

905
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:36,946
(The 3 dancers' ending poses are unique.)

906
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:37,947
Nice.

907
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,588
- All right. - Jong Cheol did well.

908
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,518
Jin Ho definitely stands out.

909
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:44,987
The revolt of the Under Class.

910
00:38:45,788 --> 00:38:47,557
(The last group's audition follows.)

911
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,296
(Kwon Yo Han, ensemble, Jung Sung Wook, sub lead role,)

912
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:50,297
(Kim In Su, ensemble)

913
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,228
Go.

914
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,637
(Explosive energy)

915
00:38:59,308 --> 00:39:00,308
All right.

916
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,248
Nice.

917
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:09,378
All right.

918
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:13,847
Yo Han's moves have weight.

919
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:21,697
Sung Wook is really good.

920
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:27,567
(2nd Round of the Formation and Choreography Audition ends.)

921
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:28,897
(You can breathe now.)

922
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:29,898
(Breathing)

923
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:30,937
(Dazed)

924
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:32,067
This is so much fun.

925
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:34,538
They're so cool. I need to be cool too.

926
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:37,337
You did well. I watched you from the back.

927
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:38,977
My balance wavered because I got too excited.

928
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:41,748
No, you did well. You did really well.

929
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:44,248
- Was my performance a bit weak? - I'm having the same thought.

930
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:45,547
Everyone's performance was intense.

931
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:47,447
I'm really disappointed.

932
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:50,157
I couldn't show what I prepared since I was worried about the cramp.

933
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:52,328
I was very disappointed.

934
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:55,957
(Sighing)

935
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,367
(The coaches begin a meeting.)

936
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:01,437
The ones who can't control their bodies...

937
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:04,197
- Jae Jin couldn't do the moves. - No.

938
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:07,637
Kyu Tae looked uncomfortable too.

939
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:12,148
(Kyu Tae couldn't show his skills due to a calf injury.)

940
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:15,248
In Su was too out of sync.

941
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:20,187
I don't know whom to choose among these four.

942
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:22,457
(They narrow it down to 4 candidates.)

943
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:25,688
They have similar energy.

944
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:27,828
Can we watch the four dancers once more?

945
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,426
Korean dance, Kim Jong Cheol.

946
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:32,427
(Korean dance, Kim Jong Cheol)

947
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,697
Contemporary dance, Kwon Yo Han.

948
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:37,097
Contemporary dance, Yun Hyeok Jung.

949
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,667
Korean dance, Kim Si Won.

950
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,637
We'll choose among these dancers.

951
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:44,176
- I think they'll drop one dancer. - Yes.

952
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,878
I think everyone else got eliminated.

953
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:47,248
I guess I didn't get the role.

954
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:50,947
I had no regrets about my performance.

955
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:53,688
Even if I don't get the role, it can't be helped.

956
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:56,788
(It can't be helped.)

957
00:40:57,117 --> 00:40:58,188
First position.

958
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,058
Music, start.

959
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:02,257
- Five, four, - The end is near.

960
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,358
- three, two, - It's do or die.

961
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:06,168
one. Go.

962
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:11,338
That's insane.

963
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:13,608
Their energy is incredible.

964
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,007
My goodness.

965
00:41:21,518 --> 00:41:22,518
All right.

966
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:26,487
Both of them are insane.

967
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:30,987
- My goodness. - Good.

968
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:35,027
- My goodness. - Good.

969
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:38,967
(Powerful ending)

970
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:45,268
My goodness.

971
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,237
I could feel their energy from here.

972
00:41:48,878 --> 00:41:51,207
(Rematch Group 2, Kwon Yo Han and Kim Jong Cheol)

973
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,378
I must move up.

974
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:54,478
I'll get cast no matter what.

975
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:56,317
Go.

976
00:41:58,018 --> 00:41:59,018
All right.

977
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,788
It was neat.

978
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:05,257
(Relaxed)

979
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:08,358
(Full of unique charms)

980
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:30,846
(The ending was insane.)

981
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,347
(They have my approval.)

982
00:42:36,088 --> 00:42:37,317
I made up my mind.

983
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:39,287
- This one. - The decision will be made.

984
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:40,358
Right?

985
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:43,128
We will now announce the result...

986
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:45,066
of Stage Fighter's...

987
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:47,697
Mega Stage Mission Double Casting Audition.

988
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,967
Firstly, we'll announce the dancer who became the double...

989
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,507
of Kim Hyo Joon, the dancer who was cast...

990
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:56,608
as the main lead role of the one opposing death.

991
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:02,776
(He pulled off various genres perfectly.)

992
00:43:02,777 --> 00:43:06,418
(Kim Hyo Joon, main lead role, the one opposing death)

993
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:09,088
I'm the most confident about Hyo Joon's role.

994
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:11,688
The role I want is the one opposing death.

995
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:14,357
The dancer who became the double...

996
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,256
of Kim Hyo Joon, the dancer who was cast...

997
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:18,268
as the main lead role of the one opposing death, is...

998
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,667
Kim Jong Cheol.

999
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:25,037
Kim Jong Cheol.

1000
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:27,538
Jong Cheol. I knew it.

1001
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:30,136
Kim Jong Cheol.

1002
00:43:30,137 --> 00:43:32,648
Jong Cheol. I knew it.

1003
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:37,046
- They have similar vibes. - Yes.

1004
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,588
Kim Jong Cheol,

1005
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:42,058
you showed the characteristics of Korean dance,

1006
00:43:42,217 --> 00:43:45,357
such as the beauty of the curves and the flow of the body...

1007
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,426
through your dance.

1008
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:49,498
You delivered impactful energy...

1009
00:43:49,797 --> 00:43:52,668
with your dance.

1010
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:56,137
That was why you caught our eye.

1011
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,768
With the dancer...

1012
00:43:57,967 --> 00:44:00,837
who got cast for the same role,

1013
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,438
I'll work hard and give a good result.

1014
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,506
(The one opposing death: Kim Hyo Joon, Kim Jong Cheol)

1015
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:10,946
We'll announce the dancer who became the double...

1016
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:12,588
of Kim Yu Chan, the dancer who was cast...

1017
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,817
as the second main lead role of the one fearing death.

1018
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:19,787
(Kim Yu Chan used elements of his specialty, ballet,)

1019
00:44:19,788 --> 00:44:21,727
(and pulled off the choreography perfectly.)

1020
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:23,797
(He got cast as the main lead role, the one fearing death.)

1021
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,867
I really wanted the role of the one fearing death.

1022
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:30,097
I want to try that role.

1023
00:44:30,637 --> 00:44:32,767
The dancer who became the double of Kim Yu Chan,

1024
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:34,237
the dancer who was cast as a main lead role, is...

1025
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,808
(Who will it be?)

1026
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:38,648
Yun Hyeok Jung.

1027
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:41,107
Yun Hyeok Jung.

1028
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:42,518
Congratulations.

1029
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,347
- Yun Hyeok Jung. - I knew it.

1030
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,018
The fearful role suits you, Hyeok Jung.

1031
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:52,128
Yun Hyeok Jung.

1032
00:44:52,558 --> 00:44:54,787
The explosive energy that comes out...

1033
00:44:54,788 --> 00:44:56,597
of your body...

1034
00:44:56,898 --> 00:44:58,167
stands out.

1035
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:00,426
You can dance very powerfully.

1036
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:02,667
You made good use of that...

1037
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:04,567
when you did the dance moves.

1038
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:07,406
I'm very thankful...

1039
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:10,308
for this opportunity. I'll work hard.

1040
00:45:10,737 --> 00:45:12,878
(The one fearing death: Kim Yu Chan, Yun Hyeok Jung)

1041
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,507
All the doubles are from the First Class.

1042
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,676
(Both doubles are from the First Class.)

1043
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:20,847
The chance of an ensemble getting cast is slim.

1044
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:24,116
The remaining number of main lead roles...

1045
00:45:24,117 --> 00:45:25,558
that need a double...

1046
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:28,128
is one.

1047
00:45:28,427 --> 00:45:31,828
It's the double of Choi Ho Jong,

1048
00:45:31,967 --> 00:45:35,167
the dancer who was cast as the main lead role...

1049
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:36,967
of the one consoling death.

1050
00:45:37,297 --> 00:45:39,136
(He showed both hardness and softness.)

1051
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:42,006
(Choi Ho Jong, main lead role, the one consoling death)

1052
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:43,577
(I think you're a dancer...)

1053
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:46,677
(a choreographer definitely needs.)

1054
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,217
The dancer who became the double...

1055
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,688
of Choi Ho Jong is...

1056
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:54,188
- Who will it be? - Sung Wook?

1057
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:56,858
I think it'll be Si Won.

1058
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,487
The double of Choi Ho Jong is...

1059
00:46:02,328 --> 00:46:03,858
Park Jin Ho.

1060
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:06,696
- Park Jin Ho. - There you go.

1061
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:07,767
Congratulations.

1062
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:09,067
(The double for the one consoling death, Park Jin Ho)

1063
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:11,937
- Park Jin Ho. - There you go.

1064
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:13,006
Congratulations.

1065
00:46:13,007 --> 00:46:14,337
(Dancers of the Under Class are happy for him.)

1066
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,608
He moved up from the Under Class.

1067
00:46:15,978 --> 00:46:18,177
- My goodness. - He worked hard.

1068
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,108
I thought he was nice.

1069
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:24,247
I also thought that Jin Ho was very nice.

1070
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,116
His techniques were nice.

1071
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,757
His expressions were intense too.

1072
00:46:29,058 --> 00:46:30,788
He expressed himself beautifully.

1073
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,328
(They voted for Park Jin Ho unanimously.)

1074
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:36,828
Park Jin Ho,

1075
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,157
you're crying.

1076
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:41,997
I saw you wipe your tears.

1077
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:45,838
(Happiness brings tears.)

1078
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:48,108
Anyone would cry in that situation.

1079
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:49,938
From Under Class...

1080
00:46:51,907 --> 00:46:53,148
Well...

1081
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:59,288
Throughout the past missions,

1082
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:02,587
I was ashamed of myself.

1083
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:06,588
I felt like I had failed to show my true essence.

1084
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:11,867
(From the start, people had high expectations for Park Jin Ho.)

1085
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,967
(But Physical and Technique Audition put him in Second Class.)

1086
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:23,107
Just now, Park Jin Ho...

1087
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:24,406
(Despite his efforts,)

1088
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:27,777
(he failed to get promoted in the Class Battle.)

1089
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:30,946
(After the Dance Film,)

1090
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:33,847
(he got demoted to the Under Class.)

1091
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:37,587
I kept failing to meet my goal.

1092
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,958
"Why can't I receive recognition?"

1093
00:47:39,728 --> 00:47:42,657
"What problems do I have to keep failing?"

1094
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:46,628
Since I was desperate,

1095
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:48,498
emotions boiled in my heart.

1096
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,907
I was desperate for this mission.

1097
00:47:52,507 --> 00:47:54,467
I thought it was the last chance.

1098
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,078
I performed as if my life depended on it.

1099
00:47:59,108 --> 00:48:03,046
I'll try hard to continue showing this side of me...

1100
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:07,187
and work well with Choi Ho Jong.

1101
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:08,317
Thank you.

1102
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:11,728
(You're cool, Park Jin Ho.)

1103
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,026
(The one consoling death: Choi Ho Jong, Park Jin Ho)

1104
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:18,426
The three doubles...

1105
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:21,097
must perfectly learn the main lead roles' choreographies.

1106
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:25,466
For the quality of the performance, the cast could change...

1107
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:27,668
even right before taking the stage.

1108
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,338
For the Solo Choreography of the main lead role,

1109
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,977
the main lead dancer and the double will be compared.

1110
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:37,247
If the double performs the choreography better,

1111
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:41,217
the cast for the section could change anytime.

1112
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:43,187
Thank you for your hard work.

1113
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:45,557
(The Double Casting Audition for the main lead role ends.)

1114
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:48,627
You'll go one at a time after warming up.

1115
00:48:48,628 --> 00:48:50,397
Ho Jong is unbelievable.

1116
00:48:50,398 --> 00:48:52,097
It's something only he can do.

1117
00:48:52,268 --> 00:48:53,967
What should I do? It's already hard.

1118
00:48:54,228 --> 00:48:55,366
How am I supposed to do that?

1119
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:56,397
(He needs to learn the choreography.)

1120
00:48:56,398 --> 00:48:59,566
I was quite pressured about getting cast as Ho Jong's double.

1121
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:02,338
He'll do an incredible job of creating his Solo Choreography.

1122
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:05,176
Still, I'll do my best.

1123
00:49:05,177 --> 00:49:06,906
(Walking over)

1124
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:08,877
(He copies all the moves.)

1125
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,518
I wasn't mindful of Jin Ho.

1126
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:15,116
I was more focused on creating...

1127
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:16,558
a good choreography.

1128
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:19,587
(My goodness)

1129
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,188
I can't help but resent Ho Jong.

1130
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:23,696
Ho Jong made many changes.

1131
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:25,727
In the past practice, the middle part changed.

1132
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:27,796
Then the first and last parts changed.

1133
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:30,168
It confused me a lot.

1134
00:49:30,498 --> 00:49:33,037
Still, I made a lot of effort to become his double.

1135
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:34,837
I know that I'll regret it...

1136
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,877
if I fail to shine.

1137
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:38,078
That's why I'm desperate.

1138
00:49:39,078 --> 00:49:41,647
(Park Jin Ho didn't stop practicing until everyone left.)

1139
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:45,288
To be honest, we practiced in a separate studio.

1140
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:46,748
Let's begin.

1141
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:49,187
(The 3 doubles practiced during their free time.)

1142
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:52,688
I don't think I've ever done that during my time as a dancer.

1143
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:57,197
I realized that all three of us were desperate.

1144
00:49:57,697 --> 00:50:00,366
(What will become of the 3 desperate doubles?)

1145
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:01,367
(The day of the rehearsal)

1146
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:04,637
Let's begin the rehearsal for the main lead role's solo part.

1147
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:06,967
If the double does a better job...

1148
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:11,006
of the main lead role's Solo Choreography,

1149
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,878
the cast can change for the quality of the performance.

1150
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:16,446
If the main lead dancer makes a mistake...

1151
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,446
- The double will get the role. - The double will get the role.

1152
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,588
Gosh, that's so cruel.

1153
00:50:21,487 --> 00:50:25,557
(It's time for Kim Yu Chan to rehearse his solo part.)

1154
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:27,387
(Focused)

1155
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:29,426
I won't let him take my role.

1156
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,997
I will prove that this is my role.

1157
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:34,796
(Kim Yu Chan's rehearsal begins.)

1158
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:36,567
(Absorbed)

1159
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:38,937
(Focused)

1160
00:50:38,938 --> 00:50:42,708
(Kim Yu Chan dances powerfully as if it's the actual performance.)

1161
00:50:44,177 --> 00:50:45,676
(Impressed)

1162
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:47,078
(Wary)

1163
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:51,418
(The flowing movements of ballet stand out in this choreography.)

1164
00:50:52,788 --> 00:50:54,116
(A difficult technique)

1165
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,148
(His eyes go wide.)

1166
00:50:56,157 --> 00:50:58,887
(Kim Yu Chan's rehearsal ends.)

1167
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:01,188
That was incredible.

1168
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:02,656
How can a male dancer's leg touch the head?

1169
00:51:02,657 --> 00:51:04,297
He did the arabesque at once.

1170
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:06,498
I was a bit anxious. But I still thought,

1171
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:09,168
"I can do well with turns, the technique I'm confident about."

1172
00:51:09,697 --> 00:51:11,837
(Yun Hyeok Jung's rehearsal begins.)

1173
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:13,567
(He pulls off the choreography in his own style.)

1174
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:15,037
(Impressed)

1175
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,177
(Wary)

1176
00:51:17,438 --> 00:51:20,148
(He pulls off the turn in a cool way.)

1177
00:51:22,918 --> 00:51:24,417
(A killer technique)

1178
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:25,588
(Impressed)

1179
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:29,558
(Yun Hyeok Jung's rehearsal ends.)

1180
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:31,017
Good.

1181
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:32,087
(A round of applause)

1182
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,487
He changed it to his own style. He changed it well.

1183
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:37,096
Although Yu Chan is on another level,

1184
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,398
I can't remember his performance after Hyeok Jung's.

1185
00:51:39,898 --> 00:51:41,696
Kim Yu Chan,

1186
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:45,037
you improved the quality greatly in terms of technique.

1187
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:46,537
"How did he do it so easily?"

1188
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:47,966
It takes skills to make people think that.

1189
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:50,636
However, your expressions were...

1190
00:51:50,637 --> 00:51:51,907
a bit lacking.

1191
00:51:52,148 --> 00:51:54,677
Yun Hyeok Jung had the expression.

1192
00:51:55,248 --> 00:51:58,276
The biggest difference in the two performances was...

1193
00:51:58,277 --> 00:52:00,546
the part where you showed a kick from the attitude position.

1194
00:52:00,547 --> 00:52:02,316
Hyeok Jung changed it to a side kick...

1195
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:05,486
to deliver the energy in a sharp way.

1196
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:07,757
It gave a new vibe to the choreography.

1197
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:09,358
(Yun Hyeok Jung and Kim Yu Chan received opposing reviews.)

1198
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,497
Thank you for your hard work.

1199
00:52:10,498 --> 00:52:13,367
Choi Ho Jong's rehearsal will come next.

1200
00:52:14,228 --> 00:52:17,537
Please go back to where you came from, the Under Class.

1201
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:20,137
(Choi Ho Jong's rehearsal begins.)

1202
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,077
(Beautiful)

1203
00:52:23,078 --> 00:52:24,177
(That's it!)

1204
00:52:24,538 --> 00:52:26,248
It's smooth and pretty.

1205
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:29,716
(Turning)

1206
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:31,578
(What's that?)

1207
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,887
(Choi Ho Jong showed his unique moves until the end.)

1208
00:52:38,117 --> 00:52:39,588
Choi Ho Jong did what he could do best.

1209
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:43,526
It was so clean.

1210
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:47,427
(It's time for Park Jin Ho's rehearsal.)

1211
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,067
Will he show us?

1212
00:52:49,297 --> 00:52:51,796
I'll grit my teeth so that I can beat him.

1213
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:52,938
I'm confident.

1214
00:52:53,268 --> 00:52:55,067
(Park Jin Ho's rehearsal begins.)

1215
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:00,547
(Winking)

1216
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:06,288
(Park Jin Ho copies the difficult moves with ease.)

1217
00:53:12,558 --> 00:53:14,187
(He wraps up with his own ending pose.)

1218
00:53:14,188 --> 00:53:15,657
(Park Jin Ho's rehearsal ends.)

1219
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:18,427
Beautiful. Great job.

1220
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:20,927
It was cool.

1221
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:23,367
Jin Ho might've made the entire thing shine more.

1222
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:27,267
Jin Ho, you showed the one consoling death...

1223
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:29,537
that was different from Ho Jong's.

1224
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:32,176
At the very end, you went down on the floor...

1225
00:53:32,177 --> 00:53:35,378
and created new moves. I was thankful for them.

1226
00:53:35,748 --> 00:53:38,816
Choi Ho Jong, I think...

1227
00:53:38,817 --> 00:53:42,716
you can execute the solo part nearly perfectly.

1228
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:43,717
However,

1229
00:53:43,718 --> 00:53:47,756
the one who seemed to control the ensemble was Park Jin Ho.

1230
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:51,127
When he motioned to the back, the spirits moved.

1231
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:52,966
In that aspect,

1232
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:55,297
Park Jin Ho is a dancer who deserves the main lead role.

1233
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:57,796
Maybe I shouldn't have choreographed the dance that way.

1234
00:53:57,797 --> 00:53:59,507
Fear washed over me.

1235
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:03,608
Kim Hyo Joon's rehearsal will come first.

1236
00:54:04,038 --> 00:54:06,477
I have no intention to give him my role.

1237
00:54:06,478 --> 00:54:08,277
I'll dance with gritted teeth.

1238
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:11,017
(Let's see.)

1239
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:12,487
(Kim Hyo Joon's rehearsal begins.)

1240
00:54:13,947 --> 00:54:14,986
(Charging forward)

1241
00:54:14,987 --> 00:54:16,287
(Impressed)

1242
00:54:16,288 --> 00:54:17,418
His facial expression is alive.

1243
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:20,526
(Charismatic and intense eyes...)

1244
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:21,527
(and memorable technique)

1245
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:23,858
(Kim Hyo Joon's specialty, knee spin)

1246
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:25,898
(Covering his mouth)

1247
00:54:27,268 --> 00:54:28,696
(Even the ending was intense.)

1248
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:30,067
(It was so nice.)

1249
00:54:30,438 --> 00:54:32,207
- He did the best today. - Yes.

1250
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,208
He did well.

1251
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:34,938
His facial expression was no joke.

1252
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:37,437
He's determined to win.

1253
00:54:37,438 --> 00:54:39,478
Okay. I'll show him what I can do.

1254
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:42,248
(Kim Jong Cheol's rehearsal begins.)

1255
00:54:43,378 --> 00:54:45,346
(He fights charisma with softness.)

1256
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:46,687
(Impressed)

1257
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:48,117
(He's equally good.)

1258
00:54:50,058 --> 00:54:52,657
(A silent cry)

1259
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,187
(Surprised)

1260
00:54:54,188 --> 00:54:55,797
(What's up with that pose?)

1261
00:54:56,398 --> 00:54:58,656
(Kim Jong Cheol's rehearsal ends.)

1262
00:54:58,657 --> 00:55:00,296
(The choreographer is satisfied.)

1263
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,797
(He's good.)

1264
00:55:02,027 --> 00:55:03,467
Both of them did well.

1265
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:06,406
Jong Cheol did better than he did during practice.

1266
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:08,067
I'm a bit worried.

1267
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:10,577
Hyo Joon showed...

1268
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:12,247
powerful moves...

1269
00:55:12,248 --> 00:55:14,147
as well as a playful smile.

1270
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:16,946
He showed various aspects...

1271
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:19,986
of the one opposing death.

1272
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:21,816
As for Kim Jong Cheol,

1273
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:25,727
he showed a soft opposition. It was fun to watch.

1274
00:55:25,728 --> 00:55:28,796
How did the two dancers interpret the character...

1275
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:31,897
in completely opposite ways? It was neck-and-neck.

1276
00:55:31,898 --> 00:55:35,467
I don't know which dancer to choose.

1277
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:40,108
Which character will the choreographer want to use?

1278
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,338
I'm a bit worried.

1279
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:44,407
I'll move up and take the main lead role.

1280
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:48,108
I think I did better than Yu Chan today.

1281
00:55:48,347 --> 00:55:50,418
I don't think my role will be taken away.

1282
00:55:50,777 --> 00:55:53,088
I'll beat everyone today.

1283
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,688
The cast won't change.

1284
00:55:56,058 --> 00:55:59,627
(What will become of the 6 dancers after the fierce rehearsals?)

1285
00:55:59,628 --> 00:56:01,727
(The day of the Mega Stage Mission)

1286
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:04,497
(The day of the Mega Stage Mission shoot)

1287
00:56:04,498 --> 00:56:05,566
(The dancers enter to prepare for the performance.)

1288
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:06,596
(What?)

1289
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:07,597
What?

1290
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:09,437
Are you serious?

1291
00:56:09,438 --> 00:56:10,466
(The dancers look in one direction and become shocked.)

1292
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,467
What?

1293
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:12,567
What?

1294
00:56:13,268 --> 00:56:16,237
(Staring intently)

1295
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:17,537
(What shocked the dancers?)

1296
00:56:17,538 --> 00:56:19,307
- Let's go. - What?

1297
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,347
(Grinning)

1298
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,176
(The contemporary dancers become startled as well.)

1299
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:24,717
(My goodness)

1300
00:56:25,478 --> 00:56:27,147
(Why is everyone congratulating Yun Hyeok Jung?)

1301
00:56:27,148 --> 00:56:28,148
I mean...

1302
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:31,487
(The one fearing death: Kim Yu Chan to Yun Hyeok Jung)

1303
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:34,386
When I think about the solo part,

1304
00:56:34,387 --> 00:56:36,096
I want the interpretation of fear...

1305
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:39,026
to involve powerful energy. I want the dancer...

1306
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:41,526
to deliver that energy and show the body...

1307
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:43,167
that's full of fear.

1308
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:46,506
But Yu Chan's energy is quite shy.

1309
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:48,736
His moves were less expansive.

1310
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:52,207
I thought Hyeok Jung's interpretation of the character...

1311
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:55,817
and expressions were much closer to what I originally wanted.

1312
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,018
It was difficult to decide,

1313
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:02,687
but we should give him the solo part instead.

1314
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:03,816
(Changed from Kim Yu Chan to Yun Hyeok Jung)

1315
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:04,886
Congratulations.

1316
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:05,958
- Thank you. - I wish you luck.

1317
00:57:06,788 --> 00:57:11,128
I thought that I should pay them back for their trust in me.

1318
00:57:12,297 --> 00:57:14,466
(There's another person who has to accept what's happened.)

1319
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:16,438
- Goodness. - What?

1320
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:21,307
Already in the morning?

1321
00:57:21,308 --> 00:57:22,406
(He tries to hide his feelings.)

1322
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:24,838
I didn't expect to be noticed like this.

1323
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,047
(Kim Yu Chan heads to the waiting room.)

1324
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:29,247
(Startled)

1325
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:30,616
(Everyone is walking on eggshells.)

1326
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:32,287
(His hands become polite automatically.)

1327
00:57:32,288 --> 00:57:34,018
(Anxious)

1328
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:38,188
Are you happy?

1329
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:40,058
(He just laughs.)

1330
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:41,627
(My goodness)

1331
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:42,728
Good luck.

1332
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,257
(Feeling embarrassed, they can only laugh.)

1333
00:57:45,597 --> 00:57:47,497
The decision has been made.

1334
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:50,397
I decided to show what I've got...

1335
00:57:50,398 --> 00:57:52,168
for the remaining role.

1336
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:55,538
(Where people are busy, getting ready for the shoot)

1337
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:59,046
(Mega Stage film set)

1338
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,207
(Welcome to the makeup zone.)

1339
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:02,517
- It's sparkling. - This is nice.

1340
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:04,248
- This is MAC. - It's MAC, indeed.

1341
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:07,887
- Do I look good today? - You do.

1342
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:09,558
You look amazing.

1343
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:11,288
You look really handsome.

1344
00:58:11,918 --> 00:58:12,957
Hello, everyone.

1345
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:14,057
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1346
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:15,558
Do you have any ideas?

1347
00:58:15,797 --> 00:58:18,756
As the performance is about death,

1348
00:58:18,757 --> 00:58:20,297
something more majestic...

1349
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:24,397
There should be a different emphasis between...

1350
00:58:24,398 --> 00:58:26,767
the main roles and the sub roles and ensemble.

1351
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:27,966
Emphasis is important.

1352
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,677
With the pearl skin look, I'll make the skin elegant.

1353
00:58:31,878 --> 00:58:33,078
It's a concealer.

1354
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:37,248
I'll highlight these parts.

1355
00:58:37,578 --> 00:58:39,387
- My look is changing. - Isn't it completely different?

1356
00:58:39,918 --> 00:58:43,216
A concealer that lasts for a long time is very important.

1357
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:46,357
I'm applying glitters and gold underneath the eyes...

1358
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:48,027
to make you look stronger.

1359
00:58:48,257 --> 00:58:49,497
You look like an idol singer.

1360
00:58:49,498 --> 00:58:51,096
You look more beautiful today.

1361
00:58:51,097 --> 00:58:52,827
The makeup turned him into someone else.

1362
00:58:52,828 --> 00:58:53,897
Seriously.

1363
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:55,096
Do I look handsome?

1364
00:58:55,097 --> 00:58:56,768
- I look so beautiful today. - I agree.

1365
00:58:57,197 --> 00:58:58,537
Is this the power of MAC?

1366
00:58:58,538 --> 00:58:59,667
(Maximizing their beauty with makeup)

1367
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,838
I will do my best.

1368
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:03,308
I will work hard.

1369
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:05,477
Music, start.

1370
00:59:05,478 --> 00:59:07,947
(The Mega Stage shoot is in full swing now.)

1371
00:59:08,407 --> 00:59:09,477
It looks amazing.

1372
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:10,918
(Watching the monitor is a must.)

1373
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,447
It will turn out well.

1374
00:59:12,547 --> 00:59:14,288
It looks like they set the angle beforehand.

1375
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:17,788
Yes, that's how it is.

1376
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,386
This scene turned out really well.

1377
00:59:20,387 --> 00:59:22,057
(The Mega Stage performance is getting completed.)

1378
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,058
Six, seven, and eight.

1379
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:28,997
Good work, everyone.

1380
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,236
(The Mega Stage shoot ended successfully.)

1381
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:33,566
(The Mega Stage is finally revealed.)

1382
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:36,077
(The biggest scale that will hold you in awe)

1383
00:59:36,078 --> 00:59:37,078
(Exclaiming)

1384
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:38,136
(The Mega Stage performance...)

1385
00:59:38,137 --> 00:59:40,208
(will decide the best dancer.)

1386
00:59:40,907 --> 00:59:42,147
(Is the benefit getting the main lead role?)

1387
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:43,577
(I should become the best dancer at least once.)

1388
00:59:43,578 --> 00:59:46,247
(And the next mission)

1389
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:52,257
(What's the K-Contents Mission that surprised everyone?)

1390
00:59:53,228 --> 00:59:54,256
Hello.

1391
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,327
- Good morning. - Hello.

1392
00:59:55,328 --> 00:59:56,357
Hello.

1393
00:59:56,358 --> 00:59:57,497
(The dancers come to work at STF Dance Company.)

1394
00:59:57,498 --> 00:59:58,526
(In harmony)

1395
00:59:58,527 --> 00:59:59,797
(Hello)

1396
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,567
It looks like your hair got longer.

1397
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,237
What do you think that we'll do today?

1398
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,107
Won't it be an easy day today?

1399
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:08,168
Right?

1400
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:10,007
It's just the start.

1401
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:13,647
I will work hard again today.

1402
01:00:13,648 --> 01:00:14,777
(Smiling)

1403
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:16,677
Do I look good?

1404
01:00:16,978 --> 01:00:18,046
(The ballet prince always checks his looks.)

1405
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,248
(Holding back his laughter)

1406
01:00:20,347 --> 01:00:22,617
(All the dancers arrive peacefully again today.)

1407
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:25,317
(Mega Stage Mission)

1408
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,157
Is the video ready?

1409
01:00:27,788 --> 01:00:28,887
We'll get to watch it.

1410
01:00:29,427 --> 01:00:30,657
My heart is fluttering so much.

1411
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:32,967
Do you think that you'll get the benefit?

1412
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:34,228
- Me? - Yes.

1413
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:36,636
I'd love to. I should.

1414
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:37,997
(His honest feeling)

1415
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:40,668
I did my best during the Double Casting Audition,

1416
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:44,478
so I'm hoping for a positive result.

1417
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:47,847
I look forward to watching the fairies.

1418
01:00:48,047 --> 01:00:49,116
The Peter Pans?

1419
01:00:49,117 --> 01:00:50,117
Yes.

1420
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:52,077
Unless there's a huge change,

1421
01:00:52,078 --> 01:00:54,817
I have a chance of becoming the best dancer.

1422
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:57,717
I showed many of my weapons,

1423
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,427
so I have high hopes.

1424
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:02,657
Why do I feel so nervous?

1425
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:07,768
"Who will be the best dancer from the Double Casting Audition?"

1426
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:11,237
I kept thinking about that.

1427
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:15,236
I got my solo part taken away.

1428
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:18,878
I had hopes, but I felt nervous at the same time.

1429
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:22,077
(It's starting.)

1430
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,316
(Mega Stage starts with 3 main lead roles.)

1431
01:01:24,317 --> 01:01:27,886
(Everyone cheers.)

1432
01:01:27,887 --> 01:01:29,486
(What will the Mega Stage look like?)

1433
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:30,487
(Feeling shy)

1434
01:01:30,488 --> 01:01:31,958
(Different versions of Mega Stage will be revealed on Mnet Plus.)

1435
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:36,128
- His role looks amazing. - What's this?

1436
01:01:36,257 --> 01:01:37,998
Ho Jong's aura is too good to be true.

1437
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:39,797
He's good with hand movements.

1438
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:42,797
The look on Hyo Joon's face.

1439
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:48,237
Their shadows look intense.

1440
01:01:48,367 --> 01:01:49,736
(Anticipating)

1441
01:01:49,737 --> 01:01:50,838
The shadows look unbelievable.

1442
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,407
(Mega Stage opens.)

1443
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:55,978
(The biggest scale ever)

1444
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:57,347
This is crazy.

1445
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,018
Let's go.

1446
01:01:59,018 --> 01:02:00,018
(Gulping)

1447
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:01,847
(I'm Yun Hyeok Jung, the main lead role.)

1448
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:04,657
Unbelievable.

1449
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,328
That's how they changed it.

1450
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:09,358
The camera is on Hyeok Jung too much.

1451
01:02:10,257 --> 01:02:11,527
(Nervous)

1452
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:15,328
They filmed it so well.

1453
01:02:15,938 --> 01:02:17,237
It's giving me goosebumps.

1454
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,608
Hyeok Jung looks amazing in this scene.

1455
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:21,067
The best film of his life.

1456
01:02:26,907 --> 01:02:28,747
The quality is clearly different.

1457
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:29,748
(He's being moved.)

1458
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:32,277
- It's very majestic. - It looks amazing.

1459
01:02:33,188 --> 01:02:34,447
The ensemble appears often.

1460
01:02:36,717 --> 01:02:37,817
He's flexible.

1461
01:02:40,288 --> 01:02:41,458
They're so nicely in sync.

1462
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:44,328
Here it comes.

1463
01:02:47,728 --> 01:02:49,128
Isn't this the highlight?

1464
01:02:49,797 --> 01:02:51,438
Hyo Joon's dancing is charming.

1465
01:02:53,038 --> 01:02:55,067
- The legendary facial expression. - Here it comes.

1466
01:02:56,177 --> 01:02:57,177
You can see it.

1467
01:03:00,648 --> 01:03:01,648
(This is crazy.)

1468
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:03,578
Goodness.

1469
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:05,116
(Ho Jong the Great)

1470
01:03:05,117 --> 01:03:06,117
Hey!

1471
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:07,688
Ho Jong the Great.

1472
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,487
The look on his face is very nice.

1473
01:03:17,657 --> 01:03:19,268
His movements are sharp.

1474
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:20,727
The music makes it better.

1475
01:03:20,728 --> 01:03:23,237
He looks like a deity in a myth.

1476
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:24,997
His moves are so smooth.

1477
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:27,337
(His moves are so smooth.)

1478
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,136
(Make some noise!)

1479
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:30,538
Ho Jong did his thing.

1480
01:03:30,777 --> 01:03:32,006
(The main supporting role's part that everyone's been waiting for)

1481
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:33,007
You can see all of them.

1482
01:03:33,808 --> 01:03:34,907
It's him.

1483
01:03:35,308 --> 01:03:36,978
- The fairies. - They look pretty.

1484
01:03:37,878 --> 01:03:39,287
- Side kick. - How are they so flexible?

1485
01:03:39,288 --> 01:03:40,316
(Pretty fairies)

1486
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,317
(Side kick)

1487
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:49,027
- It's impossible to find us. - Where are we?

1488
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:53,867
The long hair stands out.

1489
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,137
- Seong Yun looks amazing. - Right.

1490
01:03:56,697 --> 01:03:57,966
(Posing)

1491
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,737
Did you see me teleporting?

1492
01:04:00,538 --> 01:04:01,567
(Coyness of long hair)

1493
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,108
(Double-cast dancers and the main lead roles coincide.)

1494
01:04:06,547 --> 01:04:07,776
This scene looks amazing.

1495
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:08,878
It looks incredible.

1496
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:10,777
I love this part.

1497
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:17,617
(Cheering vehemently)

1498
01:04:23,328 --> 01:04:24,997
(Their chemistry is amazing.)

1499
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:26,967
The double cast looks like the main role.

1500
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:31,538
Amazing!

1501
01:04:32,197 --> 01:04:34,007
There's the contemporary dance ensemble.

1502
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:37,538
Kim Jong Cheol.

1503
01:04:38,177 --> 01:04:39,346
Jong Cheol is good.

1504
01:04:39,347 --> 01:04:40,847
(Smiling with satisfaction)

1505
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:45,447
Goodness.

1506
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:47,747
Here comes the princess.

1507
01:04:47,748 --> 01:04:48,748
(The princess is concentrating.)

1508
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:53,127
(Karina appears with spectacular turns.)

1509
01:04:53,128 --> 01:04:54,927
- It's Karina! - All right.

1510
01:04:56,427 --> 01:04:57,458
What's that?

1511
01:04:59,297 --> 01:05:00,367
He looks sturdy.

1512
01:05:00,867 --> 01:05:02,228
(Fierce Hye Seong)

1513
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:04,197
(Pure and innocent Hye Seong)

1514
01:05:06,768 --> 01:05:07,808
The Aoya.

1515
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:12,007
Hye Hyun is doing his own dance.

1516
01:05:12,637 --> 01:05:14,748
- It looks amazing. - They're good.

1517
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:16,277
Hye Seong's eyes might explode.

1518
01:05:16,578 --> 01:05:17,647
(Fancy)

1519
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:19,486
- Cool. - Hye Seong's eyes might explode.

1520
01:05:19,487 --> 01:05:21,917
- Here it is. - It looks amazing from above.

1521
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:22,958
I love it.

1522
01:05:23,788 --> 01:05:25,518
It looks magnificent.

1523
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,787
From above, it looks different from what we saw.

1524
01:05:28,788 --> 01:05:29,796
It's nice.

1525
01:05:29,797 --> 01:05:31,558
The lighting on the floor is amazing too.

1526
01:05:35,128 --> 01:05:36,897
Ho Jong's face is incredible.

1527
01:05:36,898 --> 01:05:38,067
He looks too good to be true.

1528
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:39,768
Goodness.

1529
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:43,377
- This is amazing. - Seriously.

1530
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:45,236
(People can't stop complimenting the best Mega Stage.)

1531
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,248
It looks great.

1532
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:49,308
- No! - Gosh.

1533
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:55,088
Goodness.

1534
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,787
- Gosh. - What's that?

1535
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,587
(Different versions of Mega Stage will be revealed on Mnet Plus.)

1536
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:00,656
- What? - Goodness.

1537
01:06:00,657 --> 01:06:01,828
(Covering his mouth and stomping)

1538
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,297
Is that bromance?

1539
01:06:04,197 --> 01:06:06,027
Is this a dating show?

1540
01:06:06,998 --> 01:06:08,426
(The experienced one feels dizzy.)

1541
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:09,437
Hold on.

1542
01:06:09,438 --> 01:06:10,498
Wait a minute.

1543
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:12,668
(It's time to pause.)

1544
01:06:13,507 --> 01:06:14,507
(Goodness)

1545
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:15,737
(Embarrassed)

1546
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:16,777
The two of them.

1547
01:06:17,108 --> 01:06:18,177
- Ho Jong. - What?

1548
01:06:18,637 --> 01:06:19,776
- Ho Jong. - What?

1549
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:20,978
- What? - We look quite close.

1550
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,248
It can be...

1551
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:24,078
a little dangerous.

1552
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:25,748
It's close to love.

1553
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:28,817
- Good job. - Oh, thank you.

1554
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:31,858
- Did you apologize to him? - Apologize?

1555
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:32,986
I should.

1556
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:34,026
(He feels more embarrassed after watching the video.)

1557
01:06:34,027 --> 01:06:35,757
I had my solo part,

1558
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,157
so I am satisfied with that.

1559
01:06:38,757 --> 01:06:40,696
I was walking on eggshells...

1560
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:42,627
around Yu Chan in the locker room.

1561
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:43,838
(He was intimidated.)

1562
01:06:44,197 --> 01:06:45,797
In this video,

1563
01:06:46,237 --> 01:06:48,767
we could see the ensemble...

1564
01:06:48,768 --> 01:06:51,777
and other roles more than before.

1565
01:06:51,938 --> 01:06:54,177
The energy of the ensemble in the background was good too.

1566
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,277
The quality was...

1567
01:06:56,817 --> 01:06:59,217
- Didn't it come out well? - It was different.

1568
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:00,947
You looked so sexy.

1569
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,157
- You were great. - My face should've been zoomed in.

1570
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:07,057
For Second Class,

1571
01:07:07,058 --> 01:07:08,287
I liked how...

1572
01:07:08,288 --> 01:07:10,597
- they showed various techniques. - Right.

1573
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:11,927
Hye Hyun had...

1574
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:15,197
one shot that was quite heavy.

1575
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:18,236
(Kang Gyeong Ho...)

1576
01:07:18,237 --> 01:07:20,367
(and Kim Young Woong couldn't participate due to injuries.)

1577
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:22,608
I remember the fairies the most.

1578
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:25,878
I think that I showed everything that I could.

1579
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,347
I was satisfied.

1580
01:07:29,108 --> 01:07:32,478
Who do you think will receive the benefit?

1581
01:07:32,987 --> 01:07:36,256
Among the main lead roles,

1582
01:07:36,257 --> 01:07:39,788
Ho Jong seems to have the highest chance.

1583
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:41,527
Ho Jong is being unfair.

1584
01:07:42,788 --> 01:07:44,757
How is he so good? It's annoying.

1585
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:48,768
Being a double was an advantage.

1586
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:50,237
- Right. - Yes.

1587
01:07:50,498 --> 01:07:53,338
Since his face could be seen, he looked like the main dancer.

1588
01:07:54,268 --> 01:07:57,277
I think that Hyeok Jung will get the Double Casting benefit.

1589
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,437
He took the role from Yu Chan too.

1590
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:01,807
I think that you'll get it.

1591
01:08:02,277 --> 01:08:03,348
- Really? - Yes.

1592
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:04,647
I feel nervous.

1593
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:06,987
Hyeok Jung also did a good job.

1594
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:09,218
Regarding Hyeok Jung,

1595
01:08:09,317 --> 01:08:12,017
he did a lot for someone who was double-cast.

1596
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:15,328
I was half-hopeful and half-worried.

1597
01:08:15,788 --> 01:08:17,927
(Mega Stage Mission, Best Main Lead Role is revealed.)

1598
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,697
(Everyone is paying attention.)

1599
01:08:19,928 --> 01:08:21,998
Jin Ho, be the best dancer.

1600
01:08:22,468 --> 01:08:24,697
Dancers cast for main lead roles...

1601
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:26,837
and dancers who are double-cast...

1602
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:28,366
will be given a chance to choose...

1603
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:31,678
the main role in the next mission.

1604
01:08:31,777 --> 01:08:34,507
This benefit will be given to only one person...

1605
01:08:34,508 --> 01:08:36,547
among main lead roles, main supporting roles,

1606
01:08:36,548 --> 01:08:39,078
and double-cast dancers.

1607
01:08:39,718 --> 01:08:42,217
Here's how we'll determine the dancer to receive the benefit.

1608
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,657
Five sub lead roles will evaluate the main lead roles,

1609
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:48,288
and ten sub supporting roles will evaluate the main supporting roles.

1610
01:08:48,388 --> 01:08:50,097
The best double-cast dancer...

1611
01:08:50,098 --> 01:08:52,697
will be determined by the ensemble.

1612
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:54,598
Who will it be?

1613
01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:56,497
(The Best Main Lead Role)

1614
01:08:56,498 --> 01:08:57,597
(Choi Ho Jong, 5 votes)

1615
01:08:57,598 --> 01:08:58,668
He got all the votes.

1617
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:03,907
("It was clean and amazing. I give him credit for it.")

1618
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:07,707
(Choi Ho Jong dominated the stage with his unrivaled style.)

1619
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,476
He clearly showed his own dance.

1620
01:09:09,477 --> 01:09:12,548
- He's good again. - He did it like Ho Jong.

1621
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:17,187
I wished that his dance wouldn't end.

1622
01:09:18,218 --> 01:09:19,218
Thank you.

1623
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:22,888
I felt the need to grow more.

1624
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:26,468
I was especially thankful to the ensemble...

1625
01:09:26,767 --> 01:09:28,128
who danced in my scene.

1626
01:09:28,928 --> 01:09:30,097

1628
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:34,708
(Clapping in agreement)

1629
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:36,377
Congratulations, Hye Hyun.

1630
01:09:36,378 --> 01:09:37,476
("Technically, he was flawless." "I trust in his solid movements.")

1631
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:38,508
Thank you.

1632
01:09:38,777 --> 01:09:40,507
(Kim Hye Hyun increased the quality onstage...)

1633
01:09:40,508 --> 01:09:42,378
(with precise techniques and flawless movements.)

1634
01:09:43,147 --> 01:09:45,116
He gained our trust with his dance.

1635
01:09:45,117 --> 01:09:46,647
He's always reliable.

1636
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,187
His Aoya was excellent.

1637
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:51,817
Hye Hyun's technique was amazing.

1638
01:09:51,918 --> 01:09:55,027
He's very reliable like gukbap.

1639
01:09:55,588 --> 01:09:57,458
Gukbap? I like it.

1640
01:09:58,157 --> 01:10:00,397
People liked what I did, so I was picked.

1641
01:10:00,598 --> 01:10:03,167
Now, I feel pressured...

1642
01:10:03,168 --> 01:10:05,138
to show them more.

1643

1644

01:10:09,508 --> 01:10:11,906
(It's great news for the Under Class.)

1646
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,377
Everyone, Jin Ho won!

(Best Double Casting, Park Jin Ho)

1648
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:17,877
(He feels extremely happy.)

1649
01:10:17,878 --> 01:10:20,987
(Park Jin Ho dominated the stage with his earnest expressions.)

1650
01:10:21,117 --> 01:10:23,417
He's good at giving emphasis to his movements.

1651
01:10:23,418 --> 01:10:26,317
His expression also catches people's attention.

1652
01:10:26,588 --> 01:10:29,027
He looked very desperate in that moment.

1653
01:10:29,227 --> 01:10:30,258
That's true.

1654
01:10:30,498 --> 01:10:33,066
He's the only one in the ensemble who got double-cast.

1655
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:35,328
The effort that he made seems greater than others'.

1656
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,437
It's my first accomplishment.

1657
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:41,307
("I could feel him doing his best in every moment.")

1658
01:10:41,668 --> 01:10:43,378
- The hope of Under Class. - He's amazing.

1659
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,008
I received poor evaluations,

1660
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,147
but now, I'm qualified enough...

1661
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:51,277
to redeem myself.

1662
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,486
- I hope that it happens. - Hello.

1663

- What? - It's Oh Na Ra.

1664

(Things liven up as world-class celebrities appear.)

1673
01:11:14,407 --> 01:11:16,267
World-class.

1674
01:11:16,367 --> 01:11:17,907
- The scale is huge. - Right.

1675
01:11:18,078 --> 01:11:20,207
Dancers who are proving your skills...

1676
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,277
in your positions,

1677
01:11:22,508 --> 01:11:24,078
you have worked very hard.

1678
01:11:24,317 --> 01:11:26,078
You tell stories and express yourselves...

1679
01:11:26,277 --> 01:11:27,917
by moving your body.

1680
01:11:27,918 --> 01:11:30,616
I find your talent very mysterious...

1681
01:11:30,617 --> 01:11:32,218
and impressive.

1682
01:11:32,617 --> 01:11:35,328
You must've been startled to see me all of a sudden.

1683
01:11:35,888 --> 01:11:38,628
Here's why I appeared in front of you so suddenly.

1684
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:40,527
I can't wait to find out.

1685
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:43,168
Why did actors appear?

1686
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:45,697
They must be announcing our mission now.

1687
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:49,407
I'm about to tell you your next mission.

1688
01:11:49,737 --> 01:11:53,306
I'm closely related to your next mission.

1689
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:55,378
The next mission on Stage Fighter is...

1690
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:58,317
The next mission on Stage Fighter is...

1691
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:01,088
- What is it? - What is it?

1692
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:03,088
Stop.

1693
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,487
Drum roll.

1694
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:05,857
K-Contents...

1695
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:07,026
K-Contents...

1696
01:12:07,027 --> 01:12:08,928
It's the K-Contents Mission.

1697
01:12:09,588 --> 01:12:11,527
(K-Contents Mission)

1698
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:14,266
- "K-Contents?" - What does "K-Contents" mean?

1699
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:17,237
Does it include movies and dramas?

1700
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:18,867
Aren't you curious to find out...

1701
01:12:19,197 --> 01:12:22,437
what kind of K-Contents pieces will be given to you?

1702
01:12:23,538 --> 01:12:26,078
It's one of the movies that I was in.

1703
01:12:26,477 --> 01:12:27,477
- "Parasite." - "Parasite."

1704
01:12:27,478 --> 01:12:28,647
- "Parasite." - "Parasite."

1705
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:30,678
It's "Parasite."

1706
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:32,147
I knew it.

1707
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,287
(This is it.)

1708
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:34,347
I want to do this.

1709
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:36,146
(I want to do this, no matter what.)

1710
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:39,356
("Parasite," a luxurious party with dukes and aristocrats)

1711
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:43,227
"A class war between butlers and aristocrats."

1712
01:12:43,598 --> 01:12:46,128
To be honest, I look like an aristocrat.

1713
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:47,968
This music is perfect for ballet.

1714
01:12:48,828 --> 01:12:50,468
Korean dance would go well with it too.

1715
01:12:50,897 --> 01:12:52,066
I liked the melody...

1716
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:55,367
of the music in "Parasite," so I wanted to do it.

1717
01:12:55,737 --> 01:12:58,777
The K-Contents piece I'd like to introduce to you is...

1718
01:12:59,078 --> 01:13:01,477
a drama called "SKY Castle."

1719
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:04,877
("SKY Castle," children of the top 0.1 percent elitist family)

1720
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:06,847
(Everyone gapes at the sound of the legendary soundtrack.)

1721
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:07,918
This is it.

1722
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,588
This is it.

1723
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:12,458
It makes you feel overwhelmed.

1724
01:13:12,857 --> 01:13:13,928
I like the effect.

1725
01:13:14,888 --> 01:13:17,097
Didn't I come too far to play a student?

1726
01:13:17,098 --> 01:13:18,297
(A drama about high school students)

1727
01:13:18,298 --> 01:13:21,527
The K-Contents piece I'd like to introduce to you is...

1728
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:24,168
one of the works that I was in.

1729
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,367
It is...

1730
01:13:27,138 --> 01:13:29,606
"Squid Game."

1731
01:13:29,607 --> 01:13:31,806
(A survival game to win the absolute power with dance)

1732
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:34,547
- "Squid Game" is about survival. - Korean dance to this song...

1733
01:13:34,548 --> 01:13:35,607
What will you do?

1734
01:13:35,748 --> 01:13:37,578
- It sounds like fun. - I agree.

1735
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:40,718
Wouldn't it be interesting to show something Korean...

1736
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:41,887
with "Squid Game?"

1737
01:13:41,888 --> 01:13:44,718
It could be difficult with ballet.

1738
01:13:44,918 --> 01:13:46,387
The music didn't seem...

1739
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:48,888
suitable with ballet at all.

1740
01:13:48,987 --> 01:13:52,027
That's why I was attracted to it even more.

1741
01:13:52,197 --> 01:13:53,197
Now...

1742
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:55,598
- There must be more. - Is there more?

1743
01:13:55,828 --> 01:13:56,998
A movie by Director Park Chan Wook?

1744
01:13:57,267 --> 01:14:00,538
The K-Contents piece I'd like to introduce to you is...

1745
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,508
one of the movies that I directed.

1746
01:14:02,607 --> 01:14:04,807
- "Oldboy." - It must be "Oldboy."

1747
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:08,107
It's a movie called "Oldboy."

1748
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:10,516
(What's classic is forever.)

1749
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:11,947
Seriously? "Oldboy?"

1750
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,687
(A man dreams of escaping after being imprisoned for no reason.)

1751
01:14:15,718 --> 01:14:19,257
(The introduction is crazy.)

1752
01:14:19,258 --> 01:14:20,657
The music is amazing.

1753
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,986
Since it's a waltz,

1754
01:14:22,987 --> 01:14:25,557
it sounds the most familiar to ballet dancers.

1755
01:14:26,298 --> 01:14:27,428
I want to do this one.

1756
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:29,128
Goodness.

1757
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:31,767
It's number one based on the music.

1758
01:14:32,397 --> 01:14:35,767
As soon as I heard it, I thought that it'd be worth trying.

1759
01:14:35,807 --> 01:14:38,106
(Choosing the K-Contents Mission)

1760
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:39,177
(Choi Ho Jong got the benefit. Which one will he choose?)

1761
01:14:39,178 --> 01:14:40,807
I don't have enough information.

("It was clean and amazing. I give him credit for it.")

1763
01:14:43,477 --> 01:14:45,747
Okay, I'll choose this.

1764
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:49,147
I wanted to do it because I love the "Parasite" soundtrack.

1765
01:14:49,187 --> 01:14:51,458
(Kim Hye Hyun also has the benefit. Which work will he choose?)

1766
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:53,687
("Technically, he was flawless." "I trust in his solid movements.")

1767
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,726
I thought the concept behind "Oldboy" was...

1768
01:14:56,727 --> 01:14:58,297
the best match for me.

1769
01:14:58,298 --> 01:14:59,798
There was only one.

1770
01:15:00,227 --> 01:15:02,668
("I could feel him doing his best in every moment.")

(Park Jin Ho chooses "SKY Castle.")

1772

(Dancers with the benefit get their main roles.)

1773
01:15:09,107 --> 01:15:10,477
I'll go my way.

1774
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:13,678
(The dancers pick the work of their choice.)

1775
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:15,548
I'll pick what suits me.

1776
01:15:16,248 --> 01:15:19,417
As contemporary dancers got the benefit, we get what we want.

1777
01:15:19,418 --> 01:15:21,387
- There aren't many spots left. - Only four spots remain.

1778
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:22,817
- I'll do this. - It's complete.

(Choices Made for the K-Contents Mission)

1780

For the K-Contents Mission...

1781
01:15:30,098 --> 01:15:31,757
Main lead roles will be given...

1782
01:15:31,758 --> 01:15:33,526
based on the Role Casting Audition.

1783
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:35,428
(K-Contents Casting Board is revealed.)

1784
01:15:35,727 --> 01:15:38,997
(Main roles, supporting roles, and ensemble)

1785
01:15:38,998 --> 01:15:40,507
For "SKY Castle,"

1786
01:15:40,508 --> 01:15:43,307
Jin Ho got the benefit...

1787
01:15:43,407 --> 01:15:44,437
One of the main roles is already taken.

1788
01:15:44,538 --> 01:15:46,678
I'll take the remaining role.

1789
01:15:46,777 --> 01:15:48,847
I'm guaranteed to get the main role.

1790
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:50,217
I must get the main lead role...

1791
01:15:50,218 --> 01:15:52,947
to find the strength to get ahead.

1792
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,548
I'll risk my life to get it.

1793
01:15:54,687 --> 01:15:57,856
("Squid Game," lead roles, supporting roles, ensemble)

1794
01:15:57,857 --> 01:16:00,656
Still, compared to other teams,

1795
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:04,498
"Squid Game" doesn't have clear main dancers.

1796
01:16:04,657 --> 01:16:06,297
You're right. Only "Squid Game" doesn't have them.

1797
01:16:06,298 --> 01:16:07,598
It'll be even more competitive.

1798
01:16:07,928 --> 01:16:09,766
The fact that there's another spot...

1799
01:16:09,767 --> 01:16:12,066
means the odds are better.

1800
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,566
I think I could become one of the main lead dancers.

1801
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:16,167
The classes have been taken apart.

1802
01:16:16,168 --> 01:16:18,377
Whoever is First Class or gets the main lead role,

1803
01:16:18,378 --> 01:16:20,147
it wouldn't be weird at all.

1804
01:16:20,178 --> 01:16:21,848
I just had one thought, which was to be the main lead dancer.

1805
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,277
I want to be the final one.

1806
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:26,348
Only our team has two spots available.

1807
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:28,947
This could be doable.

1808
01:16:29,248 --> 01:16:31,486
("Parasite," main lead role Choi Ho Jong)

1809
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:34,927
Although Ho Jong took the main lead role,

1810
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:37,257
there's still another spot left.

1811
01:16:37,258 --> 01:16:38,627
I want to be the main lead the most.

1812
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:40,128
It would be fun to be the main lead dancer.

1813
01:16:40,428 --> 01:16:41,797
I thought I should definitely get the main lead role.

1814
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:43,766
I have no other choice. I'll just do it.

1815
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:46,137
I can just cheer them on.

1816
01:16:46,138 --> 01:16:48,538
I'll be watching the fire from across the river.

1817
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,077
("Oldboy," lead roles, supporting roles, ensemble)

1818
01:16:50,078 --> 01:16:51,537
(Main lead role Kim Hye Hyun)

1819
01:16:51,538 --> 01:16:53,447
I have to be the main lead dancer.

1820
01:16:54,407 --> 01:16:56,776
There was a strong competitive vibe...

1821
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:58,677
for taking the remaining main lead spot.

1822
01:16:58,678 --> 01:17:00,417
Everything besides the main lead is meaningless right now.

1823
01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:02,747
I'll win the main lead role for sure.

1824
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,718
I think they would've been jealous of me.

1825
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,217
(The Audition Rules)

1826
01:17:06,218 --> 01:17:07,226
(Eligibility for Main Choreography Creative Audition: All dancers)

1827
01:17:07,227 --> 01:17:09,928
- Oh, there's a creative part? - Do you have to choreograph it?

1828
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:12,257
All dancers who chose this performance can go for it.

1829
01:17:12,258 --> 01:17:13,427
(All dancers who chose this performance are eligible.)

1830
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:15,928
(Yes, so they could even use an Under's choreography.)

1831
01:17:16,267 --> 01:17:20,806
Then, we could see choreography from all 63 of us.

1832
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:24,078
The main lead will do the choreography chosen from that.

1833
01:17:24,508 --> 01:17:27,776
So, the Choreography Creative Audition isn't related to casting?

1834
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:30,677
If you audition for a role with the choreography perfectly memorized,

1835
01:17:30,678 --> 01:17:33,447
you could have an advantage since it's your own creation.

1836
01:17:34,088 --> 01:17:35,787
This is my chance.

1837
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:37,057
I'm confident.

1838
01:17:37,218 --> 01:17:39,656
The Unders haven't had a chance.

1839
01:17:39,657 --> 01:17:41,627
Let's show myself off.

1840
01:17:41,628 --> 01:17:43,656
For the other classes, this is an opportunity.

1841
01:17:43,657 --> 01:17:46,458
Everyone must be aiming for it.

1842
01:17:46,897 --> 01:17:48,696
I really wanted to dance to my own choreography.

1843
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,967
I'm confident when it comes to choreography creation.

1844
01:17:50,968 --> 01:17:52,567
I wasn't really worried.

1845
01:17:52,838 --> 01:17:56,007
Hello, I'm the MC of Stage Fighter, Kang Daniel.

1846
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:57,237
He's the scariest person.

1847
01:17:57,277 --> 01:18:00,607
Hey, brother. My brother.

1848
01:18:01,078 --> 01:18:03,617
I'm the MC of Stage Fighter, Kang Daniel.

1849
01:18:03,647 --> 01:18:06,577
For the second Class Movement Ceremony,

1850
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:08,616
we will start the K-Contents Mission.

1851
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:09,646
(The second Class Movement Ceremony?)

1852
01:18:09,647 --> 01:18:10,958
There will be changes in class?

1853
01:18:11,157 --> 01:18:12,617
How will the classes change?

1854
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:15,027
In this Class Movement Ceremony,

1855
01:18:15,428 --> 01:18:18,628
there will be eliminations for the first time.

1856
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:20,196
- Eliminations? - Eliminations?

1857
01:18:20,197 --> 01:18:21,197
(Oh, my...)

1858
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:22,897
(Goodness)

1859
01:18:23,668 --> 01:18:25,497
It's really getting started now.

1860
01:18:25,498 --> 01:18:26,498
It's the beginning.

1861
01:18:26,499 --> 01:18:30,538
I think people will be more desperate with eliminations.

1862
01:18:30,777 --> 01:18:33,476
It really woke me up with a jolt.

1863
01:18:33,477 --> 01:18:35,077
I don't want to be eliminated.

1864
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:36,877
Let's keep trying until the end.

1865
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,718
This mission would be worth risking my life over.

1866
01:18:40,078 --> 01:18:41,816
There is no such thing as being eliminated in my life.

1867
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,486
Soon, on the Mnet Plus app,

1868
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:45,717
the Seat Class Evaluation will begin with the full performance videos...

1869
01:18:45,718 --> 01:18:47,428
of the K-Contents Mission.

1870
01:18:47,788 --> 01:18:50,697
Please vote by choosing the seat class befitting the performance.

1871
01:18:51,057 --> 01:18:52,156
(The dancers are faced with...)

1872
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:54,526
(the K-Contents Poster Shoot Mission.)

1873
01:18:54,527 --> 01:18:55,597
(This is a battle of ideas.)

1874
01:18:55,598 --> 01:18:57,297
(Only the winning team's photos...)

1875
01:18:57,298 --> 01:18:59,497
(will be used as this performance's main poster.)

1876
01:18:59,498 --> 01:19:02,567
(Who will be the one to take the best benefit?)

1877
01:19:03,008 --> 01:19:05,077
(Time to create the main choreography for each performance)

1878
01:19:05,078 --> 01:19:09,007
I thought I wanted to do something very Korean.

1879
01:19:09,008 --> 01:19:11,816
I think I'll add something the public would like.

1880
01:19:11,817 --> 01:19:13,377
"What kind of character was Oh Dae Soo?"

1881
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:15,087
I thought about such things...

1882
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:17,758
to come up with some charming movements.

1883
01:19:18,117 --> 01:19:21,356
(The day of filming for each performance's main choreography)

1884
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:24,557
(The filming for the main choreography of "Parasite" begins.)

1885
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,667
I think I tried to pay attention to show the personality...

1886
01:19:28,668 --> 01:19:29,998
of the character in the beginning.

1887
01:19:30,237 --> 01:19:33,606
I think I tried to portray...

1888
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:35,537
the attitude of a duke...

1889
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:37,838
at a party.

1890
01:19:38,378 --> 01:19:39,637
(Scanning)

1891
01:19:39,638 --> 01:19:41,777
"I should do this. I should get this."

1892
01:19:41,907 --> 01:19:43,407
That was what I thought as I watched.

1893
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:45,777
Well, going up to perform...

1894
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:48,146
my own choreography...

1895
01:19:48,147 --> 01:19:49,548
is a great feeling.

1896
01:19:49,888 --> 01:19:52,317
Kim Young Woong's choreography...

1897
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:55,258
was very powerful and eye-catching.

1898
01:19:56,788 --> 01:19:58,957
(The filming for the main choreography of "Oldboy" begins.)

1899
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,397
(Creative choreography by Contemporary Dancer Kim Hye Hyun)

1900
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:04,497
I hoped to deliver...

1901
01:20:04,498 --> 01:20:05,936
the concept of the story.

1902
01:20:05,937 --> 01:20:08,736
I tried to express that...

1903
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:09,937
through imagery.

1904
01:20:11,378 --> 01:20:13,806
It didn't feel like "Oldboy."

1905
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:16,707
It felt too much like a young boy.

1906
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:18,477
(Creative choreography by Korean Dancer Ki Moo Gan)

1907
01:20:20,178 --> 01:20:22,186
I'm glad that I was able to...

1908
01:20:22,187 --> 01:20:25,257
add the movements I liked to such sentimental music...

1909
01:20:25,258 --> 01:20:26,718
and show people something.

1910
01:20:26,987 --> 01:20:30,227
I was finally able to show people my own dance.

1911
01:20:30,758 --> 01:20:31,857
I felt happy.

1912
01:20:33,197 --> 01:20:37,367
Moo Gan's style stood out way too much.

1913
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:41,737
He came up with something that no one could do besides him.

1914
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,337
(Filming for the main choreography of "Squid Game" begins.)

1915
01:20:45,338 --> 01:20:48,047
I heard tug-of-war being mentioned.

1916
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:52,446
So, I used a lot of push and pull...

1917
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,447
in my body.

1918
01:20:54,718 --> 01:20:56,686
The action and reaction of forces.

1919
01:20:56,687 --> 01:20:58,917
Being pushed and pulled.

1920
01:20:58,918 --> 01:21:00,958
I thought it would be nice to use these concepts.

1921
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:04,896
(Creative choreography by Contemporary Dancer Kim Hyun Ho)

1922
01:21:04,897 --> 01:21:08,266
Hyun Ho's choreography looked really hard to memorize.

1923
01:21:08,267 --> 01:21:10,937
It was very detailed,

1924
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:16,338
and although it included the imagery of "Squid Game" really well,

1925
01:21:17,277 --> 01:21:20,078
there were so many movements. That's what I felt.

1926
01:21:20,138 --> 01:21:21,976
(Filming for the main choreography of "SKY Castle" begins.)

1927
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,516
I tried to think about the character...

1928
01:21:24,517 --> 01:21:26,577
of an elite student a lot.

1929
01:21:26,578 --> 01:21:30,146
I wanted to express that the character acts tough...

1930
01:21:30,147 --> 01:21:31,357
but is actually very lonely.

1931
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,127
I thought it was about constant expression.

1932
01:21:34,128 --> 01:21:38,227
So, I expressed what I was feeling on the inside.

1933
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:45,138
(The Main Choreography Creative Audition with all 64 dancers ends.)

1934

(The Main Choreography Creative Audition results are revealed.)

1935
01:21:48,367 --> 01:21:49,467
They're announcing them right away?

1936
01:21:49,468 --> 01:21:50,476
(Sighing)

1937
01:21:50,477 --> 01:21:51,477
They're announcing the results.

1938
01:21:51,478 --> 01:21:53,008
This is so much pressure.

1939
01:21:53,307 --> 01:21:54,906
(The main creative choreography for "Parasite" is revealed.)

1940
01:21:54,907 --> 01:21:55,946
(Totally curious)

1941
01:21:55,947 --> 01:21:58,347
Who do you think are the likely candidates?

1942
01:21:58,348 --> 01:21:59,816
Ho Jong and Young Woong.

1943
01:21:59,817 --> 01:22:01,646
As long as it's not Young Woong or Ho Jong's choreography, it's good.

1944
01:22:01,647 --> 01:22:03,758
- I heard Ho Jong made it very hard. - Yes.

1945
01:22:04,187 --> 01:22:05,788
(Who will it be?)

1946
01:22:06,057 --> 01:22:07,726
The person whose choreography has been chosen...

1947
01:22:07,727 --> 01:22:09,357
for the Main Choreography Creative Audition is...

1948
01:22:09,588 --> 01:22:10,957
Choi Ho Jong.

1949
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:12,226
(We knew it.)

1950
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,697
(It's me!)

1951
01:22:13,928 --> 01:22:15,027
Congratulations.

1952
01:22:16,067 --> 01:22:18,566
As soon as I saw the results, I was worried about...

1953
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:21,067
whether people would be able to do this dance.

1954
01:22:21,468 --> 01:22:22,736
How will we do that?

1955
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,377
I was really worried.

1956
01:22:24,378 --> 01:22:25,406
It was charismatic...

1957
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:29,248
and had good techniques, expression, musicality, and even character.

1958
01:22:29,508 --> 01:22:32,047
I think he showed everything that he had in mind.

1959
01:22:32,048 --> 01:22:33,048
(The strong choreography that went as the dancer intended)

1960
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:34,646
- Who did "SKY Castle?" - Hyeok Jung and Yu Chan.

1961
01:22:34,647 --> 01:22:35,686
It's a rematch.

1962
01:22:35,687 --> 01:22:37,186
(This will be a big match.)

1963
01:22:37,187 --> 01:22:40,116
(During the Mega Stage Mission)

1964
01:22:40,117 --> 01:22:42,257
(Casting change for main lead solo, Kim Yu Chan to Yun Hyeok Jung)

1965
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:44,797
(Hyeok Jung had taken Yu Chan's main lead solo before.)

1966
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:46,757
(Mixed feelings)

1967
01:22:46,758 --> 01:22:48,026
(Yu Chan couldn't do anything but watch.)

1968
01:22:48,027 --> 01:22:49,097
I'm so curious.

1969
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:50,167
I'm looking forward to this.

1970
01:22:50,168 --> 01:22:52,998
- You look nervous. - I'm not. I don't expect anything.

1971
01:22:53,138 --> 01:22:55,366
(The main creative choreography for "SKY Castle" is revealed.)

1972
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:58,037
- Go. - I was really surprised.

1973
01:22:58,038 --> 01:23:01,847
It had really good basic skills and was nicely done overall.

1974
01:23:01,848 --> 01:23:03,748
And with the way it expressed the character,

1975
01:23:04,017 --> 01:23:06,218
it left a lasting impression.

1976
01:23:06,378 --> 01:23:07,548
What an interesting scene.

1977
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:11,116
You took my solo part, so I'll take your choreography.

1978
01:23:11,117 --> 01:23:12,517
Hang on a minute.

1979
01:23:12,718 --> 01:23:14,857
(The room is in an uproar after Yu Chan's provocation.)

1980
01:23:14,928 --> 01:23:17,798
I think it's time for me to steal his thunder.

1981
01:23:18,057 --> 01:23:20,498
I can't let him take it. I'll hold on to what's mine.

1982
01:23:20,697 --> 01:23:23,668
(The main creative choreography for "Squid Game" is revealed.)

1983
01:23:23,998 --> 01:23:24,998
(The whole group is surprised.)

1984
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:26,396
- This is bad. - I knew it.

1985
01:23:26,397 --> 01:23:27,468
We're in trouble.

1986
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:29,107
The choreography that has been chosen...

1987
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:31,707
is Kim Hyun Ho's choreography.

1988
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:32,936
(For "Squid Game," Kim Hyun Ho's main choreography is chosen.)

1989
01:23:32,937 --> 01:23:34,847
He has a good understanding of the content,

1990
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,707
and we could tell that...

1991
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:39,677
he considered how to express that in his choreography.

1992
01:23:39,678 --> 01:23:41,918
That was why we chose Kim Hyun Ho's choreography.

1993
01:23:42,088 --> 01:23:43,588
His has so many movements.

1994
01:23:43,647 --> 01:23:45,056
I was so glad.

1995
01:23:45,057 --> 01:23:48,226
Hyun Ho's choreography, which I wanted to avoid the most,

1996
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:49,486
had been chosen.

1997
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:50,828
I'm in big trouble.

1998
01:23:51,197 --> 01:23:52,627
Since Hyun Ho's was chosen,

1999
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:56,027
I'll make it mine and take it away from him. That's what I thought.

2000
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:59,098
(The main creative choreography for "Oldboy" is revealed.)

2001
01:23:59,298 --> 01:24:01,637
- Hye Hyun's choreography... - I bet it's Hye Hyun.

2002
01:24:01,638 --> 01:24:03,237
seems most likely for some reason.

2003
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:05,138
I'd be happy if they chose mine.

2004
01:24:05,178 --> 01:24:06,538
The choreography that has been chosen...

2005
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:09,906
(What?)

2006
01:24:09,907 --> 01:24:10,917
That's so unexpected.

2007
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:13,276
It's Kim Jong Cheol's choreography.

2008
01:24:13,277 --> 01:24:14,687
(For "Oldboy," Kim Jong Cheol's main choreography is chosen.)

2009
01:24:16,548 --> 01:24:18,057
What? That's me.

2010
01:24:18,218 --> 01:24:19,656
- What? - What?

2011
01:24:19,657 --> 01:24:21,588
I just hoped it wasn't this.

2012
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:23,727
It looks a bit hard.

2013
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:27,266
We thought that the character's mental state was...

2014
01:24:27,267 --> 01:24:30,567
most accurately expressed.

2015
01:24:30,767 --> 01:24:34,306
And the movements flowed with the music...

2016
01:24:34,307 --> 01:24:35,468
in a harmonious way.

2017
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:41,806
(The 4 choreographies for the casting audition have been chosen.)

2018
01:24:41,807 --> 01:24:44,146
But does it even make sense that there are two main leads?

2019
01:24:44,147 --> 01:24:45,578
We only have 16 dancers per group.

2020
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,646
Isn't it so weird that there are two who are confining someone else?

2021
01:24:47,647 --> 01:24:48,946
- It's weird. - Why are there two?

2022

(K-Contents Mission Rules)

2023

2024
01:24:52,317 --> 01:24:54,628
(will have a team battle. The ensemble dances with both teams.)

2025
01:24:55,027 --> 01:24:56,087
(Gasping)

2026
01:24:56,088 --> 01:24:57,328

01:25:02,168 --> 01:25:04,497
"will have a team battle."

01:25:04,498 --> 01:25:05,798
You're right. Goodness.

"The ensemble dances with both teams."

2032
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:12,337
We have to compete with other teams.

2033
01:25:12,338 --> 01:25:16,476
So I thought that my team should do well, first and foremost.

2034
01:25:16,477 --> 01:25:17,777
I'll have to choose good members.

2035
01:25:18,277 --> 01:25:20,146
And we'll have to have good teamwork.

(Main Role Casting Audition)

2037
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:24,257
(Eligibility: All dancers besides the confirmed main lead)

2038
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:26,217
For the Main Role Casting Audition,

2039
01:25:26,218 --> 01:25:28,526
you will perform the choreography...

2040
01:25:28,527 --> 01:25:31,498
that was chosen in the Main Choreography Creative Audition.

2041
01:25:31,628 --> 01:25:34,026
Only one dancer...

2042
01:25:34,027 --> 01:25:36,526
will be chosen as Team B's main lead dancer...

2043
01:25:36,527 --> 01:25:40,236
to compete against Team A's main lead dancer...

2044
01:25:40,237 --> 01:25:41,338
whose casting has already been confirmed.

2045
01:25:41,607 --> 01:25:43,606
Our main lead roles are undecided.

2046
01:25:43,607 --> 01:25:45,677
We have to choose both main leads.

2047
01:25:45,678 --> 01:25:47,446
That team will be in a bloody battle.

2048
01:25:47,447 --> 01:25:48,677
I'm jealous that they have two spots open.

2049
01:25:48,678 --> 01:25:51,917
The dancers who don't get called by the two main leads...

2050
01:25:51,918 --> 01:25:54,247
will be eliminated from the audition...

2051
01:25:54,248 --> 01:25:55,888
and confirmed as an ensemble member.

2052
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:59,687
If we don't get chosen as supporting dancers, we end up in the ensemble.

2053
01:25:59,987 --> 01:26:01,757
(No way.)

2054
01:26:01,758 --> 01:26:03,226
We could end up in the ensemble in one step.

2055
01:26:03,227 --> 01:26:05,927
(An ominous mood sweeps the Firsts' locker room.)

2056
01:26:05,928 --> 01:26:07,697
Still, it's my choreography.

2057
01:26:07,897 --> 01:26:11,798
I think I have a high chance of being chosen as the main lead.

2058
01:26:12,338 --> 01:26:16,137
My biggest goal is to be chosen as the elite student main lead role.

2059
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:18,907
Even the Unders could become main lead dancers.

2060
01:26:19,277 --> 01:26:21,107
This is the first ever mission where that could happen.

2061
01:26:21,477 --> 01:26:22,878
I can never miss out on this chance.

2062
01:26:23,147 --> 01:26:24,217
(The night of practicing for the casting audition)

2063
01:26:24,218 --> 01:26:25,418
We'll get started right away.

2064
01:26:26,178 --> 01:26:28,947
As you move your right leg, push.

2065
01:26:29,588 --> 01:26:31,088
Then, turn.

2066
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,656
I have to teach them...

2067
01:26:33,657 --> 01:26:35,156
and practice myself too.

2068
01:26:35,157 --> 01:26:37,287
I'm competing against these people...

2069
01:26:37,288 --> 01:26:39,526
and having to prepare for the audition as well.

2070
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,267
Since I was already confirmed, I felt proud of myself.

2071
01:26:42,928 --> 01:26:44,968
In a way, I was worried too.

2072
01:26:45,437 --> 01:26:46,797
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

2073
01:26:46,798 --> 01:26:48,767
- Could we play the song again? - You don't get to ask questions.

2074
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:50,906
(Half joking, half serious)

2075
01:26:50,907 --> 01:26:51,977
You can do whatever.

2076
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,146
I didn't ask.

2077
01:26:54,147 --> 01:26:56,248
I can follow along even without asking questions.

2078
01:26:56,607 --> 01:26:58,848
Hyeok Jung is wary of me.

2079
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:04,557
If Hye Seong adds his own style to my choreography,

2080
01:27:05,258 --> 01:27:07,958
my choreography could become poison for me.

2081
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:10,027
There's no reason why I can't win.

2082
01:27:11,057 --> 01:27:14,428
The angle where they kick their legs are so different from us.

2083
01:27:15,098 --> 01:27:16,367
They're so flexible.

2084
01:27:17,397 --> 01:27:18,697
It looks so energetic.

2085
01:27:19,697 --> 01:27:21,737
Yu Chan's dance doesn't look like ballet.

2086
01:27:22,107 --> 01:27:23,668
- I know. - His lines look like ballet.

2087
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:26,138
- But the way he moves is... - He doesn't move like a ballerino.

2088
01:27:26,807 --> 01:27:29,277
Actually, everyone followed along so well...

2089
01:27:29,748 --> 01:27:33,017
that I wasn't sure about myself as time went on.

2090
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,718
I really don't know anymore.

2091
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:38,817
I thought, Yun Hyeok Jung and Jung Hye Seong...

2092
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:41,828
Also, Kim Yu Chan.

2093
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:45,397
I think those three stood out to me the most.

2094
01:27:47,598 --> 01:27:50,627
We will now begin the Main Role Casting Audition...

2095
01:27:50,628 --> 01:27:53,197
for the "SKY Castle" team in the K-Contents Mission.

2096
01:27:53,338 --> 01:27:56,008
This is the most interesting part right here.

2097
01:27:56,168 --> 01:27:57,976
This team had a really intense competition.

2098
01:27:57,977 --> 01:28:00,508
I think the "SKY Castle" team has several good dancers.

2099
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,248
This team has so many talented people too.

2100
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:05,146
The Main Role Casting Audition...

2101
01:28:05,147 --> 01:28:07,316
for the "SKY Castle" team in the K-Contents Mission...

2102
01:28:07,317 --> 01:28:11,356
will be to choose the main lead and main supporting dancers.

2103
01:28:11,357 --> 01:28:14,227
The main lead will be cast through evaluations from...

2104
01:28:14,357 --> 01:28:17,088
the choreographer, myself, and the two coaches.

2105
01:28:17,157 --> 01:28:20,457
The main supporting roles will be cast by...

2106
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:23,498
the two who were cast as the main leads.

2107
01:28:25,098 --> 01:28:26,896
For the Main Role Casting Audition,

2108
01:28:26,897 --> 01:28:30,266
you will be performing the creative choreography by Yun Hyeok Jung...

2109
01:28:30,267 --> 01:28:34,008
which was chosen during the Main Choreography Creative Audition.

2110
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,307
All of the dancers who chose this team...

2111
01:28:36,508 --> 01:28:40,078
will be divided into three evaluation groups.

2112
01:28:40,678 --> 01:28:44,686
Only one dancer will be cast as the main lead of Team B...

2113
01:28:44,687 --> 01:28:48,486
to compete against the Team A main lead dancer, Park Jin Ho,

2114
01:28:48,487 --> 01:28:51,828
whose casting has been confirmed for the "SKY Castle" team.

2115
01:28:52,157 --> 01:28:53,258
Just one. Goodness.

2116
01:28:54,027 --> 01:28:55,266
Hello, everyone.

2117
01:28:55,267 --> 01:28:57,667
I'm choreographer Luda Lee in charge of "SKY Castle."

2118
01:28:57,668 --> 01:28:58,696
Nice to meet you.

2119
01:28:58,697 --> 01:29:01,207
(Welcoming her with enthusiasm)

2120
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:05,007
First, I will focus on how well you manage the given dance...

2121
01:29:05,008 --> 01:29:08,178
and whether you can express the concept of "SKY Castle..."

2122
01:29:08,378 --> 01:29:11,348
and its character as I evaluate you.

2123
01:29:12,277 --> 01:29:14,617
Hyeok Jung, this is your own choreography, correct?

2124
01:29:14,888 --> 01:29:18,157
Which person are you wary of the most?

2125
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:22,328
There's one dancer who has the closest style to myself.

2126
01:29:25,628 --> 01:29:29,998
I think Yu Chan has the most similar vibe as me.

2127
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:32,897
This is it.

2128
01:29:33,098 --> 01:29:34,538
Big match.

2129
01:29:34,668 --> 01:29:36,838
Since the Mega Stage Mission,

2130
01:29:37,267 --> 01:29:40,208
I had hoped we could learn from each other and go up together.

2131
01:29:40,538 --> 01:29:44,217
But he went and stole my part.

2132
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:45,247
So...

2133
01:29:45,248 --> 01:29:46,446
(Looking away)

2134
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:50,418
Now, I think it's my turn to steal his thunder.

2135
01:29:50,817 --> 01:29:52,757
- Nice! - Go, Yu Chan!

2136
01:29:52,758 --> 01:29:53,856
(Burning up)

2137
01:29:53,857 --> 01:29:55,057
- Steal it! - Let's go!

2138
01:29:55,388 --> 01:29:57,487
- Steal it! - I love your speech.

2139
01:29:57,628 --> 01:29:59,226
I think it's time for me to beat Hyeok Jung...

2140
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,968
and win the main lead role.

2141
01:30:01,428 --> 01:30:04,236
I've been eyeing this role the whole time but never got it.

2142
01:30:04,237 --> 01:30:06,037
I think it's really time for me to take this spot.

2143
01:30:06,038 --> 01:30:07,767
I'll put my life on the line to win this role.

2144
01:30:08,067 --> 01:30:10,637
If I take that spot when I was an Under,

2145
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:12,436
I could be able to make history.

2146
01:30:12,437 --> 01:30:15,107
The main lead role is what I must win, no matter what.

2147
01:30:15,508 --> 01:30:19,777
We will now begin the Main Lead Role Audition for "SKY Castle."

2148
01:30:20,517 --> 01:30:22,317
Jin Ho was saying he felt so confused...

2149
01:30:23,187 --> 01:30:24,657
about who to choose.

2150
01:30:24,817 --> 01:30:26,217
Our team is so difficult to choose from.

2151
01:30:26,218 --> 01:30:27,418
- Which person to choose? - Yes.

2152
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:29,927
The "SKY Castle" team is really talented.

2153
01:30:29,928 --> 01:30:31,128
I thought I was going crazy.

2154
01:30:31,328 --> 01:30:33,827
I think I was contemplating which dancer to choose...

2155
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:36,026
so that I can stand out...

2156
01:30:36,027 --> 01:30:37,598
but have them fill the parts that I am lacking in.

2157
01:30:38,138 --> 01:30:41,366
The first group, we'll have Lee Jin Woo, Moon Jun On,

2158
01:30:41,367 --> 01:30:44,208
Jang June Hyuk, and Jung Hye Seong.

2159
01:30:44,477 --> 01:30:45,607
First position.

2160
01:30:46,838 --> 01:30:48,107
The pose is hard already.

2161
01:30:48,378 --> 01:30:49,977
Music, start.

2162
01:30:50,647 --> 01:30:53,277
Three, two, one.

2163
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:54,748
Go.

2164
01:30:56,588 --> 01:30:57,588
(Impressed)

2165
01:30:57,589 --> 01:30:59,588
Hye Seong is pushing forward with his head.

2166
01:31:00,157 --> 01:31:03,388
(Grabbing everyone's attention)

2167
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:04,628
Oh, Hye Seong.

2168
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,727
Nice. He's so good.

2169
01:31:14,538 --> 01:31:16,406
Those two are definitely moving well.

2170
01:31:16,407 --> 01:31:17,537
They look like they're dancing in sync.

2171
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:18,638
They're perfectly in sync.

2172
01:31:19,237 --> 01:31:21,047
(Hye Seong and June Hyuk grab their attention by being in sync.)

2173
01:31:21,048 --> 01:31:22,507
June Hyuk has good energy.

2174
01:31:22,508 --> 01:31:23,508
(Practicing in the meantime)

2175
01:31:25,748 --> 01:31:27,748
- Hye Seong is crazy. - Nice jump.

2176
01:31:30,317 --> 01:31:32,187
I think he got confused about the order.

2177
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:34,017
He got lost.

2178
01:31:35,428 --> 01:31:37,828
Three, two, one.

2179
01:31:38,328 --> 01:31:39,397
Stop.

2180
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:42,227
They're so good.

2181
01:31:42,428 --> 01:31:45,498
Hye Seong is hardcore. He's insane.

2182
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:47,297
He's all the way at the end,

2183
01:31:47,298 --> 01:31:49,168
but I only saw him through everyone else.

2184
01:31:50,168 --> 01:31:53,537
The second group, we'll have Kim Tae Seok, Kim Tae Gang,

2185
01:31:53,538 --> 01:31:56,848
Kim Yu Chan, and Kim In Su.

2186
01:31:57,147 --> 01:31:58,718
The order is a shame.

2187
01:31:58,878 --> 01:32:02,447
Yu Chan and Hyeok Jung should've been in the same group.

2188
01:32:02,718 --> 01:32:05,016
- Right. - I'm looking forward to Yu Chan.

2189
01:32:05,017 --> 01:32:07,517
Three, two, one.

2190
01:32:08,157 --> 01:32:09,157
Go.

2191
01:32:12,758 --> 01:32:15,928
I think Tae Seok tried to interpret it in a ballet style.

2192
01:32:18,298 --> 01:32:19,298
(Stretching)

2193
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,396
(This is it.)

2194
01:32:20,397 --> 01:32:21,736
He has an incredible kick.

2195
01:32:21,737 --> 01:32:23,107
He has great lines.

2196
01:32:25,477 --> 01:32:26,737
These guys are so good.

2197
01:32:26,977 --> 01:32:28,848
This competition is fierce too.

2198
01:32:29,407 --> 01:32:30,447
I love it.

2199
01:32:32,418 --> 01:32:33,748
I love Yu Chan's facial expression.

2200
01:32:34,117 --> 01:32:35,947
Tae Seok is doing amazing.

2201
01:32:37,088 --> 01:32:38,088
(Stretching again)

2202
01:32:38,088 --> 01:32:39,088
(He tore up the stage.)

2203
01:32:39,089 --> 01:32:40,117
There you go.

2204
01:32:41,687 --> 01:32:42,687
(Nervous)

2205
01:32:46,557 --> 01:32:48,397
Yu Chan's eyes have gone mad.

2206
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:50,428
He's channeling some spirit.

2207
01:32:50,897 --> 01:32:52,396
(No way.)

2208
01:32:52,397 --> 01:32:53,397
(Impressed)

2209
01:32:53,897 --> 01:32:57,367
Three, two, one. Stop.

2210
01:32:58,078 --> 01:32:59,606
Yu Chan is insane.

2211
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:01,146
I think Yu Chan is a madman.

2212
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:03,178
You could tell that Yu Chan was so full of that dogged spirit.

2213
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:05,077
And that'll make Hyeok Jung feel shaken up.

2214
01:33:05,078 --> 01:33:08,218
I thought there was a chance for me to become the main lead.

2215
01:33:08,348 --> 01:33:10,548
I could actually steal his choreography.

2216
01:33:10,947 --> 01:33:15,888
The third group, we'll have Jung Min Chan and Yun Hyeok Jung.

2217
01:33:17,088 --> 01:33:18,396
Five, four,

2218
01:33:18,397 --> 01:33:20,797
- I was wary of Yu Chan. - three, two,

2219
01:33:20,798 --> 01:33:22,598
- I should really do even better. - one. Go.

2220
01:33:25,498 --> 01:33:26,598
(Jaw dropping)

2221
01:33:30,867 --> 01:33:32,606
Min Chan is staying calm.

2222
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,607
Min Chan isn't bad either.

2223
01:33:36,848 --> 01:33:37,848
(Yun Hyeok Jung's lethal kick)

2224
01:33:38,317 --> 01:33:39,317
(He's good.)

2225
01:33:43,388 --> 01:33:44,718
He's sexy.

2226
01:33:48,487 --> 01:33:49,687
They're dancing like this is a duet.

2227
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:52,027
He's not backing down either.

2228
01:33:58,468 --> 01:33:59,937
(A crazy thrill)

2229
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:01,267
Nice!

2230
01:34:05,038 --> 01:34:06,338
Gosh, I love this so much.

2231
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:10,348
(The two competed fiercely until the very end.)

2232
01:34:10,848 --> 01:34:13,218
Three, two, one.

2233
01:34:13,777 --> 01:34:14,817
Stop.

2234
01:34:15,548 --> 01:34:16,616
All right.

2235
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:17,747
(Feeling confused)

2236
01:34:17,748 --> 01:34:18,757
(Satisfied)

2237
01:34:18,758 --> 01:34:20,687
This group was amazing.

2238
01:34:20,958 --> 01:34:22,757
Hyeok Jung is so good.

2239
01:34:22,758 --> 01:34:26,897
Hyeok Jung's dance doesn't even have a tiny bit of error.

2240
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:29,827
I personally want to see Yu Chan and Hyeok Jung...

2241
01:34:29,828 --> 01:34:32,236
dance together in the same group.

2242
01:34:32,237 --> 01:34:33,798
They stand out so much.

2243
01:34:34,907 --> 01:34:36,507
Jang June Hyuk.

2244
01:34:36,508 --> 01:34:38,306
This dance requires that you show the pressures of college exams...

2245
01:34:38,307 --> 01:34:41,677
and a rebellious manly power.

2246
01:34:41,678 --> 01:34:44,177
I thought you expressed that manly power really well.

2247
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:47,918
I enjoyed how you released your energy outwardly.

2248
01:34:48,117 --> 01:34:49,888
Jung Hye Seong.

2249
01:34:50,048 --> 01:34:51,686
In your expressive abilities,

2250
01:34:51,687 --> 01:34:54,627
I could tell that you were actively portraying the character.

2251
01:34:54,628 --> 01:34:58,556
I liked that you expressed the concept of "SKY Castle" well.

2252
01:34:58,557 --> 01:35:01,726
And the two of you...

2253
01:35:01,727 --> 01:35:04,298
danced together so well as if you were a pair.

2254
01:35:04,767 --> 01:35:06,367
Kim Tae Seok.

2255
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:08,866
You were actively expressing yourself,

2256
01:35:08,867 --> 01:35:12,477
and I thought you were very immersive and dynamic.

2257
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:14,508
Jung Min Chan.

2258
01:35:14,947 --> 01:35:17,606
This was Yun Hyeok Jung's choreography...

2259
01:35:17,607 --> 01:35:19,917
and despite being right next to the original choreographer,

2260
01:35:19,918 --> 01:35:22,717
you weren't lacking in comparison at all.

2261
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:25,657
You had good control, expression, flexibility,

2262
01:35:25,788 --> 01:35:29,057
and in all areas overall.

2263
01:35:29,428 --> 01:35:32,157
I could feel the strong desperation in your eyes.

2264
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:33,798
I enjoyed your performance.

2265
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,067
This is the rebellion of the Unders.

2266
01:35:37,468 --> 01:35:38,737
Kim Yu Chan.

2267
01:35:38,968 --> 01:35:42,436
I thought you were a ballerino who was only made for ballet.

2268
01:35:42,437 --> 01:35:44,366
As I watched, I thought you might have a hard time...

2269
01:35:44,367 --> 01:35:46,208
breaking out of that shell.

2270
01:35:46,437 --> 01:35:48,507
But you showed us a new language of dance...

2271
01:35:48,508 --> 01:35:53,178
that you could express as a ballerino. I enjoyed it so much.

2272
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:56,117
I didn't think that I was bad,

2273
01:35:56,218 --> 01:35:58,317
but no one gave me an evaluation.

2274
01:35:58,617 --> 01:36:01,157
So I was like, "Why isn't anyone talking about me?"

2275
01:36:01,857 --> 01:36:03,287
This is very shocking.

2276
01:36:03,288 --> 01:36:06,428
No one made comments about Hyeok Jung. It's unbelievable.

2277
01:36:06,657 --> 01:36:08,697
Hyeok Jung doesn't look happy.

2278
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:11,097
- He doesn't look happy. - Hey, sit down.

2279
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,138
- Hyeok Jung doesn't look good. - Sit back down.

2280
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:18,078
I didn't think that I did terribly.

2281
01:36:18,477 --> 01:36:20,777
Am I going to be sent to Under Class?

2282
01:36:21,107 --> 01:36:22,107
That's ridiculous.

2283
01:36:22,548 --> 01:36:23,806
(Extremely worried)

2284
01:36:23,807 --> 01:36:27,117
Is my choreography going to betray me? I'll be in trouble.

2285
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:30,347
The choreographers are seen as the standard...

2286
01:36:30,348 --> 01:36:31,888
for the choreography.

2287
01:36:32,057 --> 01:36:35,458
He has to stand out even more. Just doing the choreography is...

2288
01:36:35,788 --> 01:36:38,157
- already difficult. - Right.

2289
01:36:38,258 --> 01:36:40,598
Hyeok Jung might be having a mental breakdown.

2290
01:36:41,227 --> 01:36:43,726
This work requires the technique...

2291
01:36:43,727 --> 01:36:45,767
of a ballet dancer.

2292
01:36:45,867 --> 01:36:47,766
In terms of movements,

2293
01:36:47,767 --> 01:36:50,208
we need contemporary dancers who are masculine.

2294
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:54,107
In my opinion, these two are the best fit.

2295
01:36:54,307 --> 01:36:56,646
To be honest, I want to see more.

2296
01:36:56,647 --> 01:36:58,547
This isn't just ballet.

2297
01:36:58,548 --> 01:37:01,147
I want to see how much more they can dance.

2298
01:37:01,418 --> 01:37:03,017
The evaluation was taking longer than usual.

2299
01:37:03,447 --> 01:37:06,317
It was unpredictable. I felt nervous.

2300
01:37:07,157 --> 01:37:10,128
I'd like to see these two dancers.

2301
01:37:10,828 --> 01:37:12,458
It has to be me.

2302
01:37:12,857 --> 01:37:16,027
I was confident about doing better. I must do better.

2303
01:37:16,298 --> 01:37:18,897
I had a chance of getting eliminated.

2304
01:37:19,138 --> 01:37:20,338
I didn't want to believe it.

2305
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,638
Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung and...

2306
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:24,567
I felt relieved.

2307
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:26,078
Dancer Kim Yu Chan.

2308
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,977
Do I have to compete against Hyeok Jung again?

2309
01:37:29,048 --> 01:37:31,918
I thought that it wouldn't be easy.

2310
01:37:32,218 --> 01:37:34,787
With the same music,

2311
01:37:34,788 --> 01:37:37,718
please be free and show us your dance.

2312
01:37:38,388 --> 01:37:41,458
- This is it. - This will be big.

2313
01:37:41,557 --> 01:37:43,727
It will be a fight between water and fire.

2314
01:37:43,857 --> 01:37:45,628
A fight between a unicorn and a red horse.

2315
01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:47,027
(Anticipating)

2316
01:37:47,798 --> 01:37:50,266
I should attract more of their attention.

2317
01:37:50,267 --> 01:37:51,638
I should dance with all my might.

2318
01:37:52,197 --> 01:37:55,106
I pulled all the energy that I possibly could.

2319
01:37:55,107 --> 01:37:57,066
Okay, I'll give my all.

2320
01:37:57,067 --> 01:37:59,707
Hyeok Jung needs that kind of stimulus to really go after it.

2321
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:02,548
He's gentle, but he can be quite competitive.

2322
01:38:03,807 --> 01:38:05,447
(How will Hyeok Jung and Yu Chan's improvisation battle turn out?)

2323
01:38:05,617 --> 01:38:09,088
Three, two, one. Go.

2324
01:38:15,428 --> 01:38:16,557
Gosh.

2325
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:19,498
- He's covering him. - Yu Chan became spiteful.

2326
01:38:21,567 --> 01:38:23,367
(A competition of technique)

2327
01:38:23,468 --> 01:38:24,468
He's covering him.

2328
01:38:24,469 --> 01:38:25,538
(The two dancers dance without yielding at all.)

2329
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:32,777
(A turn of satisfaction)

2330
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:34,407
Goodness.

2331
01:38:34,508 --> 01:38:35,578
Gosh.

2332
01:38:37,348 --> 01:38:41,517
(There's power and elegance in their performance.)

2333
01:38:43,947 --> 01:38:44,957
They're so good.

2334
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:45,987
(At that moment)

2335
01:38:48,487 --> 01:38:49,887
He's starting to turn.

2336
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:50,958
(Holding her hands tightly)

2337
01:38:51,088 --> 01:38:52,527
What's this, a show?

2338
01:38:52,598 --> 01:38:53,757
Let's go, Yu Chan!

2339
01:38:53,758 --> 01:38:54,767
(His elegant manege against the powerful turn)

2340
01:38:55,668 --> 01:38:56,727
(Nervous and focused)

2341
01:38:56,867 --> 01:38:57,897
(Stumbling)

2342
01:39:00,737 --> 01:39:02,707
- Oh, no. Yu Chan. - Keep going.

2343
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:05,477
(Two of them poured their everything into it.)

2344
01:39:06,078 --> 01:39:09,347
Three, two, one. Stop.

2345
01:39:09,348 --> 01:39:10,378
("SKY Castle" Casting Audition additional evaluation ends.)

2346
01:39:10,407 --> 01:39:11,477
Goodness.

2347
01:39:11,947 --> 01:39:13,178
It's harder to choose now.

2348
01:39:13,277 --> 01:39:14,718
Goodness, Yu Chan.

2349
01:39:14,817 --> 01:39:16,487
Yu Chan is insane.

2350
01:39:16,588 --> 01:39:18,787
It's Hyeok Jung who's insane.

2351
01:39:18,788 --> 01:39:20,458
How many illusion turns did he do?

2352
01:39:20,557 --> 01:39:23,157
It was crazy. It was the best I've seen.

2353
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:25,497
Yu Chan crushed it in the beginning.

2354
01:39:25,498 --> 01:39:26,798
Hyeok Jung was amazing at the end.

2355
01:39:27,098 --> 01:39:29,668
They're making it difficult again. This is annoying.

2356
01:39:29,928 --> 01:39:32,397
Picking between them would be so difficult.

2357
01:39:33,668 --> 01:39:35,008
The dancer to compete...

2358
01:39:35,267 --> 01:39:38,378
against main lead role Park Jin Ho from Team A.

2359
01:39:38,807 --> 01:39:42,178
I'll announce the dancer who's cast...

2360
01:39:42,277 --> 01:39:45,117
for Team B's main lead role, an elite student.

2361
01:39:46,017 --> 01:39:48,686
The dancer who's cast...

2362
01:39:48,687 --> 01:39:50,686
for Team B's main lead role on "SKY Castle,"

2363
01:39:50,687 --> 01:39:52,687
which is an elite student...

2364
01:39:53,987 --> 01:39:55,856
I definitely showed it to them,

2365
01:39:55,857 --> 01:39:58,258
so wouldn't they pick me?

2366
01:39:58,928 --> 01:40:00,856
I was desperately praying...

2367
01:40:00,857 --> 01:40:02,128
for my name to be called.

2368
01:40:03,668 --> 01:40:05,138
It's Contemporary Dancer...

2369
01:40:05,168 --> 01:40:07,736
Yun Hyeok Jung. Congratulations.

2370
01:40:07,737 --> 01:40:09,338
("SKY Castle" Team B's main lead role, Yun Hyeok Jung)

2371
01:40:09,638 --> 01:40:10,767
(Congratulations, Hyeok Jung.)

2372
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:14,736
As befits the original choreographer,

2373
01:40:14,737 --> 01:40:16,406
your expression was...

2374
01:40:16,407 --> 01:40:18,946
very clean and controlled.

2375
01:40:18,947 --> 01:40:22,248
You showed the beauty of restraint.

2376
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:24,787
With much more explosive energy,

2377
01:40:24,788 --> 01:40:26,917
you have both the flexibility and strength.

2378
01:40:26,918 --> 01:40:29,628
Your technical movements were excellent.

2379
01:40:29,727 --> 01:40:31,556
The rebellious look in your eyes...

2380
01:40:31,557 --> 01:40:33,258
would be suitable...

2381
01:40:33,357 --> 01:40:35,428
to play the main lead role.

2382
01:40:36,527 --> 01:40:38,337
There were many ups and downs...

2383
01:40:38,338 --> 01:40:39,967
before I got the main lead role.

2384
01:40:39,968 --> 01:40:43,067
I'm very happy that I finally got it.

2385
01:40:43,168 --> 01:40:45,437
Now that I got the main lead role,

2386
01:40:45,538 --> 01:40:47,378
I must do very well this time.

2387
01:40:47,737 --> 01:40:50,407
The main lead role from each team, Park Jin Ho...

2388
01:40:50,647 --> 01:40:52,017
and Yun Hyeok Jung.

2389
01:40:52,218 --> 01:40:55,617
Among five dancers behind you,

2390
01:40:55,718 --> 01:40:58,958
you'll call two names and cast them.

2391
01:40:59,418 --> 01:41:01,088
We'll start with Park Jin Ho.

2392
01:41:01,187 --> 01:41:03,987
Please cast dancers of your choice for the main supporting role.

2393
01:41:04,157 --> 01:41:07,458
The dancer I'll cast for the main supporting role is...

2394
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:10,896
I'm a dancer who can't be replaced.

2395
01:41:10,897 --> 01:41:13,267
Wouldn't he pick me?

2396
01:41:13,668 --> 01:41:16,168
I definitely showed my skills in front of them.

2397
01:41:16,407 --> 01:41:18,067
I had hopes.

2398
01:41:18,338 --> 01:41:19,436
(Who will be Park Jin Ho's first choice?)

2399
01:41:19,437 --> 01:41:20,838
It's Dancer Kim Yu Chan.

2400
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:23,578
("SKY Castle" Team A's main supporting role, Kim Yu Chan)

2401
01:41:23,848 --> 01:41:26,047
He could show ballet moves...

2402
01:41:26,048 --> 01:41:27,747
that I don't have.

2403
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:30,718
Yu Chan is much more flexible than me.

2404
01:41:30,817 --> 01:41:32,218
He has a strong foundation.

2405
01:41:32,317 --> 01:41:34,587
I picked Yu Chan who can cover...

2406
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:35,958
what I lack.

2407
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:38,357
Please call out your second dancer.

2408
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:41,458
The dancer I'll cast for the main supporting role is...

2409
01:41:41,968 --> 01:41:44,567
I thought that I could overcome this crisis.

2410
01:41:44,668 --> 01:41:45,668
I felt confident.

2411
01:41:45,968 --> 01:41:47,567
He might pick Min Chan.

2412
01:41:48,197 --> 01:41:50,067
It's Dancer Jang June Hyuk.

2413
01:41:50,468 --> 01:41:53,807
His looks and physique are both impressive.

2414
01:41:53,907 --> 01:41:56,678
I wanted to pick someone who had matching energy as mine.

2415
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,477
That's why I picked Jang June Hyuk.

2416
01:41:58,578 --> 01:42:01,317
Shall we start the main supporting role casting for Team B?

2417
01:42:01,788 --> 01:42:04,588
The dancer I'll cast for the main supporting role is...

2418
01:42:05,187 --> 01:42:07,617
I felt confident that someone would pick me.

2419
01:42:07,857 --> 01:42:10,888
Being in the ensemble will be bad news. I'll get eliminated.

2420
01:42:11,157 --> 01:42:12,897
I felt anxious.

2421
01:42:13,897 --> 01:42:15,727
It's Dancer Jung Hye Seong.

2422
01:42:15,968 --> 01:42:18,367
I got this one.

2423
01:42:18,538 --> 01:42:20,668
Hye Seong is a rebellious boy.

2424
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:22,767
He's perfect for the role.

2425
01:42:23,067 --> 01:42:24,637
Hye Seong's strength is...

2426
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:27,337
that his dancing energy is unique and strong.

2427
01:42:27,338 --> 01:42:30,348
He was the perfect match for someone rebellious.

2428
01:42:30,748 --> 01:42:32,247
Luckily, Hyeok Jung got...

2429
01:42:32,248 --> 01:42:34,547
got a very strong weapon.

2430
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:35,817
It's impossible for him to lose.

2431
01:42:36,088 --> 01:42:37,317
That weapon is me.

2432
01:42:38,958 --> 01:42:40,957
Please pick your second dancer.

2433
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:43,557
The dancer I'll cast for the main supporting role is...

2434
01:42:43,828 --> 01:42:46,628
(Who will get the last main supporting role?)

2435
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,498
There was only one spot left.

2436
01:42:50,067 --> 01:42:52,168
If I'm sent to the ensemble, I'll turn black.

2437
01:42:52,397 --> 01:42:55,267
Will I be able to get somewhere safe from the edge of this cliff?

2438
01:42:55,567 --> 01:42:56,708
I hoped that he'd call my name.

2439
01:42:57,267 --> 01:42:59,807
The dancer I'll cast for the main supporting role is...

2440
01:43:00,977 --> 01:43:02,548
Dancer Kim Tae Seok.

2441
01:43:03,078 --> 01:43:04,878
(Bowing thankfully)

2442
01:43:06,477 --> 01:43:08,547
I picked Tae Seok because...

2443
01:43:08,548 --> 01:43:11,657
his jumps and turns will be good and precise.

2444
01:43:12,157 --> 01:43:15,628
I hope that both teams will do your best and prove yourselves.

2445
01:43:15,788 --> 01:43:18,056
For my first main lead role,

2446
01:43:18,057 --> 01:43:21,027
I'll pour my everything into it.

2447
01:43:21,258 --> 01:43:23,098
Jin Ho should stay wary.

2448
01:43:23,428 --> 01:43:24,997
On my team,

2449
01:43:24,998 --> 01:43:26,998
I have Yu Chan, the gem of ballet...

2450
01:43:27,098 --> 01:43:29,838
and Jang June Hyuk, the handsomest contemporary dancer.

2451
01:43:29,968 --> 01:43:31,168
That's all I have to explain.

2452
01:43:31,678 --> 01:43:33,907
("SKY Castle" Team A Cast)

2453
01:43:34,178 --> 01:43:36,348
("SKY Castle" Team B Cast)

2454
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:39,617
- We'll start right away. - The special lesson will start.

2455
01:43:40,617 --> 01:43:41,617
Step forward.

2456
01:43:42,288 --> 01:43:45,718
Hyun Ho's choreography includes ballet moves...

2457
01:43:46,017 --> 01:43:47,356
and contemporary dance moves.

2458
01:43:47,357 --> 01:43:49,027
He even considered...

2459
01:43:49,187 --> 01:43:51,758
Korean dance in his choreography.

2460
01:43:52,197 --> 01:43:53,957
I thought that each dancer...

2461
01:43:53,958 --> 01:43:57,298
would bring out the strength in his part.

2462
01:43:57,428 --> 01:44:01,097
Since it's my choreography, I have the highest chance...

2463
01:44:01,098 --> 01:44:03,107
of getting the main lead role.

2464
01:44:03,607 --> 01:44:06,008
One, put it down in the back.

2465
01:44:07,078 --> 01:44:09,607
Two, hit it like this.

2466
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:12,078
Then start the brise.

2467
01:44:12,748 --> 01:44:15,117
I'm not familiar with the terms. Was it brise vole?

2468
01:44:15,418 --> 01:44:18,458
Hop, brise, hop, hop, hop, hop.

2469
01:44:19,357 --> 01:44:21,657
(Hop)

2470
01:44:22,227 --> 01:44:23,428
That looks incredible.

2471
01:44:24,328 --> 01:44:26,798
I'm a ballerino. All right.

2472
01:44:27,958 --> 01:44:29,026
I'm a ballerino.

2473
01:44:29,027 --> 01:44:30,196
(Ballerino Si Won tries the brise vole again.)

2474
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:31,197
(He fails.)

2475
01:44:31,267 --> 01:44:32,337
Goodness.

2476
01:44:32,338 --> 01:44:33,867
(His feet are moving idly in the air forever.)

2477
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:35,937
I thought that...

2478
01:44:36,468 --> 01:44:40,107
all Korean dancers totally failed when it came to brise vole.

2479
01:44:40,508 --> 01:44:41,508
It was a mess.

2480
01:44:41,977 --> 01:44:43,277
He's definitely a ballerino.

2481
01:44:43,578 --> 01:44:46,048
His feet were moving elaborately.

2482
01:44:46,477 --> 01:44:47,517
I was in trouble.

2483
01:44:47,918 --> 01:44:49,847
He was teaching others,

2484
01:44:49,848 --> 01:44:50,947
but that's how ballet is.

2485
01:44:51,348 --> 01:44:52,418
Even if someone teaches you, you'll never get it.

2486
01:44:52,958 --> 01:44:55,657
I should give up completing the ballet steps.

2487
01:44:56,258 --> 01:44:58,758
Other than that, I was confident.

2488
01:44:59,197 --> 01:45:02,027
The right leg is underneath. Twist right here.

2489
01:45:02,897 --> 01:45:03,967
That's it.

2490
01:45:03,968 --> 01:45:05,266
(Is this correct?)

2491
01:45:05,267 --> 01:45:06,337
Oh, nice.

2492
01:45:06,338 --> 01:45:07,396
- Is that right? - Yes.

2493
01:45:07,397 --> 01:45:09,637
Should I lift both legs or sweep one leg?

2494
01:45:09,638 --> 01:45:11,807
- Pose first. - That's it.

2495
01:45:12,508 --> 01:45:13,538
Ballerinos, are you okay?

2496
01:45:14,307 --> 01:45:15,807
Do you want to see the legs again?

2497
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:18,848
(Going over it one more time slowly)

2498
01:45:19,748 --> 01:45:21,848
(Despite that, Gyeong Ho can't keep up the floor movement.)

2499
01:45:22,088 --> 01:45:24,348
Of course, I was having a mental breakdown.

2500
01:45:24,447 --> 01:45:27,088
Only the brise vole was easy.

2501
01:45:27,388 --> 01:45:29,828
It was the only difficult thing for the rest of the dancers.

2502
01:45:29,928 --> 01:45:32,098
I can do the movements separately.

2503
01:45:32,357 --> 01:45:34,727
This is at the count of eight.

2504
01:45:35,527 --> 01:45:38,266
Hyun Ho taught me until I got it.

2505
01:45:38,267 --> 01:45:41,367
He helped me out until I could do it.

2506
01:45:43,538 --> 01:45:47,378
(Soon, Kang Gyeong Ho's floor movements become smooth.)

2507
01:45:51,817 --> 01:45:53,078
Gosh, he's really good.

2508
01:45:55,788 --> 01:45:57,187
He's really good.

2509
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:59,717
Oh, ballet...

2510
01:45:59,718 --> 01:46:01,828
It's not easy for ballet dancers to do that.

2511
01:46:03,057 --> 01:46:04,987
I forgot that it was a competition for a second.

2512
01:46:05,027 --> 01:46:09,226
I belatedly noticed that I was in danger.

2513
01:46:09,227 --> 01:46:11,497
He acquired...

2514
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:13,066
the details well.

2515
01:46:13,067 --> 01:46:15,067
Still, I'm the original choreographer.

2516
01:46:15,437 --> 01:46:16,638
I'll be different.

2517
01:46:20,338 --> 01:46:21,607
Dong Hoon...

2518
01:46:21,977 --> 01:46:23,207
Dong Hoon, let's practice together.

2519
01:46:23,208 --> 01:46:24,347
- I am. - Are you?

2520
01:46:24,348 --> 01:46:25,348
- Yes. - Okay.

2521
01:46:25,349 --> 01:46:26,646
- Now... - Practice here.

2522
01:46:26,647 --> 01:46:28,147
- Wait. - When you get here...

2523
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:29,817
After the bridge...

2524
01:46:29,987 --> 01:46:33,116
I said I was managing my condition...

2525
01:46:33,117 --> 01:46:35,258
and watched them from the side.

2526
01:46:35,527 --> 01:46:38,288
It was more entertaining than I thought. It wasn't so bad.

2527
01:46:38,727 --> 01:46:41,027
It's worth taking it from him.

2528
01:46:41,197 --> 01:46:43,867
If I can't get it with my hands, I'll bite it.

2529
01:46:43,998 --> 01:46:46,867
If my teeth get pulled out, I'll bite it with my gum.

2530
01:46:47,038 --> 01:46:49,967
I was that desperate.

2531
01:46:49,968 --> 01:46:53,338
I'll shine bright in the part I'm good at.

2532
01:46:53,508 --> 01:46:55,178
It's the Korean dance.

2533
01:46:56,107 --> 01:46:57,276
I feel confident.

2534
01:46:57,277 --> 01:47:00,146
We will now begin the main role Casting Audition...

2535
01:47:00,147 --> 01:47:02,918
for K-Contents Mission "Squid Game."

2536
01:47:03,147 --> 01:47:07,417
Pulling off the given choreography is a given.

2537
01:47:07,418 --> 01:47:10,458
We'll focus...

2538
01:47:10,727 --> 01:47:12,457
on how you express the character...

2539
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:15,427
in details...

2540
01:47:15,428 --> 01:47:17,067
without harming the original dance.

2541
01:47:17,227 --> 01:47:18,866
Since it's my choreography,

2542
01:47:18,867 --> 01:47:21,696
I'm likely...

2543
01:47:21,697 --> 01:47:22,806
to get the main role.

2544
01:47:22,807 --> 01:47:25,067
I'll get the main role no matter what.

2545
01:47:25,107 --> 01:47:28,037
Getting the main role...

2546
01:47:28,038 --> 01:47:29,146
is the only way.

2547
01:47:29,147 --> 01:47:32,276
If I become a group dancer, it's the end of my dance career.

2548
01:47:32,277 --> 01:47:34,016
First group. I Ban.

2549
01:47:34,017 --> 01:47:35,116
(I Ban from contemporary dance)

2550
01:47:35,117 --> 01:47:37,817
Park Jun Woo, Kim Hyun Ho.

2551
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:39,187
First position.

2552
01:47:39,758 --> 01:47:42,258
Music, start.

2553
01:47:42,727 --> 01:47:46,258
Three, two, one. Go.

2554
01:47:48,867 --> 01:47:50,227
Park Jun Woo is confident.

2555
01:47:51,267 --> 01:47:52,338
(Exclaiming)

2556
01:47:52,437 --> 01:47:55,968
(Ballet technique section)

2557
01:47:56,338 --> 01:47:57,638
He's also good at ballet.

2558
01:47:59,178 --> 01:48:01,407
Can anyone beat the original choreographer?

2559
01:48:03,878 --> 01:48:05,247
Jun Woo is pretty good.

2560
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,248
(Exclaiming)

2561
01:48:07,777 --> 01:48:09,418
Jun Woo is amazing.

2562
01:48:09,647 --> 01:48:11,748
What? He's dancing like it's his own.

2563
01:48:11,958 --> 01:48:14,516
Jun Woo knows how to use his energy.

2564
01:48:14,517 --> 01:48:16,027
This is risky.

2565
01:48:19,397 --> 01:48:20,527
(Hyun Ho is indeed good.)

2566
01:48:23,267 --> 01:48:24,327
(They're both good.)

2567
01:48:24,328 --> 01:48:25,437
Oh, Jun Woo.

2568
01:48:25,968 --> 01:48:27,397
(It's hard to tell who's better between the two.)

2569
01:48:29,407 --> 01:48:30,407
(Impressed)

2570
01:48:30,408 --> 01:48:33,907
Three, two, one. Stop.

2571
01:48:34,378 --> 01:48:35,776
("Squid Game" Casting Audition Line 1 ends.)

2572
01:48:35,777 --> 01:48:36,777
They were good.

2573
01:48:37,708 --> 01:48:38,817
Very good.

2574
01:48:39,117 --> 01:48:40,718
Jun Woo was amazing.

2575
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:42,516
While dancing, I realized...

2576
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:44,486
I found my path.

2577
01:48:44,487 --> 01:48:45,817
He was stable.

2578
01:48:45,888 --> 01:48:49,156
But I was better.

2579
01:48:49,157 --> 01:48:50,587
Because he came up with it,

2580
01:48:50,588 --> 01:48:54,027
he presented the intention and quality the best.

2581
01:48:54,458 --> 01:48:55,726
Line Two.

2582
01:48:55,727 --> 01:48:58,297
Lee Ha Nel, Kim Hyo Joon,

2583
01:48:58,298 --> 01:49:01,367
Han Jeong Bin, Kwon Yo Han.

2584
01:49:01,867 --> 01:49:05,066
A hope that I can move up.

2585
01:49:05,067 --> 01:49:06,237
I have to prove them.

2586
01:49:06,338 --> 01:49:07,776
I finally get to prove them.

2587
01:49:07,777 --> 01:49:08,907
I was confident.

2588
01:49:09,008 --> 01:49:10,976
Except for the ballet move,

2589
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:12,647
I'll be more powerful...

2590
01:49:12,678 --> 01:49:15,817
on the floor.

2591
01:49:16,317 --> 01:49:20,088
Three, two, one. Go.

2592
01:49:20,657 --> 01:49:22,027
(Lee Ha Nel swings his arms the other way.)

2593
01:49:22,527 --> 01:49:23,856
(Due to the wrong arm move, he misses the beat.)

2594
01:49:23,857 --> 01:49:24,857
Awesome.

2595
01:49:24,857 --> 01:49:25,857
(What a shame.)

2596
01:49:26,098 --> 01:49:27,227
(Followed by the ballet technique)

2597
01:49:30,527 --> 01:49:31,668
(What? Why are they good at it?)

2598
01:49:31,727 --> 01:49:32,798
Good.

2599
01:49:32,998 --> 01:49:34,566
(Followed by tutting section)

2600
01:49:34,567 --> 01:49:35,937
Yo Han's good at tutting.

2601
01:49:36,407 --> 01:49:38,266
Because he was a hip-hop dancer.

2602
01:49:38,267 --> 01:49:39,878
Hyun Ho might lose it.

2603
01:49:41,977 --> 01:49:44,776
Hyo Joon never looks weird.

2604
01:49:44,777 --> 01:49:45,947
(His eyes move busily.)

2605
01:49:46,218 --> 01:49:47,848
(It's hard to tell who's in which class.)

2606
01:49:47,878 --> 01:49:49,187
Nice.

2607
01:49:56,288 --> 01:49:57,288
(Keep it up, buddy.)

2608
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:01,498
Okay.

2609
01:50:01,598 --> 01:50:03,527
It doesn't look any strange.

2610
01:50:04,798 --> 01:50:08,468
Three, two, one. Stop.

2611
01:50:08,538 --> 01:50:10,907
Both Yo Han and Hyo Joon were good.

2612
01:50:11,038 --> 01:50:12,137
They were all very good.

2613
01:50:12,138 --> 01:50:13,838
Good job, Yo Han.

2614
01:50:14,138 --> 01:50:15,947
I thought I had a chance, obviously.

2615
01:50:15,977 --> 01:50:17,378
"I was pretty good."

2616
01:50:17,678 --> 01:50:19,247
"They probably liked it."

2617
01:50:19,248 --> 01:50:23,717
I thought they'd focus more on the dance techniques.

2618
01:50:23,718 --> 01:50:25,146
That'd get me...

2619
01:50:25,147 --> 01:50:26,787
more credits.

2620
01:50:26,788 --> 01:50:28,856
Hyo Joon was very good.

2621
01:50:28,857 --> 01:50:31,128
Since then, I was worried about him.

2622
01:50:31,328 --> 01:50:34,197
Line Three. Kim Min Seok.

2623
01:50:34,697 --> 01:50:36,397
Choi Jong In.

2624
01:50:36,468 --> 01:50:37,567
Baek Sang Ha.

2625
01:50:37,668 --> 01:50:38,797
Kim Si Won.

2626
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:39,866
(Kim Si Won from Korean dance)

2627
01:50:39,867 --> 01:50:40,998
They're all Korean dancers.

2628
01:50:41,498 --> 01:50:43,406
Kim Si Won scares me.

2629
01:50:43,407 --> 01:50:44,907
He's splendid from the start, right?

2630
01:50:45,107 --> 01:50:48,077
No one is as strong as I am.

2631
01:50:48,078 --> 01:50:51,878
No one is as impressive as I am...

2632
01:50:51,947 --> 01:50:53,848
or dance as well as I do.

2633
01:50:54,178 --> 01:50:57,347
Three, two, one.

2634
01:50:57,348 --> 01:50:58,418
("Squid Game" Casting Audition for Line 3 begins.)

2635
01:51:02,328 --> 01:51:03,527
(Focusing)

2636
01:51:04,088 --> 01:51:05,088
(The difficult ballet technique section)

2637
01:51:05,657 --> 01:51:07,057
Oh, no.

2638
01:51:08,057 --> 01:51:10,167
(Awkward ballet technique section)

2639
01:51:10,168 --> 01:51:11,397
(Sad)

2640
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:15,168
Korean dancers aren't good at the beginning.

2641
01:51:15,338 --> 01:51:16,367
(Ballet dancers sigh.)

2642
01:51:16,407 --> 01:51:17,606
(The tutting section is another crisis.)

2643
01:51:17,607 --> 01:51:18,767
Si Won pulled it off.

2644
01:51:18,977 --> 01:51:20,077
It's so neat.

2645
01:51:20,078 --> 01:51:21,508
(You got it!)

2646
01:51:23,447 --> 01:51:26,016
I've never seen Jong In dancing with so much passion before.

2647
01:51:26,017 --> 01:51:27,017
(Max enthusiasm)

2648
01:51:27,018 --> 01:51:28,418
Oh, Jong In.

2649
01:51:31,248 --> 01:51:32,388
(Bugged)

2650
01:51:32,687 --> 01:51:33,687
(Nodding, approving)

2651
01:51:34,418 --> 01:51:35,987
Si Won looks stable.

2652
01:51:37,588 --> 01:51:39,226
Sang Ha looks neat.

2653
01:51:39,227 --> 01:51:40,598
(Nervous)

2654
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:43,827
Two, one. Stop.

2655
01:51:43,828 --> 01:51:45,838
("Squid Game" Casting Audition for Line 3 ends.)

2656
01:51:45,998 --> 01:51:47,067
Line Four.

2657
01:51:47,598 --> 01:51:50,607
Go Dong Hoon. Choo Seok Ho.

2658
01:51:50,968 --> 01:51:52,407
Kang Gyeong Ho.

2659
01:51:52,508 --> 01:51:54,606
I'll do my best for brise vole.

2660
01:51:54,607 --> 01:51:57,146
And for the floor technique and tutting,

2661
01:51:57,147 --> 01:51:59,747
I'll carry them out, so I wouldn't fall behind.

2662
01:51:59,748 --> 01:52:02,446
There are ballet and floor techniques.

2663
01:52:02,447 --> 01:52:05,186
It's favorable for me...

2664
01:52:05,187 --> 01:52:07,156
since I can pull them all off.

2665
01:52:07,157 --> 01:52:08,617
I must get the main role.

2666
01:52:09,027 --> 01:52:10,458
("Squid Game" Casting Audition for Line 4 begins.)

2667
01:52:10,888 --> 01:52:12,527
One. Go.

2668
01:52:17,128 --> 01:52:18,128
(Eyes focused)

2669
01:52:19,867 --> 01:52:21,138
Good job, Dong Hoon.

2670
01:52:23,107 --> 01:52:24,107
(Amazed)

2671
01:52:25,678 --> 01:52:27,338
(Standard example of ballet)

2672
01:52:27,477 --> 01:52:28,638
(That's it.)

2673
01:52:28,907 --> 01:52:30,548
(Is that what we're supposed to do?)

2674
01:52:30,977 --> 01:52:32,277
They're crazy.

2675
01:52:33,678 --> 01:52:34,718
Good job.

2676
01:52:37,348 --> 01:52:38,348
Nice.

2677
01:52:39,088 --> 01:52:41,156
What if they're only focusing on Gyeong Ho?

2678
01:52:41,157 --> 01:52:43,527
I must get their attention no matter what.

2679
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:46,298
(Standard example of the floor dance)

2680
01:52:46,727 --> 01:52:47,758
(Cheering)

2681
01:52:48,727 --> 01:52:50,297
Gyeong Ho is good.

2682
01:52:50,298 --> 01:52:52,026
But it's the contemporary dance technique.

2683
01:52:52,027 --> 01:52:54,066
How can a ballet dancer...

2684
01:52:54,067 --> 01:52:56,468
do the floor dance like that?

2685
01:52:59,008 --> 01:53:00,607
This is risky.

2686
01:53:02,878 --> 01:53:04,008
(Exclaiming continuously)

2687
01:53:04,277 --> 01:53:07,077
Two, one. Stop.

2688
01:53:07,078 --> 01:53:10,016
They sat down at the end. Okay.

2689
01:53:10,017 --> 01:53:11,647
Dong Hoon was good.

2690
01:53:11,987 --> 01:53:13,817
I really liked Gyeong Ho.

2691
01:53:14,388 --> 01:53:15,657
How come they're all good at it?

2692
01:53:15,888 --> 01:53:17,088
Everyone is good.

2693
01:53:17,157 --> 01:53:19,757
Unless there's a big variable,

2694
01:53:19,758 --> 01:53:21,726
I expect to get the main role.

2695
01:53:21,727 --> 01:53:23,167
I made no mistake.

2696
01:53:23,168 --> 01:53:26,637
I expressed it just as I planned.

2697
01:53:26,638 --> 01:53:27,767
I could get my hopes up.

2698
01:53:28,237 --> 01:53:29,508
I might get it.

2699
01:53:29,538 --> 01:53:32,037
I didn't realize...

2700
01:53:32,038 --> 01:53:33,377
that other people were improving.

2701
01:53:33,378 --> 01:53:35,436
I don't know what's going to happen.

2702
01:53:35,437 --> 01:53:38,606
Hyun Ho, when I saw your choreography,

2703
01:53:38,607 --> 01:53:41,516
I felt that you considered...

2704
01:53:41,517 --> 01:53:43,687
all three genres.

2705
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:46,316
(Ballet)

2706
01:53:46,317 --> 01:53:48,387
(Korean dance)

2707
01:53:48,388 --> 01:53:51,087
(Contemporary dance)

2708
01:53:51,088 --> 01:53:54,896
But because you were too considerate,

2709
01:53:54,897 --> 01:53:58,067
some dancers nailed your choreography.

2710
01:53:58,197 --> 01:54:00,497
(Nervous)

2711
01:54:00,498 --> 01:54:01,767
"Some nailed it."

2712
01:54:02,098 --> 01:54:06,207
Kang Gyeong Ho stood out big time.

2713
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,236
I agree.

2714
01:54:07,237 --> 01:54:10,547
Ballet dancers aren't used to...

2715
01:54:10,548 --> 01:54:12,646
using the floor.

2716
01:54:12,647 --> 01:54:15,516
It might be awkward to do the dance with an accent.

2717
01:54:15,517 --> 01:54:17,616
You maintained balance,

2718
01:54:17,617 --> 01:54:20,787
yet you were flexible and soft.

2719
01:54:20,788 --> 01:54:25,627
You really pulled off Hyun Ho's choreography.

2720
01:54:25,628 --> 01:54:26,726
(Nodding)

2721
01:54:26,727 --> 01:54:28,627
Whereas Jun Woo's dance...

2722
01:54:28,628 --> 01:54:30,027
had the musicality.

2723
01:54:30,067 --> 01:54:34,037
You expressed each accent and intention.

2724
01:54:34,038 --> 01:54:37,366
You were the most suitable dancer for this work.

2725
01:54:37,367 --> 01:54:38,607
I was impressed.

2726
01:54:39,338 --> 01:54:41,437
Kim Hyo Joon in Line Two.

2727
01:54:41,477 --> 01:54:44,377
You just proved...

2728
01:54:44,378 --> 01:54:47,816
that depending on who sees the choreography,

2729
01:54:47,817 --> 01:54:49,787
the character changes.

2730
01:54:49,788 --> 01:54:52,587
You expressed...

2731
01:54:52,588 --> 01:54:55,986
that the role of the final one...

2732
01:54:55,987 --> 01:54:58,486
is completely exhausted.

2733
01:54:58,487 --> 01:55:00,397
It was very encouraging.

2734
01:55:00,798 --> 01:55:01,857
Thank you.

2735
01:55:02,598 --> 01:55:05,026
Dong Hoon, you finally proved yourself...

2736
01:55:05,027 --> 01:55:07,667
through this mission.

2737
01:55:07,668 --> 01:55:09,967
I waited for it. It was fun.

2738
01:55:09,968 --> 01:55:12,007
"Should I do this? Should I do that?"

2739
01:55:12,008 --> 01:55:15,177
"Do you want to fight?" That impression...

2740
01:55:15,178 --> 01:55:16,677
felt new.

2741
01:55:16,678 --> 01:55:19,776
No one expressed it like you did.

2742
01:55:19,777 --> 01:55:22,178
Thank you for that. I enjoyed it.

2743
01:55:22,517 --> 01:55:26,617
Fortunately, it was delivered.

2744
01:55:27,157 --> 01:55:28,958
During the Class Battle...

2745
01:55:30,628 --> 01:55:33,556
(Go Dong Hoon didn't catch the judges' attention.)

2746
01:55:33,557 --> 01:55:35,258
Under Class goes to...

2747
01:55:35,498 --> 01:55:37,968
(That's how he began as Under Class.)

2748
01:55:38,168 --> 01:55:40,436
(During the Class Movement Ceremony)

2749
01:55:40,437 --> 01:55:42,337
I became the promotion candidate,

2750
01:55:42,338 --> 01:55:45,107
and I thought I had a chance of getting promoted to Second.

2751
01:55:46,807 --> 01:55:48,637
(But what he received was...)

2752
01:55:48,638 --> 01:55:50,578
(the Under Class again.)

2753
01:55:50,708 --> 01:55:53,547
All my effort and enthusiasm...

2754
01:55:53,548 --> 01:55:55,717
(He did his best, but he wasn't acknowledged.)

2755
01:55:55,718 --> 01:55:58,248
I was shocked that I didn't meet the requirement.

2756
01:55:59,157 --> 01:56:03,457
I hated the judges for not approving me.

2757
01:56:03,458 --> 01:56:06,758
But I was doing better than I thought.

2758
01:56:06,998 --> 01:56:11,527
I was proud of myself and felt comforted at the same time.

2759
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:15,436
Stage Fighter K-Contents Mission...

2760
01:56:15,437 --> 01:56:17,766
"Squid Game" Team A's main role.

2761
01:56:17,767 --> 01:56:20,038
I can do it. I'll get it.

2762
01:56:20,208 --> 01:56:21,936
I was certain.

2763
01:56:21,937 --> 01:56:25,306
I expected it to be me for sure.

2764
01:56:25,307 --> 01:56:26,417
I had confidence.

2765
01:56:26,418 --> 01:56:28,477
I hope it's me.

2766
01:56:29,218 --> 01:56:31,388
"Squid Game" Team A's main role goes to...

2767
01:56:31,617 --> 01:56:33,617
Kang Gyeong Ho.

2768
01:56:34,017 --> 01:56:37,157
("Squid Game" Team A's main role goes to Kang Gyeong Ho.)

2769
01:56:37,588 --> 01:56:39,258
- Nice. - Congratulations.

2770
01:56:40,928 --> 01:56:42,726
Of course, I was happy and proud.

2771
01:56:42,727 --> 01:56:44,998
I overcame the mountain in front of me.

2772
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:47,197
That was relieving.

2773
01:56:47,338 --> 01:56:51,607
Now, the person who will be competing...

2774
01:56:52,267 --> 01:56:54,737
against "Squid Game" Team A's main role Kang Gyeong Ho.

2775
01:56:55,477 --> 01:56:58,977
We will announce Team B's main role.

2776
01:56:59,178 --> 01:57:00,718
Who do you think it'll be?

2777
01:57:01,117 --> 01:57:03,287
(Thinking)

2778
01:57:03,288 --> 01:57:04,616
Oh, I have no idea.

2779
01:57:04,617 --> 01:57:05,647
(That's a tough question.)

2780
01:57:05,857 --> 01:57:07,057
Hyun Ho or...

2781
01:57:07,187 --> 01:57:11,357
Since it's my choreography, of course, I want the main role.

2782
01:57:12,027 --> 01:57:13,958
Is it going to be Jun Woo?

2783
01:57:14,128 --> 01:57:16,598
Only one spot remained. I was desperate.

2784
01:57:17,067 --> 01:57:18,127
Dong Hoon?

2785
01:57:18,128 --> 01:57:19,896
I thought it'd be me.

2786
01:57:19,897 --> 01:57:21,668
"Squid Game" Team B's main role.

2787
01:57:21,897 --> 01:57:23,737
(Nervous)

2788
01:57:25,638 --> 01:57:27,178
It's Park Jun Woo.

2789
01:57:28,038 --> 01:57:30,747
("Squid Game" Team B's main role goes to Park Jun Woo.)

2790
01:57:30,748 --> 01:57:32,207
(Sad)

2791
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:33,217
That's surprising.

2792
01:57:33,218 --> 01:57:35,317
I was relieved at once.

2793
01:57:35,447 --> 01:57:38,316
It was the role I'd always wanted to get,

2794
01:57:38,317 --> 01:57:41,057
and I finally got it.

2795
01:57:41,218 --> 01:57:43,387
Jun Woo has outstanding abilities for...

2796
01:57:43,388 --> 01:57:46,257
catching the point of the movement and the highlight.

2797
01:57:46,258 --> 01:57:48,957
Korean dance sometimes makes your body flexible...

2798
01:57:48,958 --> 01:57:51,598
and sometimes strong.

2799
01:57:51,897 --> 01:57:55,237
And you're well aware of how to use that rhythm.

2800
01:57:55,798 --> 01:57:58,606
(Grateful)

2801
01:57:58,607 --> 01:58:00,677
(It's a bummer, but he still approves.)

2802
01:58:00,678 --> 01:58:04,477
Each team's main roles, Kang Gyeong Ho and Park Jun Woo...

2803
01:58:04,647 --> 01:58:07,918
name two dancers you need...

2804
01:58:08,348 --> 01:58:12,348
for the main supporting roles and cast them.

2805
01:58:12,588 --> 01:58:14,417
Park Jun Woo,

2806
01:58:14,418 --> 01:58:16,987
cast the main supporting role you want.

2807
01:58:17,758 --> 01:58:21,128
The dancer I'd like to cast for main supporting role is...

2808
01:58:21,758 --> 01:58:25,026
My choreography became the fixed choreography.

2809
01:58:25,027 --> 01:58:26,638
I might have more chance.

2810
01:58:26,968 --> 01:58:28,468
If I become a group dancer again,

2811
01:58:29,197 --> 01:58:31,237
it'll hurt my pride big time.

2812
01:58:31,807 --> 01:58:35,178
The dancer I'd like to cast for main supporting role is...

2813
01:58:35,977 --> 01:58:37,407
Kim Hyun Ho.

2814
01:58:37,777 --> 01:58:41,147
("Squid Game" Team B's main supporting role, Kim Hyun Ho)

2815
01:58:41,477 --> 01:58:44,017
If Gyeong Ho takes Hyun Ho,

2816
01:58:44,588 --> 01:58:47,057
I might fall behind in the team battle.

2817
01:58:47,288 --> 01:58:49,986
He's good at making choreographies.

2818
01:58:49,987 --> 01:58:52,598
He has an outstanding technicality.

2819
01:58:52,697 --> 01:58:55,027
I knew I shouldn't lose him.

2820
01:58:55,258 --> 01:58:57,497
Jun Woo made the right choice.

2821
01:58:57,498 --> 01:59:00,097
I'll show you the impact the First brings...

2822
01:59:00,098 --> 01:59:03,367
when given the supporting role.

2823
01:59:04,038 --> 01:59:08,538
The second dancer I'd like to cast for main supporting role is...

2824
01:59:08,878 --> 01:59:10,707
I might not have a chance at all.

2825
01:59:10,708 --> 01:59:11,708
(Worried)

2826
01:59:11,709 --> 01:59:12,877
What should I do?

2827
01:59:12,878 --> 01:59:14,247
I was really anxious.

2828
01:59:14,248 --> 01:59:16,517
I could never guess the main supporting role.

2829
01:59:18,218 --> 01:59:19,758
Kim Hyo Joon.

2830
01:59:20,718 --> 01:59:23,258
("Squid Game" Team B's main supporting role, Kim Hyo Joon)

2831
01:59:23,557 --> 01:59:27,428
Because the choreographer is a Korean dancer major,

2832
01:59:27,628 --> 01:59:30,726
I chose Hyo Joon with technicality...

2833
01:59:30,727 --> 01:59:33,367
who's good at Korean dance. I must cast him.

2834
01:59:33,498 --> 01:59:36,638
I must do well.

2835
01:59:36,807 --> 01:59:39,307
Yes, Jun Woo. Let's take the main stage.

2836
01:59:39,878 --> 01:59:41,538
- He made a good decision. - Yes.

2837
01:59:41,937 --> 01:59:45,777
Let's begin the next main supporting role audition.

2838
01:59:46,147 --> 01:59:49,918
The dancer I'd like to cast for main supporting role is...

2839
01:59:50,647 --> 01:59:53,317
I probably suit the image the best.

2840
01:59:53,718 --> 01:59:55,087
I expected him to pick me.

2841
01:59:55,088 --> 01:59:58,486
I was worried about becoming a group dancer again.

2842
01:59:58,487 --> 02:00:00,128
I was in agony.

2843
02:00:00,258 --> 02:00:03,527
The dancer I'd like to cast for main supporting role is...

2844
02:00:04,598 --> 02:00:06,397
Kim Si Won.

2845
02:00:06,668 --> 02:00:08,837
("Squid Game" Team A's main supporting role, Kim Si Won)

2846
02:00:08,838 --> 02:00:11,406
I'd need at least one Korean dancer...

2847
02:00:11,407 --> 02:00:13,606
for the main supporting role.

2848
02:00:13,607 --> 02:00:17,877
Kim Si Won can express the rhythm and movements...

2849
02:00:17,878 --> 02:00:21,218
of Korean dance the best.

2850
02:00:21,517 --> 02:00:23,588
That's why I chose him for the main supporting role.

2851
02:00:23,817 --> 02:00:26,816
Gyeong Ho and my energy...

2852
02:00:26,817 --> 02:00:28,888
will form chemistry.

2853
02:00:29,187 --> 02:00:30,758
Name the second dancer.

2854
02:00:31,288 --> 02:00:34,758
The dancer I'd like to cast for main supporting role is...

2855
02:00:35,098 --> 02:00:36,367
He'll pick Dong Hoon.

2856
02:00:36,498 --> 02:00:37,867
Or will it be Sang Ha?

2857
02:00:38,267 --> 02:00:39,498
I think Yo Han was better.

2858
02:00:39,697 --> 02:00:41,597
(Who is the last supporting role in "Squid Game?")

2859
02:00:41,598 --> 02:00:43,168
Go Dong Hoon.

2860
02:00:43,437 --> 02:00:44,437
(Bowing)

2861
02:00:44,438 --> 02:00:46,137
("Squid Game" Team A's main supporting role, Go Dong Hoon)

2862
02:00:46,138 --> 02:00:50,646
Considering Go Dong Hoon's dance and personality,

2863
02:00:50,647 --> 02:00:53,917
despite the mission or movement given,

2864
02:00:53,918 --> 02:00:57,987
I believed he'd draw an even better movement.

2865
02:00:58,447 --> 02:01:02,288
I was happy that I didn't become a group dancer.

2866
02:01:02,588 --> 02:01:03,987
It's only the beginning.

2867
02:01:04,187 --> 02:01:08,557
All I could think about was that I had to prove myself again.

2868
02:01:09,227 --> 02:01:11,526
My team has a lot of weapons.

2869
02:01:11,527 --> 02:01:15,067
We have a lot of technicality, so I'm confident.

2870
02:01:15,338 --> 02:01:17,306
I think my team...

2871
02:01:17,307 --> 02:01:19,838
forms harmony.

2872
02:01:19,937 --> 02:01:22,807
That will be our strength to pull it off.

2873
02:01:23,107 --> 02:01:24,347
("Squid Game" Team A Cast)

2874
02:01:24,348 --> 02:01:25,577
(Kim Si Won, Kang Gyeong Ho, Go Dong Hoon)

2875
02:01:25,578 --> 02:01:26,816
("Squid Game" Team B Cast)

2876
02:01:26,817 --> 02:01:27,918
(Kim Hyun Ho, Park Jun Woo, Kim Hyo Joon)

2877
02:01:28,918 --> 02:01:30,048
(CJ ENM Ilsan Production Center)

2878
02:01:30,487 --> 02:01:31,487
(The return...)

2879
02:01:31,588 --> 02:01:32,986
Jump and down.

2880
02:01:32,987 --> 02:01:34,517
(of Ho Jong School from inferno)

2881
02:01:35,487 --> 02:01:36,758
I'm losing my mind.

2882
02:01:37,487 --> 02:01:38,727
I'm going to die.

2883
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:39,958
(Everyone is groaning.)

2884
02:01:40,657 --> 02:01:43,227
(Now that they have tried it together)

2885
02:01:43,367 --> 02:01:46,968
He can only do that because he's Choi Ho Jong.

2886
02:01:47,737 --> 02:01:50,807
My brain couldn't function.

2887
02:01:51,407 --> 02:01:52,508
I don't know how to do that.

2888
02:01:52,838 --> 02:01:56,107
One bar has many movements.

2889
02:01:56,447 --> 02:01:57,806
He breaks that beat...

2890
02:01:57,807 --> 02:02:01,017
that's already broken.

2891
02:02:01,178 --> 02:02:02,417
It'll be tough for them.

2892
02:02:02,418 --> 02:02:05,117
I don't need to audition.

2893
02:02:05,187 --> 02:02:07,288
So I had no pressure.

2894
02:02:07,588 --> 02:02:09,627
There's no time to breathe.

2895
02:02:09,628 --> 02:02:11,356
(Will that do?)

2896
02:02:11,357 --> 02:02:12,526
Two hundred segments.

2897
02:02:12,527 --> 02:02:14,597
Who makes 200 segments?

2898
02:02:14,598 --> 02:02:15,998
How can people do that?

2899
02:02:16,128 --> 02:02:18,197
People were glaring like...

2900
02:02:19,128 --> 02:02:20,437
(What?)

2901
02:02:20,668 --> 02:02:21,697
(Full of enthusiasm)

2902
02:02:21,867 --> 02:02:24,306
Three, two, one.

2903
02:02:24,307 --> 02:02:25,307
(Screaming)

2904
02:02:25,308 --> 02:02:27,437
I have a chance of taking the main lead role.

2905
02:02:27,638 --> 02:02:30,708
Even if something fractures or breaks, I shouldn't give up.

2906
02:02:30,947 --> 02:02:32,878
Do it until I die. It won't kill me anyway.

2907
02:02:33,147 --> 02:02:37,288
Ho Jong has already taken one main lead role.

2908
02:02:37,588 --> 02:02:40,417
I want the other main lead role.

2909
02:02:40,418 --> 02:02:42,788
Let me get the main lead role. Let me get it first.

2910
02:02:43,057 --> 02:02:44,128
(Even during the break)

2911
02:02:44,388 --> 02:02:46,057
Can you play the music, please?

2912
02:02:46,598 --> 02:02:47,598
Oh, stop.

2913
02:02:48,157 --> 02:02:49,457
How are you going to distribute your energy?

2914
02:02:49,458 --> 02:02:51,128
Sang Gil is putting so much effort.

2915
02:02:52,168 --> 02:02:55,066
It's fun to watch Kim Sang Gil's dance.

2916
02:02:55,067 --> 02:02:57,067
It feels new.

2917
02:02:57,267 --> 02:02:59,907
Sang Gil has a unique style.

2918
02:03:00,307 --> 02:03:04,106
Tae Young looks like a duke just by standing.

2919
02:03:04,107 --> 02:03:05,878
He looks elegant.

2920
02:03:07,447 --> 02:03:09,646
(Ho Jong's hardcore class begins again.)

2921
02:03:09,647 --> 02:03:10,718
Again.

2922
02:03:11,588 --> 02:03:16,388
Won Jun looked like an herbivore.

2923
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:19,088
Let's try it one more time.

2924
02:03:19,928 --> 02:03:23,897
I liked how he tried to keep up.

2925
02:03:24,468 --> 02:03:26,668
He has sturdy basic skills.

2926
02:03:27,367 --> 02:03:28,697
Catch your breath.

2927
02:03:31,407 --> 02:03:33,538
(Kim Young Woong continues to practice.)

2928
02:03:34,338 --> 02:03:35,737
(Sharp)

2929
02:03:38,508 --> 02:03:40,247
Kim Young Woong from contemporary dance...

2930
02:03:40,248 --> 02:03:41,747
not only picks up the choreography fast,

2931
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:45,218
but he also moves smoothly like water.

2932
02:03:45,288 --> 02:03:47,758
His dance is detailed yet soft.

2933
02:03:48,017 --> 02:03:49,187
I like it.

2934
02:03:50,458 --> 02:03:51,927
(Watching)

2935
02:03:51,928 --> 02:03:54,157
Next, bring your left hand.

2936
02:03:54,557 --> 02:03:56,767
I noticed Ho Jong...

2937
02:03:57,027 --> 02:03:58,196
watched Young Woong...

2938
02:03:58,197 --> 02:04:01,767
with love.

2939
02:04:02,197 --> 02:04:03,267
I was jealous.

2940
02:04:03,668 --> 02:04:07,337
Kim Young Woong's tenacious power...

2941
02:04:07,338 --> 02:04:08,976
felt natural...

2942
02:04:08,977 --> 02:04:11,708
from the way he tried to acquire the choreography.

2943
02:04:11,878 --> 02:04:13,777
He was a strong candidate.

2944
02:04:14,017 --> 02:04:15,847
(Another person who pays attention to Kim Young Woong)

2945
02:04:15,848 --> 02:04:18,348
I was worried about Young Woong the most.

2946
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:21,116
He's keeping up the best.

2947
02:04:21,117 --> 02:04:23,927
I was worried,

2948
02:04:23,928 --> 02:04:25,288
but I focused on getting the main lead role.

2949
02:04:28,628 --> 02:04:29,628
(Turning)

2950
02:04:29,628 --> 02:04:30,628
(Wandering around?)

2951
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:32,797
I tried to watch...

2952
02:04:32,798 --> 02:04:36,067
how Kyu Nyeon was doing.

2953
02:04:36,807 --> 02:04:41,907
I heard Kyu Nyeon was Ho Jong's student.

2954
02:04:42,437 --> 02:04:44,878
It might be easier for Kyu Nyeon.

2955
02:04:45,248 --> 02:04:48,678
He dances like Choi Ho Jong.

2956
02:04:49,548 --> 02:04:51,917
It feels like our styles changed a lot.

2957
02:04:51,918 --> 02:04:53,656
Now that I grew up,

2958
02:04:53,657 --> 02:04:56,017
I want to dance in my way.

2959
02:04:56,458 --> 02:04:59,487
I want to show that I can be different from Ho Jong.

2960
02:05:00,157 --> 02:05:01,557
- Do you want to try? - Yes.

2961
02:05:02,928 --> 02:05:04,526
Kyu Nyeon is soft, flexible,

2962
02:05:04,527 --> 02:05:06,637
and gentle in his own way.

2963
02:05:06,638 --> 02:05:10,207
If there could be an unexpected strong rival,

2964
02:05:10,208 --> 02:05:14,107
that would be Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2965
02:05:14,378 --> 02:05:16,508
I could feel Kyu Nyeon's energy.

2966
02:05:16,678 --> 02:05:17,946
I'll give my all too.

2967
02:05:17,947 --> 02:05:20,048
I became determined.

2968
02:05:20,348 --> 02:05:22,517
I won't fall behind.

2969
02:05:22,878 --> 02:05:25,446
I don't plan to fall...

2970
02:05:25,447 --> 02:05:27,187
or do a bad job.

2971
02:05:27,388 --> 02:05:29,557
I'm going to clench my teeth for this mission.

2972
02:05:29,687 --> 02:05:32,687
(Who will get the last ticket to the main lead role?)

2973
02:05:33,298 --> 02:05:36,366
We will now begin the Main Role Choreography Casting Audition...

2974
02:05:36,367 --> 02:05:39,397
for K-Contents Mission "Parasite."

2975
02:05:40,838 --> 02:05:41,936
Hello.

2976
02:05:41,937 --> 02:05:44,807
I'm the "Parasite" choreographer, An Nam Keun.

2977
02:05:47,638 --> 02:05:50,577
The K-Contents Mission Main Role Casting Audition...

2978
02:05:50,578 --> 02:05:52,307
we're about to begin...

2979
02:05:52,878 --> 02:05:54,116
is held to cast...

2980
02:05:54,117 --> 02:05:57,218
the main lead role and main supporting role.

2981
02:05:57,348 --> 02:06:00,387
Only one main lead role will be selected in Team B...

2982
02:06:00,388 --> 02:06:03,788
to compete with Dancer Ho Jong,

2983
02:06:03,888 --> 02:06:05,357
now the main lead role...

2984
02:06:05,557 --> 02:06:08,428
in "Parasite."

2985
02:06:08,758 --> 02:06:11,128
That group seems more heated as there's only one seat.

2986
02:06:11,428 --> 02:06:12,498
I guess so.

2987
02:06:12,598 --> 02:06:14,038
(Tensed)

2988
02:06:14,138 --> 02:06:15,838
Now...

2989
02:06:16,038 --> 02:06:19,038
the Main Lead Role Casting Audition for "Parasite" begins.

2990
02:06:19,567 --> 02:06:21,606
(They are given a break before the audition begins.)

2991
02:06:21,607 --> 02:06:24,147
Look at Ho Jong. He's there...

2992
02:06:24,878 --> 02:06:26,178
as if he were a judge.

2993
02:06:26,617 --> 02:06:27,776
He's like a guest judge.

2994
02:06:27,777 --> 02:06:28,976
(He's looking at others' performance to select the Supporting Role.)

2995
02:06:28,977 --> 02:06:31,418
I've tried to see the expression of each dancer.

2996
02:06:31,748 --> 02:06:32,787
I mean, their unique characters.

2997
02:06:32,788 --> 02:06:35,487
Of course, I've already given some thought,

2998
02:06:35,588 --> 02:06:37,487
but I will take a look on the spot...

2999
02:06:37,588 --> 02:06:40,527
and decide the best dancer...

3000
02:06:40,628 --> 02:06:42,798
who fits me well.

3001
02:06:43,897 --> 02:06:45,566
- Very good! - Nice.

3002
02:06:45,567 --> 02:06:48,638
(In the 1st round, 14 competed each other with Ho Jong's choreography.)

3003
02:06:48,838 --> 02:06:49,907
- Nice! - Gosh!

3004
02:06:52,807 --> 02:06:53,807
(Feeling a shudder)

3005
02:06:53,977 --> 02:06:56,276
(7 dancers were qualified for the 2nd round.)

3006
02:06:56,277 --> 02:06:57,277
That was nice.

3007
02:06:57,848 --> 02:06:59,707
(2nd round, 1st group)

3008
02:06:59,708 --> 02:07:01,617
(2nd round, 2nd group)

3009
02:07:01,817 --> 02:07:03,788
(Only one will be selected as the main lead role in the 2nd round.)

3010
02:07:04,048 --> 02:07:07,317
Dancer Ha Won Jun, are you confident enough?

3011
02:07:07,418 --> 02:07:10,557
I will do my best as I believe this is the only opportunity...

3012
02:07:11,788 --> 02:07:12,987
given to Under.

3013
02:07:15,328 --> 02:07:19,267
For dancers in Under, this audition is literally a welcome rain...

3014
02:07:19,598 --> 02:07:20,798
in the drought.

3015
02:07:21,767 --> 02:07:25,468
Because they haven't got a single chance.

3016
02:07:25,767 --> 02:07:27,538
Everybody must've been feeling of danger.

3017
02:07:28,907 --> 02:07:30,548
"I'm glad I got this chance."

3018
02:07:31,578 --> 02:07:32,647
"Time to show them what I am."

3019
02:07:33,817 --> 02:07:36,547
If I were eliminated like this, I would quit my career as a dancer.

3020
02:07:36,548 --> 02:07:37,718
So, I'll make sure I stay here.

3021
02:07:38,017 --> 02:07:39,617
"I'll fight to death."

3022
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:42,918
All I was thinking about was how to be the main lead role.

3023
02:07:43,788 --> 02:07:44,827
Music,

3024
02:07:44,828 --> 02:07:45,887
(2nd round, 1st group)

3025
02:07:45,888 --> 02:07:46,897
start.

3026
02:07:48,027 --> 02:07:51,628
Three, two, one. Go.

3027
02:07:56,767 --> 02:07:57,767
So nice.

3028
02:08:03,777 --> 02:08:04,777
- Gosh! - Oh, my.

3029
02:08:05,977 --> 02:08:07,047
Good!

3030
02:08:07,048 --> 02:08:08,048
(He completes checking their performance.)

3031
02:08:14,017 --> 02:08:16,527
- Seong Hyun's movement is so clean. - Oh, you think so?

3032
02:08:18,527 --> 02:08:19,588
Won Jun's doing well.

3033
02:08:21,397 --> 02:08:22,397
(Staring)

3034
02:08:23,367 --> 02:08:24,427
Nice!

3035
02:08:24,428 --> 02:08:25,428
(Focused)

3036
02:08:25,798 --> 02:08:27,997
- Three, two, one. - Yes!

3037
02:08:27,998 --> 02:08:29,737
- He's so flexible! - Stop.

3038
02:08:30,968 --> 02:08:32,038
(Stop!)

3039
02:08:33,678 --> 02:08:37,008
- Three, two, one. Stop. - Nice!

3040
02:08:39,178 --> 02:08:40,178
Amazing!

3041
02:08:40,378 --> 02:08:42,976
Young Woong's performance overwhelmed others'.

3042
02:08:42,977 --> 02:08:44,016
He was crazy.

3043
02:08:44,017 --> 02:08:45,718
Young Woong was so good on this stage.

3044
02:08:46,447 --> 02:08:47,758
(Thanks for your performance, guys.)

3045
02:08:48,088 --> 02:08:50,388
Won Jun was rather conspicuous.

3046
02:08:51,458 --> 02:08:53,697
The second group starts now.

3047
02:08:54,697 --> 02:08:55,797
"Calm down."

3048
02:08:55,798 --> 02:08:59,328
"Come on. I'm Choi Ho Jong."

3049
02:09:00,168 --> 02:09:03,098
- Kyu Nyeon was quite good. - Kyu Nyeon was rather...

3050
02:09:03,407 --> 02:09:05,708
inspired by Ho Jong.

3051
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:08,708
From high school to concours in my senior year, he affected me...

3052
02:09:08,907 --> 02:09:11,147
in many ways and is my teacher.

3053
02:09:11,248 --> 02:09:13,417
The audition was based on his choreography.

3054
02:09:13,418 --> 02:09:16,617
So, I thought that was for me,

3055
02:09:16,718 --> 02:09:18,218
so I had to seize the opportunity.

3056
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:21,418
(Nervous)

3057
02:09:24,128 --> 02:09:26,328
(2nd round, 2nd group)

3058
02:09:26,928 --> 02:09:28,357
One. Go.

3059
02:09:33,867 --> 02:09:34,937
I see.

3060
02:09:35,737 --> 02:09:36,807
(Stumbled)

3061
02:09:38,468 --> 02:09:39,907
(What a pity.)

3062
02:09:40,737 --> 02:09:41,878
Ryu Tae Young is like a duke.

3063
02:09:46,548 --> 02:09:48,647
Kyu Nyeon dances as if it were his choreography.

3064
02:09:51,487 --> 02:09:52,987
- Darn, Kyu Nyeon. You're so good. - Gosh!

3065
02:09:54,117 --> 02:09:55,517
Look at his facial expression!

3066
02:10:02,057 --> 02:10:03,367
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

3067
02:10:07,697 --> 02:10:09,468
He's truly sexy.

3068
02:10:09,567 --> 02:10:11,607
Look at him! Oh, my baby.

3069
02:10:13,907 --> 02:10:14,977
Tae Young's doing well too.

3070
02:10:15,538 --> 02:10:19,008
Three, two, one. Stop.

3071
02:10:19,777 --> 02:10:22,977
Kyu Nyeon. His performance was amazing.

3072
02:10:25,348 --> 02:10:27,357
(That was so nice!)

3073
02:10:27,458 --> 02:10:28,617
Now I see why he's Ho Jong's student.

3074
02:10:30,128 --> 02:10:33,697
If I imagine one strong rival,

3075
02:10:34,258 --> 02:10:36,797
I once thought...

3076
02:10:36,798 --> 02:10:38,527
it could be Dancer Kyu Nyeon.

3077
02:10:38,628 --> 02:10:40,667
For me, Dancer Bang Seong Hyun,

3078
02:10:40,668 --> 02:10:42,998
your dance was so amazing.

3079
02:10:43,538 --> 02:10:44,606
I see.

3080
02:10:44,607 --> 02:10:46,406
- Thanks. - The mood in this music...

3081
02:10:46,407 --> 02:10:49,476
allures us to only focus on emotions.

3082
02:10:49,477 --> 02:10:52,207
But you wisely restrained it and showed what you are.

3083
02:10:52,208 --> 02:10:53,947
Thanks for your performance.

3084
02:10:54,378 --> 02:10:58,588
(Seong Hyun's restrained movement with emotions caught the eyes.)

3085
02:11:01,817 --> 02:11:04,656
- Thanks. - Regarding Won Jun's dance,

3086
02:11:04,657 --> 02:11:07,627
you came all the way from Under to this audition.

3087
02:11:07,628 --> 02:11:11,367
It seems you adjusted yourself to this stage.

3088
02:11:12,027 --> 02:11:14,567
You have no issues related to technique, right?

3089
02:11:15,038 --> 02:11:16,038
Yes!

3090
02:11:16,039 --> 02:11:17,968
(Won Jun's amazing flexibility caught the eyes.)

3091
02:11:19,538 --> 02:11:22,307
- That's actually my weakness. - Oh, really?

3092
02:11:23,138 --> 02:11:24,207
(Embarrassed)

3093
02:11:24,208 --> 02:11:26,277
(He shows his unexpected charms.)

3094
02:11:27,348 --> 02:11:28,677
But all you showed us looked based on techniques.

3095
02:11:28,678 --> 02:11:30,987
- He's quite cute. - He's like a hamster.

3096
02:11:31,088 --> 02:11:33,486
Young Woong, as you feel confident,

3097
02:11:33,487 --> 02:11:35,788
your movement becomes very bold,

3098
02:11:36,788 --> 02:11:39,027
so your facial expressions and energy...

3099
02:11:39,357 --> 02:11:40,557
are good.

3100
02:11:41,098 --> 02:11:43,468
- It was nice. - Thanks.

3101
02:11:44,367 --> 02:11:45,968
Actually, I should mention...

3102
02:11:46,067 --> 02:11:48,538
that one dancer in this group surprised me the most.

3103
02:11:49,338 --> 02:11:51,566
It was the first time I realized...

3104
02:11:51,567 --> 02:11:54,378
that Kyu Nyeon is full of detailed expressions.

3105
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:57,947
(Kyu Nyeon put so many different emotions into his dance.)

3106
02:12:00,718 --> 02:12:03,017
- Thanks. - It was very impressive.

3107
02:12:03,117 --> 02:12:05,888
I even imagined what if you and Ho Jong...

3108
02:12:06,248 --> 02:12:08,217
danced together.

3109
02:12:08,218 --> 02:12:10,687
Yours was this good at this stage.

3110
02:12:10,958 --> 02:12:12,487
He gave him a high phrase.

3111
02:12:14,557 --> 02:12:17,866
I have no idea who'd be selected.

3112
02:12:17,867 --> 02:12:19,867
Kim Young Woong and Kim Kyu Nyeon.

3113
02:12:20,067 --> 02:12:21,867
They would be the final candidates.

3114
02:12:22,038 --> 02:12:24,237
I think it'd be either Tae Young or Young Woong.

3115
02:12:24,437 --> 02:12:27,377
Now we announce the main lead role dancer for "Duke" in Team B,

3116
02:12:27,378 --> 02:12:29,708
who'll compete...

3117
02:12:30,307 --> 02:12:33,947
against the Main Lead Role Ho Jong in Team A.

3118
02:12:34,678 --> 02:12:37,186
The selected dancer for the main lead role...

3119
02:12:37,187 --> 02:12:39,117
in Team B is from...

3120
02:12:40,088 --> 02:12:42,687
(Tensed)

3121
02:12:43,117 --> 02:12:44,128
Who'll it be?

3122
02:12:45,328 --> 02:12:46,388
I have no idea.

3123
02:12:47,027 --> 02:12:49,027
- Second. - Gosh.

3124
02:12:49,828 --> 02:12:52,428
(First Ryu Tae Young is eliminated from this Main Lead Role Casting.)

3125
02:12:52,468 --> 02:12:53,468
Tae Young is First, right?

3126
02:12:53,838 --> 02:12:55,598
(Under Ha Won Jun is eliminated from this Main Lead Role Casting.)

3127
02:12:56,067 --> 02:12:57,968
In Second, there are...

3128
02:12:58,538 --> 02:13:00,907
three dancers in total. Kim Young Woong,

3129
02:13:01,578 --> 02:13:03,707
Kim Kyu Nyeon,

3130
02:13:03,708 --> 02:13:05,178
and Kim Sang Gil.

3131
02:13:05,477 --> 02:13:06,508
It may be Young Woong.

3132
02:13:07,117 --> 02:13:08,647
The main lead role for "Parasite" in Team B.

3133
02:13:09,048 --> 02:13:11,418
- Kyu Nyeon will be selected. - It could be Sang Gil.

3134
02:13:12,317 --> 02:13:15,357
I thought I was surely selected because that's where I belong.

3135
02:13:15,987 --> 02:13:18,027
"I do want to be the Main Role this time."

3136
02:13:19,088 --> 02:13:20,828
I thought it could be me.

3137
02:13:21,958 --> 02:13:23,428
The main lead role for "Parasite" is...

3138
02:13:23,998 --> 02:13:26,098
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon!

3139
02:13:26,267 --> 02:13:28,498
(The main lead role for "Parasite" in Team B: Kim Kyu Nyeon)

3140
02:13:28,697 --> 02:13:30,138
(Okay. I admit it.)

3141
02:13:31,567 --> 02:13:32,607
Congratulations!

3142
02:13:33,067 --> 02:13:34,138
Thanks.

3143
02:13:35,378 --> 02:13:38,407
First, your facial expression was so good.

3144
02:13:38,508 --> 02:13:40,917
I could almost hear the music...

3145
02:13:40,918 --> 02:13:43,918
through your expressions. It was quite impressive.

3146
02:13:44,017 --> 02:13:45,588
Yes, this is it!

3147
02:13:46,617 --> 02:13:47,887
(Casting for "Parasite" in Team B)

3148
02:13:47,888 --> 02:13:49,458
(Kim Kyu Nyeon the main lead role as Duke)

3149
02:13:49,817 --> 02:13:52,987
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon, are you sure you can beat him?

3150
02:13:53,288 --> 02:13:55,627
Actually, he's my teacher.

3151
02:13:55,628 --> 02:13:58,098
I'll do my best to defeat him.

3152
02:13:58,197 --> 02:13:59,767
Now I'm full of excitement...

3153
02:13:59,998 --> 02:14:03,267
before the new competition.

3154
02:14:03,367 --> 02:14:05,807
We're also excited to see you guys.

3155
02:14:06,668 --> 02:14:08,638
(It's time to select Supporting Roles.)

3156
02:14:08,737 --> 02:14:11,708
The two main lead roles,

3157
02:14:11,907 --> 02:14:14,117
Choi Ho Jong and Kim Kyu Nyeon,

3158
02:14:14,218 --> 02:14:16,987
each should choose two dancers...

3159
02:14:17,487 --> 02:14:21,187
from the six dancers standing behind.

3160
02:14:21,718 --> 02:14:23,857
- They want to choose Young Woong. - That's for sure.

3161
02:14:25,027 --> 02:14:27,557
(After playing drawing lots, Ho Jong chooses first.)

3162
02:14:27,657 --> 02:14:30,668
Starting from Dancer Ho Jong,

3163
02:14:30,928 --> 02:14:32,467
choose the main supporting roles.

3164
02:14:32,468 --> 02:14:34,668
- Tae Young would be their first. - It's Young Woong.

3165
02:14:35,098 --> 02:14:36,237
- It's Young Woong. - Will it be?

3166
02:14:36,907 --> 02:14:37,937
It may be Young Woong.

3167
02:14:38,937 --> 02:14:42,178
The first main supporting dancer for me is...

3168
02:14:42,307 --> 02:14:44,878
I was hoping Ho Jong would pick me.

3169
02:14:45,277 --> 02:14:47,878
As Ho Jong chooses first, it'd be Young Woong for sure.

3170
02:14:48,017 --> 02:14:49,848
(What would be his choice?)

3171
02:14:50,048 --> 02:14:52,017
Dancer Ha Won Jun.

3172
02:14:52,147 --> 02:14:54,016
Dancer Ha Won Jun.

3173
02:14:54,017 --> 02:14:55,387
(What?)

3174
02:14:55,388 --> 02:14:57,187
(Full of surprise)

3175
02:14:57,687 --> 02:14:59,026
Dancer Ha Won Jun.

3176
02:14:59,027 --> 02:15:00,697
Oh, this is unexpected.

3177
02:15:00,928 --> 02:15:03,097
(The Main Supporting Role for "Parasite" is Ha Won Jun.)

3178
02:15:03,098 --> 02:15:05,027
(It's me?)

3179
02:15:05,468 --> 02:15:08,567
- It is a story about human triumph! - Won Jun!

3180
02:15:09,538 --> 02:15:10,607
Won Jun!

3181
02:15:11,907 --> 02:15:13,776
It is a story about human triumph!

3182
02:15:13,777 --> 02:15:15,777
(Thank you so much!)

3183
02:15:15,907 --> 02:15:17,008
(Making a profound bow)

3184
02:15:17,878 --> 02:15:19,477
- He's so cute! - Hey, Won Jun!

3185
02:15:19,748 --> 02:15:22,678
You're feeling the greatest happiness now, aren't you?

3186
02:15:23,078 --> 02:15:24,117
Are you happy?

3187
02:15:25,487 --> 02:15:28,057
Now I enter his jewel box.

3188
02:15:32,328 --> 02:15:34,328
(That's unexpected gratitude.)

3189
02:15:34,598 --> 02:15:37,128
Then, I feel a bit strange.

3190
02:15:37,367 --> 02:15:38,367
(I feel so good!)

3191
02:15:38,368 --> 02:15:40,397
Then, would Ho Jong tell us...

3192
02:15:40,968 --> 02:15:42,338
why you put him...

3193
02:15:42,437 --> 02:15:44,937
into your jewel box?

3194
02:15:45,138 --> 02:15:47,807
During the practice for this audition,

3195
02:15:48,178 --> 02:15:51,048
I saw how well he followed my turn,

3196
02:15:51,208 --> 02:15:54,477
and I could feel he controlled his body very well.

3197
02:15:56,878 --> 02:15:59,748
- I think it'll work. - He was like a rough diamond.

3198
02:16:00,758 --> 02:16:03,888
I wanted to work with him and polish him.

3199
02:16:04,057 --> 02:16:05,687
Ho Jong picked me?

3200
02:16:06,557 --> 02:16:07,557
I was picked by him.

3201
02:16:10,468 --> 02:16:12,668
Thank you for putting me in your jewelry box.

3202
02:16:12,798 --> 02:16:13,867
He's cute.

3203
02:16:15,168 --> 02:16:18,967
The dancer I'm going to choose for the main supporting role is...

3204
02:16:19,268 --> 02:16:21,008
I wonder who he's going to pick.

3205
02:16:21,678 --> 02:16:24,177
It might not be Young Woong.

3206
02:16:24,178 --> 02:16:26,706
I think it'll be Young Woong. Or maybe not as he wasn't the priority.

3207
02:16:26,707 --> 02:16:27,778
That's what I'm saying.

3208
02:16:27,977 --> 02:16:29,178
Or is it Tae Young?

3209
02:16:29,317 --> 02:16:30,647
Gosh, I don't know.

3210
02:16:32,387 --> 02:16:34,716
It's Dancer Kim Young Woong.

3211
02:16:34,717 --> 02:16:36,687
(Kim Young Woong takes the main supporting role for "Parasite.")

3212
02:16:36,688 --> 02:16:37,727
Right.

3213
02:16:38,157 --> 02:16:43,197
Dancer Kim Young Woong was so good...

3214
02:16:43,198 --> 02:16:45,768
that I worried he might play the main lead role.

3215
02:16:46,067 --> 02:16:48,598
I wanted him to become the main supporting dancer...

3216
02:16:48,998 --> 02:16:50,737
and work with me.

3217
02:16:51,768 --> 02:16:52,807
I think it's going to be fun.

3218
02:16:53,467 --> 02:16:55,637
I'll do my best to show you a good performance.

3219
02:16:56,008 --> 02:16:58,706
(Ha Won Jun: Butler 1, Choi Ho Jong: Duke, Kim Young Woong: Butler 2)

3220
02:16:58,707 --> 02:17:01,517
Please choose the main supporting dancers on Team B.

3221
02:17:01,518 --> 02:17:05,448
The dancers I'm going to cast for the main supporting role...

3222
02:17:07,557 --> 02:17:09,216
is Dancer Ryu Tae Young.

3223
02:17:09,217 --> 02:17:12,726
(Ryu Tae Young takes the main supporting role for "Parasite.")

3224
02:17:12,727 --> 02:17:15,897
We had good teamwork when we practiced together.

3225
02:17:16,358 --> 02:17:19,928
I thought his looks and dance were charming.

3226
02:17:20,537 --> 02:17:22,466
That's why I chose him.

3227
02:17:22,467 --> 02:17:24,307
Please cast the next dancer.

3228
02:17:24,467 --> 02:17:27,477
The dancers I'm going to cast for the main supporting role...

3229
02:17:27,737 --> 02:17:29,476
(Choi Kyu Tae, Kim Sang Gil, and Bang Seong Hyun are left.)

3230
02:17:29,477 --> 02:17:30,477
Who would it be?

3231
02:17:30,748 --> 02:17:31,877
Sang Hyun?

3232
02:17:31,977 --> 02:17:33,047
Sang Gil.

3233
02:17:33,448 --> 02:17:34,817
It'll be Sang Gil.

3234
02:17:35,977 --> 02:17:38,986
Honestly, I really hoped he would call my name.

3235
02:17:38,987 --> 02:17:40,248
(Who is the last dancer to be picked as the main supporting dancer?)

3236
02:17:40,557 --> 02:17:42,216
It's Dancer Bang Seong Hyun.

3237
02:17:42,217 --> 02:17:44,687
(Bang Seong Hyun takes the main supporting role for "Parasite.")

3238
02:17:44,688 --> 02:17:46,127
(Trying not to smile)

3239
02:17:47,797 --> 02:17:49,057
(He made it.)

3240
02:17:50,828 --> 02:17:53,837
He can do various genres.

3241
02:17:53,838 --> 02:17:56,698
I thought he would blend in for any performance.

3242
02:17:57,268 --> 02:17:59,707
That's why I chose him.

3243
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:03,007
Kyu Nyeon chose me as he trusted me.

3244
02:18:03,008 --> 02:18:04,248
So we must win no matter what.

3245
02:18:04,578 --> 02:18:06,707
I should work hard because he chose me.

3246
02:18:07,047 --> 02:18:08,847
(Ryu Tae Young: Butler 1, Kim Kyu Nyeon: Duke)

3247
02:18:08,848 --> 02:18:09,918
(Bang Seong Hyun: Butler 2)

3248
02:18:10,178 --> 02:18:12,947
I'd like to congratulate every dancer who was cast.

3249
02:18:12,948 --> 02:18:15,418
(You worked hard.)

3250
02:18:16,188 --> 02:18:18,656
I want to compete with them...

3251
02:18:18,657 --> 02:18:20,796
as dancers in a positive sense.

3252
02:18:20,797 --> 02:18:22,528
I hope Kyu Nyeon does the same.

3253
02:18:24,727 --> 02:18:28,438
(Ha Won Jun: Butler 1, Choi Ho Jong: Duke, Kim Young Woong: Butler 2)

3254
02:18:28,768 --> 02:18:31,107
(Ryu Tae Young: Butler 1, Kim Kyu Nyeon: Duke)

3255
02:18:31,108 --> 02:18:32,467
(Bang Seong Hyun: Butler 2)

3256
02:18:32,938 --> 02:18:35,277
Through this mission, there will be class movement...

3257
02:18:35,278 --> 02:18:36,938
and some of us will even be eliminated.

3258
02:18:36,977 --> 02:18:39,077
So it seems like we have to show everything we have desperately.

3259
02:18:39,078 --> 02:18:41,948
We're fighting regardless of the rank.

3260
02:18:42,047 --> 02:18:44,987
I think there are many good dancers in Under Class.

3261
02:18:45,047 --> 02:18:47,257
I want them to be promoted.

3262
02:18:47,258 --> 02:18:49,518
I was excited to see who would take the main role.

3263
02:18:49,557 --> 02:18:53,656
Hye Hyun already took the main lead role.

3264
02:18:53,657 --> 02:18:55,027
It's already taken.

3265
02:18:55,028 --> 02:18:57,267
If another main lead dancer is picked,

3266
02:18:57,268 --> 02:18:58,897
they're going to compete against each other.

3267
02:18:59,567 --> 02:19:00,668
Here,

3268
02:19:01,137 --> 02:19:03,237
you get hit. And bang.

3269
02:19:03,598 --> 02:19:04,907
(Like this?)

3270
02:19:05,108 --> 02:19:07,277
The dance is easy, but I can't do it like him.

3271
02:19:07,278 --> 02:19:10,007
The moves were made for Jong Cheol.

3272
02:19:10,008 --> 02:19:11,907
That's a big advantage for him.

3273
02:19:12,108 --> 02:19:13,678
It's so hard, Jong Cheol.

3274
02:19:13,848 --> 02:19:17,517
Those are the moves my body makes.

3275
02:19:17,518 --> 02:19:20,456
I was like, "If you turn like this, your body automatically follows."

3276
02:19:20,457 --> 02:19:21,817
But they found it difficult.

3277
02:19:21,858 --> 02:19:24,727
So I was like, "What? This is good for me."

3278
02:19:25,127 --> 02:19:27,227
As big as you can. Then here...

3279
02:19:28,127 --> 02:19:30,828
(But the dancers of "Oldboy" don't give up and try to follow.)

3280
02:19:31,198 --> 02:19:34,097
The contemporary dancers...

3281
02:19:34,098 --> 02:19:35,268
executed it well.

3282
02:19:35,598 --> 02:19:38,906
Among them, Do Hyun stood out to me.

3283
02:19:38,907 --> 02:19:40,677
It looked like he was dancing naturally...

3284
02:19:40,678 --> 02:19:43,108
based on his interpretation.

3285
02:19:43,477 --> 02:19:45,247
It feels like Seong Yun can do anything...

3286
02:19:45,248 --> 02:19:47,546
that is given to him.

3287
02:19:47,547 --> 02:19:50,547
But no one will be as good as me.

3288
02:19:50,588 --> 02:19:51,947
(I'm going to take the main lead role.)

3289
02:19:51,948 --> 02:19:53,287
There's none.

3290
02:19:53,418 --> 02:19:55,557
I thought I was the best during the practice.

3291
02:19:55,887 --> 02:19:57,787
If I'm not confident,

3292
02:19:58,028 --> 02:19:59,187
I should go home.

3293
02:19:59,188 --> 02:20:01,327
And kick here.

3294
02:20:01,328 --> 02:20:02,427
(Kim Jong Cheol continues to teach the choreography.)

3295
02:20:02,428 --> 02:20:05,867
I've never done disconnected moves.

3296
02:20:05,868 --> 02:20:08,637
So I worried I might not be able to follow.

3297
02:20:08,698 --> 02:20:11,268
Turn with your knee and your hands on the floor.

3298
02:20:11,868 --> 02:20:16,376
Ballet dancers don't really do floor techniques.

3299
02:20:16,377 --> 02:20:19,107
Flexible and fast moves like that...

3300
02:20:19,108 --> 02:20:21,077
are very difficult for ballet dancers.

3301
02:20:21,078 --> 02:20:22,317
I felt bad.

3302
02:20:22,418 --> 02:20:25,987
The mission was the most unfavorable to ballet dancers.

3303
02:20:26,118 --> 02:20:27,657
- I have no idea. - Seriously.

3304
02:20:27,717 --> 02:20:30,088
Can you teach ballet dancers separately, please?

3305
02:20:30,358 --> 02:20:31,556
Make the angle.

3306
02:20:31,557 --> 02:20:32,626
- The angle? - Yes.

3307
02:20:32,627 --> 02:20:33,627
(A good example)

3308
02:20:33,628 --> 02:20:34,858
(A bad example)

3309
02:20:35,057 --> 02:20:36,198
It's like...

3310
02:20:36,797 --> 02:20:38,127
- It's the elbow and the head. - The elbow?

3311
02:20:39,098 --> 02:20:40,796
Jong Cheol...

3312
02:20:40,797 --> 02:20:43,767
used a lot of contemporary moves.

3313
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:48,178
I'm worried about how I can express that with my body.

3314
02:20:48,278 --> 02:20:51,146
I think we, ballet dancers, should pause here.

3315
02:20:51,147 --> 02:20:53,277
We can't catch up with others.

3316
02:20:53,278 --> 02:20:54,677
We should practice ourselves.

3317
02:20:54,678 --> 02:20:57,316
It must've been difficult for them...

3318
02:20:57,317 --> 02:20:58,847
as they're not used to those moves.

3319
02:20:58,848 --> 02:21:00,447
Let's do it again.

3320
02:21:00,448 --> 02:21:01,617
We can do it if we keep trying.

3321
02:21:01,618 --> 02:21:04,087
I was like, "How can they practice so much?"

3322
02:21:04,088 --> 02:21:06,057
They were working really hard.

3323
02:21:06,227 --> 02:21:09,597
They're the best when it comes to ballet.

3324
02:21:09,598 --> 02:21:12,467
I could see they were working hard not to look stupid.

3325
02:21:13,528 --> 02:21:14,796
It suddenly came to my mind.

3326
02:21:14,797 --> 02:21:18,567
I was just copying Jong Cheol.

3327
02:21:18,868 --> 02:21:20,876
"The feelings he didn't show."

3328
02:21:20,877 --> 02:21:23,948
"What I'm best at. I should show something like that."

3329
02:21:24,047 --> 02:21:27,247
(That's how Kyung Won started practicing in his own way.)

3330
02:21:27,248 --> 02:21:29,947
Kim Kyung Won. I like his eyes.

3331
02:21:29,948 --> 02:21:31,716
He was so charismatic...

3332
02:21:31,717 --> 02:21:33,046
that it looked like he became the character.

3333
02:21:33,047 --> 02:21:34,716
I thought he could take the main lead role.

3334
02:21:34,717 --> 02:21:36,757
My choreography was chosen.

3335
02:21:36,758 --> 02:21:39,027
So I think I'm likely to take the main lead role.

3336
02:21:39,028 --> 02:21:41,498
I can say I worked harder than the others with confidence.

3337
02:21:41,598 --> 02:21:44,367
If I become the main lead dancer, who should I pick?

3338
02:21:44,368 --> 02:21:45,626
I even thought about it.

3339
02:21:45,627 --> 02:21:46,868
(He's going his own way as well.)

3340
02:21:47,168 --> 02:21:49,997
We'll begin the casting audition for the main lead role...

3341
02:21:49,998 --> 02:21:53,137
in "Oldboy" for the K-Contents Mission.

3342
02:21:54,407 --> 02:21:56,507
(Contemporary Dance Coach Seong Chang Yong, Master Kim Joo Won)

3343
02:21:56,508 --> 02:21:58,108
(Kang Hyo Hyung, the choreographer of "Oldboy," Choi Soo Jin)

3344
02:21:58,877 --> 02:22:01,177
Only one dancer will be cast...

3345
02:22:01,178 --> 02:22:05,687
for the main lead role on Team "Oldboy" B who will compete...

3346
02:22:05,688 --> 02:22:07,758
against Hye Hyun, the main lead dancer on Team "Oldboy" A.

3347
02:22:08,457 --> 02:22:10,316
We'll primarily evaluate...

3348
02:22:10,317 --> 02:22:12,927
how engagingly you convey

3349
02:22:12,928 --> 02:22:16,056
the character's psychological state and the concept...

3350
02:22:16,057 --> 02:22:17,828
within the given time frame.

3351
02:22:19,067 --> 02:22:21,037
When my choreography was chosen,

3352
02:22:21,098 --> 02:22:23,896
I immediately thought I would take the main lead role with confidence.

3353
02:22:23,897 --> 02:22:26,067
No one would execute it like me.

3354
02:22:26,668 --> 02:22:30,578
The choreography has his distinctive moves.

3355
02:22:30,707 --> 02:22:33,207
So I thought it was very unfavorable to us.

3356
02:22:34,018 --> 02:22:37,588
"Can I do the moves?" I was worried a lot.

3357
02:22:37,717 --> 02:22:40,087
This isn't a matter of whether I can do it or not.

3358
02:22:40,088 --> 02:22:42,858
I don't care if I'm good or not. I'm going to try it.

3359
02:22:42,987 --> 02:22:45,027
I think I'm as good as him.

3360
02:22:45,028 --> 02:22:46,957
If I'm not confident,

3361
02:22:47,227 --> 02:22:48,397
I should go home.

3362
02:22:49,297 --> 02:22:50,397
I'm confident.

3363
02:22:51,098 --> 02:22:54,037
I'm going to call the dancers in the first group.

3364
02:22:54,668 --> 02:22:58,168
Dancer Shin Min Kwon, Dancer Kim Jae Jin.

3365
02:22:58,537 --> 02:23:02,078
Dancer Cho Tae Yoon, and Dancer Yang Seong Yun.

3366
02:23:02,838 --> 02:23:06,547
The casting audition for "Oldboy" will begin.

3367
02:23:07,348 --> 02:23:08,547
First position.

3368
02:23:09,078 --> 02:23:11,018
Music, start.

3369
02:23:12,217 --> 02:23:14,017
- I'm the best. - Four.

3370
02:23:14,018 --> 02:23:15,986
- Three, two. - I wanted to win, of course.

3371
02:23:15,987 --> 02:23:17,758
One. Go.

3372
02:23:21,758 --> 02:23:22,797
(Exclaiming)

3373
02:23:25,668 --> 02:23:26,967
I got goosebumps.

3374
02:23:28,397 --> 02:23:29,498
Nice.

3375
02:23:29,537 --> 02:23:30,907
Jae Jin is good.

3376
02:23:31,037 --> 02:23:32,938
Jae Jin and Seong Yun stand out.

3377
02:23:35,678 --> 02:23:37,407
Nice. There you go.

3378
02:23:37,807 --> 02:23:39,007
- Nice. - Nice.

3379
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:40,877
Seong Yun is great.

3380
02:23:42,778 --> 02:23:43,848
I like his facial expression.

3381
02:23:45,848 --> 02:23:46,848
Nice.

3382
02:23:46,849 --> 02:23:49,118
Seong Yun is killing it.

3383
02:23:49,188 --> 02:23:50,287
(Agreeing)

3384
02:23:52,127 --> 02:23:53,258
(Exclaiming)

3385
02:23:53,358 --> 02:23:55,027
I like how Jae Jin is doing.

3386
02:23:55,028 --> 02:23:56,858
Jae Jin knows how to control his body.

3387
02:23:57,358 --> 02:23:59,428
Seong Yun stands out so much.

3388
02:24:00,397 --> 02:24:04,067
Three, two, one. Stop.

3389
02:24:05,807 --> 02:24:07,137
Well done.

3390
02:24:07,207 --> 02:24:09,877
- The others didn't stand out. - Right.

3391
02:24:09,938 --> 02:24:12,906
- Seong Yun was dominating. - Yes.

3392
02:24:12,907 --> 02:24:15,518
Seong Yun in the first group caught my eye.

3393
02:24:16,147 --> 02:24:17,147
The second group.

3394
02:24:17,148 --> 02:24:20,217
Dancer Kim Do Hyun, Dancer Jeon Tae Hu.

3395
02:24:20,748 --> 02:24:23,588
Dancer Ki Moo Gan, and Dancer Park Min Woo.

3396
02:24:24,287 --> 02:24:26,427
- Five, four. - Ki Moo Gan and Kim Do Hyun.

3397
02:24:26,428 --> 02:24:28,427
- Three, two, one. - I had high expectations of them.

3398
02:24:28,428 --> 02:24:29,897
(The second group for the casting audition for "Oldboy")

3399
02:24:33,967 --> 02:24:36,197
- Do Hyun. - He's good.

3400
02:24:36,198 --> 02:24:37,668
How is Do Hyun so good?

3401
02:24:38,067 --> 02:24:40,438
Do Hyun stands out.

3402
02:24:41,877 --> 02:24:43,537
I also like Moo Gan.

3403
02:24:49,578 --> 02:24:50,717
Nice.

3404
02:24:51,817 --> 02:24:52,887
(Impressed)

3405
02:24:54,487 --> 02:24:55,886
(Ki Moo Gan and Kim Do Hyun's jumps feel different.)

3406
02:24:55,887 --> 02:24:57,157
The jump was so good.

3407
02:24:57,217 --> 02:24:58,387
They're really good.

3408
02:25:02,057 --> 02:25:04,867
I wish Moo Gan's moves were a little bit more powerful.

3409
02:25:04,868 --> 02:25:07,127
It would accentuate the energy.

3410
02:25:07,897 --> 02:25:09,067
It's crazy.

3411
02:25:10,467 --> 02:25:12,707
- I like Do Hyun's moves. - He's crazy.

3412
02:25:13,108 --> 02:25:14,237
Everyone is crazy.

3413
02:25:18,248 --> 02:25:21,977
Three, two, one. Stop.

3414
02:25:23,977 --> 02:25:24,986
It was so good.

3415
02:25:24,987 --> 02:25:27,146
Do Hyun...

3416
02:25:27,147 --> 02:25:28,987
and Moo Gan are good.

3417
02:25:29,258 --> 02:25:30,986
The dancers in the third group.

3418
02:25:30,987 --> 02:25:31,987
(The third group for "Oldboy")

3419
02:25:32,328 --> 02:25:33,457
Here comes the choreographer.

3420
02:25:34,227 --> 02:25:38,928
Kim Jong Cheol, Kim Kyung Won, and Kim Tae Yeon.

3421
02:25:39,797 --> 02:25:41,867
- Five, four. - It's Jong Cheol's choreography.

3422
02:25:41,868 --> 02:25:43,796
- Three, two. - I'll show my dance.

3423
02:25:43,797 --> 02:25:45,306
- One. Go. - Then I'm going to make it.

3424
02:25:45,307 --> 02:25:46,407
Good.

3425
02:25:51,508 --> 02:25:54,317
I like Kyung Won.

3426
02:25:55,647 --> 02:25:56,748
He knows how to utilize his body.

3427
02:25:57,348 --> 02:25:58,588
Jong Cheol's dance is sensual.

3428
02:25:59,518 --> 02:26:00,588
He's good.

3429
02:26:02,618 --> 02:26:04,157
He's indeed the choreographer.

3430
02:26:06,328 --> 02:26:07,828
Kyung Won is also a veteran.

3431
02:26:08,258 --> 02:26:09,297
There you go.

3432
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:12,528
I like their emotions.

3433
02:26:14,397 --> 02:26:15,397
It's over.

3434
02:26:17,768 --> 02:26:18,868
It's over.

3435
02:26:21,008 --> 02:26:22,008
Oh, my gosh.

3436
02:26:22,009 --> 02:26:24,307
Jong Cheol's body lines are clear.

3437
02:26:26,108 --> 02:26:27,748
Kyung Won looks like he has a lot of experience on stage.

3438
02:26:28,848 --> 02:26:29,848
(Perfect spins)

3439
02:26:29,849 --> 02:26:31,618
- I like Kyung Won too. - One. Stop.

3440
02:26:34,188 --> 02:26:37,088
(The ending technique)

3441
02:26:38,188 --> 02:26:39,188
Bravo.

3442
02:26:40,088 --> 02:26:41,828
It was like Jong Cheol's solo performance.

3443
02:26:42,598 --> 02:26:44,467
Jong Cheol has become an amazing dancer.

3444
02:26:45,028 --> 02:26:47,227
I saw madness in Jong Cheol.

3445
02:26:48,067 --> 02:26:51,107
The dancers in the fourth group are Jung Sung Wook,

3446
02:26:51,108 --> 02:26:54,477
Choi Ji Won, and Sung Hun Mo.

3447
02:26:55,537 --> 02:26:57,237
- Five, four. - I should take the main lead role.

3448
02:26:57,647 --> 02:26:59,306
- Three, two. - I think I'll make it.

3449
02:26:59,307 --> 02:27:01,078
- So I'm going to do my best. - One. Go.

3450
02:27:06,188 --> 02:27:07,248
Sung Wook.

3451
02:27:07,657 --> 02:27:09,157
Sung Wook isn't bad.

3452
02:27:10,317 --> 02:27:12,028
I really like...

3453
02:27:12,887 --> 02:27:14,697
Ji Won's energy.

3454
02:27:14,698 --> 02:27:17,557
But he should show more.

3455
02:27:22,637 --> 02:27:24,067
His moves are unique.

3456
02:27:25,137 --> 02:27:26,206
(All eyes are on him.)

3457
02:27:26,207 --> 02:27:27,307
He's good.

3458
02:27:28,207 --> 02:27:29,577
It's light.

3459
02:27:29,578 --> 02:27:30,707
Sung Wook is crazy.

3460
02:27:32,078 --> 02:27:33,778
I like Sung Wook.

3461
02:27:36,618 --> 02:27:38,087
(The dance is reaching the climax.)

3462
02:27:38,088 --> 02:27:39,688
(The choreographer is checking.)

3463
02:27:40,448 --> 02:27:41,457
Nice.

3464
02:27:44,457 --> 02:27:45,956
- Their moves are all delicate. - Three.

3465
02:27:45,957 --> 02:27:47,797
- They're all delicate. - Two, one.

3466
02:27:47,957 --> 02:27:49,697
(The casting audition for the fourth group ends.)

3467
02:27:49,698 --> 02:27:52,197
Two, one. Stop.

3468
02:27:52,198 --> 02:27:53,227
Oh, no.

3469
02:27:54,067 --> 02:27:56,267
(The coaches are thinking after the audition ends.)

3470
02:27:56,268 --> 02:27:57,498
(You worked hard.)

3471
02:27:57,868 --> 02:27:59,467
- Hye Hyun. - Yes.

3472
02:27:59,838 --> 02:28:02,108
Who do you think is your biggest rival?

3473
02:28:02,508 --> 02:28:03,877
My rival?

3474
02:28:04,647 --> 02:28:05,907
Who will be your biggest rival if he becomes the main lead dancer?

3475
02:28:06,377 --> 02:28:07,877
There's none.

3476
02:28:08,877 --> 02:28:09,877
(Impressed)

3477
02:28:09,878 --> 02:28:11,117
(Smiling)

3478
02:28:11,118 --> 02:28:12,286
That's hip-hop.

3479
02:28:12,287 --> 02:28:13,647
(Who will take the main lead role on Team B and become his rival?)

3480
02:28:14,118 --> 02:28:18,487
Jong Cheol, your moves were unrivaled.

3481
02:28:19,088 --> 02:28:22,257
The character is in an extreme situation.

3482
02:28:22,258 --> 02:28:24,928
So I wanted to see the dancers express raw feelings.

3483
02:28:25,168 --> 02:28:27,667
In that sense, you expressed the feelings well.

3484
02:28:27,668 --> 02:28:32,167
You must've executed it well because it's your choreography,

3485
02:28:32,168 --> 02:28:34,438
but I was genuinely impressed.

3486
02:28:35,907 --> 02:28:39,748
Seong Yun, you're like a monster.

3487
02:28:40,477 --> 02:28:43,146
When you danced,

3488
02:28:43,147 --> 02:28:45,547
I couldn't think of the original choreography.

3489
02:28:45,817 --> 02:28:48,456
You expressed and interpreted it in your own way,

3490
02:28:48,457 --> 02:28:50,786
which gives it a unique energy and texture.

3491
02:28:50,787 --> 02:28:53,688
That's why you had a special presence.

3492
02:28:53,987 --> 02:28:58,028
You were one of the most impressive dancers.

3493
02:28:58,198 --> 02:28:59,528
I enjoyed it.

3494
02:29:00,328 --> 02:29:04,137
"I can execute this kind of dance very well."

3495
02:29:04,268 --> 02:29:06,838
There are dances that make them stand out.

3496
02:29:07,137 --> 02:29:09,536
I think Jae Jin and Do Hyun...

3497
02:29:09,537 --> 02:29:12,608
showed something like that, which was surprising.

3498
02:29:12,977 --> 02:29:16,216
Your expressions and movements of your bodies...

3499
02:29:16,217 --> 02:29:19,887
grabbed my attention.

3500
02:29:20,688 --> 02:29:24,387
From what I know, you were struggling on the bottom.

3501
02:29:25,258 --> 02:29:28,627
I think you're ready to escape the Under Class now.

3502
02:29:29,627 --> 02:29:30,998
(Let's escape.)

3503
02:29:31,498 --> 02:29:33,867
Yes. That's what I felt.

3504
02:29:33,868 --> 02:29:35,897
You've become an amazing dancer.

3505
02:29:36,838 --> 02:29:38,167
(Thank you.)

3506
02:29:38,168 --> 02:29:40,037
Moo Gan.

3507
02:29:40,768 --> 02:29:42,706
- Yes. - I always think...

3508
02:29:42,707 --> 02:29:44,507
you're very stable.

3509
02:29:44,508 --> 02:29:48,046
You're an exceptionally talented dancer,

3510
02:29:48,047 --> 02:29:50,517
in both your expressive abilities and execution of movements,

3511
02:29:50,518 --> 02:29:52,046
so I always have high expectations.

3512
02:29:52,047 --> 02:29:54,348
But I'm curious somehow.

3513
02:29:54,557 --> 02:29:58,427
Because I feel like you've been struggling.

3514
02:29:58,428 --> 02:30:01,698
Of course, you must be doing your best,

3515
02:30:02,098 --> 02:30:05,527
but I want to know how you feel.

3516
02:30:05,528 --> 02:30:08,536
I want to know what your mindset...

3517
02:30:08,537 --> 02:30:11,536
and approach toward this mission are.

3518
02:30:11,537 --> 02:30:13,567
(Thinking hard)

3519
02:30:18,307 --> 02:30:21,876
(He can't open his mouth easily.)

3520
02:30:21,877 --> 02:30:23,817
(Moo Gan...)

3521
02:30:26,588 --> 02:30:27,646
You were shining.

3522
02:30:27,647 --> 02:30:28,987
(What happened to Moo Gan?)

3523
02:30:29,118 --> 02:30:32,858
(To be continued)

3524
02:30:33,057 --> 02:30:35,827
I want to know what your mindset...

3525
02:30:35,828 --> 02:30:38,896
and approach toward this mission are.

3526
02:30:38,897 --> 02:30:40,997
(Thinking hard)

3527
02:30:40,998 --> 02:30:42,797
(Worried)

3528
02:30:43,938 --> 02:30:45,736
(Hesitant)

3529
02:30:45,737 --> 02:30:48,537
(He can't open his mouth easily.)

3530
02:30:49,307 --> 02:30:52,477
Actually, after doing the moves,

3531
02:30:52,907 --> 02:30:56,877
I'm a little disappointed in myself.

3532
02:30:57,377 --> 02:30:59,448
It looks like it. He could've been done better.

3533
02:30:59,787 --> 02:31:03,088
Participating in the audition for this mission,

3534
02:31:03,817 --> 02:31:07,997
I really wanted to do well for the first time.

3535
02:31:07,998 --> 02:31:12,328
But I haven't been able to manage my condition well.

3536
02:31:13,297 --> 02:31:14,997
(He participated in the audition sincerely,)

3537
02:31:14,998 --> 02:31:16,397
(but he's disappointed in himself as he's not feeling well.)

3538
02:31:17,137 --> 02:31:19,567
That's why I'm upset.

3539
02:31:20,907 --> 02:31:22,608
I want to do well.

3540
02:31:23,037 --> 02:31:24,277
I feel so bad.

3541
02:31:24,278 --> 02:31:25,306
(Trying to smile)

3542
02:31:25,307 --> 02:31:27,306
"I should do it well."

3543
02:31:27,307 --> 02:31:30,146
I rarely think like that.

3544
02:31:30,147 --> 02:31:32,748
Because I ruin it when I try to do well.

3545
02:31:33,287 --> 02:31:35,817
I appeared as if I was something.

3546
02:31:36,317 --> 02:31:37,557
But I've been struggling.

3547
02:31:39,188 --> 02:31:41,428
People had high expectations of me.

3548
02:31:41,797 --> 02:31:44,527
But I knew I wouldn't meet their expectations.

3549
02:31:44,528 --> 02:31:47,168
I knew I would be bad.

3550
02:31:47,428 --> 02:31:49,198
Their expectations weigh heavy on me.

3551
02:31:50,797 --> 02:31:54,008
I really wanted to do well this time.

3552
02:31:54,438 --> 02:31:57,008
But I knew I wasn't feeling well.

3553
02:31:58,778 --> 02:32:00,248
This is really annoying.

3554
02:32:02,248 --> 02:32:03,817
I was just so upset.

3555
02:32:04,618 --> 02:32:07,347
From my perspective,

3556
02:32:07,348 --> 02:32:10,986
you're an incredibly delicate and sensitive dancer.

3557
02:32:10,987 --> 02:32:14,726
So I felt that dancing with many other dancers...

3558
02:32:14,727 --> 02:32:19,127
was too stimulating and had a significant impact on you.

3559
02:32:19,467 --> 02:32:20,497
Yes.

3560
02:32:20,498 --> 02:32:23,437
I really want you to utilize...

3561
02:32:23,438 --> 02:32:25,406
your sensitivity and delicacy.

3562
02:32:25,407 --> 02:32:27,306
So next time,

3563
02:32:27,307 --> 02:32:29,837
I hope you forget about their expectations or the environment...

3564
02:32:29,838 --> 02:32:33,147
and dance more comfortably.

3565
02:32:33,608 --> 02:32:34,748
Thank you.

3566
02:32:34,977 --> 02:32:37,948
"I also hope I can do that." That's what I thought.

3567
02:32:38,387 --> 02:32:39,787
I was just so grateful.

3568
02:32:40,248 --> 02:32:41,518
I really liked his dance.

3569
02:32:41,858 --> 02:32:44,057
Goblin Ki Moo Gan, come back.

3570
02:32:44,627 --> 02:32:46,886
Honestly, today,

3571
02:32:46,887 --> 02:32:49,456
Jong Cheol expressed it so well.

3572
02:32:49,457 --> 02:32:50,627
- He was phenomenal. - Yes.

3573
02:32:50,998 --> 02:32:53,066
He executed his choreography the best.

3574
02:32:53,067 --> 02:32:54,226
- It can't he helped. - Right.

3575
02:32:54,227 --> 02:32:56,598
Based on the audition itself,

3576
02:32:56,797 --> 02:32:58,938
- It's him. - Seong Yun was unrivaled.

3577
02:32:59,067 --> 02:33:00,237
- Anyone would think that. - Actually, I also...

3578
02:33:00,608 --> 02:33:04,748
But it doesn't feel like he's the best for the role.

3579
02:33:04,948 --> 02:33:07,046
That's what makes me hesitant.

3580
02:33:07,047 --> 02:33:09,376
He was great in the audition, but it doesn't necessarily mean...

3581
02:33:09,377 --> 02:33:11,047
he suits the role or is essential for the performance.

3582
02:33:11,217 --> 02:33:12,387
It's a shame.

3583
02:33:13,047 --> 02:33:15,358
There's no way they won't cast me for the main lead role.

3584
02:33:15,688 --> 02:33:18,428
I thought I was the best. I think I'll win.

3585
02:33:18,727 --> 02:33:21,227
The casting audition for the main lead role in "Oldboy."

3586
02:33:21,457 --> 02:33:24,767
I'm going to announce the dancer who was cast...

3587
02:33:24,768 --> 02:33:28,368
for the main lead role on Team B, the one confining.

3588
02:33:28,438 --> 02:33:30,168
(He's also nervous.)

3589
02:33:30,467 --> 02:33:32,338
It's Dancer Kim Jong Cheol.

3590
02:33:33,467 --> 02:33:36,078
(Kim Jong Cheol takes the main lead role for "Oldboy.")

3591
02:33:36,438 --> 02:33:37,476
(Congratulating)

3592
02:33:37,477 --> 02:33:39,778
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol in First Class...

3593
02:33:40,047 --> 02:33:43,546
embodied the character in every aspect,

3594
02:33:43,547 --> 02:33:46,717
from this movements and perfect technique to the music.

3595
02:33:47,217 --> 02:33:48,286
Congratulations.

3596
02:33:48,287 --> 02:33:50,088
(Check the rest of the results on THE CHOOM.)

3597
02:33:50,387 --> 02:33:52,157
I've finally become the main lead dancer.

3598
02:33:52,727 --> 02:33:55,598
I've never played the main lead role in First Class before.

3599
02:33:56,858 --> 02:33:57,957
It felt great.

3600
02:33:58,627 --> 02:34:00,296
The Seat Class Evaluation based on the full performance...

3601
02:34:00,297 --> 02:34:02,597
in the K-Contents Mission...

3602
02:34:02,598 --> 02:34:04,297
will begin on the Mnet Plus app soon.

3603
02:34:04,668 --> 02:34:07,537
Please vote for their Seat Class by ticketing.

3604
02:34:07,967 --> 02:34:08,976
(The K-Contents Poster Shooting Mission...)

3605
02:34:08,977 --> 02:34:11,476
(for the dancers)

3606
02:34:11,477 --> 02:34:12,477
(Ideas are important.)

3607
02:34:12,478 --> 02:34:14,177
(Only the photo of the winning team...)

3608
02:34:14,178 --> 02:34:16,376
(will be on the main poster.)

3609
02:34:16,377 --> 02:34:19,517
(Who will earn the best benefit on the show so far?)

3610
02:34:19,518 --> 02:34:21,886
(After the fierce casting audition ends)

3611
02:34:21,887 --> 02:34:23,057
The air is so nice.

3612
02:34:23,557 --> 02:34:24,787
What do you think we're going to do today?

3613
02:34:25,057 --> 02:34:26,556
I can't make predictions.

3614
02:34:26,557 --> 02:34:27,688
Is it an interim review?

3615
02:34:28,198 --> 02:34:29,198
No.

3616
02:34:29,199 --> 02:34:31,397
- No way. - The crow is ominous.

3617
02:34:32,368 --> 02:34:34,737
What is it waiting for us today?

3618
02:34:35,737 --> 02:34:36,838
What is it?

3619
02:34:37,567 --> 02:34:39,307
- It's cool. - They're showing us something.

3620
02:34:40,168 --> 02:34:41,207
I guess we're going to do something.

3621
02:34:41,778 --> 02:34:43,338
Kang Daniel might appear out of nowhere.

3622
02:34:43,637 --> 02:34:44,948
What is it?

3623
02:34:45,508 --> 02:34:48,046
I'm Photographer Lee Se Hyeong.

3624
02:34:48,047 --> 02:34:49,047
It's nice to meet you.

3625
02:34:49,848 --> 02:34:51,077
(Known for his unconventional angles and sophisticated tones,)

3626
02:34:51,078 --> 02:34:52,547
(he's a renowned photographer who worked with domestic...)

3627
02:34:52,647 --> 02:34:54,418
(and international artists like JYP, TWICE, NCT, and ITZY.)

3628
02:34:54,717 --> 02:34:56,758
I'm going to give you a mission today.

3629
02:34:57,188 --> 02:34:58,227
There's another mission?

3630
02:34:58,328 --> 02:34:59,386
It's a mission again?

3631
02:34:59,387 --> 02:35:01,258
It's the K-Contents Poster Shooting Mission.

3632
02:35:01,627 --> 02:35:03,127
(K-Contents Poster Shooting Mission)

3633
02:35:03,328 --> 02:35:04,357
(A poster shooting?)

3634
02:35:04,358 --> 02:35:05,427
(Glancing)

3635
02:35:05,428 --> 02:35:08,797
I actually like cameras. So I was confident.

3636
02:35:08,897 --> 02:35:10,197
- Please help me. - We should discuss...

3637
02:35:10,198 --> 02:35:11,198
after washing up.

3638
02:35:11,199 --> 02:35:14,567
I don't have much photoshoot experience. So I wasn't confident.

3639
02:35:15,278 --> 02:35:17,237
It was the first mission that had fazed me.

3640
02:35:17,338 --> 02:35:18,608
We'll proceed with a mission...

3641
02:35:18,707 --> 02:35:21,306
to determine the main poster for the work...

3642
02:35:21,307 --> 02:35:23,447
through a competition between Team A and B,

3643
02:35:23,448 --> 02:35:25,418
based on how you interpret and express the character.

3644
02:35:25,518 --> 02:35:27,918
The winning team will receive a benefit.

3645
02:35:28,487 --> 02:35:31,287
The poster of the winning team will become the main poster.

3646
02:35:31,657 --> 02:35:34,627
And it will be posted on the online voting page...

3647
02:35:34,928 --> 02:35:37,457
as the main poster.

3648
02:35:38,227 --> 02:35:40,726
- When they press "Squid Game," - And the work...

3649
02:35:40,727 --> 02:35:42,397
our faces will be on the next page or not.

3650
02:35:42,897 --> 02:35:44,967
- That'll improve our image. - It'll give us an advantage.

3651
02:35:45,008 --> 02:35:46,567
Because they'll see the main poster a lot.

3652
02:35:47,008 --> 02:35:48,178
I can't let them take it.

3653
02:35:48,278 --> 02:35:50,778
The main lead dancers will have solo shots.

3654
02:35:51,078 --> 02:35:52,748
The main supporting dancers will have two shots.

3655
02:35:52,848 --> 02:35:55,147
And Team A and Team B will have group shots.

3656
02:35:55,248 --> 02:35:57,778
Each shot should be taken in ten minutes.

3657
02:35:58,118 --> 02:35:59,448
(Sighing automatically)

3658
02:35:59,787 --> 02:36:01,418
That's short.

3659
02:36:02,358 --> 02:36:03,418
It's time attack.

3660
02:36:03,588 --> 02:36:05,188
Let's start the mission right away.

3661
02:36:05,957 --> 02:36:09,557
Let's begin the Poster Shooting Mission for Team "Parasite."

3662
02:36:09,758 --> 02:36:11,027
(Main lead role: Choi Ho Jong)

3663
02:36:11,028 --> 02:36:13,396
(Main supporting role: Kim Young Woong, Ha Won Jun)

3664
02:36:13,397 --> 02:36:15,197
"How can we finish it in such a short time?"

3665
02:36:15,198 --> 02:36:17,537
I didn't know what to do. I was flustered.

3666
02:36:17,938 --> 02:36:19,267
(Main lead role: Kim Kyu Nyeon)

3667
02:36:19,268 --> 02:36:21,437
(Main supporting role: Ryu Tae Young, Bang Seong Hyun)

3668
02:36:21,438 --> 02:36:24,037
I thought we must win the mission...

3669
02:36:24,137 --> 02:36:25,778
because we need to grab people's attention.

3670
02:36:25,977 --> 02:36:28,777
- Please start the timer now. - Let's begin the shoot.

3671
02:36:28,778 --> 02:36:29,977
(The first group shot for the poster of "Parasite")

3672
02:36:30,217 --> 02:36:31,348
(Team "Parasite" A is checking the group shots.)

3673
02:36:31,547 --> 02:36:32,847
(Ho Jong is thinking while looking at the photos.)

3674
02:36:32,848 --> 02:36:34,447
The background stood out.

3675
02:36:34,448 --> 02:36:37,588
And it didn't go well with what we had prepared.

3676
02:36:37,688 --> 02:36:40,457
I thought it wasn't working.

3677
02:36:40,557 --> 02:36:42,758
(They stand diagonally.)

3678
02:36:42,998 --> 02:36:45,297
There are too many of you to stand in a diagonal line.

3679
02:36:45,498 --> 02:36:47,368
People in the second row are sitting too low.

3680
02:36:48,067 --> 02:36:49,338
We're in trouble. We have five minutes left.

3681
02:36:49,838 --> 02:36:52,967
I could tell Ho Jong's team was perplexed.

3682
02:36:53,067 --> 02:36:55,578
We have 2 minutes and 30 seconds. We need to take pictures now.

3683
02:36:55,678 --> 02:36:57,937
I saw them changing the composition at the last minute.

3684
02:36:57,938 --> 02:36:59,646
I thought we would win.

3685
02:36:59,647 --> 02:37:01,647
We have 40 seconds. Strike a pose, everyone.

3686
02:37:02,147 --> 02:37:04,117
(Team "Parasite" A continues with the shooting.)

3687
02:37:04,118 --> 02:37:07,088
Nice. It's the best one so far.

3688
02:37:11,688 --> 02:37:14,787
(They barely made it.)

3689
02:37:15,127 --> 02:37:17,928
I'm upset because it was unexpected.

3690
02:37:18,028 --> 02:37:19,667
- Hello. Yes. - We...

3691
02:37:19,668 --> 02:37:21,297
The composition...

3692
02:37:21,637 --> 02:37:23,498
We made it look like the ensemble was our skirt.

3693
02:37:23,698 --> 02:37:26,567
And Kyu Nyeon was looking at them like he was envious.

3694
02:37:26,668 --> 02:37:28,938
We created a triangular composition.

3695
02:37:29,207 --> 02:37:30,737
(Team B is shooting quickly thanks to their pre-planned composition.)

3696
02:37:32,248 --> 02:37:34,248
- Nice. - That's nice.

3697
02:37:35,078 --> 02:37:37,518
I got nervous after looking at their group shots.

3698
02:37:37,618 --> 02:37:40,018
Their message was delivered effectively. They did a good job.

3699
02:37:40,647 --> 02:37:41,917
(Park Jin Ho, the main lead dancer of "SKY Castle" starts shooting.)

3700
02:37:41,918 --> 02:37:43,588
There you go. It's much better with the hands.

3701
02:37:43,657 --> 02:37:45,387
(Veins are popping out as well.)

3702
02:37:45,758 --> 02:37:48,656
Good. I like it so much.

3703
02:37:48,657 --> 02:37:49,657
(The photographer keeps exclaiming.)

3704
02:37:49,658 --> 02:37:52,627
Nice. Just like that. This is cool. I really like this.

3705
02:37:52,727 --> 02:37:53,896
(Today, he's a prince, not a princess.)

3706
02:37:53,897 --> 02:37:54,897
It looks good.

3707
02:37:54,898 --> 02:37:56,098
I would've become a fan.

3708
02:37:56,438 --> 02:37:58,037
- Tell me if it's choking. - Okay.

3709
02:37:58,368 --> 02:38:00,236
(Yun Hyeok Jung, the main lead dancer of "SKY Castle" is shooting.)

3710
02:38:00,237 --> 02:38:01,306
- Good. - He...

3711
02:38:01,307 --> 02:38:04,206
just looks like an office worker who drank a lot yesterday.

3712
02:38:04,207 --> 02:38:05,578
(That was a good one, Yu Chan!)

3713
02:38:06,508 --> 02:38:07,577
Nice.

3714
02:38:07,578 --> 02:38:08,647
(Kill him!)

3715
02:38:09,078 --> 02:38:10,078
This is good.

3716
02:38:10,578 --> 02:38:11,578
That's what I'm talking about.

02:38:11,579 --> 02:38:13,517
(Check their profiles and behind-the-scenes on Mnet Plus.)

3718
02:38:13,518 --> 02:38:14,547
Nice.

3719
02:38:15,118 --> 02:38:16,118
I like it.

3720
02:38:16,119 --> 02:38:17,787
It's the Poster Shooting Mission for "Squid Game."

3721
02:38:18,018 --> 02:38:19,557
(Main supporting role: Kim Hyun Ho, Kim Hyo Joon)

3722
02:38:19,858 --> 02:38:21,328

3725
02:38:26,098 --> 02:38:27,098
Great.

(Main lead role: Kim Hye Hyun)

3727
02:38:28,168 --> 02:38:29,236
Good.

3728
02:38:29,237 --> 02:38:31,536
This is nice. It looks like a myth.

3729
02:38:31,537 --> 02:38:32,706
(Please visit Mnet Plus to check the winning team.)

3730
02:38:32,707 --> 02:38:34,108
There you go. That's nice.

3731
02:38:34,737 --> 02:38:37,278

3744
02:39:08,778 --> 02:39:10,977
that suits their work by ticketing.

3745
02:39:11,377 --> 02:39:14,278
There are four Seat Classes.

3746

VIP, R, S, and A.

3747
02:39:17,948 --> 02:39:20,487
Different scores will be added for each Seat Class.

3748

Between Team A and Team B for each work,

3749

3753
02:39:34,868 --> 02:39:36,737
(An episode with the K-Contents Poster Mission on November 5)

3754
02:39:38,037 --> 02:39:39,108
(Tuesday, November 12, at 10pm,)

3755
02:39:42,637 --> 02:39:43,707
(The K-Contents Performance Evaluation...)

3756
02:39:47,008 --> 02:39:49,047
(and the 2nd Class Movement Ceremony will be revealed.)

3757
02:39:49,317 --> 02:39:50,717
Let's begin the rehearsal.

3758
02:39:51,147 --> 02:39:53,987
(A rehearsal for Team "Parasite" A begins.)

3759
02:39:54,317 --> 02:39:55,557
Won Jun, you should go further in the back.

3760
02:39:55,887 --> 02:39:57,157
Won Jun, you should go that way.

3761
02:39:57,588 --> 02:39:59,387
(Won Jun keeps missing his position.)

3762
02:39:59,528 --> 02:40:00,727
(Serious)

3763
02:40:00,987 --> 02:40:03,457
Won Jun, you keep missing your position in the center.

3764
02:40:03,828 --> 02:40:05,367
When Young Woong is coming to the center,

3765
02:40:05,368 --> 02:40:06,897
you're the only one missing the position.

3766
02:40:07,067 --> 02:40:08,637
I'm nervous because of Won Jun.

3767
02:40:09,168 --> 02:40:11,837
I think we were nervous for one another.

3768
02:40:11,838 --> 02:40:12,867
(Shaking his head)

3769
02:40:12,868 --> 02:40:15,838
Won Jun, if you do it like this, we can't be in sync.

3770
02:40:16,407 --> 02:40:18,108
Honestly, I really wanted to go home.

3771
02:40:18,338 --> 02:40:20,178
They kept pointing it out,

3772
02:40:20,508 --> 02:40:21,778
but I couldn't get it together.

3773
02:40:22,377 --> 02:40:24,517
It was my first time to play the main supporting role,

3774
02:40:24,518 --> 02:40:25,887
so there was a lot of pressure.

3775
02:40:27,018 --> 02:40:29,816
- There you go. - That's right.

3776
02:40:29,817 --> 02:40:31,717
One point for Tae Young.

3777
02:40:31,887 --> 02:40:33,887
(The atmosphere is good, unlike Team A.)

3778
02:40:34,088 --> 02:40:35,528
(Team A is silent.)

3779
02:40:36,057 --> 02:40:38,097
The main lead and supporting dancers on our team...

3780
02:40:38,098 --> 02:40:40,198
will be in trouble because of me.

3781
02:40:40,828 --> 02:40:44,297
I'll get it together.

3782
02:40:46,338 --> 02:40:49,008
(What will happen to Team "Parasite" A?)

3783
02:40:49,237 --> 02:40:50,707
(Stage Choice by Public Mission)

3784
02:40:50,907 --> 02:40:52,047
- Oh, my. - What?

3785
02:40:52,748 --> 02:40:53,807
(What is it?)

3786
02:40:53,848 --> 02:40:55,977
(Stage Choice by Public Mission)

3787
02:40:56,248 --> 02:40:58,047
(Do you think we'll go to public places and do something?)

3788
02:40:58,248 --> 02:40:59,286
(Stage Choice by Public)

3789
02:40:59,287 --> 02:41:00,317
(The first mission where they are cast based on the public's choice)

3790
02:41:00,918 --> 02:41:02,716
(The first mission based on the public's choice on Stage Fighter)

3791
02:41:02,717 --> 02:41:04,217
(The public's choice?)

3792
02:41:04,817 --> 02:41:06,758
(The public will pick the main lead dancer?)

3793
02:41:06,858 --> 02:41:09,797
(Possessed by Matthew)

3794
02:41:09,928 --> 02:41:12,197
(We won't be divided into 1st, 2nd, or Under Class.)

3795
02:41:12,198 --> 02:41:13,626
(We'll be evaluated regardless of our class.)

3796
02:41:13,627 --> 02:41:15,498
(All of us are equal in front of the public.)

3797
02:41:15,838 --> 02:41:17,698
(The main lead dancer will make the choreography and direct it.)

3798
02:41:17,938 --> 02:41:20,268
(The main lead dancer will have the right to direct it!)

3799
02:41:20,368 --> 02:41:22,907
(- Isn't it the best benefit so far? - You suddenly get greedy, right?)

3800
02:41:23,407 --> 02:41:26,107
(The main lead dancers selected by the public will be revealed...)

3801
02:41:26,108 --> 02:41:27,607
(on Tuesday, November 12, at 10pm.)

3802
02:41:27,608 --> 02:41:28,917
(Impressed)

3803
02:41:28,918 --> 02:41:30,146
(That's sexy.)

3804
02:41:30,147 --> 02:41:34,188
(Dash)

3805
02:41:34,418 --> 02:41:35,987
(It's crazy.)

3806
02:41:36,018 --> 02:41:37,088
(This is what I'm talking about!)

3807
02:41:37,118 --> 02:41:42,258
(Salvation)

3808
02:41:42,358 --> 02:41:46,227
(Nightmare)

3809
02:41:46,498 --> 02:41:48,227
(It's right up his alley.)

3810
02:41:51,907 --> 02:41:53,307
(This is insane.)

3811
02:41:53,768 --> 02:41:55,067
(I think we're going to perform.)

3812
02:41:55,338 --> 02:41:57,178
(Is it a surprise performance?)

3813
02:41:57,377 --> 02:41:59,277
(You're invited to the recording on Sunday, November 10.)

3814
02:41:59,278 --> 02:42:01,347
