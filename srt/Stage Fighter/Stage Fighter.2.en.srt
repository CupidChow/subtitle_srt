(Stage Fighter)

00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:21,660
(Kim Yu Chan, 13 years old)

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,300
I started ballet when I was in fifth grade.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,199
My mother recommended it.

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,268
My younger sister started ballet first.

6
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:32,938
My older sister does ballet,

7
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,740
and I started after watching her do it.

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,008
The hardest part to get used to when I first started ballet...

9
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,149
was the fact that I had to wear tights.

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,950
Like, "How can a man wear those?"

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,380
I think I was in sixth grade.

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,788
I went to the academy after I started dancing,

13
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,390
and I was the only boy.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,460
I was wearing tights and a tight top.

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,389
I was afraid of getting teased for it.

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,728
I was so ashamed.

17
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,299
"A man wears tights?"

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,399
Those prejudices were hard on me.

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,499
I said, "I'd never wear tights. I'm not going to do ballet."

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,840
Then, I went to watch it, and they were so cool.

21
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,310
A male dancer in tights was dancing.

22
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,149
And the grains and shapes of the man's muscles...

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,450
looked so cool.

24
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,579
I wanted to be like them.

25
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,390
I immediately thought that I wanted to do it.

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,419
But when I wore them,

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,959
my physique showed too explicitly.

28
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,060
He's got the best lines.

29
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,629
- He has beautiful lines. - Yes.

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,968
The overall lines of my body change...

31
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,599
if I miss just a day of exercise.

32
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,669
It just ends...

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,469
If you don't stick to harsh self-management.

34
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,140
I had no idea the tights meant so much.

35
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,348
Ballet is a type of art in which we have to strive...

36
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,379
every day to perfect our bodies and lines.

37
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,789
And the tights mean our effort, passion...

38
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,019
And sweat.

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,530
Ballet is a type of art that you can't fake on the stage.

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,598
You wear these things called tights...

41
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,800
that show every part of your body and stand there.

42
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,568
So, dancers always have to strain our bodies.

43
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,169
Knowing that this art is...

44
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,509
a battle that starts and ends with fighting against oneself,

45
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,839
in which one constantly strives...

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,949
to better showcase their strengths,

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,150
I am touched deeply, and it makes me sympathetic.

48
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,589
(The art of graceful movements expressed with relentless effort,)

49
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,749
(ballet)

50
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,419
The moment I first put on those tights,

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,530
my life began.

52
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:36,859
- Again... - We...

53
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,930
- Wear tights... - And dance.

54
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,030
- Yes! - Yes!

55
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,090
(Stage Fighter)

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,819
Dancers express things with their bodies.

57
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,259
That's why our first audition begins by talking about our bodies.

(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

62
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,270
(The battle of techniques so gentle yet powerful)

63
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,369
Nice.

64
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,409
I'm shocked.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,279
(Contemporary dance Physical and Technique Audition follows.)

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,340
He's a good jumper.

67
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,848
(The athletic dancers have fierce dance-offs.)

68
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,110
They have great techniques.

69
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,479
(Their classes are first determined through this audition.)

70
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,089
(And the day of the Class Battle has come.)

71
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,150
(You don't know what it took for me to get here.)

72
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,918
I think he should go to First.

73
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,789
Please switch places.

74
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:42,089
My final chance to move up to First.

75
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,999
Shouldn't I be in the First Class?

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,199
- Change. - Me too.

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,000
This is horrible. Why do survivals have to be so harsh?

78

79
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,799

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,709

(Who's the first contemporary dancer to enter?)

84
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,818
It says, "Stage Fighter."

85
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,889
"Stage Fighter."

86
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,089
- We're actually doing this. - I know.

87
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,120

93
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,309
The audition will be held in groups,

94
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,509
which are chosen by yourselves.

95
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,278
Only the final survivor will be given...

96

(They get to decide whom to go against.)

99
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,649
A, B, C, D, E, F.

100
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,959
Being number 1 among 4 dancers sounds pretty easy.

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,458
Only 1 dancer gets to be in the 1st Class.

102
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,660
So, 6 dancers will be in the 1st Class.

103
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,230
- Should I go with Seong Yun? - You're going to the Under Class.

104
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,269
The two were classmates, and they chose different groups.

105
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,100
Are they avoiding each other?

106
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:59,540
I'm going to the First Class, so I choose this group.

107
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,870
- See you in the 1st Class. - See you in the 1st Class.

108
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,638

(Gulping)

111
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,620
Hi. I'm a 25-year-old contemporary dancer, Kim Young Woong.

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,448
I started when I was 16,

113
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,589
and I've competed in contests for seven years.

114
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,919
Last year, I got a great prize...

115
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,319
in an international competition

116
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,089
So I realized that I could do it and should keep on doing it.

117
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,198
My jumps are pretty high.

118
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,758
And my legs are flexible,

119
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,170
so I do the fish pretty well by jumping up and dropping.

120
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,399
I can pull off pretty much all dance moves.

121
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm confident.

122
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,539
(Who's the other dancer that came with him?)

123
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,439
Jeong Bin and I are from Sejong University.

124
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,509
We're from the same year, so we're pretty close.

125
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,649
We both seem to think we are better than the other.

126
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,319
We argued a lot when we were in school.

127
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,959
We're always like, "You're better. I'm better."

128
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,258
When it comes to physique, I'll probably win.

129
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,230
My body is so fit that I could even be a model.

130
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,698
I won't be intimidated by anyone.

131
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,899
I'd like to compete with him while I'm here.

132
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,338
Gosh.

133
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,768
(Will the two choose the same judging group?)

134
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:07,870
Which group are you going for?

135
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,439
I'll go to Group B.

136
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,410
(He chooses one without hesitation.)

137
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,179
(Young Woong chose Group B right away.)

138
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,409
(Deliberating)

139
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,879
(Which group will Jeong Bin choose?)

140
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,220
And you?

141
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,750
You want to go together?

142
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,818
(Awkward)

143
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,849
(Grinning)

144
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,889
Should we?

145
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:25,959
I'm better.

146
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,660
I'm confident I'll beat him skill-wise.

147
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,028
(Which group will Jeong Bin choose?)

148
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,399
(Curious)

149
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,300
I'll choose Group D.

150
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:37,339
(Jeong Bin chose a different group.)

151
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,199
We should both place first.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,670
And we'll go against each other on a bigger stage.

153
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,009
I'm going to do my best, so he should also do his best.

154
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,810
I believe it'll be more fun to compete on a higher stage.

155
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,680
This is gorgeous.

156
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,350
I like it.

157
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,359
(Excited)

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,789
(Amazed)

159
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,729
Is it like a locker room for athletes?

160
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,800
(Contemporary Dance Locker Room)

161
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,328
I'll choose this one.

162
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,398
(They choose their lockers.)

163
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,600
What? Are these gifts?

164
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,699
- Yes! - This is great.

165
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:12,569
This would make the perfect practice shirt.

166
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,370
Thank you.

167
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,339
I felt a lot better.

168
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,209
(Happy)

169
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,810
Do we have to wait until all the others come?

170
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,379
- Who do you think will be here? - Will they be from our school?

171
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,819
Probably.

172
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,249
(Startled)

173
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,749
(Another dancer's profile is on the screen.)

174
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,759
(Surprised)

175
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,220
He's from K-Arts.

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,859
(Korea National University of Arts, entered in 2016)

177

(Another K-Arts graduate's profile is up.)

178
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,629
They're all from K-Arts.

179
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,959
This could get pretty tough.

180
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,628
I saw the name Korea National University of Arts...

181
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,399
and thought they'd be good.

182
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:48,638
(Who are the next contemporary dancers?)

183
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,938
I'm 26 years old.

184
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,339
I'm Kwon Yo Han, a contemporary dance major.

185
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,350
I'm Yang Seong Yun, a contemporary dancer.

186
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,980
Seong Yun and I graduated from the same school.

187
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,379
We entered Korea National University of Arts in 2016.

188
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,819
The classmates who entered in 2016 are...

189
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,790
all unique and skillful.

190
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,860
They say that we're the golden class.

191
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Is this it?

192
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,500
- You should go first. - Gosh.

193
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,669
Dong Hoon was a senior at school.

194
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,670
He was already famous before he graduated.

195
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,938
Hi, I'm a 29-year-old contemporary dancer, Go Dong Hoon.

196
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,009
I entered K-Arts in 2014.

197
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,980
I played ssireum before I started dancing.

198
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,178
Maybe it's because I fought in the ssireum ring,

199
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,749
but I like rough moves.

200
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,089
People say that my movements are like those of animals.

201
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,319
(His strength is his raw expressions and animal-like movements.)

202
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,359
I'm like a wild animal.

203
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,398
And I turned out to have great techniques.

204
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,929
Some floor techniques are the rainbow and the fish.

205
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,139
Some air techniques are the belt,

206
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:53,299
the Aoya,

207
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:54,970
and the swan.

208
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,778
There's another thing called the nuclear bomb.

209
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,710
My techniques are second to none.

210
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,409
Isn't K-Arts the best dance school there is?

211
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,119
- It is. - Yes.

212
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,919
As K-Arts graduates, we should honor our school.

213
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,320
He entered in 2014.

214
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:11,919
But we entered in 2019.

215
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,758
He's a senior.

216
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,159
But there are no seniors or juniors here.

217
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,159
The best dancer is the senior.

218
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,600
(Glaring)

219
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,940
(Opening)

220
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,840
(The senior enters.)

221
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:29,110
But there are no seniors or juniors here.

222
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,679
Hello.

223
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,408
(The juniors couldn't be more polite.)

224
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,439
(Standing)

225
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,209
I guess we put our name tags on the lockers to use them.

226
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,778
(He uncrosses his legs in front of his senior.)

227
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,590
(He doesn't know where to look.)

228
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,460
(There's only silence in the room as the seniors enter.)

229
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,460
(Peeking)

230
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,329
(Silently exchanging a look)

231
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,029
(Coughing)

232
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,658
(Wary)

233
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,000
The air is pretty cold.

234
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,038
He was a senior, so I was wondering which group he chose.

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,840
Could he have chosen the same group as me?

236
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,168
(The judging groups are revealed.)

237
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,509
(Looking up)

238
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:05,809
There it is.

239
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,750
(All 3 of them chose different groups.)

240
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,408
We had to choose the empty groups...

241
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,949
since we were the first to get here.

242
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,479
(That's true, senior.)

243
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,620
It's about time the other dancers got here.

244
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,090
(Two more dancers are choosing their groups.)

245
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,419
Which group are you choosing?

246
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,490
I think I should avoid the dancers from our school.

247
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,830
Either Group C or Group E.

248
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,399
- Group C or Group E? - Yes.

249
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,769
As far as I know, Yang Seong Yun is from K-Arts.

250
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,469
(Which group will Ryu Tae Young choose?)

251
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,339
(Contemporary Dance Locker Room)

252
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,710
(Looking)

253
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,778
- Okay. - Seong Yun, you have a competitor.

254
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,779
(Relieved)

255
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,779
Seong Yun has a competitor.

256
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,450
You're the first one to have a competitor.

257
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,720
Who could have chosen it? Let's find out.

258
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,149
You're popular.

259
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,659
But I don't want to be popular in a place like this.

260
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,159
(Gulping)

261
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:57,128

262
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,398
(Entering)

263
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,499
(Who's the dancer that chose Seong Yun's group?)

264
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,599
- Hello. - Hello.

265
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,629
(He fixes his hair as his competitor enters.)

266
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,200
(Tae Young walks in while flapping his long hair.)

267
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,940
(And another man with long hair can't take his eyes off him.)

268
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:17,580
(Seong Yun has always watched Tae Young from behind.)

269
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,178
(Shaking)

270
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,350
(Why is that?)

271
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,820
That long hair suits you so well. I should have cut mine.

272
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,690
I look like a man in the wild.

273

(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition Judging Groups)

275
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,830
- Oh, no. - Oh, this is how they show us.

276
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,600
He must have thought that I was an easy opponent.

277
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,100
I didn't feel so good about that.

278
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,970
I'm not particularly worried that he's from K-Arts.

279
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,439
Starting now, we will all have competitors.

280
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,009
You're right.

281
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,649
They're our competition. This is getting interesting.

282
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,579
I hope they come soon.

283
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,849
(Stamping his foot)

284
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,850
I'll crush them.

285
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,220
I'll choose Group A because I'm surely going to win.

286
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,989
(Kim Tae Gang chooses Group A.)

287
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,058
Group A.

(Oh Hyeok Heon chooses Group D.)

289
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,388
I'll go for Group E.

(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

292
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,258
They didn't put their names beside mine.

293
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,929
I wonder who will.

294
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,699
Let's do this together.

295
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,729
(Kwon Yo Han and Kim Tae Gang will compete in Group A.)

296
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,239
(Jung Hye Seong and Choo Seok Ho will compete in Group E.)

297
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,669
You put your name beside mine because you missed me, didn't you?

298
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,940
(As if I would.)

299
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,309
I'm suddenly getting angry.

(Judging Groups Register)

301
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,678
This is scary.

302
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,080
I want to dance with him.

303
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,549
I like the middle, so Group C.

304
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:26,350
I'll choose Group D.

(Kim Seung Wook, Ha Won Jun, Lee Jeong Hoon)

306
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,730
There's only one person in Group F.

307
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,289
As I'd thought, they didn't put their names beside mine.

308
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,759
I think everyone would avoid you.

309
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,899
Go Dong Hoon is a scarily good dancer.

310
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,269
I thought, "I shouldn't get near him."

311
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,768
"Who will go to Go Dong Hoon?"

312
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,340
I kept feeling nervous about it.

313
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,679
Who will I go against? I can't wait to find out.

314
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:55,009

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,860
He has really good muscles.

322

His muscles are compact.

323

My body shape from my shoulders and below is like "Gundam."

329
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,850
I was born very thin,

330
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,489
so I built up...

my body from scratch.

00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,939

Hyeok Jung is really cool. I'll admit that.

But if having a beautiful body was all that mattered,

351
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,470

361
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:44,120
I'm outstanding. I'm the only one.

362
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,689
I was going to join your group.

363
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,690
But I thought, "I'll fight you next time."

364
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,389
Why, are you scared already?

365
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,759
Actually, I wasn't scared at all.

366
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,570
Hyeok Jung went to Group E because he was scared of me.

367
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,870
Why?

368
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,099
All he can do is the gainer.

369
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,639
(Technique I'm confident in: Gainer)

370
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,309
I'm at a loss for words.

371
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,039
I don't know what to say.

372
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
(The two contemporary dancers check the dancers' names.)

373
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:07,879
Here?

374
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,278
(I see!)

375
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,450
He...

376
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,678
must be good. Everyone avoided him.

377
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,289
Dong Hoon. We're in the same school and are the same age.

378
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,189
Hello. I am a 29-year-old contemporary dancer,

379
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,730
Kim Hyun Ho.

380
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,830
Currently, I am a dancer in Ambiguous Dance Company.

381
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,069
My nickname is...

382
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,129
Tiger Hyun.

383
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,268
A tiger has a very strong energy.

384
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,569
When I need to show something or pull something off,

385
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,679
I turn on the switch to such energy.

386
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,048
I started off dancing with breakdance,

387
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,980
so I can do what others can't.

388
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,779
Fancy techniques...

389
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,320
and strong energy.

390
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,889
I'm most confident in the windmill, a breakdance technique.

391
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,859
I don't know how many carnivores are on the show,

392
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,200
but they'll be good prey for me.

393
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,759
- Goodness. - It's Hyun Ho.

394
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,629
"Windmill?" No way.

395
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:03,870
He's finally here.

396
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,340
Windmill. It's so different.

397
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,008
Hyun Ho's technique makes him roll on the floor,

398
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,409
and I mostly jump and roll midair.

399
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,549
We're complete opposites.

400
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,009
So I thought it might be better to avoid him.

401
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,879
Let's see.

402
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,220
- Please don't join Group C. - My goodness.

403
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,750
What?

404
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,059
(Very shocked)

405
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,788
(Revealing Tiger Hyun's judging group!)

406
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:30,189
(Group F: Go Dong Hoon, Lee Jin Woo, Kim Hyun Ho)

407
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,929
Both of them? Suddenly?

408
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,700
Suddenly?

409
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,229
Group F will be fun to watch.

410
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,399
My group suddenly became strong.

411
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:38,799
Why did both of them join?

412
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,809
Because they thought it'd be easy.

413
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,509
(Laughing)

414
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,809
- Hey, be quiet. Don't fool around. - What?

415
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:48,979
What did I say?

416
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,179
He makes me stand up from my seat.

417
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,750
You won't have a second chance.

418
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,320
When you go against me, you'll be nothing but a squid.

419
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:58,189
(He is not affected at all.)

420
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,258
Seriously...

421
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,259
(The deer versus wild boar match, to be continued)

422
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,229
- Welcome. - Hello.

423
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,230
Hello.

424
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,258
(Welcome!)

425
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,068
(Tiger Hyun enters.)

426
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,829
Hyun Ho, will you be fine going against me?

427
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,568
(STF OST, the fight theme, "Dangerous")

428
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,798
(Yes.)

429
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,809
I thought it'd be nice for those born in 1995 to be grouped together.

430
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,210
- Get nervous. - Okay.

431
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,980
I think I'll beat everyone easily.

432
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,950
He said he wanted to enjoy dancing with others born in 1995.

433
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,849
But this is a competition. He can't enjoy it.

434
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,990
Who is next?

435
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,720
When are you coming? Hurry up.

436
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,529
Who is it?

437
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,729
(Determined princess, Brown eyes, Aiming for 1st place only)

438
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,500
Jin Ho is here.

439
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,828
(Surprised)

440
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:43,229
We have two international competition winners so far.

441
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,068
The guy sitting all the way in front.

442
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,299
(Yun Hyeok Jung won a silver medal in an international competition.)

443
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,910
He is a princess.

444
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,609
"Determined Princess."

445
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,108
(Loud footsteps suddenly echo in the locker room.)

446
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,480
(Stomping)

447
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,149
(What is this?)

448
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,419
(What is this?)

449
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,480
Is the sound coming from upstairs?

450
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,190
Is he walking barefoot?

451
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,420
(Impressed)

452
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,318
(The princess looks around carefully.)

453
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,519
Should I remove my shoes?

454
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,359
(Removing his shoes to enter a practice room)

455
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,798
(He is the first dancer to remove his shoes and enter.)

456
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,569
(Neat)

457
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,470
(Stomping)

458
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,309
(He stomps barefoot.)

459
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,268
(A rather fierce-looking Princess Jin Ho arrives.)

460
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,740
I am Park Jin Ho, a 26-year-old contemporary dancer.

461
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,308
When I prepare for my performance,

462
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,519
I keep changing my makeup and take a very long time to do so.

463
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,479
Some girls saw it...

464
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,819
and called me princess.

465
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,390
Is the makeup going to be heavy?

466
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:37,858
Do you not like heavy makeup?

467
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:38,859
I like it.

468
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,788
(Princess Jin Ho checks his face!)

469
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:43,528
It's important to be an eye-catching dancer.

470
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,200
I am very mindful of my appearance, including my physique.

471
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,068
My rival?

472
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,500
(Who is Determined Princess' rival?)

473
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,099
Yun Hyeok Jung.

474
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,670
I'm a bit concerned about him.

475
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,568
We're too similar.

476
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,980
("My current rival is Yun Hyeok Jung. We are similar in many ways.")

477
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,679
I often heard our body shapes...

478
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,049
and movements were similar.

479
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,278
I like emphasizing my body shape,

480
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,220
and so does Jin Ho.

481
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,518
Hyeok Jung uses his legs well.

482
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,859
Kicking with his legs and so on.

483
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:16,389
I'm also confident in kicks and turning leaps, the techniques...

484
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,559
that use my legs.

485
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,400
So I consider him my rival.

486
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,298
They didn't show which group he chose.

487
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,299
They didn't.

488
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,099
(Which group did Park Jin Ho choose?)

489
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:25,470
I wonder which group you chose.

490
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,539
(A meaningful smile)

491
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,008
(Group E: Yun Hyeok Jung, Park Jin Ho)

492
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,409
(Park Jin Ho chose Group E which has Yun Hyeok Jung.)

493
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,439
That's a fun group.

494
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,180
(It will be a big match.)

495
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,979
- Let's compete. - Yes.

496
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,319
You joined that group? You made a mistake.

497
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,079
This group looked easy.

498
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,549
(Sucking in his breath)

499
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,848
You'll regret it.

500
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,220
(Excited)

501
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,088
(Meanwhile, he is humming while checking his competitors...)

502
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,089
(in front of the Judging Groups Register.)

503
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,390
(A very relaxed dancer)

504
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,829
Two in Group A, two in Group B.

505
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,529
Out of the names on the wall,

506
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,369
there was no name that I felt competitive against.

507
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,970
I'm not scared at all.

508
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,338
(Contemporary dance's Premier League, From Ultima Vez)

509
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,440
Chang Min is here.

510
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,609
He's finally here.

511
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,079
"Ultima Vez."

512
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,180
"Ultima Vez." He won.

513
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,649
Dancer Lee Chang Min. We were classmates.

514
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,919
Dancer Lee Chang Min...

515
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,419
- Lee Chang Min... - Dancer Lee Chang Min.

516
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,690
He is so good.

517
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,729
Ultima Vez is a dance company in Belgium.

518
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,529
It's one of the top three biggest dance companies.

519
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,629
He went to Europe,

520
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,999
did an audition when he had nothing,

521
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,368
and joined Ultima Vez.

522
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,640
I think he is the best contemporary dancer.

523
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,209
Hello. I am Lee Chang Min,

524
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,639
a 27-year-old contemporary dancer.

525
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,779
Nice to meet you.

526
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,279
My dance could remind you of an animal.

527
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,750
I challenge the limits of my body.

528
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,019
I roll, fall, and collide nonstop.

529
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,389
I could divide the techniques into three.

530
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,390
Rolling on the floor,

531
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,930
jumping,

532
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,089
and turning.

533
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,329
I think I'm good at them all.

534
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,529
Which group will he choose?

535
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,929
I wonder which group he'll join.

536
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,470
- Me too. I can't wait to find out. - Yes.

537
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,200
This is scary.

538
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,769
Group A? It's either you or me.

539
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,368
I think I'll get eliminated.

540
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,538
I hope he doesn't join Group C.

541
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,339
I'll give up on becoming First Class if he joins mine.

542
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,649
You should bite him with all you have.

543
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,479
I felt a bit of rivalry against Chang Min.

544
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,018
Chang Min dances like a beast too.

545
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:21,819
I think he might look a bit similar to me.

546
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,288
Contemporary dancers prefer...

547
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,720
animal-like movements.

548
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,189
Contemporary dancers are beasts.

549
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,029
We like animalistic movements.

550
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,399
We're wild animals.

551
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,068
He is like a deer with a fit body.

552
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,269
A Dobermann onstage.

553
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,769
Tiger Hyun.

554
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,170
(Welcome to the Contemporary Zoo with various animals!)

555
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,469
(He will make everyone in the zoo tremble in fear.)

556
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,209
The lion is here.

557
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,210
(The strongest lion arrives.)

558
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,410
(The lion enters.)

559
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,249
To me, they looked like they were looking at a lion...

560
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,249
that appeared in the jungle,

561
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,420
instead of looking at a competitor.

562
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,789
(The locker room becomes silent at the arrival of the lion.)

563
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,318
(Which group did Dancer Lee Chang Min choose?)

564
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,460
I think Chang Min will be superior.

565
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,390
I don't want to go against Lee Chang Min.

566
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,299
- Chang Min. - He chose the group in the middle.

567
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,268
Darn it, why did he join my group?

568
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,338
(Yo Han is relieved.)

569
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,009
There are Groups B and D, so why...

570
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,680
Me? I'm more comfortable with Seong Yun than Yo Han.

571
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,180
(One is happy, and one is sad.)

572
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,778
I wanted to avoid competing with him.

573
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,750
On the other hand, I was confident because I knew what he could do.

574
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,219
The first place still hasn't arrived.

575
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,750
I think he'll arrive last.

576
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,559
The physical check ranking.

577
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,989
I got 19, a joint 2nd place.

578
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,329
Someone must've gotten a perfect score.

579
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,788
When a dancer stands on the stage,

580
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,460
their body is the most obvious thing the audience can see.

581
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,599
We use our bodies to dance,

582
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,669
so we need to keep ourselves fit...

583
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,400
to dance with high quality.

584
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,139
When you have a good physique,

585
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
your dance stands out more.

586
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,910
I think it's a very important aspect in contemporary dancing.

587
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:01,720
(Where did the contemporary dancers visit?)

588
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,450
(A physical care center for Stage Fighter's dangers)

589
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,559
(From a simple physical check-up...)

590
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,288
(to body composition analysis)

591
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,629
We will evaluate your movements with four exercises.

592
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,798
They are movements to test the physical abilities...

593
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,059
that are necessary for dancers.

594
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,528
(Shaking)

595
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,828
(They are not easy for dancers either.)

596
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,939
(Mobility check)

597
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,970
- Pull. Okay. - I'm embarrassed.

598
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,609
I really want to score a five.

599
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,308
It was a bit lacking for 5, so I'll give you 4.

600
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,410
Okay.

601
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,950
- I'll give you a three. - Okay.

602
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,910
Did anyone score a five?

603
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,379
Five for push-ups.

604
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
(I did it.)

605
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:34,789
- Five. - Thank you.

606
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,089
He's here.

607
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,519
- He scored a 19. - He still scored a 19.

608
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,230
(Feeling a sense of rivalry)

609
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:44,930
- He is 185cm. - He's tall.

610
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,559
He is as tall as a model.

611
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,399
He is 23cm taller than me.

612
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,670
(No way.)

613
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,499
He must be the tallest.

614
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,170
Seong Yun, you're 185cm.

615
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,769
Four, not five.

616
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,038
(He misses being the tallest because of just 1cm.)

617
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,838
(Opening wide)

618
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,078
(The arrival of two men makes the locker room's atmosphere tense.)

619
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,440
- Hello. - Hello.

620
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,909
(Why are the dancers surprised as soon as they enter?)

621
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,420
(Surprised)

622
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,949
(The two dancers are wearing revealing clothes.)

623
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,519
Why are you guys practically naked?

624
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,759
You should've worn something inside.

625
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,690
Today, I felt my shoulder muscles were pumped up better than usual,

626
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,859
and so were my abs.

627
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:21,699
I was confident of these parts ever since I started dancing.

628
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,298
You have nice hips.

629
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,429
(Two hands wrapped around it stably)

630
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,440
Can you see how pretty they are just from looking?

631
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,008
They're as hard as a rock, so they are rocks.

632
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,009
(Rocks)

633
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,180
I have a straight upper body and long arms.

634
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:35,579
I think I'm quite tall,

635
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,579
which gives me an advantage.

636
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,119
(Two dancers with strong physiques)

637
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
Oh, dear.

638
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
(He omits the rest.)

639
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:43,920
They have fierce bodies.

640
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,460
They show our physical check rankings?

641
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,788
- What was my rank? - Second place.

642
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:47,819
Really?

643
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:49,429
(Three physical check silver medalists)

644
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,690
(Tiger Hyun, Rock Hips June Hyuk, Contemporary Lion Lee Chang Min)

645
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,529
I want to see who got the full score.

646
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,900
I wonder who won first place.

647
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,368
I want to see him.

648
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,130
He must be scary.

649
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,500
(The arrival of the physical check 1st place)

650
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Gosh, 20 points.

651
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,739
- He is in 1st place. - He is in 1st place.

652
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,008
(Murmuring)

653
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,009
Hye Hyun.

654
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,579
Even in the picture, he has wide shoulders.

655
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,519
First place in the physical check is very impressive.

656
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:14,920
Twenty points.

657
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,518
He has an outstanding physique.

658
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,660
(Feeling a sense of rivalry)

659
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,789
First, squats, five points.

660
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,630
Second, push-ups, five points.

661
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,559
Bird dog, rotational stability, five points.

662
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,328
And balance, five points.

663
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,699
You scored 20 out of 20.

664
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,999
(Kim Hye Hyun scored 20 out of 20, placing 1st in the physical test.)

665
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,700
- You're in the top one percent. - Really?

666
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,539
You have a very amazing...

667
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,170
Thank you.

668
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,608
Hello. I am Kim Hye Hyun,

669
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:40,339
a 22-year-old contemporary dancer.

670
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:44,578
When I was young, I lived in Africa for seven years.

671
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:47,819
I think I exercised more than I studied then.

672
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,990
As a dancer, I am confident...

673
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,660
in my physique.

674
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,489
I am springy and flexible.

675
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,929
So I use a lot of movements...

676
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,700
that require difficult physical techniques.

677
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,900
Jump techniques and floor techniques.

678
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,400
I can do almost everything.

679
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,910
I felt that Dancer Kim Hye Hyun was my rival.

680
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,470
"He's got something."

681
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,809
He reminds me of a kangaroo.

682
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,309
A kangaroo looks very cute too.

683
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:20,149
But when a kangaroo decides to move,

684
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,250
it becomes very fierce.

685
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,220
I was going to jump the Aoya, but I changed my mind.

686
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,089
You're still tall. You should beat him with that.

687
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,529
He's handsome.

688
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,430
He is.

689
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,399
(He is.)

690
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
(Turning around)

691
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,670
(What did you say, my friend?)

692
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,140
- Hello. - Hello.

693
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,140
(Keeping him in check)

694
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,209
(Eyes fixed on him)

695
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,409
- I wonder which he chose. - What?

696
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,440
The judging group.

697
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,410
Either Group A or B.

698
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,778
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun's physical test ranking...

699
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,049
It won't be easy.

700
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,289
He has a very good physique.

701
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,250
I wanted to avoid being in the same group.

702
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:00,919
(Which judging group did Kim Hye Hyun...)

703
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,329
(with good physique and techniques choose?)

704
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,588
(Group A: Kim Eun Hyuk, Kim Hye Hyun)

705
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,058
Group A.

706
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,229
(Kim Hye Hyun chose Group A with Kwon Yo Han.)

707
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,829
Can you beat him in terms of physique?

708
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,470
No, I can't.

709
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:12,400
(Sobbing)

710
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,710
I'll be at an advantage in terms of technique.

711
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,239
He won't be an easy opponent.

712
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
(Worried)

713
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,380
I wonder who the last dancer is.

714
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,049
It must be someone we all know.

715
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,619
(Ta-da)

716
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,588
Who is it?

717
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:29,690
- Who is it? - I Ban?

718
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:31,249
(Who is he?)

719
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,258
(A fighter, A fusion dancer, I am always the lead dancer)

720
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,319
"Street Woman Fighter?"

721
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,490
He was on Season One of "Street Woman Fighter?"

722
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:40,329
During CocaNButter's mixed gender mission...

723
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,769
(I remember.)

724
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,338
(He first appeared...)

725
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,140
(with "Street Woman Fighter" crew's cheers!)

726
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,338
I did the Man of Woman mission...

727
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,269
with CocaNButter.

728
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:53,839
I am Dancer I Ban.

729
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,348
I don't do pure dancing,

730
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:00,079
but I mix contemporary dance and street dance harmoniously.

731
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,089
I don't want to be defined as a contemporary dancer.

732
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,190
Nor do I want to be defined as a pure dancer.

733
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,630
I am just I Ban.

734
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,758
I joined the show...

735
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,160
to be acknowledged as who I am.

736
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,630
He didn't major in contemporary dance.

737
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,099
Will he be fine?

738
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,369
I didn't expect him to not have majored in it.

739
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,739
He has a lot of weapons,

740
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,969
but he has no technique he is confident in.

741
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,079
(Technique I'm confident in: None)

742
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,079
He'll have a hard time with the technique mission.

743
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,979
If he came here without any technique,

744
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,450
is he a really good dancer?

745
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,189
I think he thought it would be easy...

746
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,220
because he was on "Street Woman Fighter."

747
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,489
That's what I think. A non-major...

748
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,690
(A non-major...)

749
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:43,659
(The final contemporary dancer arrives.)

750
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,759
- Hello. - Hello.

751
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,000
- Hello, nice to meet you. - Hello.

752
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:50,129
(Glancing)

753
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,739
(Scanning)

754
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,869
(Glancing)

755
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,339
I thought they considered me as an outsider.

756
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,409
Honestly, I don't even think...

757
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,980
they felt a sense of rivalry against me.

758
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,809
It really felt like, "Who is he?"

759
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:09,650
I Ban, you wrote "None" for the technique you were confident in.

760
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,890
Yes. I've never done any technique before.

761
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,059
Really?

762
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:18,859
But you wrote for your advantage that you had a lot of weapons.

763
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:20,859
(Confused)

764
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,970
Did you mean ammunition?

765
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,669
(Flustered)

766
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,299
I do have guns and knives.

767
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,999
(Smacking his lips)

768
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,769
I felt like they were looking down on me.

769
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,140
I thought, "Has it started?"

770
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,308
(Group F: Go Dong Hoon, I Ban)

771
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,008
(Contemporary Dance Group F is completed with I Ban.)

772
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,180
I can't imagine what I Ban will be like.

773
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,289
He is like a Pandora's box.

774
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,559
He did say he didn't have any technique.

775
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:51,359
But other skills that he has... He is a variable.

776
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,999
I Ban. I have no information about him.

777
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,400
I don't know how he dances.

778
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,240
Only 1 person can become 1st Class, right?

779
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:00,869
It's finally complete.

780
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,139
(Stage Fighter's 24 contemporary dancers have all gathered.)

781
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,739
(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition Judging Groups)

782
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,939
Only 1 person can become 1st Class, right?

783
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,140
One from each group.

784
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,608
Then it's one of you guys.

785
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:09,650
I'll take it.

786
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,680
You can't.

787
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,519
Become Under.

788
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:16,088
Was it Group E? There was one impossible group.

789
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,889
- I pick Group E. - Group E.

790
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,618
Two of them won in international competitions.

791
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,730
Yun Hyeok Jung is good, and so is Jin Ho.

792
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,460
It will be really intense.

793
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,660
It would've been bad if I had gone there.

794
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,929
(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition will start soon.)

795
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,099
(Gather at the dance studio on the 2nd basement floor.)

796
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,099
Everyone had a great physique.

797
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,169
(Removing the top)

798
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,368
(Muscular)

799
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,879
(The contemporary dancers are preparing for the audition.)

800
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,579
Real men. Beasts.

801
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:43,309
They all seemed to have great physiques.

802
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,880
- Their bodies are lively. - They were no joke.

803
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,819
They all had good physiques.

804
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,650
I looked at them while exclaiming.

805
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,358
Is being tan a trend in Hanyang University nowadays?

806
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,359
It's summer.

807
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,160
- It's summer. - Yes.

808
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,058
I hope it is a physical test...

809
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:00,029
- so it won't be so stressful. - Exactly.

810
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,470
"Physical and Technique Audition?" What is it?

811
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,629
It sounds like you need to be strong and muscular.

812
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,170
Stamina test? Are we doing physical tests?

813
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,410
I cannot imagine what mission it'll be.

814
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:15,508
(STF Dance Company)

815
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:17,949
(The 24 contemporary dancers have gathered for the audition.)

816
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,180
(At that time)

817
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,779
This is insane.

818
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,150
What a man.

819
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,690
- Look at his body. - He is so muscular.

820
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,088
(Contemporary Dance Coach Seong Chang Yong...)

821
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:29,130
(arrives with charisma.)

822
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,429
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

823
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,259
Seong Chang Yong is at the top of the top.

824
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,759
I was astonished.

825
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,469
I really love him as a dancer.

826
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,299
He is the master of techniques.

827
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,768
(Another contemporary dance coach enters after him.)

828
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:43,970
I was dazed.

829
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,079
I saw the light shine behind her.

830
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,078
(The heroine who took over "Dancing 9...")

831
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,549
(with her natural-born talent and dance)

832
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,920
- She is the absolute best. - I aspire to be like her.

833
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,989
I am her big fan,

834
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,490
so it felt like I was looking at a celebrity.

835
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,818
(Cheering and clapping)

836
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,190
(Master Kim Joo Won appears with an extraordinary aura about her.)

837
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:04,890
(Unbelievable)

838
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,230
This is amazing.

839
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,329
(Elegant presence)

840
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,539
(Won Best Female Dancer at Prix Benois de la Danse)

841
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,440
I love ballet, so I felt honored.

842
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,739
(Nice to meet you.)

843
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,209
She holds a high position.

844
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,779
I felt overwhelmed.

845
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,818
He looks extremely charismatic.

846
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,490
He looked like a strict teacher.

847
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:33,858
(He was a senior rehearsal director of the Rambert Dance Company.)

848
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,889
(Stage Fighter's rehearsal director who adds details to the dance)

849
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,960
He looks very charismatic.

850
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,130
He has an extraordinary aura.

851
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,299
Anyone would expect them to be here.

852
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,269
They were like people from a big agency.

853
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,940
They're famous people in the dance scene,

854
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,769
so I feel even more nervous.

855
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,338
During the Physical and Technique Audition,

856
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,009
they'll be judged on their physique and basic techniques.

857
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,049
We'll also evaluate them on flexibility, balance,

858
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:03,519
and expression of contemporary dance.

859
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,659
For the Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition,

860
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,359
the technique combination for each round will be revealed.

861
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,859
We don't know which techniques will be given.

862
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,299
What if it's something that I can't do?

863
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,299
I was hoping that it'd mainly involve floor technique.

864
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,899
Techniques that most people can't do easily.

865
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,809
I hoped for the nuclear bomb or side roll.

866
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,679
(Round 1, Technique combination is on.)

867
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,109
Five, four...

868
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
(Concentrating)

869
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:31,548
- It's probably difficult. - Two,

870
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,118
one. Go.

871
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,720
Shouldn't we get closer and look?

872
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:37,149
I wanted to get closer...

873
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,059
and watch the details of the movement.

874
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,529
Contraction and double contraction.

875
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,900
It was the basic Martha Graham technique.

876
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:50,900
I didn't expect to do the Martha Graham technique here.

877
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,970
Side tilt.

878
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,769
It requires a particular physique,

879
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,339
so it could be unfavorable to me.

880
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,009
(Front kick jump: A jump while stretching one leg to the front)

881
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,250
I'm not sure if I can do that.

882
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:06,650
I've never done such a technique. I'm in big trouble.

883
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,690
I jump higher than most, and I stay in the air for a long time.

884
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:11,920
I feel confident.

885
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,419
Next is an illusion turn.

886
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,789
(Stepping with one foot and kicking the other in the air to turn)

887
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,360
Oh, okay.

888
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,829
The technique that I'm most confident in is illusion turn.

889
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,400
I should show them.

890
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,299
I'm not familiar with the illusion turn.

891
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,138
The combination isn't so difficult,

892
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,639
so I can do it well as long as I prepare myself.

893
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:33,239
Most people can do the rainbow.

894
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,209
(I got this.)

895
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,079
I'm good at the illusion turn and the rainbow.

896
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,320
They were back-to-back.

897
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,750
It made me feel more confident.

898
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,250
Gosh, side flip.

899
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,960
(Two dancers who can do side flips without touching the ground)

900
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,759
It's a side flip without touching the ground.

901
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,900
I've done it a lot, so I felt confident.

902
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,368
I felt most confident about that technique.

903
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:58,400
I should show off my strength.

904
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,369
(Round 1 demonstration video is over.)

905
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:02,969
(Expecting trouble)

906
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,469
It looks intense.

907
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,739
It was about having a strong foundation.

908
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,750
They wanted to see if we had muscles that a dancer needs.

909
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,879
It's easy yet difficult because they're basic movements.

910
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,449
I felt confident yet worried.

911
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,449
I was very shocked.

912
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,260
I have never done most of the movements.

913
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:25,559
I wasn't sure how I would do the combination.

914
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:29,530
For Round Two, it is the Modified Technique Combination.

915
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:30,929
"Modified technique?"

916
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,670
We have to choreograph the middle.

917
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,469
Maintain the first...

918
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,209
and the last moves.

919
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,539
But choreograph the middle with techniques that you're good at.

920
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,679
For the modified technique, I should do what I'm good at.

921
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:46,820
How will I modify the combination?

922
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,749
I'll have to be strategic during the competition.

923
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,320
Round 3 is the 1-on-1 Improvised Technique.

924
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,289
- "Improvised?" - That sounds fun.

925
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,928
First, you'll improvise individually.

926
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:03,029
Then two dancers will improvise at the same time.

927
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,428
After that, the result will be announced.

928
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,599
(The 2 dancers' final classes will be revealed.)

929
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,339
If I make B-boy moves that others can't do,

930
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,539
my strength will be able to stand out.

931
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,078
Compared to when I follow combinations,

932
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,909
I use more varied techniques.

933
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,579
This is better for me.

934
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,780
Having good reflexes is key in improvisation.

935
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,150
I'm confident.

936
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,659
Which of you will join the First Class?

937
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,530
Which of you will join the Under Class?

938
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:33,130
The Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition...

939
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:34,659
will begin now.

940
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,969
I have to make it to First Class no matter what.

941
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,099
- I won't join the Under Class. - Definitely First Class.

942
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:42,670
I'll risk my life to win.

943
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,539
(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

944
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,138
Here is Group B.

945
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,908
(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition, Group B)

946
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:50,909
Kim Young Woong.

947
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,519
Kim Seung Wook.

948
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,250
Kim Jae Jin.

949
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,989
Kim Do Hyun.

950
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,049
(Brushing lightly)

951
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,819
(Kim Young Woong, Kim Jae Jin, Kim Do Hyun, Kim Seung Wook)

952
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,119
Kim Jae Jin has a really nice body.

953
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,659
In ballet, you get graded on your physique.

954
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:06,929
Yes, physical attributes do count.

955
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,999
Proportions need to be ranked.

956
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
In Group B, Kim Jae Jin has the nicest body.

957
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,900
Jae Jin seems quite handsome.

958
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:17,439
Right?

959
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,238
Jae Jin has nice looks and a good physique.

960
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,239
(Smiling)

961
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,909
Hello, I'm a 26-year-old Contemporary Dancer Kim Jae Jin.

962
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,750
I look quite good.

963
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,320
People have told me that I look like a prince.

964
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:32,189
I have long arms and legs.

965
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,719
I'm confident about my physique.

966
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:37,090
(While entering the Contemporary Dance Locker Room)

967
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,299
(Technique I'm confident in: Cartwheel)

968
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,929
Technique he's confident in is the cartwheel. That's it.

969
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,800
The cartwheel technique?

970
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,530
- But that's... - I can understand.

971
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
I can do it with one hand.

972
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,940
Cartwheel is a technique for beginners.

973
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,869
It's very basic.

974
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,239
It's one of the basic techniques in dance.

975
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,009
Don't you learn it as a beginner dancer?

976
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,179
Director, you could probably do it right now.

977
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,349
(I'm serious.)

978
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,519
I have no technique that I'm confident in.

979
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,119
I don't have strong techniques. I'm doomed.

980
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:05,989
Why does Round One involve technique?

981
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:07,589
(Stage 3 of emotions: Resigning)

982
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,690
(Sighing)

983
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,130
(During Physical and Technique Audition practice)

984
00:38:10,131 --> 00:38:11,460
(Glancing)

985
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,900
During practice, I couldn't stop looking at Kim Young Woong.

986
00:38:16,269 --> 00:38:17,968
Kim Young Woong is...

987
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:21,169
well-known as an amazing dancer.

988
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,510
The Sejong University ace has appeared.

989
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:27,038
He won first place at a competition last year.

990
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,949
In my group, I am wary of Young Woong the most.

991
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,980
I'm not wary of anyone.

992
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,549
The Martha Graham technique is...

993
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,719
one of the basic techniques in contemporary dance.

994
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,489
I can do most dance techniques.

995
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,630
I'm sure that I'll do well.

996
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,129
I've practiced the jump and the illusion turn...

997
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,030
for many years, so I feel confident.

998
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,699
(Look at him.)

999
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,198
I practiced every movement repeatedly...

1000
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,038
until I got it perfect.

1001
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,969
I focused and got myself immersed in it endlessly.

1002
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,969
I'll definitely make it to First Class.

1003
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,709
Watch me objectively.

1004
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,448
(How tough men talk)

1005
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:03,449
I'll watch you too.

1006
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,079
Can you tell me what you think?

1007
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,249
You look strong and perfect.

1008
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,250
Do I look powerful?

1009
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:10,288
(Do I look powerful?)

1010
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:11,289
(He's happy to hear it.)

1011
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,119
(Fully charging his strength and energy)

1012
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,629
For Round One, we should pick the best one...

1013
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,428
- to follow Chang Yong's combo. - Right.

1014
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:20,800
We should focus on their foundation.

1015
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:25,070
Round One, technique combination, will start.

1016
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:26,940
It's starting.

1017
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,969
I can't wait to see them.

1018
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,440
I'll do exactly what I practiced.

1019
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,839
I have a strong enough foundation.

1020
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,280
I want to survive Round One, at least.

1021
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,078
(Who will be the First Class dancer from Group B?)

1022
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,319
(Concentrating)

1023
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,619
(Group B's Round 1 starts.)

1024
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,920
I was confident about my body lines.

1025
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,730
- Gosh. - He has lovely body lines.

1026
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,389
He's flexible.

1027
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,800
Jae Jin has an outstanding physique.

1028
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,429
He has beautiful body lines.

1029
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,769
I'm confident about my jumps.

1030
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,138
(Swift)

1031
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,269
Nice jump.

1032
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,368
- Gosh. - Young Woong jumps well.

1033
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:04,039
I think my jump was good, as always.

1034
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:07,279
(Illusion turn)

1035
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,839
His illusion turn looks stable.

1036
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,150
Goodness, he's so good.

1037
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,649
It could be risky.

1038
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,049
I should show them how good I am.

1039
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,449
- The rainbow. - Nice.

1040
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:20,289
The only technique I'm confident in is the cartwheel.

1041
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,289
Even if I can't do a side flip, I should do a proper cartwheel.

1042
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:26,828
- Cartwheel. - He still looks good.

1043
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,329
Two, one.

1044
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,800
Stop.

1045
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,840
(Group B's Physical and Technique Audition is over.)

1046
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,170
Jae Jin did a good job.

1047
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,369
I did my best.

1048
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,139
Young Woong is good.

1049
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,509
I was confident about the entire combination,

1050
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,949
so I think I performed well.

1051
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,218
For the Physical and Technique Audition,

1052
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:48,420
I will announce the dancer that got cut out...

1053
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,420
and will join...

1054
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:52,420
the Under Class.

1055
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,689
(Standing)

1056
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,690
(Which dancer will join the Under Class from Group B?)

1057
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:56,929
- What? - Gosh.

1058
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,530
(Matthew is scanning the dancers in Group B.)

1059
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:02,929
- Is he coming down to announce it? - What?

1060
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,670
He's coming down to put the tag on.

1061
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,539
This is so cruel.

1062
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,710
The dancer in Under Class is...

1063
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,638
Gosh, he's moving.

1064
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,679
(Glancing)

1065
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,908
Unfortunately, you've been ranked Under.

1066
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,448
- It's Kim Seung Wook. - Please leave the floor.

1067
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:20,579
(No way.)

1068
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,889
It felt like being graded in a breeding farm.

1069
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,919
He had no idea...

1070
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,388
about the hand direction during the contraction.

1071
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,888
In all movements,

1072
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,229
his legs weren't straight.

1073
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,969
They were always bent.

1074
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
(Dancer Kim Seung Wook is sent to Under Class.)

1075
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,000
We'll move on to Round Two.

1076
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:46,578
His elasticity is nice. His body lines are very clean.

1077
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:48,610
He has a very strong foundation.

1078
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,109
I like Kim Young Woong.

1079
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,880
His long limbs make his moves nice to look at.

1080
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,579
He uses the space very well.

1081
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,718
(Unfortunately, Kim Do Hyun makes a mistake.)

1082
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,788
(Oh, no.)

1083
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:00,289
Did he just make a mistake?

1084
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,960
(Dancer Kim Do Hyun is sent to Second Class.)

1085
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,589
(Jae Jin and Young Woong get ready...)

1086
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,729
(for the 1-on-1 Improvised Technique.)

1087
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,800
It's 1-on-1 next.

1088
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,328
One by one and together.

1089
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,529
(After dancing individually, they improvise together.)

1090
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,399
- It's completely freestyle. - Improvisation.

1091
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,069
- They can show their strengths. - Exactly.

1092
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,400
(A war of nerves right before the last battle)

1093
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:15,940
The odds are in my favor.

1094
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,738
My technique may be weaker,

1095
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,210
but I'm confident about improvisation.

1096
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,649
I feel confident about showing...

1097
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,848
my dance.

1098
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:26,949
Won't they be ranked 1st and 2nd after this round?

1099
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,780
Now that I got this far, I should make it to First.

1100
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:32,050
I've been expecting myself to join the First Class.

1101
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,789
Round Three will begin.

1102
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,989
Music for Round Three, start.

1103
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,459
(Group B's Kim Young Woong goes first.)

1104
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,399
- Five, four, three, - I'll do my best.

1105
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,029
two, one.

1106
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,229
- Young Woong looks determined. - Go.

1107
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,269
(The look in his eyes changes.)

1108
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:48,739
A body roll.

1109
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,409
- Yes. - Let's show them my balance.

1110
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:52,940
(All eyes are on him.)

1111
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,539
He has control.

1112
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,710
He has quality.

1113
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,849
I was confident about my flexibility and strength.

1114
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,348
Gosh, kick.

1115
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:04,848
He's very strong and flexible.

1116
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,090
I'm probably the only one who knows this technique.

1117
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,260
(That's insane.)

1118
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,129
- It's surprising. - Because... Exactly.

1119
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,488
He has control over his body. Beautiful.

1120
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,860
He's so flexible.

1121
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,759
He was very good.

1122
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,369
He showed many surprising aspects.

1123
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,569
Five, four, three,

1124
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,769
- He looks like a tough idol singer. - two, one.

1125
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,440
- Go. - Amazing.

1126
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,880
That was perfect.

1127
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
I was happy with it.

1128
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,448
You should do your best too.

1129
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:32,079
Bring it on with your strongest weapon.

1130
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,419
I also have my weapon.

1131
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,518
My technique may not be as strong as Young Woong's, but...

1132
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:38,849
The style of a prince.

1133
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm quite flexible too.

1134
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,030
He's flexible.

1135
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,029
He was more flexible than I thought.

1136
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,928
Balance.

1137
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:51,098
What I like about him is his eyes.

1138
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,500
The look on his face.

1139
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,440
I believe that dance is about having confidence.

1140
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:57,510
- My gosh. - What?

1141
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,909
He knows how to use his face. My gosh.

1142
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:03,078
(Kim Jae Jin improvises in his own style.)

1143
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,309
- Two... - He has a talent.

1144
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:07,518
Two, one. Stop.

1145
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,389
He looks like a K-drama actor.

1146
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:12,219
- He knows the face and the angles. - Yes.

1147
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:15,558
He showed a side that was different from mine,

1148
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:17,090
so I was worried.

1149
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,730
I didn't think such a battle was possible.

1150
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,900
Now, they'll dance at the same time.

1151
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,570
(Observing)

1152
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,739
In terms of technique, I won't lose.

1153
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:29,039
What should I do to survive?

1154
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:32,669
(Round 3, 1-on-1 Improvised Technique)

1155
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,739
Go.

1156
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,949
- Rond de jambe. - Balance.

1157
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,150
Nice.

1158
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,420
I'm good at using my right leg.

1159
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,650
Back kick.

1160
00:44:41,651 --> 00:44:42,679
It was clean.

1161
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,550
He was strong and good at making quick movements.

1162
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,090
I should dance calmly instead.

1163
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,459
- He's flexible. - Yes.

1164
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,729
(His eyes widen.)

1165
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,329
Jumps are my lethal move.

1166
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,570
In that case, I should stay low on the floor.

1167
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,309
Side stretching.

1168
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,768
I kept dancing in the back.

1169
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,038
Go for it.

1170
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,209
I wanted to pierce them with strong energy.

1171
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,449
You must go for it. That's it. Yes.

1172
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,280
(In love with his technique)

1173
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:16,689
Three, two...

1174
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,249
- I can't choose. - Three,

1175
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,988
- Oh, my gosh. - two, one. Stop.

1176
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,030
(Group B's Physical and Technique Audition Round 3 is over.)

1177
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:29,130
(A competition between midair and floor with no yield)

1178
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,869
Round Three is fun.

1179
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:32,530
Both of them did a terrific job.

1180
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,868
Their dancing styles are different, but both of them are charming.

1181
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,670
It was like a fight between black and white.

1182
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:42,209
I liked Kim Jae Jin's improvisation.

1183
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,009
- Wasn't there a twist? - Yes, there was a twist.

1184
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,780
He knows how to direct himself.

1185
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,678
He had a very clear focus.

1186
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,218
Young Woong is amazing and powerful,

1187
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,420
but his focus was unclear.

1188
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:56,488
In terms of technique and foundation,

1189
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,360
- Young Woong was much better. - I agree.

1190
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:02,428
I showed every technique that I had.

1191
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,369
It was something that only I could do.

1192
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,670
I believe that dance is about having confidence.

1193
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:10,139
I showed my sense of confidence,

1194
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:12,070
so the odds could be in my favor.

1195
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,839
One of you will be in First Class.

1196
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,809
And one of you will be in Second Class.

1197
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,049
I'm nervous. Who will it be?

1198
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,780
Who will be First?

1199
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:25,789
Between you, the First Class dancer is...

1200
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,888
(Which dancer will be the honorable First Class?)

1201
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:33,429
Dancer Kim Young Woong, congratulations.

1202
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,369
(Group B First Class, Kim Young Woong)

1203
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,099
(Kim Young Woong in 1st)

1204
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,440
He did a good job.

1205
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,969
He did well.

1206
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:47,038
Dancer Kim Jae Jin will join the Second Class.

1207
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,379
(Group B Second Class, Kim Jae Jin)

1208
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,609
- You've reached the highest rank. - Thank you.

1209
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,650
First. Congratulations.

1210
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,349
Young Woong.

1211
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,590
It stuck on him right away.

1212
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,090
Like this?

1213
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,389
Jae Jin has a wide chest.

1214
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,719
It's bigger than the tag.

1215
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,589
I wasn't surprised.

1216
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,000
I had hopes, but I give him credit for it.

1217
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:08,230
He's a good dancer.

1218
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,530
I was happy.

1219
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,969
- That's all? - Yes.

1220
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,368
(He's as happy as he can be.)

1221
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:16,000
You're the 1st to be 1st.

1222
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,539
(Feeling the best)

1223
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:19,009
You're the 1st one in 1st Class.

1224
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,039
Thank you.

1225
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:22,239
- You did a great job. - Good luck.

1226
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,780
(Tapping his bottom)

1227
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,079
Here is Group A.

1228
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:28,279
My hands and feet were shaking.

1229
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,419
I sent a message to "Street Woman Fighter" and "Street Man Fighter..."

1230
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,820
and asked them for a show about contemporary dance.

1231
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,118
Kim Tae Gang.

1232
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,288
(Kim Tae Gang came to the audition as he had hoped.)

1233
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:37,360
I'm finally on.

1234
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:39,829
- It's Puppy. - Puppy.

1235
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,559
My nickname is Kim Tae Puppy.

1236
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:45,828
First of all, I look like a dog.

1237
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:46,939
(A puppy with a smiling face)

1238
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,238
I also have a smiling face.

1239
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:50,669
People find me cute, but...

1240
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,710
(The puppy transforms.)

1241
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:53,939
If I'm smiling, people will think that I'm easy.

1242
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,210
Onstage, I'll be Dobermann.

1243
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,210
If I look like a Dobermann, people won't look down on me.

1244
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,920
I plan to win.

1245
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,419
Kim Hye Hyun.

1246
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,420
(Next to him is Dancer Kim Hye Hyun.)

1247
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:04,919
Hye Hyun seemed strong.

1248
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,988
He had the highest physical score.

1249
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:08,960
(While entering the Contemporary Dance Locker Room)

1250
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:10,988
(Physical Score: 1st place, 20 out of 20)

1251
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,260
How will he dance?

1252
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,659
Won't it be strong?

1253
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,530
It will be intense.

1254
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:19,129
It will be scary.

1255
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,739
(Nervous, Pit-a-pat)

1256
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,439
- Can you go in first? - You go in.

1257
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,638
- You go in first. - Rock-paper-scissors?

1258
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,010
- Okay. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1259
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:28,639
I'm scared.

1260
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,550
Come in right behind me.

1261
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,018
(Squeaking)

1262
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:34,019
(Shutting)

1263
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,150
They're leaving right away.

1264
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,049
What? They ran away.

1265
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,019
I'm shy around new people.

1266
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,118
I get nervous easily.

1267
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,158
(I got in.)

1268
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,488
(Kwon Yo Han, Kim Tae Gang, Kim Eun Hyuk, Kim Hye Hyun)

1269
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,759
(Smiling)

1270
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,929
(Rubbing his nose)

1271
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,899
Kim Hye Hyun's records were...

1272
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,300
overwhelming.

1273
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:52,699
I thought, "It won't be easy."

1274
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,839
(Keeping an eye on him)

1275
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,768
I kept Hye Hyun in check the most.

1276
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,538
I've seen the video of his performance during the competition.

1277
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:03,578
He's probably the youngest dancer...

1278
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:05,678
to win a prize at an international competition.

1279
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:07,449
He had nice technique back then.

1280
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,079
His dancing looked so clean.

1281
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,289
He'll probably dance well again today.

1282
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,860
Why don't the three of us do it together?

1283
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:17,129
I met him for the first time,

1284
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,659
and he was short.

1285
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,229
I felt relieved.

1286
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,658
In terms of height and proportions,

1287
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,170
I felt more confident.

1288
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:27,698
I'm considered short as a dancer.

1289
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:29,868
Being short is my weakness.

1290
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:33,408
That's why I move more and jump higher than others.

1291
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,738
I mostly dance with a lot of technique,

1292
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,010
so I don't think it's a disadvantage.

1293
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,820
I will do my best to make it to the First Class.

1294
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,690
Let's take our first positions, please.

1295
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:47,919
Music, start.

1296
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,960
(Group A's Physical and Technique Audition Rounds 1 and 2)

1297
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,730
Nice, Hye Hyun.

1298
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,760
Kick.

1299
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,268
Did you see him kick with his eyes fixed until the end?

1300
00:49:58,269 --> 00:49:59,530
It looks so stable.

1301
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,899
He has a strong foundation.

1302
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,699
The landing. Nice.

1303
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,010
(She can't take her eyes off him.)

1304
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,009
- Nice. - Nice.

1305
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,279
- Isn't that exemplary? - It is.

1306
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,280
Yes.

1307
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,210
(Surprised)

1308
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:14,049
Isn't Kim Tae Gang good?

1309
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,178
- Kim Tae Gang is good. - Yes, I agree.

1310
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,949
His twist and illusion turn are good.

1311
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,820
Tae Gang has nice body lines.

1312
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,559
Even his rainbow looks clean.

1313
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:26,359
(Group A's Physical and Technique Audition Rounds 1 and 2...)

1314
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,399
(are over)

1315
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,460
(Kim Tae Gang and Kim Hye Hyun face each other in Round 3.)

1316
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,369
Round Three will start.

1317
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,440
First position.

1318
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,739
Before Round 3, I thought I'd be happy to be in 2nd,

1319
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,639
but greed is frightening.

1320
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,010
I wanted to become First Class.

1321
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:43,279
Since he's younger than me,

1322
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,848
he has less experience than me.

1323
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:47,079
I might have the upper hand.

1324
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,250
Music.

1325
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:50,489
Dobermann when I'm onstage.

1326
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,989
Like Dobermann, the hunting dog.

1327
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,190
Start.

1328
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,819
- Five, four, - Tae Gang is only twenty years old.

1329
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,129
(Group A's Physical and Technique Audition Round 3 starts.)

1330
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,559
He's the youngest.

1331
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,099
Go.

1332
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,369
He did the fish right after the rainbow.

1333
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:11,340
Like Dobermann, the hunting dog.

1334
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:13,409
(Startled)

1335
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,440
(The Dobermann soars with force.)

1336
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,379
(Surprised)

1337
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,480
A breakfall?

1338
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:20,949
Nice.

1339
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,349
(Giving him credit)

1340
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,090
(Focused)

1341
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,300
Four, three, two, one. Go.

1342
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,029
Okay.

1343
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,230
- I should do breakfalls too. - One. Go.

1344
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:39,570
(Dancer Kim Hye Hyun is up next.)

1345
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,939
(That's it.)

1346
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,169
(In awe continuously)

1347
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,440
He's so light.

1348
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,679
I think he wanted to show...

1349
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:54,078
that he was better than me. It hurt my sense of pride.

1350
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,019
It's needless to say that I'm better.

1351
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,820
Yes.

1352
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,328
He's like a rock.

1353
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:07,359
(Getting into it)

1354
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,460
(Impressed)

1355
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,599
He's so beautiful.

1356
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,739
His moves are so nice.

1357
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,779
(Matthew is surprised.)

1358
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,909
Look at his physique.

1359
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,949
He's flexible too?

1360
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,050
He has everything except height.

1361
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,929
Three, two, one.

1362
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,530
Stop.

1363
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,198
- It's crazy. - It was tight.

1364
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,829
The quality is already on another level.

1365
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,299
- I acknowledge that. - Everyone is good.

1366
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,300
I really acknowledge that.

1367
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,309
Hye Hyun was good.

1368
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,969
I should show a plot twist.

1369
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,840
I'm confident.

1370
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,779
(1-on-1 Improvised Technique Simultaneous Dance Battle starts.)

1371
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,808
(The last part in Round 3)

1372
00:52:58,809 --> 00:52:59,809
Go.

1373
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,150
He starts with a rainbow as expected.

1374
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,090
The line is clean.

1375
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,590
Hye Hyun is so relaxed.

1376
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,059
- The kick. - Oh, my. Beautiful.

1377
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,500
- Oh, gosh. - He's good.

1378
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:18,699
(Impressed)

1379
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,500
A back tumbling too?

1380
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,670
Nice.

1381
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:22,670
(There you go.)

1382
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,139
Oh, my gosh.

1383
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:32,880
- Hye Hyun has his own movements. - Yes.

1384
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,349
I like his character too.

1385
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,219
Three, two, one.

1386
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:39,889
Stop.

1387
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,289
One. Stop.

1388
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,690
One. Stop.

1389
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,698
(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition is over.)

1390
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:48,699
(They acknowledge it.)

1391
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,070
They're so good.

1392
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:52,000
Will I be in First Class?

1393
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,440
I think I did well.

1394
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:55,900
Let me announce the result.

1395
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:58,908
Hye Hyun,

1396
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:02,880
it seemed you knew your character well.

1397
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:07,149
You looked very relaxed, which was nice.

1398
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:09,348
(He showed clean moves and relaxed facial expressions.)

1399
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:10,618
- His facial expressions too. - Yes.

1400
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:11,820
There's also drama.

1401
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:13,860
Tae Gang,

1402
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,289
you had great breathing techniques and upper body movements.

1403
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,129
(Kim Tae Gang caught their attention with his flexible upper body moves.)

1404
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,900
I think Tae Gang has a flexible back.

1405
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:22,929
You worked hard.

1406
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:27,269
Dancer Kim Tae Gang and Dancer Kim Hye Hyun.

1407
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,599
The First Class is...

1408
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,109
(Who is the dancer that will be in the First Class?)

1409
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:36,439
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun.

1410
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,449
Congratulations.

1411
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,880
The Second Class is Dancer Kim Tae Gang.

1412
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,018
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1413
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,749
You've achieved the highest rank of First.

1414
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,819
I really enjoyed it.

1415
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,959
- Truly. - Thank you.

1416
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,960
Well done.

1417
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:53,499
If I hadn't been on this show,

1418
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,999
I wouldn't have known dancers like this...

1419
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,059
existed.

1420
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:57,499
(Sighing)

1421
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
It's a pity.

1422
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:02,769
I could clearly see Hye Hyun was a great dancer.

1423
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,009
He was cool.

1424
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,109
(Back to reality)

1425
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,340
I'll go practice.

1426
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,409
It's my 1st time being in the 1st Class. I was so happy.

1427
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,710
I want to stay in the First Class.

1428
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,420
I should work harder.

1429
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:16,719
And next, we have Group E.

1430
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,489
Jung Hye Seong.

1431
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,190
Choo Seok Ho.

1432
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,059
Yun Hyeok Jung.

1433
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,789
Park Jin Ho.

1434
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,530
Two of them won in international competitions.

1435
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,199
Oh, gosh.

1436
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:30,070
There was a ridiculous group.

1437
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,929
Dancer Hyeok Jung and Dancer Jin Ho.

1438
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:34,570
They're too strong.

1439
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:36,869
The two have great bodies.

1440
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,670
Yun Hyeok Jung and Park Jin Ho.

1441
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:41,340
You can tell already when they're just standing.

1442
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,308
(Everyone is paying attention...)

1443
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,610
(to Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung and Dancer Park Jin Ho.)

1444
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,179
Where is he?

1445
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,848
(Jin Ho chose the same group as Hyeok Jung.)

1446
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:50,189
This is interesting.

1447
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,519
(It's going to be fun.)

1448
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:52,920
We should compete against each other.

1449
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:56,189
I've performed with Hyeok Jung once.

1450
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,328
I heard we have similar lines.

1451
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:01,099
So I thought he was my rival.

1452
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:03,900
- He went there? - It's going to be easy.

1453
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,630
I thought, "Look at him."

1454
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,699
I did feel competitive.

1455
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:09,869
(Upset)

1456
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,969
You'll regret that you put your name there.

1457
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:13,479
Beating Hyeok Jung?

1458
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,639
I can do it.

1459
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,908
I can move my body more softly than him.

1460
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:18,280
So I have an advantage.

1461
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,909
He can't win against me yet.

1462
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,179
Jin Ho is good,

1463
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:23,848
but I'm better.

1464
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:26,190
It'll be either Hyeok Jung or Jin Ho in this group.

1465
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:27,988
By the way, these two...

1466
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,860
lack a lot in terms of physique, don't you think?

1467
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,029
From the moment we were standing,

1468
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,030
we started in different places.

1469
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,429
Everyone is wearing the same clothes.

1470
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,469
Those with great bodies surely stand out.

1471
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:42,170
They look cool just by standing.

1472
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:45,639
The two of them were so fit.

1473
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:48,209
I'm small and slim.

1474
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,480
So it's natural I'm overshadowed.

1475
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,449
I'll do my best.

1476
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:53,480
Round One begins.

1477
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,218
- Bravo. - You can see...

1478
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:58,250
his body extending to both sides.

1479
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,190
Hyeok Jung has power.

1480
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,960
I can tell he's using his back to move his arms.

1481
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,159
He's good.

1482
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:08,030
Look at him.

1483
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,959
(Hye Seong caught their attention with an amazing jump.)

1484
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,000
Jung Hye Seong?

1485
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,500
Surprising.

1486
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:14,538
How can he make a perfect line like that...

1487
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:15,840
without putting his hands on the floor?

1488
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,010
I didn't have high expectations, but he grabbed my attention.

1489
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,780
Under Class is Choo Seok Ho.

1490
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,179
He just has a hard time rotating.

1491
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:27,919
- The transitions aren't smooth. - Right.

1492
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,880
Choo Seok Ho is a little...

1493
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,949
I must've done a good job.

1494
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,058
They were looking at me with eyes full of expectations.

1495
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:36,419
I felt the atmosphere had changed.

1496
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,589
Before that, they were like, "He would be mediocre."

1497
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,500
Their facial expressions had changed.

1498
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,829
There's a stark difference between our bodies.

1499
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,329
But instead of thinking about that,

1500
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,769
I thought I would do something else to prove myself.

1501
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,609
I should work ten times harder...

1502
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,139
and practice 100 times more than those with great bodies.

1503
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,639
Round Two will begin.

1504
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:56,710
I suddenly felt competitive against someone else.

1505
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:59,409
It's going to be an intense battle from now on.

1506
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,419
With my small body,

1507
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,889
how can I grab their attention?

1508
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,590
I must make them look at me only.

1509
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,190
First position.

1510
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:09,119
Music, start.

1511
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,730
Three, two, one.

1512
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,500
Go.

1513
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,670
He has a great leg.

1514
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,369
I thought I should show my leg movements more.

1515
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:22,769
The kick.

1516
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,170
It's crazy.

1517
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,409
That side kick was amazing.

1518
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,679
- The floor technique. - Beautiful.

1519
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,150
I thought I should show it too.

1520
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,449
- The fish. - He's so flexible.

1521
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,550
(What?)

1522
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:41,420
I was overshadowed as I was behind tall people.

1523
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,159
- Oh, my. - What?

1524
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,658
(Hye Seong suddenly goes forward.)

1525
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,729
He's going.

1526
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,559
Here he goes.

1527
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,230
He's smart.

1528
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,229
(He appears like a comet.)

1529
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,900
"What? Why does he go forward?"

1530
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:56,909
If I'm the smallest, I can go forward.

1531
00:58:57,469 --> 00:58:58,769
I don't know who to look at.

1532
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,209
Yes.

1533
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,839
(Look at me.)

1534
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,078
Okay.

1535
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,750
Nice.

1536
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,449
"This isn't going well."

1537
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,150
"This is bad."

1538
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,920
Three, two, one. Stop.

1539
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,320
It was fun.

1540
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,460
He showed his best move.

1541
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:19,788
I didn't know who to look at,

1542
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,099
then he suddenly turned as if he was saying, "Look at me."

1543
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,198
(Everyone is obsessed with Hye Seong.)

1544
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,469
Gosh, how can he keep spinning like that?

1545
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:30,139
I think he was a top in his past life.

1546
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:32,409
His pirouette was so impactful.

1547
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,339
But he wasn't bad.

1548
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,409
- Right. - No, he wasn't.

1549
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,280
The difference is very slight.

1550
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,979
He chose the wrong group.

1551
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,320
He's unlucky for having opponents like them.

1552
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:45,820
- I really don't know. - Me neither.

1553
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:48,719
At first, I wasn't worried at all.

1554
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,089
But I worried...

1555
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,659
I might not win because of my physique.

1556
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:56,099
If I go just 1 more step, I can be in the 1st Class.

1557
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:57,570
I wanted to get out of there, at least.

1558
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,428
I don't want to be eliminated.

1559
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,539
I think I did my best.

1560
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,809
I will announce the dancer in the Second Class.

1561
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,269
No way.

1562
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,408
(Closing his eyes)

1563
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,420
(What?)

1564
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,019
It's Dancer Park Jin Ho. You worked hard.

1565
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,650
What? Jin Ho?

1566
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:21,920
He doesn't lack in terms of physique.

1567
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,389
I was like, "It turned out like this?"

1568
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,260
This group is quite intense.

1569
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,030
I thought I would be eliminated while competing for the First Class.

1570
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,800
It was an unexpected result.

1571
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:34,400
It's true I wasn't good enough. I should accept it.

1572
01:00:34,769 --> 01:00:37,010
I should do better on other missions.

1573
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:41,710
I didn't expect Jin Ho to be eliminated there.

1574
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,679
"This won't do." That's when I changed.

1575
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:47,150
The last round will be intense.

1576
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,050
Round Three will begin.

1577
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:53,389
Dancer Hyeok Jung is tall and good-looking.

1578
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,919
I felt competitive just for that reason.

1579
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,089
In terms of skills,

1580
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,659
I think I can win.

1581
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:00,860
It's over if I lose here.

1582
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,529
So I was drawing up strategies...

1583
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,699
to receive more votes.

1584
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,000
I thought I should show off more.

1585
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:10,340
Round 3, 1st position.

1586
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:12,440
Music, start.

1587
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,138
Three, two,

1588
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,880
- I'll show my arm and leg lines. - one. Go.

1589
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,050
The side balance.

1590
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:21,619
He's good.

1591
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,449
A nice turn.

1592
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:27,389
He wasn't extraordinary, unlike my expectations.

1593
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,719
His techniques weren't special.

1594
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,689
I should do what I'm good at.

1595
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,730
- Oh, my. - He's going hard.

1596
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,570
He has a face too.

1597
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:42,670
Hyeok Jung was flirting.

1598
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:44,769
The atmosphere had changed.

1599
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:47,280
He's flexible and looks relaxed.

1600
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,710
He knows how to control his body.

1601
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,948
Five, four,

1602
01:01:52,949 --> 01:01:54,320
- three, two. - "What is it?"

1603
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,518
- Five, four... - I should make it interesting.

1604
01:01:57,519 --> 01:01:59,388
- Five, four, - The technique I'm confident in.

1605
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:00,959
- three, two. - What is he going to do?

1606
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,919
(A gainer)

1607
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,289
- Oh, my. - Okay.

1608
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,460
A gainer.

1609
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,460
(A perfect gainer)

1610
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:09,530
Look at how he finished it.

1611
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,429
I thought they would have more positive opinions about me.

1612
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:14,369
I was like, "Goodbye."

1613
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:15,500
(Laughing)

1614
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,269
I thought I should change the atmosphere.

1615
01:02:17,769 --> 01:02:20,579
I wanted to do what they would like.

1616
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,610
Yes. Even from the beginning.

1617
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,110
It's a move based on ballet.

1618
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,579
- What? What's that? - He's light.

1619
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,049
Oh, my.

1620
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,488
(The ballerinas...)

1621
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:32,749
(like it.)

1622
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,559
- That is soft and strong. - Soft and strong.

1623
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,158
- Oh, gosh. - Here he goes.

1624
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,429
You can't do the move if you're not flexible.

1625
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:45,730
Did he do gymnastics? He's very flexible.

1626
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,940
I thought I should mix ballet techniques with contemporary dance.

1627
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:51,968
(Look at his feet.)

1628
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,039
(Grinning)

1629
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:56,980
- Battu. Bourree. - Three, two, one.

1630
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,079
(He combined ballet and contemporary dance.)

1631
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,119
(Satisfied)

1632
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,780
Both are really good.

1633
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:05,289
He's good, but he was better in Round Two.

1634
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:09,119
If I don't make a mistake, I could be in the First Class.

1635
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,889
This is it.

1636
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,829
I thought I should use all my remaining energy to finish it.

1637
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,999
Three, two...

1638
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,969
(1-on-1 Improvised Technique Simultaneous Dance Battle starts.)

1639
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,769
I went forward no matter what.

1640
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:24,269
The energy. Yes.

1641
01:03:24,809 --> 01:03:25,940
I thought I should leave a strong impression.

1642
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:29,380
- Both are so good. - It's tight.

1643
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,209
(Hyeok Jung is using his long limbs.)

1644
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,219
His moves definitely look big.

1645
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,789
I thought I should show something strong.

1646
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,789
Oh, no.

1647
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,860
I thought, "Something is wrong."

1648
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,960
I sprained my back for a moment. It was painful.

1649
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,400
I thought I should just keep going.

1650
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,699
Yes. Okay.

1651
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,969
No. You should do more.

1652
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,969
(Hyeok Jung tries to show a technique at that moment.)

1653
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,539
It was so high, even though he jumped without a run-up.

1654
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,940
I thought I should make them lock their eyes on me.

1655
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,239
The skills.

1656
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,739
His moves are big.

1657
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,710
I did it, thinking it was my last chance.

1658
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,909
They're so different, but both are...

1659
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,820
- Stop. - I loved it.

1660
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,419
It was close.

1661
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,848
- I loved it. - Nice.

1662
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:15,288
(Their finale made it seem like they performed together.)

1663
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:16,320
Nice.

1664
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:18,329
Bravo.

1665
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,029
This is what I wanted to see.

1666
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,829
It was very close.

1667
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,199
It was amazing.

1668
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:27,070
They showed every technique they could do.

1669
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,340
"First Class is mine."

1670
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,909
That's what I thought.

1671
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,109
I could've done better at the end.

1672
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,509
But I was witty. I did so well in that sense.

1673
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:38,879
It's so hard to choose.

1674
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,150
They have completely different styles.

1675
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:44,250
Hyeok Jung is better in terms of physique and techniques.

1676
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,919
He expressed the lines...

1677
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:48,389
he could utilize well.

1678
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,460
He has those lines and power for a reason.

1679
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:55,598
He should use his physique to bring out the energy.

1680
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,869
But you saw his technique. Then it should be him for sure.

1681
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,799
He effectively showcased his forte...

1682
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,599
through his moves.

1683
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,170
He showed a lot of moves.

1684
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:08,210
This is the Physical and Technique Audition.

1685
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:09,539
But the technique was good.

1686
01:05:09,579 --> 01:05:11,079
(The masters and coaches can't reach a consensus easily.)

1687
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:13,250
(Which one will be in the First Class?)

1688
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,920
It was an extremely difficult decision. I'll announce the result.

1689
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:20,249
One of you will be in the First Class.

1690
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,260
And the other will be in the Second Class.

1691
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,730
Which one will be in the First Class?

1692
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,099
The First Class is...

1693
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:30,260
Who is it?

1694
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:35,070
- What? - What?

1695
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,039
The Second Class is Dancer Jung Hye Seong.

1696
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,010
The First Class is Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung.

1697
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,009
You worked hard.

1698
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:50,149
It was a close game.

1699
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,618
If only Hye Seong's rainbow had been perfect...

1700
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,360
It's a competition, so you can't help it.

1701
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:57,460
How would you score them regardless of your taste?

1702
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,029
- Hye Seong made a mistake. - Yes. He made a mistake.

1703
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,360
- The rainbow. - Yes.

1704
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,630
It was a little disappointing.

1705
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,899
But I don't want to say it was because of my back.

1706
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,269
It's my job to control it as a dancer.

1707
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,308
"I don't have a great body. What do I do?" Rather than thinking that,

1708
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:14,808
"I made the masters and coaches contemplate..."

1709
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:17,480
"for a long time."

1710
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:20,210
I like this. Number one.

1711
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,419
(Precious)

1712
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,519
I should be in the First Class no matter what.

1713
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:26,690
I'll protect it as much as I can.

1714
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,288
(Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition, Group F)

1715
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:31,789
Go Dong Hoon.

1716
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:33,929
Lee Jin Woo.

1717
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:36,360
Kim Hyun Ho.

1718
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,400
And finally, I Ban.

1719
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,868
Go Dong Hoon and Kim Hyun Ho are the same age.

1720
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:44,539
Their physical scores differ by just one point.

1721
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:47,269
- Both have high scores. - They have almost perfect scores.

1722
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,638
Hyun Ho and I go to the same school.

1723
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,650
I major in Dance Performance, and he majors in Choreography.

1724
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,780
We have very different styles. But in terms of technique,

1725
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,750
I think I'm much better than him.

1726
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,618
I learned many basic contemporary dance techniques...

1727
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:03,058
in school. As I learned them before,

1728
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:04,159
I didn't have a problem.

1729
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:07,530
Contraction.

1730
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:10,599
This is for me.

1731
01:07:10,969 --> 01:07:12,130
(Glancing)

1732
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:13,669
Oh, my gosh.

1733
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:17,199
I wasn't familiar with the terms as I mostly focused on choreography.

1734
01:07:17,469 --> 01:07:19,469
Contraction, chaines.

1735
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,380
It's confusing.

1736
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,039
I thought, "How can I do this?"

1737
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,408
(What else can you do? Let's practice.)

1738
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,780
I might not be that good in terms of basic techniques,

1739
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,420
but I will compete using my energetic body.

1740
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:35,920
When I do a kick, I'll do it faster and stronger.

1741
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:40,659
When I do chaines, I'll turn as energetically as possible.

1742
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,030
Yes.

1743
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,658
(He found the target.)

1744
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,000
Hyun Ho doesn't know basic techniques.

1745
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,570
But he was better than I thought.

1746
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,199
I feel competitive.

1747
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:52,408
(Meanwhile, I Ban is not practicing techniques.)

1748
01:07:52,409 --> 01:07:53,468
(He has a headache.)

1749
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,139
"What do I do?"

1750
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:58,349
I really wanted to hide. I felt very small.

1751
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,979
(While they were playing the demonstration video)

1752
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,019
How do I do that?

1753
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,118
I've never learned dance techniques.

1754
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:07,289
It was very hard to copy the moves in a short period of time.

1755
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:12,488
You didn't study contemporary dance.

1756
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:13,489
No.

1757
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,500
- It must be so hard. - I've never done this.

1758
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,729
(Upset)

1759
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,368
But I don't want to run away.

1760
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:24,470
I thought I would do anything.

1761
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,880
(How did I Ban with no experience prepare for the audition?)

1762
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,609
Let's take the first position.

1763
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:32,909
Music, start.

1764
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,078
- Let's move as my body remembers. - Five, four,

1765
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:39,119
- I should show powerful moves - three, two, one.

1766
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:40,720
(The Contemporary Dance Physical and Technique Audition starts.)

1767
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,819
The contraction is nice.

1768
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:46,430
It feels great when I hit the move.

1769
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:47,800
His moves are clean and nice.

1770
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:51,500
- I liked how he held it. - It's stable.

1771
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,770
The tilt isn't bad.

1772
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,710
I thought I should do it more powerfully than Dong Hoon.

1773
01:08:58,109 --> 01:08:59,109
(Power and energy)

1774
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,169
(Impressed)

1775
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:01,379
(Cross side tilt)

1776
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,880
It's a powerful tilt.

1777
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:04,949
His tilt is the best among them.

1778
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,810
I should show them properly.

1779
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,578
(Jumping in earnest)

1780
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:10,449
- A nice jump. - It's clean.

1781
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:12,649
He stretched his front leg properly.

1782
01:09:12,989 --> 01:09:14,819
Dong Hoon has great basic techniques.

1783
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,930
I'll release my energy.

1784
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:19,930
(Hyun Ho is turning powerfully.)

1785
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:22,060
He knows how to keep it powerful yet controlled.

1786
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,829
Both Dong Hoon and Hyun Ho are good.

1787
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,300
- What? - What is he doing?

1788
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,310
He changed the move.

1789
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:35,439
Do you think he's confused about the order?

1790
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:36,779
He's giving a solo performance.

1791
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,850
What is I Ban doing?

1792
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:42,079
Does he have another strategy?

1793
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:44,989
- He's not supposed to do that now. - He's not.

1794
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:47,520
He just did it in his own style.

1795
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,858
Three, two, one.

1796
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:53,959
(The Contemporary Physical and Technique Audition has ended.)

1797
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,060
(I Ban showed his own moves instead of the fixed techniques.)

1798
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,429
He did what he should do...

1799
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,430
- in Round Two. - Yes.

1800
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:04,270
(The atmosphere in the audition room suddenly turned cold.)

1801
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,868
What was that?

1802
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,439
It seemed he didn't learn dance at all.

1803
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:11,349
It was overwhelmingly silent.

1804
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,380
It was a mess.

1805
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:14,720
But I don't regret it.

1806
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,188
It's obvious who should be cut out this time.

1807
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:20,249
- You're right. - Yes.

1808
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,760
We'll now reveal the dancer...

1809
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:24,960
who got cut out and joined the Under Class.

1810
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:29,260
(When they were about to announce the Under Class in Group F,)

1811
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:31,500
(I Ban quickly raised his hand.)

1812
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:32,729
(Startled)

1813
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:34,129
(What's going on?)

1814
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,170
First of all,

1815
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,109
I'd like to apologize.

1816
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,078
I didn't improvise...

1817
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,710
because I thought my moves were better.

1818
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,880
Actually,

1819
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,220
I paused...

1820
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,420
because I couldn't execute the technique.

1821
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,659
(After the practice had ended before the audition)

1822
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,529
(I Ban quietly goes to the corridor.)

1823
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,429
Twist. Twist one more time.

1824
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,460
(Staggering)

1825
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:06,430
(Hyun Ho in Group F found I Ban.)

1826
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,340
Are you okay?

1827
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,899
- I'm doing my best. - Do you want...

1828
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,210
to practice together? Like we could dance on the same beat.

1829
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:17,209
- I can practice with you. - Thank you.

1830
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,210
(No worries.)

1831
01:11:18,449 --> 01:11:19,509
Kick.

1832
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,020
(With Hyun Ho's help, they're practicing techniques.)

1833
01:11:22,619 --> 01:11:23,849
- Illusion turn. - Thankfully,

1834
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:26,289
- Hyun Ho helped me. - Then turn.

1835
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:30,090
(He kept practicing after Hyun Ho had left.)

1836
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:32,689
But it really wasn't easy.

1837
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,760
I thought it would never work out.

1838
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,299
But I thought it'd be even ruder...

1839
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,140
to stand still...

1840
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:43,939
to the other dancers and the people who were watching.

1841
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,569
I don't have to follow the exact move, right?

1842
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,880
It's because I can't execute the technique.

1843
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:53,479
I might lack as a dancer.

1844
01:11:54,779 --> 01:11:55,920
But I thought I should do something.

1845
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,750
I wanted to show the right attitude, at least.

1846
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,260
I thought I needed to show some kind of dance.

1847
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,889
(Nodding)

1848
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,259
(I respect that.)

1849
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,960
He was very cool.

1850
01:12:08,329 --> 01:12:10,229
That was a good attitude.

1851
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,269
He had the mindset to show some kind of movements.

1852
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,739
I agree with that thought.

1853
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,438
I think his movements showed respect...

1854
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:20,739
to the reason why he was here.

1855
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:24,078
Unfortunately, you've been ranked in Under.

1856
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:25,250
Thank you.

1857
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,408
You can exit the floor.

1858
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:30,648
(I Ban regains his smile and receives the Under Class mark.)

1859
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:33,619
(Everyone gives him a round of applause.)

1860
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:36,960
This isn't the only time I'll get to show my dance.

1861
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:39,489
I think I'll do better next time.

1862
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,529
- I liked his attitude. - Same here.

1863
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,129
(Contemporary Physical and Technique Audition)

1864
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:46,170
(Group F, Round 2)

1865
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:48,770
Contraction. Double contraction.

1866
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,698
The Aoya was clean.

1867
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:54,210
Go Dong Hoon is the most precise and easy on the eyes.

1868
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,279
He did a headstand.

1869
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,279
Gainer.

1870
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:00,350
Hyun Ho does it in a very unique way.

1871
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:03,078
Jin Woo keeps breaking up the movements.

1872
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,050
I don't think we can call that a technique.

1873
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,760
The Second Class is Dancer Lee Jin Woo.

1874
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,318
All right.

1875
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,529
(The 2 of them prepare for the 1-on-1 Improvised Technique.)

1876
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:13,229
Now is my time.

1877
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,630
I'll show them a variety.

1878
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:18,868
I'll show my unique charms.

1879
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:20,970
I'll show something only I can do.

1880
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,369
Round Three will begin.

1881
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,140
First position.

1882
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,340
Music, start.

1883
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:30,039
(Dancer Go Dong Hoon performs first in Group F.)

1884
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:31,779
I came this far.

1885
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:34,349
Let's enjoy myself in earnest.

1886
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,380
Go.

1887
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:36,979
(Transforming)

1888
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:40,220
He can jump well.

1889
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,989
He's light.

1890
01:13:42,859 --> 01:13:44,319
I'll soar into the air first.

1891
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:46,590
- The Aoya. - It was clean.

1892
01:13:47,859 --> 01:13:49,729
- The transition was nice. - Yes.

1893
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,430
His movements are controlled and swift.

1894
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,199
Modified forward roll.

1895
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,198
- Soft. It's nice. - Yes.

1896
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,939
Why isn't he showing a technique like the nuclear bomb?

1897
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:04,109
I wanted to show that I could take on various moods.

1898
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,309
- Five, four, - He dances tastefully.

1899
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,050
- three, two, - It looks like he has been freed.

1900
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,219
one. Go.

1901
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,289
It was a bit disappointing.

1902
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:15,289
There wasn't an impactful move.

1903
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:17,090
I decided to be daring.

1904
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:18,659
(Dancer Kim Hyun Ho goes second in Group F)

1905
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:24,430
- He's enjoying it even more. - Not bad.

1906
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:25,868
He's showing off his charms.

1907
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,470
- This is fun. - Look at his facial expression.

1908
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,810
If he performs like that, the match will be interesting.

1909
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,738
It's like B-boying.

1910
01:14:33,739 --> 01:14:35,809
I think the mood changed to street dance.

1911
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:36,909
What?

1912
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,009
Modified floor technique.

1913
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:40,849
He's breaking up the movements.

1914
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:41,979
(Interested)

1915
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:46,520
Hyun Ho works very hard.

1916
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:50,389
- Three, two, one. - Yes.

1917
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:51,529
(Powerful)

1918
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:53,529
He did so well.

1919
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,630
Nice.

1920
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,829
He looked macho.

1921
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,699
It was insane.

1922
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:01,499
I don't know what will happen.

1923
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:04,500
I'll show them everything I can do.

1924
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:06,839
- Five, four, - I'll give a proper performance.

1925
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,209
three, two,

1926
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,340
- It'll be a fun match. - one. Go.

1927
01:15:11,609 --> 01:15:13,380
- My goodness. - It's a relay battle.

1928
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,050
He's warming up with krumping.

1929
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,319
I thought, "I lost control."

1930
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:21,050
I didn't come off as strong at first.

1931
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,158
(Dropping the nuclear bomb)

1932
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:24,930
- That's the nuclear bomb. - That move?

1933
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,460
He moved so lightly.

1934
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:28,659
He's good.

1935
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,869
I decided to captivate their eyes as soon as possible.

1936
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,039
A headspin.

1937
01:15:36,039 --> 01:15:37,039
(Expectant)

1938
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,170
(A shocking spin)

1939
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:42,038
Three, two...

1940
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:43,039
(Group F, Round 3 ends.)

1941
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,140
Stop.

1942
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,408
(My goodness)

1943
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:47,509
What a sight.

1944
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,579
It was fun.

1945
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:50,319
They're completely different.

1946
01:15:50,949 --> 01:15:54,419
One showed floor techniques, and the other showed aerial techniques.

1947
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,788
I showed them aerial techniques.

1948
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:59,789
They probably said, "Go Dong Hoon doesn't disappoint."

1949
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,199
I have a chance of joining the First Class.

1950
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,600
While adding a sense of humor to my performance,

1951
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:09,238
I showed them impressive techniques...

1952
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:10,439
on the floor.

1953
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,938
The one with better basic skills in contemporary dance was...

1954
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:16,108
this dancer.

1955
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:17,810
His techniques were very light.

1956
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:19,749
He made them look easy.

1957
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,278
(Nodding)

1958
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:25,149
One will join the 1st Class, and the other will join the 2nd Class.

1959
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:26,619
This is so hard.

1960
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,560
(Becoming nervous)

1961
01:16:28,789 --> 01:16:30,919
The First Class is...

1962
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,028
(First Class of Group F)

1963
01:16:34,029 --> 01:16:36,529
Dancer Go Dong Hoon. Congratulations.

1964
01:16:37,229 --> 01:16:39,328
(Go Dong Hoon in 1st)

1965
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:41,099
(Go Dong Hoon joined the First Class.)

1966
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,670
(Both of them were cool.)

1967
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:45,239
Dancer Kim Hyun Ho joined the Second Class.

1968
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,210
He fought hard.

1969
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:50,879
Congratulations. You ranked the highest. First.

1970
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,050
(Thank you.)

1971
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:55,919
Congratulations.

1972
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,979
(Group F's audition wraps up with the manly men's hug.)

1973
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,919
I came so close to joining the First Class,

1974
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,060
so I'm very disappointed.

1975
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:05,328
I'll keep trying...

1976
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:06,960
to join the First Class.

1977
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:10,060
I'm happy to be recognized for my talent.

1978
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,800
But they say that you must bear the weight of the crown.

1979
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,329
There's a bit of pressure.

1980
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:17,698
(STF Dance Company)

1981
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,438
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

1982
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:21,310
(24 Korean dancers gather for the audition.)

1983
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,509
Who'll judge our dance?

1984
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,810
I'm curious about the judges.

1985
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,278
(Who will they be?)

1986
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:28,319
(At that moment)

1987
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,649
I was very surprised.

1988
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,789
To be honest, I was surprised.

1989
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,019
I could feel her charisma.

1990
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,189
(My goodness)

1991
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,228
I'm the Master of Stage Fighter, Kim Joo Won.

1992
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:42,328
Ballerina Kim Joo Won is very famous.

1993
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:43,929
She exuded charisma.

1994
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,329
I'm Matthew. Nice to meet you.

1995
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,300
I was very surprised.

1996
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,069
I didn't expect to see him here.

1997
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,439
I'm Coach Kim Jae Seung.

1998
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,608
(He's a choreographer who shows Korean aesthetics and mood.)

1999
01:17:55,609 --> 01:17:57,039
He's a big name.

2000
01:17:57,609 --> 01:18:00,609
He's well-known for his talent in the Korean dance scene.

2001
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,850
I watched many of his performances.

2002
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,648
(He's a global choreographer who spreads Korean dance.)

2003
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:08,420
Being a fan, I became very nervous.

2004
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:11,260
I'm Korean Dance Coach Jung Bo Kyung.

2005
01:18:13,829 --> 01:18:15,698
Despite being petite,

2006
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:18,800
her power and energy surpass those of a male dancer.

2007
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,829
She often does choreography.

2008
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:24,000
I admire her for her unique colors.

2009
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,068
She's a celebrity in the dance scene.

2010
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:27,108
(Korean Dance Coach Jung Bo Kyung)

2011
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:28,710
This is a legitimate dance show.

2012
01:18:28,939 --> 01:18:31,210
They'll judge us properly.

2013
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:34,009
I thought it'd be an honor...

2014
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,478
to be judged and coached by them.

2015
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:38,989
I was both nervous and scared.

2016
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,318
In the Physical and Technique Audition,

2017
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:44,519
we'll judge your physique and techniques.

2018
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,089
You'll also be judged for your breath, line,

2019
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,430
balance, and expression that are unique to Korean dance.

2020
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,398
I'll reveal how each round will proceed...

2021
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,568
in the Physical and Technique Audition.

2022
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:59,309
Round One is the Technique Combination.

2023
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,009
Memorize the order...

2024
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,379
and recreate the dance in the video.

2025
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:05,709
It's similar to the copying test of the college entrance exam.

2026
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:08,579
I thought that I'd do well since I can memorize quickly.

2027
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,419
Knowing that my techniques were bad,

2028
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,618
I became scared.

2029
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:14,719
When it comes to techniques, I can do better than anyone else.

2030
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,259
I have confidence in most techniques...

2031
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,060
of Korean dance.

2032
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:20,658
(Nervous)

2033
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:21,728
(Curious)

2034
01:19:21,729 --> 01:19:22,799
(The Technique Combination video plays.)

2035
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,399
The first move is the head move.

2036
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,770
I was very surprised.

2037
01:19:27,869 --> 01:19:28,970
It's a basic move.

2038
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,840
What? It's a dance.

2039
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:33,969
Since it's a basic move, it'll be a battle of quality.

2040
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,608
Despite being very basic, the head move is quite difficult.

2041
01:19:36,609 --> 01:19:38,309
Turning the wrist...

2042
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,608
isn't easy for male dancers.

2043
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,318
People with more years of experience will have an advantage.

2044
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:45,720
I find the head move the hardest.

2045
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:48,359
I can show basic moves like this one.

2046
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,788
The Korean moves and steps...

2047
01:19:50,789 --> 01:19:52,228
are the techniques in traditional dance.

2048
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:54,158
Contestants who do traditional dance like me...

2049
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,759
will have an advantage.

2050
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,429
When it comes to such moves,

2051
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,199
I'm the absolute best.

2052
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:00,629
(Kim Hyo Joon scans the jaban.)

2053
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,039
After the jaban...

2054
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,069
I like jaban.

2055
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:06,369
I jump really well for jaban.

2056
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,538
I have confidence in the jaban, but...

2057
01:20:08,539 --> 01:20:10,739
Isn't every Korean dancer good at jaban?

2058
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,549
It's a basic technique.

2059
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,108
It isn't difficult to do it.

2060
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,619
But it's difficult to do it well.

2061
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,148
Seonja and jaban are basic techniques.

2062
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:21,959
But it's hard to keep the lines pretty.

2063
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,188
It's important to go up high.

2064
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:26,289
But I think what matters more is jumping in a beautiful way.

2065
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,300
After the jaban,

2066
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:30,028
do the gainer.

2067
01:20:30,029 --> 01:20:31,029
(Gainer: Jumping on 1 foot and making a 360° turn)

2068
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:32,868
I'm in so much trouble.

2069
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,828
I can't do a gainer.

2070
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:37,698
A gainer? A gainer right after a jaban?

2071
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:41,010
I have no experience in the gainer.

2072
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:42,309
I'm ruined.

2073
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,709
I'm ruined.

2074
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,750
That isn't something I can do.

2075
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,420
That's my move.

2076
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:49,778
I can do it with my eyes closed.

2077
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:50,779
(I can totally do it.)

2078
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,319
I had confidence.

2079
01:20:52,819 --> 01:20:55,589
Balance with the ollilsawi and wrap up the performance...

2080
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:56,689
with the ending pose.

2081
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,260
I think they will put importance on the basic moves.

2082
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:03,599
The choreography contained the basics of the Korean dance.

2083
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,728
I thought the order was perfect for evaluating the contestants.

2084
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:08,599
Since my techniques are a bit lacking...

2085
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,069
I'll compete with the basic moves.

2086
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:14,909
Round Two is the Modified Technique Combination.

2087
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:19,049
Keep the first and last techniques the same...

2088
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,350
and add modified techniques in the middle.

2089
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:25,919
If I do my best, I'll be able to add my colors...

2090
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,590
and show a good performance.

2091
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:31,289
I decided to change the key points to suit my taste.

2092
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:35,029
Round 3 is the 1-on-1 Improvised Technique.

2093
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:38,770
Each dancer will show improvised techniques.

2094
01:21:38,899 --> 01:21:42,469
Then after the two dancers show it at the same time,

2095
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,038
the result will be revealed.

2096
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:45,868
I have confidence in improvisation.

2097
01:21:45,869 --> 01:21:48,778
I'll show the most of my talent.

2098
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:52,578
My strength is the Korean move,

2099
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:55,019
so I'll try to win points that way.

2100
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,078
I'll captivate their attention with my killer move.

2101
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,618
I'll think about Round Three when I get there.

2102
01:21:59,619 --> 01:22:00,649
That's improvisation.

2103
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:03,019
From now on, we will begin...

2104
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,789
the Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition.

2105
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:07,560
My goal is First.

2106
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:09,859
First Class is mine.

2107
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,559
I will never become an Under.

2108
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,698
I will step on the others and climb up.

2109
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:14,429
- I'll go for it. - I'll get First.

2110
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,239
Isn't it right that I become First?

2111
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,309
The next is Group D.

2112
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,470
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition Group D)

2113
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:23,010
Jang Sung Bum,

2114
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:24,680
Kim Kyu Nyeon,

2115
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,810
Bang Seong Hyun, and Choi Ji Won.

2116
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,779
He received an award.

2117
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,850
Our Gold Award. Gold Award Kyu Nyeon.

2118
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:35,819
The person whose name I was surprised to see was Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2119
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,729
He won the Dong-A Dance Competition.

2120
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,029
I'm guessing he will have the best form.

2121
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:44,430
Isn't his top too open?

2122
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,499
This dancer also seems to have...

2123
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:47,899
- a sturdy build. - He's well-built.

2124
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:52,310
Out of the three, I was most wary of Dancer Kyu Nyeon.

2125
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,010
- What? - Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2126
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,839
- Kim Kyu Nyeon. - It has started.

2127
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,939
I know who he is.

2128
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,809
Kyu Nyeon, do you know Sung Bum?

2129
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,079
(Feeling nervous for some reason)

2130
01:23:01,819 --> 01:23:03,319
I saw him at the competition...

2131
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:05,219
- So, because you won... - No.

2132
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,549
- You beat him once, - No, it's not that.

2133
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,789
- so you can beat him twice? - It's not like that.

2134
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,060
(Burning with a competitive spirit)

2135
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:13,859
Kyu Nyeon won the Gold Award in the Dong-A Dance Competition.

2136
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:16,100
And I was eliminated in the preliminary round.

2137
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,929
Still, I'm confident that I won't lose...

2138
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,630
in terms of physique and technique.

2139
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,939
(Spinning, A graceful landing)

2140
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,209
I think I have good physical attributes...

2141
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,569
and good technique too.

2142
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,380
(Glancing)

2143
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:33,380
Actually, I don't think there was anyone I was wary of.

2144
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:37,819
In Korean Dance, flashy technique isn't the most important.

2145
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:40,219
Flowing lines that are Korean...

2146
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,560
and subtle details. I think those matter more.

2147
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,460
Rather than someone's jumping abilities or angles,

2148
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,028
I thought I should show...

2149
01:23:48,029 --> 01:23:51,159
the lines that Korean dancers can show with basic techniques.

2150
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,529
Since I'm going to do this, I should go to First.

2151
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,840
I'm going to join the First Class.

2152
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,439
I will.

2153
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,109
Let's take our first positions.

2154
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,680
Music,

2155
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:05,279
start.

2156
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,109
Three, two, one.

2157
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,420
- Let's go. - Go.

2158
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,679
The head move.

2159
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,720
(The fixed technique in Round 1: The head move)

2160
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:14,789
Let's show off the beauty in my flowing lines.

2161
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,560
Nice.

2162
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,189
Kyu Nyeon looks good.

2163
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,429
Kyu Nyeon has good, clean lines.

2164
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,630
Yes, he looks good.

2165
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:23,859
Beautiful.

2166
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,469
(The fixed technique in Round 1: The double step)

2167
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,569
The stationary jump.

2168
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:27,929
(Nice.)

2169
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:29,099
(Satisfied)

2170
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,938
I liked how he dropped his wrists in the stationary jump.

2171
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:33,868
- His fingertip placement is... - They're delicate.

2172
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:34,869
Yes.

2173
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:38,339
Dancer Jang Sung Bum is letting his wrists flap about.

2174
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,350
That's a shame.

2175
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,319
Kim Kyu Nyeon is more precise.

2176
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,420
Seonja.

2177
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:49,858
(A neat jump)

2178
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:51,520
(Impressed)

2179
01:24:51,789 --> 01:24:54,389
Kyu Nyeon's back leg extends all the way...

2180
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,699
and has a clean line.

2181
01:24:55,829 --> 01:24:56,829
He's good.

2182
01:24:57,029 --> 01:24:58,430
I'm confident in showing techniques.

2183
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:00,399
His lines are disappointing.

2184
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:01,970
His body looks heavy right now.

2185
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:05,368
(Right then, Jang Sung Bum misses the beat.)

2186
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:06,769
Gosh, he missed it.

2187
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:09,179
- Oh, dear. - I couldn't remember anything.

2188
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,278
I thought, "I'm in big trouble."

2189
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:12,649
Three, two, one.

2190
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:14,180
Stop.

2191
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,879
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

2192
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,648
(Group D, Round 1 is over.)

2193
01:25:19,649 --> 01:25:20,948
(Sighing)

2194
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:21,989
I was so annoyed.

2195
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:25,020
This was all I could show them?

2196
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,429
This dancer was...

2197
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:29,500
- behind on the beat and stuff. - Right.

2198
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:31,100
- I think so too. - Yes, this dancer.

2199
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,828
- He has a good build, though. - Yes.

2200
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:34,270
But that's why it looks worse.

2201
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:36,399
I danced without any regrets.

2202
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:39,809
We will reveal the dancer who will be cut out...

2203
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:42,439
and become Under Class in Round One.

2204
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:45,149
The Under Class dancer is...

2205
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,549
(Striding over)

2206
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:50,478
Your rhythm at the end was a little disappointing.

2207
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:51,779
I forgot the order.

2208
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:55,618
(Jang Sung Bum is cut out. He's confirmed as Under Class.)

2209
01:25:55,619 --> 01:25:56,819
- I feel bad. - Right.

2210
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,858
He was good during practice.

2211
01:25:58,859 --> 01:25:59,930
He memorized the order quickly.

2212
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:02,859
I made too many mistakes.

2213
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,630
I was so mad at myself.

2214
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,228
But just because I came in last, doesn't mean I'll always be last.

2215
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:09,139
With the resolve of going to war with no intention of coming back,

2216
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,270
I will go for it.

2217
01:26:10,869 --> 01:26:12,510
We will begin Round Two.

2218
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,609
I think his basic technique is really strong.

2219
01:26:16,409 --> 01:26:17,639
- That's it. - Nice.

2220
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,108
It's a double step going backward.

2221
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:20,279
(Would you look at this?)

2222
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:22,549
What was that?

2223
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:23,949
- Goodness! - What was that?

2224
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,819
- What was that? - Gosh, he's good.

2225
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,488
Dancer Bang Seong Hyun is lost in his own world.

2226
01:26:30,489 --> 01:26:31,929
He sure is unique.

2227
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:33,188
I think he's all right.

2228
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:34,930
He's lost in himself.

2229
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:36,699
(Lost in himself)

2230
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,698
He has good physical energy.

2231
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,029
He's a new discovery.

2232
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,899
Now, this dancer is rather weak.

2233
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,299
Unfortunately, you are Second.

2234
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,710
Please leave the floor.

2235
01:26:46,609 --> 01:26:48,209
(Round 3: 1-on-1 Improvised Technique)

2236
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:49,839
(Kim Kyu Nyeon versus Bang Seong Hyun)

2237
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:50,840
It's improvisation time.

2238
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:53,510
This dancer was just standing there earlier.

2239
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:55,920
- Earlier? - By himself. Just him.

2240
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,118
(During the practice session)

2241
01:26:58,119 --> 01:26:59,919
(Among all the dancers moving busily about,)

2242
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,689
(there is a man standing like a statue.)

2243
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:05,359
I didn't major in Korean dance.

2244
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,028
I was thinking about how to express myself...

2245
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:10,260
to make myself stand out.

2246
01:27:10,529 --> 01:27:13,369
My dance has Korean dance as its basis...

2247
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,599
with ballet, contemporary dance,

2248
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,799
ballroom dance, street dance,

2249
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,709
and various other genres.

2250
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,239
That's why I give off a new vibe.

2251
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:23,478
I should distinguish myself clearly...

2252
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:25,579
to show them that I can do other genres too.

2253
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:27,949
He has a totally different style than mine.

2254
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:29,520
I had no idea what he might do.

2255
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,019
- They're very different. - Yes.

2256
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,449
It's the real deal from now on.

2257
01:27:32,619 --> 01:27:34,649
Music, start.

2258
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,318
(Round 3, Bang Seong Hyun goes first.)

2259
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:37,889
I was moving to the music,

2260
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:39,460
and I suddenly thought of a zombie.

2261
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:41,890
I wanted to express that, at least.

2262
01:27:43,829 --> 01:27:45,868
(Bang Seong Hyun showed an improvised technique like a zombie.)

2263
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:47,199
- What's this? - Why is he so good?

2264
01:27:47,369 --> 01:27:48,500
(Surprised and intrigued)

2265
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:49,739
What's this?

2266
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:53,269
The segmentation of his arms and lower body...

2267
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:55,170
was great for showing his strengths.

2268
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,510
He has a different charm from mine.

2269
01:27:58,579 --> 01:28:00,908
Bang Seong Hyun is lost in his own world.

2270
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:01,949
I love it.

2271
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:04,149
He's drunk on his own vibe.

2272
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:07,319
A zombie that could move was dancing.

2273
01:28:08,289 --> 01:28:09,318
It's very unique.

2274
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:11,789
The trend of Korean dance is incredible.

2275
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,889
Let's finish this strong.

2276
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:15,728
Three, two, one.

2277
01:28:15,729 --> 01:28:17,129
- That's amazing. - What's that?

2278
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,630
- Goodness! - What's that?

2279
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:20,568
(Giving him credit)

2280
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:21,600
He's good.

2281
01:28:22,069 --> 01:28:24,100
(100-percent satisfied)

2282
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:25,938
I didn't feel threatened at all.

2283
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:29,039
I just wanted to show myself, whatever that may be.

2284
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:33,309
(Kim Kyu Nyeon starts dancing right away.)

2285
01:28:33,310 --> 01:28:35,249
- Five, four, - Oh, no.

2286
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,679
- three, two, one. - He made a mistake.

2287
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,049
- Oh, no. - Go.

2288
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:40,419
(Kim Kyu Nyeon forgot about the countdown due to his nerves.)

2289
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,849
- That was nice just now. - It was good.

2290
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:43,019
- It was good. - Two...

2291
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,789
We got bonus dancing.

2292
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,489
- Just go again. - Four, three,

2293
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,188
- I'm doomed. - two, one.

2294
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:49,300
- Let's make up for it. - Go.

2295
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,600
(He takes a breath and starts his Round 3 Improvised Technique.)

2296
01:28:53,029 --> 01:28:54,199
What is this?

2297
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,539
(Focused and keeping him in check)

2298
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,399
His body segmentation is good.

2299
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,770
Nice.

2300
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:00,939
His breathing is great right now.

2301
01:29:02,409 --> 01:29:04,439
(Continuous techniques)

2302
01:29:04,909 --> 01:29:05,909
Oh, my gosh.

2303
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:07,710
- He's doing a cartwheel full twist. - There's his weapon!

2304
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:09,819
He had a big punch.

2305
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,779
He has great flow in his dance.

2306
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,189
- The connecting motions. - Yes.

2307
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,489
That's insane.

2308
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:17,420
He's good. He has good technique too.

2309
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,289
His body moves freely.

2310
01:29:19,489 --> 01:29:21,960
I thought using my face was a part of technique too.

2311
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,599
(Expressive acting)

2312
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,869
Five, four, three, two, one.

2313
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,640
That was good.

2314
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:31,600
I showed them everything I could.

2315
01:29:32,069 --> 01:29:34,640
His moves weren't good enough to seem interesting.

2316
01:29:35,109 --> 01:29:36,779
They each have such unique colors.

2317
01:29:37,109 --> 01:29:38,779
They're both interesting.

2318
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:41,149
I came all the way to the end. I should be First Class.

2319
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,019
Will I be able to win?

2320
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,519
- I should win, no matter what. - Five, four,

2321
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,789
- I should beat him. - three, two,

2322
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,619
- Let's go. - one. Go.

2323
01:29:52,729 --> 01:29:53,788
Nice.

2324
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:54,959
He's passionate.

2325
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,199
This time, let's dance like a maniac.

2326
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,500
- Nice. - Goodness.

2327
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,069
He has personality.

2328
01:30:03,569 --> 01:30:05,069
He really is going to be free.

2329
01:30:05,770 --> 01:30:08,439
I'm pretty good at floor moves.

2330
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:09,840
He's good at utilizing the floor.

2331
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:12,149
He is good at using his body in various ways.

2332
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:14,078
I thought I couldn't win with this.

2333
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:16,550
If I have to show off something, let's make it this technique.

2334
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:17,979
(Bang Seong Hyun comes forward with a technique.)

2335
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:19,319
He added a jump.

2336
01:30:19,319 --> 01:30:20,319
(Surprised)

2337
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:21,319
(Impressed)

2338
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,260
He's very interesting.

2339
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,159
What was that?

2340
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:28,060
- He's just good. - Three, two, one.

2341
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:29,699
Stop.

2342
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,130
One. Stop.

2343
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:36,699
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition, Group D Round 3, is over.)

2344
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:43,609
(Drained of all his energy)

2345
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:45,210
They're very different.

2346
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:46,850
Oh, my gosh.

2347
01:30:46,851 --> 01:30:48,350
- Nice. - They both did so well.

2348
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,119
This is a fierce competition.

2349
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,489
You both did well.

2350
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:55,319
Then, I will announce the result.

2351
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,188
(Kim Kyu Nyeon and Bang Seong Hyun...)

2352
01:30:57,189 --> 01:30:58,419
(showed off totally different charms.)

2353
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:00,629
Dancer Bang Seong Hyun...

2354
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:03,259
seemed to show us what you were good at...

2355
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,099
and what you could do with passion.

2356
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:06,969
We gave you high scores on that.

2357
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,099
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon...

2358
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,368
didn't have a fixed flow to your dance.

2359
01:31:10,369 --> 01:31:13,739
I thought it was great that you expressed yourself in various ways.

2360
01:31:14,109 --> 01:31:17,609
Dancers Kim Kyu Nyeon and Bang Seong Hyun.

2361
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,109
The First Class is...

2362
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,720
- Who will it be? - Who's First?

2363
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,079
I was satisfied with how I finished.

2364
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:26,720
I thought I'd get this.

2365
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,859
I hope they choose me. Please choose me.

2366
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,789
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon. Congratulations.

2367
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:39,429
(Group D's First Class, Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon)

2368
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:41,328
(Disappointed)

2369
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:42,369
Congratulations.

2370
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,999
You've ranked First, which is the highest place.

2371
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,510
Congratulations.

2372
01:31:48,939 --> 01:31:50,639
I felt great.

2373
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,408
It felt like I was being acknowledged.

2374
01:31:52,409 --> 01:31:53,550
Let's work hard.

2375
01:31:53,979 --> 01:31:56,219
(Kim Kyu Nyeon in 1st.)

2376
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,220
You're in Second Class.

2377
01:31:57,221 --> 01:31:59,420
Dancer Bang Seong Hyun is in Second class.

2378
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,148
I'm not happy with the result,

2379
01:32:01,149 --> 01:32:03,719
but it's not that heartbreaking.

2380
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,920
I don't want to blame myself.

2381
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,090
I learned so much in that brief moment.

2382
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,858
Now that I'm on this show, I'll improve...

2383
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:11,930
and be in First Class.

2384
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:13,429
Group B.

2385
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:14,469
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition Group B)

2386
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:15,529
Baek Sang Ha.

2387
01:32:16,439 --> 01:32:17,439
Kim Min Seok?

2388
01:32:18,739 --> 01:32:19,770
Kim Si Won?

2389
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,578
His hair alone already looks like a painting.

2390
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,209
(Shiny)

2391
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:26,079
Only Si Won stood out.

2392
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:29,949
He's that famous, and he's talented.

2393
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:31,979
I've seen a lot of his videos.

2394
01:32:32,819 --> 01:32:34,520
- He's here. - I can't wait.

2395
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,659
You can already see it from the way he's standing.

2396
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:38,989
(Focused)

2397
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,029
I think it's been about 15 years since I began dancing.

2398
01:32:41,529 --> 01:32:43,229
I've never stopped dancing.

2399
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,028
(Kim Si Won spent half of his life dancing.)

2400
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:47,800
I feel as confident as the time I've spent dancing.

2401
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:50,669
And Kim Jong Cheol.

2402
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:52,369
(Dancer Kim Jong Cheol)

2403
01:32:53,069 --> 01:32:55,409
I'm looking forward to watching Si Won and Jong Cheol.

2404
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,439
Jong Cheol.

2405
01:32:58,279 --> 01:33:00,810
I've heard that he's good.

2406
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,420
That just in a few years,

2407
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:05,350
he'll wipe the dance industry.

2408
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:07,988
When I joined five dance competitions,

2409
01:33:07,989 --> 01:33:10,460
I placed 1st 3 or 4 times.

2410
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,090
My strength is...

2411
01:33:12,189 --> 01:33:14,759
that my muscles are more developed...

2412
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,499
than other dancers.

2413
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,100
I look masculine.

2414
01:33:19,369 --> 01:33:21,299
But I think I'm good at...

2415
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,799
dancing something detailed...

2416
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,369
and soft.

2417
01:33:27,109 --> 01:33:29,209
- He's... - Kim Jong Cheol has flat feet.

2418
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:32,279
He shouldn't be good at dancing, but he is. It's amazing.

2419
01:33:32,409 --> 01:33:33,779
He's very talented.

2420
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:38,078
Because I was born with them,

2421
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:39,818
instead of giving excuses,

2422
01:33:39,819 --> 01:33:43,420
I made a lot of effort to break the prejudice...

2423
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,589
on my own.

2424
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:47,229
Si Won, I want to stay next to you.

2425
01:33:47,529 --> 01:33:48,590
(It's guaranteed to be fun.)

2426
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,029
You'll see.

2427
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,499
You'll see.

2428
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,569
(Grinning)

2429
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:56,398
I thought Jong Cheol was young.

2430
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:57,539
But he was rather passionate.

2431
01:33:58,069 --> 01:34:00,210
I should show my years of experience.

2432
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,078
Si Won isn't exactly...

2433
01:34:03,079 --> 01:34:06,010
good at techniques.

2434
01:34:06,909 --> 01:34:09,649
I can be in First Class.

2435
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,789
I'll make it in First Class.

2436
01:34:12,989 --> 01:34:15,050
I'm the best. I can do it.

2437
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,259
(Ballet Physical and Technique Audition Group B,)

2438
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,358
(Rounds 1 and 2 start.)

2439
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:19,460
Si Won is good.

2440
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:23,129
As he moves, he knows how to keep the angle of his body.

2441
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:24,198
(Exclaiming)

2442
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:26,130
I think I'm better.

2443
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:28,398
(Round 1 fixed technique, seonja: Expressing a flying butterfly)

2444
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:30,270
- Nice. - That was one neat seonja.

2445
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:32,469
Nice jaban.

2446
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:33,470
(He nailed it.)

2447
01:34:33,471 --> 01:34:35,309
- He modified it. - After jaban,

2448
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:37,679
he threw his arm in the air.

2449
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,579
I see that he tried to modify it.

2450
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,250
- Amazing. - Okay.

2451
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,379
Kim Jong Cheol is good at Korean dance moves,

2452
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,020
like keeping the angle of his fingertips and wrists.

2453
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:50,658
(Pulling it off softly)

2454
01:34:50,659 --> 01:34:51,720
I like the flow of his moves.

2455
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,390
(Flying)

2456
01:34:53,391 --> 01:34:54,459
(Look at him.)

2457
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:56,599
The way his body curves.

2458
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,500
It's very Korean. I love it.

2459
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,799
(On the other hand, Kim Min Seok made a mistake.)

2460
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,399
- He's struggling. - He doesn't know the order.

2461
01:35:04,039 --> 01:35:05,068
You're in Under.

2462
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:08,010
He's not using any techniques. That's a shame.

2463
01:35:08,609 --> 01:35:10,010
You've ranked Second.

2464
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,510
(The last round before joining First Class)

2465
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,880
Who's it going to be?

2466
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,090
Si Won and Jong Cheol? I can't predict it.

2467
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:22,460
I have a good chance...

2468
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,889
of winning.

2469
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:26,090
(Confident)

2470
01:35:26,289 --> 01:35:28,130
Jong Cheol is the youngest.

2471
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:30,130
He's good, but still,

2472
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:32,699
he's nothing compared to me.

2473
01:35:34,529 --> 01:35:35,839
(Look at Si Won.)

2474
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,100
He looks so cool.

2475
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:39,209
He looks like a painting.

2476
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:41,438
I can see that Kim Si Won has a lot of experience.

2477
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:42,439
His eyes look charismatic.

2478
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,979
Two, one. Go.

2479
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:48,179
(Kim Si Won goes first.)

2480
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,250
(Exclaiming)

2481
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:52,589
Si Won is rather tough...

2482
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,520
than soft.

2483
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,520
He made me go, "What's he doing?"

2484
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:01,489
I have to show that I'm good at spinning.

2485
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,029
- Amazing. - Dynamic.

2486
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:07,469
That was the best jaban.

2487
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,470
(Neat)

2488
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:10,300
He's good.

2489
01:36:10,539 --> 01:36:12,909
He's dynamic, and he makes smooth connections.

2490
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:14,510
(Impressed)

2491
01:36:14,909 --> 01:36:16,479
I shouldn't make a mistake until the end.

2492
01:36:17,979 --> 01:36:19,010
Until the end.

2493
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:20,879
(Exclaiming)

2494
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,479
- He's good. - I've shown them my strength.

2495
01:36:24,279 --> 01:36:26,720
I'll take First Class.

2496
01:36:27,189 --> 01:36:28,250
Do it if you can.

2497
01:36:28,989 --> 01:36:29,989
Jong Cheol, do better.

2498
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,920
Do everything you can.

2499
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,500
(Exclaiming)

2500
01:36:36,529 --> 01:36:37,529
(Oh, my gosh!)

2501
01:36:39,229 --> 01:36:40,970
Gosh.

2502
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:42,800
Look at him. He's doing the whole jump.

2503
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:45,869
It's a very difficult move, and he's good at it.

2504
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:48,470
I think he was waiting for enough space.

2505
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:49,608
He's got nice techniques.

2506
01:36:49,609 --> 01:36:52,210
I like the energy in his dance.

2507
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,350
He has nice arms.

2508
01:36:55,479 --> 01:36:56,720
Gosh.

2509
01:36:57,449 --> 01:36:58,479
(Amazing)

2510
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,618
Oh, what is that?

2511
01:37:01,619 --> 01:37:02,789
- A helicopter. - Gosh.

2512
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,130
Interesting.

2513
01:37:07,729 --> 01:37:09,760
He has very nice breathing.

2514
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:11,760
One. Stop.

2515
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:13,930
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2516
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:16,769
I think I showed...

2517
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:18,038
everything I could.

2518
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:20,569
- He's good. - They're both good.

2519
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:23,139
- What's your opinion? - They're neck-and-neck.

2520
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,140
- Right? - Yes.

2521
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:25,608
He's good.

2522
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:27,250
I have a chance. I'm taking it.

2523
01:37:27,409 --> 01:37:28,949
But he can't compete against me yet.

2524
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:30,350
(1-on-1 Improvised Technique starts.)

2525
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:33,720
What's he doing?

2526
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:36,159
Gosh.

2527
01:37:37,289 --> 01:37:38,289
Nice.

2528
01:37:38,359 --> 01:37:39,359
Gosh.

2529
01:37:39,659 --> 01:37:42,029
Kim Si Won captured our attention.

2530
01:37:42,729 --> 01:37:43,729
Beat me if you can.

2531
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:45,300
(Satisfied)

2532
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:48,100
This is bad. I need to draw their attention.

2533
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,470
I won't let you do that.

2534
01:37:56,439 --> 01:37:59,380
- I won't be seen. - Come forward and dance.

2535
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:01,609
I'll show you that experience makes you different.

2536
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:04,850
He has very long and nice arms.

2537
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:06,949
I need to move forward no matter what.

2538
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:09,689
(Sliding)

2539
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:11,920
Come forward.

2540
01:38:12,989 --> 01:38:16,430
Three, two, one. Stop.

2541
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:18,359
Stop.

2542
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:19,770
He should've endured it.

2543
01:38:20,069 --> 01:38:21,170
(What a shame.)

2544
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,399
I was drained at the end.

2545
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:25,739
It was a bummer.

2546
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:27,408
One. Stop.

2547
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:28,770
Gosh.

2548
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:30,340
Good job, Si Won.

2549
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:34,408
- Who's going to be First? - It won't be easy to decide.

2550
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:35,750
Kim Si Won can control the dynamics...

2551
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:38,978
when connecting the moves.

2552
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:40,849
There's something fresh about him.

2553
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:43,489
So he feels new and exciting to me.

2554
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:45,719
It could be Jong Cheol.

2555
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,028
They were about the same when they were dancing separately,

2556
01:38:47,029 --> 01:38:48,089
but he has more experience.

2557
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,460
He knew how to steal the attention in the end.

2558
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,500
Thank you, dancers.

2559
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:54,568
One of you will become First,

2560
01:38:54,569 --> 01:38:56,600
and the other, Second.

2561
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,709
I felt both of you were very dynamic,

2562
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:02,009
but there were differences...

2563
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,778
variety, and quality,

2564
01:39:03,779 --> 01:39:05,279
which I really appreciated.

2565
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:09,720
I saw Jong Cheol's dance when he was dancing second.

2566
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:14,289
I agreed that he was good.

2567
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:16,420
So I was a little anxious.

2568
01:39:20,829 --> 01:39:23,930
Si Won and I kept running into each other.

2569
01:39:24,029 --> 01:39:25,929
That made me confused.

2570
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:27,199
That was a bummer.

2571
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:30,739
Who will take First Class?

2572
01:39:30,939 --> 01:39:32,439
(Intrigued)

2573
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:34,568
Kim Si Won...

2574
01:39:34,569 --> 01:39:36,380
and Kim Jong Cheol.

2575
01:39:36,579 --> 01:39:38,409
Between the 2, 1st Class goes to...

2576
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:39,779
Who's it going to be?

2577
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:41,609
(Who will take First Class in Korean Dance Group B?)

2578
01:39:43,319 --> 01:39:46,090
Honestly, whoever it is, it's a great decision.

2579
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:50,890
It's Kim Si Won. Congratulations.

2580
01:39:51,189 --> 01:39:53,729
(Kim Si Won takes First Class in Korean Dance Group B.)

2581
01:39:54,329 --> 01:39:56,560
(Congratulations.)

2582
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,630
(Bummed out)

2583
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:04,169
- Congratulations. You ranked First. - Thank you.

2584
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:06,739
- Congratulations. It was fabulous. - Thank you.

2585
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:10,509
I find him very charming.

2586
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:12,179
He'll do even better.

2587
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,909
It breaks my heart.

2588
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:18,079
Just because I couldn't be in First Class,

2589
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:20,520
doesn't mean it's not over.

2590
01:40:20,789 --> 01:40:22,688
I have a place to go up to.

2591
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:25,159
I should take over First Class now.

2592
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:27,659
Still, he can't compete against me.

2593
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:30,229
And next, we have Group E.

2594
01:40:31,159 --> 01:40:32,260
Guys, a big one is coming.

2595
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:36,670
The time has come.

2596
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,739
This is so tough.

2597
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:40,339
Gosh.

2598
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:43,078
I thought Group E was...

2599
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,509
the toughest competition.

2600
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:47,180
That is a group of death.

2601
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,520
I'm dying to see it.

2602
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:52,819
They're all well-known dancers.

2603
01:40:52,989 --> 01:40:55,489
Choi Ho Jong is from the National Dance Company of Korea.

2604
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:56,720
He played the main role.

2605
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,829
His hashtag said, "Korean dance legend."

2606
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:02,229
Legend. Number one in Korea.

2607
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,198
No one denies it.

2608
01:41:04,199 --> 01:41:06,198
He's the dancer among dancers.

2609
01:41:06,199 --> 01:41:09,500
Choi Ho Jong is the reason I started dancing.

2610
01:41:09,699 --> 01:41:11,898
He's probably the dream...

2611
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:13,969
of numerous male Korean dance students.

2612
01:41:13,970 --> 01:41:16,340
- He's the legend. - He's the deity of dancers.

2613
01:41:16,439 --> 01:41:18,739
I think he's top-class.

2614
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:20,608
Ki Moo Gan is...

2615
01:41:20,609 --> 01:41:23,578
good at competitions and choreographies.

2616
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:25,478
Should I say he's an elite?

2617
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:29,188
He was known as the urban legend at school.

2618
01:41:29,189 --> 01:41:31,158
People who saw his dance said...

2619
01:41:31,159 --> 01:41:33,430
his back muscles wiggled.

2620
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:35,728
He's one of a kind.

2621
01:41:35,729 --> 01:41:37,060
He's shocking.

2622
01:41:37,229 --> 01:41:39,529
He's unique.

2623
01:41:39,699 --> 01:41:42,000
No one's more unique than him in the dance industry.

2624
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,738
It'll be worth watching...

2625
01:41:44,739 --> 01:41:46,368
if Ki Moo Gan and Choi Ho Jong compete.

2626
01:41:46,369 --> 01:41:47,608
(Everyone looks forward to Ki Moo Gan and Choi Ho Jong's match.)

2627
01:41:47,609 --> 01:41:49,939
I thought it was going to be fun.

2628
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:52,339
I've joined a competition...

2629
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:54,880
with Moo Gan before.

2630
01:41:54,979 --> 01:41:58,249
When I watched Moo Gan's performance,

2631
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:01,020
I thought it was unique and distinct.

2632
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:03,059
When people talk about Ho Jong,

2633
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,719
I always say...

2634
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,089
that he's so perfect...

2635
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:08,289
that I'm not worried about anything he does.

2636
01:42:09,329 --> 01:42:12,358
I believe his charisma comes from...

2637
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:14,430
his physique and appearance.

2638
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:20,409
I thought Moo Gan would be in First Class.

2639
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:24,710
I'm only worried about one person.

2640
01:42:24,979 --> 01:42:25,979
Ho Jong.

2641
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,509
I can't help but worry about him.

2642
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:29,478
It's the years of experience.

2643
01:42:29,479 --> 01:42:30,978
He has more experience.

2644
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,779
That will make a clear difference.

2645
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:35,148
He can never beat me.

2646
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,420
It'll be fun...

2647
01:42:38,789 --> 01:42:40,059
for the audience.

2648
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,129
If Choi Ho Jong and Ki Moo Gan are competing...

2649
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:44,000
from the start,

2650
01:42:45,229 --> 01:42:46,470
it'll sound intriguing.

2651
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:47,770
This is going to be fun.

2652
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:49,399
I can't wait to watch it.

2653
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,340
Who will get to First Class?

2654
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,769
Five, four,

2655
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:58,510
three, two, one. Go.

2656
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:01,810
Ho Jong's moves are laid-back.

2657
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:03,749
Ho Jong is good.

2658
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,078
He's disciplined.

2659
01:43:05,079 --> 01:43:06,148
(Choi Ho Jong puts on neat and disciplined techniques.)

2660
01:43:06,149 --> 01:43:08,519
(Round 1 fixed technique, gainer: Jump with one leg and turn 360°)

2661
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,319
That was a perfect gainer.

2662
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:11,988
He has good basic skills.

2663
01:43:11,989 --> 01:43:13,629
I can see his years of experience.

2664
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:15,429
Kim Min Su can't do double steps.

2665
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:16,859
He can't do double steps at all.

2666
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:19,800
- He can't keep his knees straight. - No.

2667
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:23,170
- You're in Under. - Thank you.

2668
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:26,269
(The 3 get ready for Round 2.)

2669
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:27,509
(Watching carefully)

2670
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,978
I've never seen him before.

2671
01:43:29,979 --> 01:43:30,979
He's young.

2672
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,009
(22 years old)

2673
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:33,279
Jun Woo must be nervous.

2674
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:35,709
Jun Woo was in a group...

2675
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,050
that was expected to be intense.

2676
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,890
I felt bad for Park Jun Woo.

2677
01:43:40,119 --> 01:43:42,488
He was competing against two top dancers.

2678
01:43:42,489 --> 01:43:45,259
There were Moo Gan and Ho Jong.

2679
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:47,289
I'm in trouble.

2680
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:48,688
This is the group of death.

2681
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:51,659
(Park Jun Woo and Choi Jong Ho's match was decided from the start.)

2682
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,130
(What now?)

2683
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:56,398
(I'd rather not see it.)

2684
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:59,139
When it was just Ho Jong at first,

2685
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,210
I felt rather relieved.

2686
01:44:01,539 --> 01:44:03,379
- Why? - I don't need to worry...

2687
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,408
about anyone else.

2688
01:44:04,409 --> 01:44:06,609
No matter who it is?

2689
01:44:06,979 --> 01:44:10,149
I was thinking, "Okay. I'll go for Second Class."

2690
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,749
(After Choi Ho Jong,)

2691
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,389
(Ki Moo Gan was added.)

2692
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:16,559
- What am I going to do? - What?

2693
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,559
Oh, he's in your team.

2694
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,429
When Moo Gan joined too, I knew I was in trouble.

2695
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:22,788
There were two monsters.

2696
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:23,829
(Two monsters)

2697
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:26,729
I really have to clench my teeth and do it.

2698
01:44:27,699 --> 01:44:29,899
Even though I'm in the group of death,

2699
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,310
I should still get something out of it.

2700
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:36,840
I shouldn't be discouraged. I'll do my best to prove myself.

2701
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:39,109
Because...

2702
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:41,079
I have nothing to lose.

2703
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:45,879
It's a rare chance to dance...

2704
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,550
with wonderful dancers.

2705
01:44:47,789 --> 01:44:49,619
I'm going to do my very best.

2706
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,359
Oh, I can't wait.

2707
01:44:54,989 --> 01:44:56,188
(Round 2: Modified Technique Combination)

2708
01:44:56,189 --> 01:44:58,198
Five, four,

2709
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:01,799
three, two, one. Go.

2710
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,000
Ho Jong, show me what you've got.

2711
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,300
They're different.

2712
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:10,109
Their moves are clearly laid-back.

2713
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:15,550
Nice.

2714
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:18,020
I need to show them.

2715
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:20,549
- Oh, no. - Be careful.

2716
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:21,750
Oh, no.

2717
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:24,688
He made a mistake.

2718
01:45:24,689 --> 01:45:26,158
Gosh, it's not working.

2719
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:27,560
What's wrong with me? Calm down.

2720
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:30,930
- He looks... - He looks dull, right?

2721
01:45:31,859 --> 01:45:33,028
Oh, no.

2722
01:45:33,029 --> 01:45:34,099
(He keeps making mistakes.)

2723
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,670
Moo Gan is flustered.

2724
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:39,000
He can't show his skills.

2725
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:41,340
I shouldn't let him influence me.

2726
01:45:47,409 --> 01:45:49,149
Look at him. He's doing a whole jump.

2727
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:51,279
He puts on techniques so easily.

2728
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:52,680
He's very good.

2729
01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:54,019
Gosh.

2730
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,789
How can he dance like that?

2731
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:57,189
Oh, what?

2732
01:46:01,189 --> 01:46:02,728
Jun Woo is doing better than expected.

2733
01:46:02,729 --> 01:46:04,199
He's pretty good.

2734
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:06,969
It's time to show my skills.

2735
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:08,329
Let me show them my lethal move.

2736
01:46:09,699 --> 01:46:11,140
(Grabbing attention)

2737
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,210
- What was that? - Park Jun Woo is good.

2738
01:46:15,739 --> 01:46:17,439
I love that move.

2739
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:19,479
You got it.

2740
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,278
I find Park Jun Woo better.

2741
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:22,778
I agree with you.

2742
01:46:22,779 --> 01:46:26,489
Two, one. Stop.

2743
01:46:26,819 --> 01:46:27,890
Stop.

2744
01:46:32,789 --> 01:46:34,590
- Jun Woo was good. - Yes, he was good.

2745
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,260
Jun Woo was not bad.

2746
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:38,060
Jun Woo was pretty good.

2747
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:40,699
That was a new discovery.

2748
01:46:42,069 --> 01:46:43,899
I think I did a pretty good job.

2749
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,099
Wait.

2750
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,238
I might have a chance.

2751
01:46:47,239 --> 01:46:48,509
(Who will be the 1st dancer to be 2nd in Group E?)

2752
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:50,140
Second Class goes to...

2753
01:46:51,609 --> 01:46:53,210
I couldn't keep my head up.

2754
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:56,279
Unfortunately, you've ranked Second.

2755
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,179
Please leave the floor. Thank you.

2756
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,850
Second Class goes to Ki Moo Gan. Thank you.

2757
01:47:02,449 --> 01:47:04,590
- He was flustered. - He was flustered.

2758
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:07,259
He couldn't show what he's got.

2759
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,329
I know. That was a bummer.

2760
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:10,429
Moo Gan is in Second.

2761
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:11,759
It was a bummer.

2762
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,770
I know he could do better than that.

2763
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,039
It hurt my pride big time.

2764
01:47:18,199 --> 01:47:22,239
All those people thought I was matchless.

2765
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:26,510
They'd be like, "What? What was that?"

2766
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:29,380
I need to redeem myself soon.

2767
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:31,979
I'll be in First Class next time.

2768
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:34,590
This doesn't suit me.

2769
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:39,858
(First Class candidates are Choi Ho Jong and Park Jun Woo.)

2770
01:47:39,859 --> 01:47:41,359
Gosh, Jun Woo.

2771
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:43,500
He's competing against Choi Ho Jong.

2772
01:47:43,899 --> 01:47:46,828
It's youth versus experience.

2773
01:47:46,829 --> 01:47:47,829
Right.

2774
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,599
When I got to compete 1-on-1 with him,

2775
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,899
I was surprised.

2776
01:47:53,539 --> 01:47:55,310
I can't believe Park Jun Woo made it.

2777
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:58,210
Now that this has happened, Jun Woo should win.

2778
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,049
Now that I've made it,

2779
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:01,409
I should do my best to win.

2780
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:06,119
Four, three, two, one. Go.

2781
01:48:06,449 --> 01:48:07,489
Jun Woo, show them.

2782
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,649
- Yes! - Good job.

2783
01:48:10,989 --> 01:48:12,060
(Surprised)

2784
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:14,729
He's swift.

2785
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:16,188
It was interesting.

2786
01:48:16,189 --> 01:48:18,399
I didn't expect him to move like that.

2787
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:21,629
You got it.

2788
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:22,729
Good job.

2789
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:24,999
He has long arms.

2790
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,010
(He's good at using the dance floor.)

2791
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:28,239
He's good.

2792
01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:31,340
If you're a dancer, you should dance with your breath.

2793
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:36,249
- Cool. - Good job.

2794
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:37,948
- Nice. - Three, two...

2795
01:48:37,949 --> 01:48:39,920
- That's neat. - Five, four...

2796
01:48:39,949 --> 01:48:42,289
He's doing a very neat Korean dance.

2797
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:44,289
- Go. - Good job.

2798
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:46,289
He doesn't forget to look forward.

2799
01:48:46,689 --> 01:48:47,729
Nice.

2800
01:48:48,229 --> 01:48:50,560
I wasn't discouraged until the end.

2801
01:48:50,829 --> 01:48:52,159
How will Ho Jong do?

2802
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:56,328
Despite the competition,

2803
01:48:56,329 --> 01:48:59,270
I should maintain my rhythm.

2804
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,738
(Choi Ho Jong goes 2nd in Round 3,)

2805
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:03,039
(the 1-on-1 Improvised Technique.)

2806
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,750
He's clearly laid-back.

2807
01:49:06,909 --> 01:49:07,948
He's different.

2808
01:49:07,949 --> 01:49:09,009
Beautiful.

2809
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:10,479
His sentiment is different.

2810
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:12,220
He's different.

2811
01:49:12,779 --> 01:49:13,850
That's crazy.

2812
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:17,659
(Choi Ho Jong moves to the corner smoothly.)

2813
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:20,760
Why is he moving to the corner?

2814
01:49:21,189 --> 01:49:22,260
No way.

2815
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,500
(Shocked)

2816
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:30,300
(Everyone cheers.)

2817
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:32,439
Oh, no.

2818
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:33,869
What? Oh, no.

2819
01:49:34,869 --> 01:49:35,939
Is he hurt?

2820
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:37,340
Is he okay?

2821
01:49:37,779 --> 01:49:40,779
I wasn't afraid of jumping.

2822
01:49:41,609 --> 01:49:43,449
Then, I was flustered.

2823
01:49:43,649 --> 01:49:45,020
This is too dangerous.

2824
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:47,489
If I land like this...

2825
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:51,520
What? Oh, no.

2826
01:49:51,819 --> 01:49:53,590
I changed the direction.

2827
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:58,198
I tried changing to the next move,

2828
01:49:58,199 --> 01:50:00,299
but as you saw, it was too obvious.

2829
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:01,300
Stop.

2830
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:02,800
The end.

2831
01:50:02,801 --> 01:50:04,499
(Choi Ho Jong ended up with a mistake at the end.)

2832
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:05,868
(I can't believe it.)

2833
01:50:05,869 --> 01:50:07,109
Ho Jong made a mistake?

2834
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,770
Maybe Jun Woo...

2835
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:12,309
Park Jun Woo...

2836
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:15,350
- He's good. - did better than expected.

2837
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,020
He went beyond expectations.

2838
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:20,489
When I saw him falling,

2839
01:50:21,149 --> 01:50:22,819
I thought I might have a chance.

2840
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,960
I should give my all when we're competing 1-on-1.

2841
01:50:28,229 --> 01:50:31,699
That's when I became relaxed.

2842
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:34,368
This will be worth watching.

2843
01:50:34,369 --> 01:50:35,828
(They both start the 1-on-1 Improvised Technique.)

2844
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:39,569
Three, two, one. Go.

2845
01:50:39,939 --> 01:50:42,969
(Who will be in 1st Class between the 2?)

2846
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,140
(They both start the 1-on-1 Improvised Technique.)

2847
01:50:45,739 --> 01:50:49,510
Three, two, one. Go.

2848
01:50:53,619 --> 01:50:55,590
I should show my energy.

2849
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:57,859
(Park Jun Woo begins using the floor with enthusiasm.)

2850
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:02,460
I wanted to show them how relaxed I was.

2851
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:04,600
He's amazing.

2852
01:51:04,829 --> 01:51:06,659
- So articulate. - How calm.

2853
01:51:07,529 --> 01:51:09,529
His details are great.

2854
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:12,439
- Oh, my. - He surely is different.

2855
01:51:12,569 --> 01:51:13,840
That's crazy.

2856
01:51:14,939 --> 01:51:16,140
Pushing and pulling.

2857
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,608
Even if I was improvising,

2858
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:23,310
it was still a Physical and Technique Audition.

2859
01:51:25,949 --> 01:51:27,949
I had to leave a strong impression.

2860
01:51:29,649 --> 01:51:30,689
What was that?

2861
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:34,359
He's got the spirit.

2862
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:38,500
- Nice. - These two members are great.

2863
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,629
Three, two...

2864
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:41,630
(Excellent.)

2865
01:51:41,631 --> 01:51:43,939
Three, two, one.

2866
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,300
- Stop. - That was cool.

2867
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:47,609
Stop.

2868
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:50,640
- Jun Woo did well. - Both were awesome.

2869
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:52,639
(Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

2870
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,210
(Group E, Round 3 ends)

2871
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:56,778
(Acknowledging them)

2872
01:51:56,779 --> 01:51:57,779
Ho Jong the Great.

2873
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:00,149
Jun Woo put up a good fight.

2874
01:52:00,649 --> 01:52:01,890
He gave it his all.

2875
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,289
Great job, dancers.

2876
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:08,288
One of you will become First Class,

2877
01:52:08,289 --> 01:52:10,100
and the other will become Second Class.

2878
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:14,169
Park Jun Woo was very novel.

2879
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:15,398
(It was novel.)

2880
01:52:15,399 --> 01:52:19,068
The Korean vibe and lines were beautiful.

2881
01:52:19,069 --> 01:52:23,439
We could see great potential in you.

2882
01:52:23,579 --> 01:52:25,039
Jun Woo. Good job.

2883
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:27,850
And Choi Ho Jong.

2884
01:52:27,979 --> 01:52:31,149
You felt like a sharp knife...

2885
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,818
or like a sword.

2886
01:52:33,819 --> 01:52:38,818
You had a very strong foundation.

2887
01:52:38,819 --> 01:52:40,590
Watching you two...

2888
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:43,429
was like black and white.

2889
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:45,198
(Black Ho Jong, White Jun Woo)

2890
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:46,299
(Choi Ho Jong is tanned while Park Jun Woo is pale.)

2891
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,300
You're right about that.

2892
01:52:47,301 --> 01:52:48,328
(I want to see too.)

2893
01:52:48,329 --> 01:52:49,829
- "Black and white?" - "Black and white."

2894
01:52:50,170 --> 01:52:51,869
- They are black and white stones. - Exactly.

2895
01:52:52,369 --> 01:52:54,210
I really enjoyed your performances.

2896
01:52:54,439 --> 01:52:55,810
Thank you.

2897
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:58,640
I was surprised by Park Jun Woo.

2898
01:52:59,239 --> 01:53:02,310
In the 1-on-1 battle, you stepped up.

2899
01:53:02,979 --> 01:53:04,948
(Including fancy techniques,)

2900
01:53:04,949 --> 01:53:07,319
(Park Jun Woo showed off all of his skills.)

2901
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:08,989
That amazed me.

2902
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:12,419
Because the judges kept complimenting him,

2903
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:13,590
I couldn't help but get bothered.

2904
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:17,500
At this rate, I could become First Class.

2905
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:20,299
I will announce the result.

2906
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:22,869
Park Jun Woo and Choi Ho Jong.

2907
01:53:23,369 --> 01:53:25,140
The one to get to First Class is...

2908
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:27,538
It should be me.

2909
01:53:27,539 --> 01:53:29,340
That was only natural.

2910
01:53:30,409 --> 01:53:32,579
I had the feeling I could beat him.

2911
01:53:34,579 --> 01:53:35,680
The First Class is...

2912
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,549
Choi Ho Jong. Congratulations.

2913
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:40,318
(First Class of Group E, Choi Ho Jong)

2914
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:42,350
(Showing gratitude with his hands together)

2915
01:53:42,689 --> 01:53:43,989
(Congratulations.)

2916
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:45,720
- The king is back. - It has to be Ho Jong.

2917
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:48,289
Jun Woo did well. But Ho Jong is First Class.

2918
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:49,590
Ho Jong is unbeatable.

2919
01:53:50,029 --> 01:53:51,930
Jun Woo lost but fought well.

2920
01:53:52,829 --> 01:53:54,470
You've ranked First Class,

2921
01:53:55,029 --> 01:53:57,039
which is the highest. Congratulations.

2922
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:58,369
Thank you.

2923
01:53:58,899 --> 01:54:00,239
It's a shame, but you did great.

2924
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,539
You're Second Class. Good luck.

2925
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:03,909
Well done, Jun Woo.

2926
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:06,079
Great work.

2927
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:10,379
Park Jun Woo will become big in the future.

2928
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:13,648
Jun Woo was a good competitor.

2929
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:15,850
Ho Jong would've been shocked.

2930
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:19,288
I saw him for the first time and was very surprised.

2931
01:54:19,289 --> 01:54:20,630
Jun Woo. Good job.

2932
01:54:20,989 --> 01:54:22,130
Great job, Jun Woo.

2933
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:23,760
You were cool.

2934
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:25,198
(Sticking)

2935
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:27,328
I became Second Class as hoped.

2936
01:54:27,329 --> 01:54:28,368
(A smile of relief)

2937
01:54:28,369 --> 01:54:31,539
As much as I put in my everything, I'm proud of myself.

2938
01:54:32,239 --> 01:54:33,970
It's finally my turn.

2939
01:54:35,409 --> 01:54:36,439
First Class.

2940
01:54:36,979 --> 01:54:39,310
(Feeling great)

2941
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:41,909
Ballet Physical and Technique Audition.

2942
01:54:42,279 --> 01:54:43,349
(Sighing)

2943
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:44,380
They must be nervous.

2944
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:46,350
Group B.

2945
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:48,119
Kim Tae Seok.

2946
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:49,850
Jeon Tae Hu.

2947
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:51,419
(Ballerino Jeon Tae Hu)

2948
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:52,488
And An Si On.

2949
01:54:52,489 --> 01:54:54,060
(Ballerino An Si On)

2950
01:54:55,590 --> 01:54:58,000
In this group, the youngest...

2951
01:54:58,529 --> 01:55:01,500
and the oldest ballerinos will compete.

2952
01:55:01,869 --> 01:55:03,568
(This will be interesting.)

2953
01:55:03,569 --> 01:55:06,000
I feel the pressure because he's super young.

2954
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:08,310
We are 15 years apart.

2955
01:55:08,739 --> 01:55:10,479
He's the youngest, 19 years old.

2956
01:55:10,739 --> 01:55:13,238
Being young isn't to be looked down upon.

2957
01:55:13,239 --> 01:55:14,779
His body was very light.

2958
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:17,578
I'm confident in jumping.

2959
01:55:17,579 --> 01:55:18,880
I want to jump.

2960
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:20,489
(Bothered)

2961
01:55:20,819 --> 01:55:22,849
(Jumping again...)

2962
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:23,858
(and again)

2963
01:55:23,859 --> 01:55:25,419
He jumped very lightly.

2964
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:27,060
I couldn't help but stare at him.

2965
01:55:27,229 --> 01:55:29,789
I was bringing my spirits up.

2966
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:31,430
Tae Seok.

2967
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:32,858
(Kim Tae Seok does a pirouette at the center.)

2968
01:55:32,859 --> 01:55:34,800
I hate losing.

2969
01:55:35,529 --> 01:55:36,898
From what I know, Ballerino Kim Tae Seok...

2970
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:39,139
is in the Korean National Ballet.

2971
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:40,568
He has a good physique...

2972
01:55:40,569 --> 01:55:43,310
and can jump really well.

2973
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:45,438
Being able to do mostly all the moves,

2974
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:47,109
I have confidence.

2975
01:55:47,710 --> 01:55:49,309
I came on this show to win.

2976
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:51,220
All I had in mind was being First Class.

2977
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:53,789
I must become First Class, period.

2978
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:55,589
Let's take our first positions, please.

2979
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:58,560
How Tae Seok is standing is very prince-like.

2980
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,090
He looks relaxed.

2981
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,859
I'm curious as to how this group will turn out.

2982
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:04,359
Music,

2983
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,269
- start. - Cabriole.

2984
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:10,469
(Cabriole)

2985
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:12,840
The double cabriole was nice, and so was his head.

2986
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,310
You can see he's enjoying it.

2987
01:56:14,409 --> 01:56:15,409
(Amazed)

2988
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:18,009
(Pas couru jete)

2989
01:56:18,010 --> 01:56:19,109
His jumps are high.

2990
01:56:19,239 --> 01:56:20,578
It's very light.

2991
01:56:20,579 --> 01:56:21,579
Ciseaux.

2992
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:22,649
(Stunned)

2993
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:26,350
(Jeon Tae Hu excels at the ciseaux.)

2994
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:28,119
Being young is the best.

2995
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:30,318
(Group B wraps up without any mistake.)

2996
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:31,390
It's great.

2997
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:35,889
The Second Class is Ballerino An Si On.

2998
01:56:35,890 --> 01:56:38,698
He should've spun in a standardized position.

2999
01:56:38,699 --> 01:56:40,229
But his shoulders wouldn't stay down.

3000
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:41,929
The turn-out is the norm.

3001
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:43,529
But his feet on the ground would curve.

3002
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,640
(Second Class of Ballet Group B, An Si On)

3003
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,270
Round Three...

3004
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:51,010
will start with Ballerino Kim Tae Seok.

3005
01:56:51,609 --> 01:56:52,639
Good luck.

3006
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:54,550
It's a match between a veteran and a newbie.

3007
01:56:54,909 --> 01:56:57,118
Though I was granted Round Three,

3008
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:59,679
I was full of worries.

3009
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:01,448
I was already out of energy,

3010
01:57:01,449 --> 01:57:03,149
but Tae Hu was still going strong.

3011
01:57:03,689 --> 01:57:05,189
This one's tough.

3012
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:08,460
Even if I'm tired, let's show what a pro is like.

3013
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,629
(Smiling)

3014
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:12,929
- Look at his smile. - Five,

3015
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:14,029
- four, - Here's the prince.

3016
01:57:14,329 --> 01:57:16,228
- three, two, - I imagined it as a performance...

3017
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:17,999
- one. Go. - and kept smiling.

3018
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,368
(Round 3 Fixed Technique)

3019
01:57:19,369 --> 01:57:21,739
(1st tour en l'air)

3020
01:57:21,939 --> 01:57:23,238
That was clean.

3021
01:57:23,239 --> 01:57:25,408
He's good. I should do it like him.

3022
01:57:25,409 --> 01:57:28,049
(2nd tour en l'air)

3023
01:57:28,050 --> 01:57:29,050
(Slipping)

3024
01:57:29,051 --> 01:57:30,449
(Feeling bad)

3025
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,948
Because the leg he landed on, the left leg, wasn't stable,

3026
01:57:34,949 --> 01:57:36,489
it bounced back.

3027
01:57:36,689 --> 01:57:38,720
I thought I could fight for First Class.

3028
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:40,288
It's too early.

3029
01:57:40,289 --> 01:57:42,060
(3rd tour en l'air)

3030
01:57:42,289 --> 01:57:44,600
- Nice. - That was really clean.

3031
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,129
Here comes the manege.

3032
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:48,698
(Manege)

3033
01:57:48,699 --> 01:57:49,729
- I love it. - Okay.

3034
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,739
He jumps really well.

3035
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:54,710
His moves are energetic.

3036
01:57:55,439 --> 01:57:58,978
His manege, the way he stretches his left arm out to the direction...

3037
01:57:58,979 --> 01:58:00,609
he's heading, is on point.

3038
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:03,779
As expected from a pro, he was good.

3039
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:07,519
I'm the prince and the coolest person here.

3040
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,889
I wanted to show them my specialty.

3041
01:58:09,890 --> 01:58:11,618
(All eyes are on him.)

3042
01:58:11,619 --> 01:58:12,688
(Astonished)

3043
01:58:12,689 --> 01:58:14,430
Double saut de basque.

3044
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:17,228
(Kim Tae Seok finishes with double saut de basque.)

3045
01:58:17,229 --> 01:58:18,229
(In awe)

3046
01:58:18,230 --> 01:58:19,829
(That was perfect.)

3047
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,698
Three, two, one.

3048
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:23,799
Even saut de basque.

3049
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,499
(Even a double saut de basque!)

3050
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,539
Wait.

3051
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:29,270
(I'm the prince of this place!)

3052
01:58:29,810 --> 01:58:30,938
He's different.

3053
01:58:30,939 --> 01:58:32,680
Yes, for sure.

3054
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:34,350
This is what you call experience, Tae Hu.

3055
01:58:35,050 --> 01:58:37,010
Only when Tae Hu takes a note...

3056
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:40,319
and brings something now, he has the opportunity.

3057
01:58:41,449 --> 01:58:44,618
I was worried but determined to put on a clean performance.

3058
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:46,489
(Jeon Tae Hu starts.)

3059
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:50,599
(1st tour en l'air)

3060
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,699
(He's good.)

3061
01:58:52,130 --> 01:58:54,369
He jumped up straight.

3062
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:55,930
The youngest is light.

3063
01:58:56,470 --> 01:58:57,999
(2nd tour en l'air)

3064
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
That was nice.

3065
01:58:59,399 --> 01:59:00,470
He's strong.

3066
01:59:00,909 --> 01:59:01,939
Tae Hu jumped really well.

3067
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:03,979
His cartilage must be soft.

3068
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:05,879
This is fun.

3069
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,849
(3rd tour en l'air)

3070
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:10,819
It's truly a nip-and-tuck match.

3071
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:15,220
I got nervous, thinking I could lose to him.

3072
01:59:15,689 --> 01:59:17,358
Even his tour en l'air was nice.

3073
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:18,459
Let's look at his manege.

3074
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:21,789
(Manege)

3075
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:23,459
(Disappointed)

3076
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:24,930
Jump low but far.

3077
01:59:26,199 --> 01:59:29,429
Jumping low, not high, and far...

3078
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:31,239
would be more practical for Tae Hu.

3079
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,399
My manege was definitely better.

3080
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,809
(Jeon Tae Hu continues his manege without a mistake.)

3081
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:38,710
I had to ace the last tour en l'air.

3082
01:59:38,979 --> 01:59:41,510
Two, one. Stop.

3083
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:43,279
That's his weak move.

3084
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,818
It was just 1.5 turns.

3085
01:59:45,819 --> 01:59:47,749
(Jeon Tae Hu landed with a missing turn.)

3086
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:49,288
(Bummed out)

3087
01:59:49,289 --> 01:59:52,119
These two have completely different charms.

3088
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:53,818
This is difficult.

3089
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:55,158
(It's hard to decide.)

3090
01:59:55,159 --> 01:59:57,500
We'll know for sure here.

3091
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:00,569
Let's make it up with the grand pirouette.

3092
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:02,500
I can do it.

3093
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:04,869
I'm First Class if I don't make any mistakes.

3094
02:00:05,670 --> 02:00:06,839
(Smiling again)

3095
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,109
(I like his smile.)

3096
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:11,238
- He's already performing. - I meant...

3097
02:00:11,239 --> 02:00:12,640
This is not a survival anymore.

3098
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:15,380
Don't mind him. Let's just focus on mine.

3099
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:16,850
Do your best.

3100
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:21,819
Five, four, three, two, one.

3101
02:00:22,449 --> 02:00:23,489
Go.

3102
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:27,590
(Amazed)

3103
02:00:27,989 --> 02:00:30,159
Nice. His legs are high up.

3104
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:32,199
How his body turns is great.

3105
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:34,300
Tae Hu isn't doing well.

3106
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:36,398
(Furrowing his brows)

3107
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:38,669
His legs moving up and down...

3108
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:41,310
affects the turn. It'll wear him down.

3109
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:43,739
I thought I could beat him.

3110
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:46,238
My legs were giving way.

3111
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:47,680
I gutted it out.

3112
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:49,278
Just a bit more.

3113
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:51,020
- This is "Physical: 100." - Totally.

3114
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:52,750
It's insane.

3115
02:00:53,479 --> 02:00:55,720
They're exhausted.

3116
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:57,789
You can do it. Keep going.

3117
02:00:59,159 --> 02:01:01,559
You can do it. Keep going.

3118
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,729
(He's great.)

3119
02:01:02,859 --> 02:01:04,499
(That's crazy!)

3120
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,000
To do that right now?

3121
02:01:06,829 --> 02:01:09,630
You never know, so let's last until the end.

3122
02:01:10,029 --> 02:01:13,600
I can't let the youngest become First Class.

3123
02:01:13,869 --> 02:01:15,369
(His deadly attitude)

3124
02:01:15,609 --> 02:01:17,209
(He's in another class.)

3125
02:01:17,210 --> 02:01:18,279
Even attitude?

3126
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:23,349
From grand pirouette to double a la seconde and attitude?

3127
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:24,920
That's a veteran.

3128
02:01:26,579 --> 02:01:29,649
Keep spinning. I simply pushed myself with determination.

3129
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:32,489
Just watching them hurts. Who made ballet?

3130
02:01:33,289 --> 02:01:34,489
(Staggering)

3131
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:35,859
Hold it.

3132
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:37,759
(Grunting)

3133
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:39,329
(Kim Tae Seok lasts until the 32 count.)

3134
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,600
Goodness.

3135
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:41,869
He's got incredible stamina.

3136
02:01:42,369 --> 02:01:44,500
He was giving it his all.

3137
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,100
(Kim Tae Seok is using up all of his energy.)

3138
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:48,770
(Group B's Physical and Technique Audition ends.)

3139
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:51,539
Such passion!

3140
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:54,810
- They were really cool. - That was impressive.

3141
02:01:55,649 --> 02:01:56,709
(Shocked)

3142
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:59,520
(Kim Tae Seok and Jeon Tae Hu showed an impressive match.)

3143
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:02,149
- They must be tired. - Of course.

3144
02:02:02,789 --> 02:02:04,359
I spun until the end,

3145
02:02:04,989 --> 02:02:07,560
but it wasn't satisfying.

3146
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:10,630
I'm proud of myself.

3147
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:12,560
(Kim Tae Seok praises himself.)

3148
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:15,970
Great job, you two.

3149
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:17,770
I will announce the result.

3150
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:19,970
I enjoyed this group very much.

3151
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:21,210
Jeon Tae Hu.

3152
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:24,909
I felt as if you needed more performance quality.

3153
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:26,309
I enjoyed you technically.

3154
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:29,278
But I feel that you have a lot more to work on for your artistry...

3155
02:02:29,279 --> 02:02:30,479
and for your artistic side.

3156
02:02:32,779 --> 02:02:36,148
Kim Tae Seok. I enjoyed your performance.

3157
02:02:36,149 --> 02:02:37,590
Anyone can pull off...

3158
02:02:37,890 --> 02:02:40,729
academic moves through training.

3159
02:02:41,229 --> 02:02:43,759
But a dancer enjoying ballet...

3160
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:45,858
with a smile on...

3161
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:48,130
and facially expressing what they feel...

3162
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:50,300
is very rare.

3163
02:02:50,739 --> 02:02:53,140
I thoroughly enjoyed your performance.

3164
02:02:53,369 --> 02:02:54,369
Thank you.

3165
02:02:54,370 --> 02:02:56,409
(The prince appreciates.)

3166
02:02:56,670 --> 02:02:58,109
(Who is First Class of Group B?)

3167
02:02:58,340 --> 02:03:00,180
Ballerino Jeon Tae Hu...

3168
02:03:00,979 --> 02:03:02,609
and Ballerino Kim Tae Seok.

3169
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:05,779
The First Class is...

3170
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,288
Ballerino Kim Tae Seok. Congratulations.

3171
02:03:09,289 --> 02:03:11,560
(First Class of Group B, Kim Tae Seok)

3172
02:03:11,659 --> 02:03:12,659
Thank you.

3173
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:15,159
(Jeon Tae Hu is bummed out but agrees.)

3174
02:03:15,289 --> 02:03:16,460
(Great job.)

3175
02:03:16,789 --> 02:03:19,358
- You're First Class. - Thank you so much.

3176
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:20,600
- Thank you. - I really enjoyed your work.

3177
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:23,828
I realized I still love...

3178
02:03:23,829 --> 02:03:26,068
and adore ballet in my heart.

3179
02:03:26,069 --> 02:03:28,170
I found confidence...

3180
02:03:28,569 --> 02:03:30,510
I could still do it,

3181
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:32,310
which made me happy.

3182
02:03:33,210 --> 02:03:34,810
- You did well. - Thank you.

3183
02:03:35,109 --> 02:03:36,180
You are Second Class.

3184
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:39,749
Becoming First Class right away is no fun.

3185
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:43,089
Stepping up, taking, and conquering the other dancers' classes...

3186
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:44,789
is more interesting.

3187
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:46,589
(Contemporary Dance)

3188
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:47,729
(Yang Seong Yun, Ha Won Jun, Ryu Tae Young, Lee Chang Min)

3189
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:49,260
Group C.

3190
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:50,929
(Group C: Yang Seong Yun, Ha Won Jun, Ryu Tae Young)

3191
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:51,960
Are there only three dancers?

3192
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:56,029
Due to Lee Chang Min's injury in Group C,

3193
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:58,839
he was automatically placed in Under Class.

3194
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:01,239
(Round 2 for Group C started right away.)

3195
02:04:01,409 --> 02:04:02,438
(Ha Won Jun showed great balance.)

3196
02:04:02,439 --> 02:04:03,470
(Even a side tilt)

3197
02:04:03,569 --> 02:04:04,979
(Yang Seong Yun pulled off difficult techniques.)

3198
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:08,310
(Ryu Tae Young emphasized flexibility more than technique.)

3199
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:10,049
(Ryu Tae Young got Second Class.)

3200
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:11,079
Here you go.

3201
02:04:11,279 --> 02:04:14,050
I had to be brazen to win.

3202
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:15,350
(Surprised)

3203
02:04:15,619 --> 02:04:16,649
(Ha Won Jun counterattacked.)

3204
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:17,890
Come at me.

3205
02:04:17,891 --> 02:04:19,259
I had to go wild.

3206
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:20,829
(Sliding, Surprised, It must be hurt)

3207
02:04:20,859 --> 02:04:21,859
(Yang Seong Yun overpowered the air.)

3208
02:04:22,529 --> 02:04:24,399
That was amazing. You're in First Class.

3209
02:04:24,859 --> 02:04:26,129
(Contemporary Dance)

3210
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:27,359

Now that I'm really in Under Class, it's like I got struck in the head.

3387
02:10:34,569 --> 02:10:37,500
It's going to make me cry.

3388
02:10:37,939 --> 02:10:41,210
But Under Class is where I'm in right now.

3389
02:10:41,609 --> 02:10:44,439
I'm at the edge now. I'll crawl up step by step.

3390
02:10:44,939 --> 02:10:46,840
The more I think about it, the more absurd it is.

3391
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:49,810
I'm in Second Class. This is wrong.

3392
02:10:49,909 --> 02:10:52,349
I was so close to becoming First Class.

3393
02:10:52,350 --> 02:10:54,890
Nobody would be satisfied with that.

3394
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:57,249
This is our first mission.

3395
02:10:57,250 --> 02:10:58,719
Everything starts now.

3396
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:01,959
Starting with 2nd and finishing with 1st.

3397
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:04,600
I believe an epic will make things better.

3398
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,029
It's cruel.

3399
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:07,760
I feel like I'm a fool.

3400
02:11:08,229 --> 02:11:09,929
I was disappointed.

3401
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:11,339
I should work harder.

3402
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:13,499
It's true that my performance wasn't good enough.

3403
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:16,470
I'm just one step away from being First.

3404
02:11:16,909 --> 02:11:18,409
Let's focus on going up.

3405
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,009
From now on, the Class Battle...

3406
02:11:21,010 --> 02:11:22,880
for contemporary dances begins.

3407
02:11:22,949 --> 02:11:27,350
It consists of a choreography combination audition.

3408
02:11:27,720 --> 02:11:28,788
(Dance Film Mission)

3409
02:11:28,789 --> 02:11:31,489
(Class Battle)

3410
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:34,859
Today, dancers, who become First Class,

3411
02:11:35,029 --> 02:11:37,959
will receive benefits that can be useful...

3412
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,199
in the Class Battle.

3413
02:11:39,729 --> 02:11:40,899
I should be ready well.

3414
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:42,129
(Nodding)

3415
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:44,839
That is, you will have a chance to create your choreography,

3416
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:46,868
which will be used...

3417
02:11:46,869 --> 02:11:49,709
in the choreography combination audition.

3418
02:11:49,710 --> 02:11:52,309
You will have a chance to create your choreography.

3419
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:54,038
(I knew it was coming.)

3420
02:11:54,039 --> 02:11:56,309
That's creating choreography, and I'm good at it.

3421
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:57,380
So, I felt somewhat disappointed.

3422
02:11:57,649 --> 02:11:59,420
Please, technique shouldn't be included.

3423
02:11:59,579 --> 02:12:02,449
I thought it would be so good if my choreography was selected.

3424
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:03,619
It sounds fun.

3425
02:12:03,819 --> 02:12:04,859
It's getting serious.

3426
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:06,688
(First Class also hears about the benefits.)

3427
02:12:06,689 --> 02:12:10,329
You'll join the audition with the self-created choreography.

3428
02:12:10,789 --> 02:12:13,499
What a relief that I got First.

3429
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,868
Challenging with my choreography...

3430
02:12:15,869 --> 02:12:17,728
will be a great benefit.

3431
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:20,769
Of course, it sounds like a good option,

3432
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:22,710
but I never thought my dance skills would fall behind.

3433
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:25,640
Whatever comes won't block me.

3434
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:27,978
All of the 24 Korean dancers...

3435
02:12:27,979 --> 02:12:31,249
should proceed to the higher class,

3436
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:33,579
using the First ones' choreography.

3437
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:35,649
This makes me feel frustrated.

3438
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:38,119
Competition never ends.

3439
02:12:38,859 --> 02:12:40,619
It sounds intriguing.

3440
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:43,358
There's a step for me to proceed, so now...

3441
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:44,898
It doesn't matter who creates the choreography.

3442
02:12:44,899 --> 02:12:48,130
My aura will engulf all of you.

3443
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:50,599
First Class dancers should keep their positions,

3444
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,238
using your choreography.

3445
02:12:53,239 --> 02:12:54,600
I should keep my seat here.

3446
02:12:54,869 --> 02:12:57,470
I'm not interested in going down again.

3447
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:58,810
I'm well prepared.

3448
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:01,778
Now, the audio of the contemporary dance film is...

3449
02:13:01,779 --> 02:13:02,880
revealed.

3450
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:06,118
(The audio of the contemporary dance film is now revealed.)

3451
02:13:06,119 --> 02:13:08,788
(First Kim Hye Hyun focuses and listens to it to keep his position.)

3452
02:13:08,789 --> 02:13:10,288
(Second Jung Hye Seong tries to catch the point to take his.)

3453
02:13:10,289 --> 02:13:11,559
(Under Kim Eun Hyuk renews his heart and mind, looking for a promotion.)

3454
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:13,220
This is one of my favorites.

3455
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:16,259
"Moonlight" was spreading all over there.

3456
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:19,100
What about taking an easy step?

3457
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,328
It was tranquil and eager.

3458
02:13:22,329 --> 02:13:24,170
What should I do? Or this will do.

3459
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:26,469
This music will make my dance more sophisticated.

3460
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:27,840
The music is quite sexy.

3461
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:30,539
It leads to a quite strong mood.

3462
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:32,578
Where should I focus on?

3463
02:13:32,579 --> 02:13:34,979
I felt like it was boosting my energy.

3464
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:37,849
I thought it was rather sexy.

3465
02:13:37,850 --> 02:13:39,350
I guessed my movement should match it.

3466
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:42,089
Triple time can be interesting if used well.

3467
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:43,788
I was somewhat confident.

3468
02:13:43,789 --> 02:13:44,818
(I like this.)

3469
02:13:44,819 --> 02:13:47,659
Now, the audio of the contemporary dance film is revealed.

3470
02:13:47,789 --> 02:13:49,859
I was hoping it would be classical music.

3471
02:13:49,989 --> 02:13:52,000
I was of two minds. Excited and worried.

3472
02:13:52,630 --> 02:13:54,158
(The audio of the ballet dance film is now revealed.)

3473
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:57,369
(The audio that will be used in the Class Battle is now revealed.)

3474
02:13:57,430 --> 02:13:58,839
(Focused)

3475
02:13:58,840 --> 02:13:59,868
It's "Swan."

3476
02:13:59,869 --> 02:14:02,069
Oh, this is for me.

3477
02:14:03,810 --> 02:14:06,239
I could feel the movement of the swan through it.

3478
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:09,209
Actually, I was confident.

3479
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:12,078
I was listening to the lyrics.

3480
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:14,149
I thought I needed to organize a well-built story.

3481
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:17,449
The audio of the Korean dance film is now revealed.

3482
02:14:18,119 --> 02:14:20,020
(The audio of the Korean dance film is now revealed.)

3483
02:14:20,189 --> 02:14:24,188
(Now, the audio of the Korean dance film is revealed to everyone.)

3484
02:14:24,189 --> 02:14:26,829
(Focused)

3485
02:14:28,029 --> 02:14:30,568
As soon as I heard the musical pitch of the court music,

3486
02:14:30,569 --> 02:14:31,868
I could feel that was for me.

3487
02:14:31,869 --> 02:14:33,100
That piece would fit me well.

3488
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:36,840
I felt I could show the elegance of the Korean style.

3489
02:14:37,210 --> 02:14:39,779
(After the introduction of the court music, a lively beat is added.)

3490
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:41,448
(His eyes crinkle.)

3491
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:42,549
(Nice)

3492
02:14:42,550 --> 02:14:43,648
That's so fetch!

3493
02:14:43,649 --> 02:14:45,978
(The trendy music makes them move their bodies first.)

3494
02:14:45,979 --> 02:14:49,349
What kind of dance will suit this piece?

3495
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:50,819
I imagined it in my head.

3496
02:14:51,789 --> 02:14:54,019
Some distinctive movement combined with this music...

3497
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:55,859
will be something.

3498
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:58,728
This is totally for me, including the change of the rhythm.

3499
02:14:58,729 --> 02:15:02,269
If I can create the movement, it may be the best of all.

3500
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:04,529
What a miss that the young boy took my chance.

3501
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:06,169
(Kim Min Suk: He took First from Choi Jong In.)

3502
02:15:06,170 --> 02:15:07,469
Oh, this is cool.

3503
02:15:07,470 --> 02:15:08,969
I was creating my movement...

3504
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:11,170
while listening to it.

3505
02:15:11,479 --> 02:15:13,439
I know more...

3506
02:15:13,479 --> 02:15:15,049
about the current trend, aren't I?

3507
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:16,250
Because I'm young.

3508
02:15:17,479 --> 02:15:18,549
(Interested)

3509
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:19,550
(This will be interesting.)

3510
02:15:20,119 --> 02:15:21,750
What others in First will do with this?

3511
02:15:23,319 --> 02:15:25,019
(Everyone starts clapping.)

3512
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:26,989
(The audio of the Korean dance film is heard by everyone now.)

3513
02:15:27,319 --> 02:15:30,059
From now on, the six in the First Class...

3514
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:32,899
should create choreography with this music.

3515
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:35,528
Only 1 choreography of 6 will be selected...

3516
02:15:35,529 --> 02:15:37,670
for the audition choreography.

3517
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:41,269
Oh, the competition in the First Class has begun now.

3518
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:42,368
I hate to lose.

3519
02:15:42,369 --> 02:15:43,839
Whoever my opponent is.

3520
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,539
The last choreography will be chosen by the six in the First.

3521
02:15:47,779 --> 02:15:50,779
How should I create to be selected by all?

3522
02:15:50,909 --> 02:15:53,078
I should avoid things that only I can do.

3523
02:15:53,079 --> 02:15:54,679
I should reveal my weakness.

3524
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:57,749
Only 1 choreography of 4 will be selected...

3525
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:59,659
for the audition choreography.

3526
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:00,788
(Feeling a headache)

3527
02:16:00,789 --> 02:16:02,429
I suddenly came to my senses.

3528
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:05,059
As we compete for only one seat.

3529
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:07,100
This program will get me...

3530
02:16:07,829 --> 02:16:09,529
in the end.

3531
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:11,538
Okay. Let's go.

3532
02:16:11,539 --> 02:16:13,368
I can be the top among these four.

3533
02:16:13,369 --> 02:16:15,039
This whole thing pressured me.

3534
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:19,239
Yu Chan has many experiences in creating choreography.

3535
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:20,380
Kim Yu Chan!

3536
02:16:20,479 --> 02:16:21,948
He's an expert. Everyone admits it.

3537
02:16:21,949 --> 02:16:23,809
I should hold him in check, naturally.

3538
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:25,549
To maintain my position here,

3539
02:16:25,550 --> 02:16:26,649
mine should be selected.

3540
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:28,988
Everyone should do well with mine,

3541
02:16:28,989 --> 02:16:32,488
but slightly favorable to me.

3542
02:16:32,489 --> 02:16:36,329
I will add my strength to the choreography.

3543
02:16:36,930 --> 02:16:39,898
From now on, create your choreography.

3544
02:16:39,899 --> 02:16:42,370
(A chance to create a choreography is given to the First Class.)

3545
02:16:42,469 --> 02:16:44,029
I was feeling so good.

3546
02:16:44,030 --> 02:16:46,499
I got the benefit of creating choreography,

3547
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:47,670
which I like the most.

3548
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:50,468
I got a chance to create choreography...

3549
02:16:50,469 --> 02:16:51,878
If mine is selected,

3550
02:16:51,879 --> 02:16:53,879
it will be a favorable situation for me.

3551
02:16:53,979 --> 02:16:57,209
I can do well because I'm an expert in this part.

3552
02:16:57,409 --> 02:16:59,279
(Time to create choreography by the First Class has finally begun.)

3553
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:00,818
(First Class in the contemporary dance group)

3554
02:17:00,819 --> 02:17:02,019
It drives me crazy.

3555
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:04,919
Apparently, Hyeok Jung created well,

3556
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,389
showing his strength.

3557
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:09,760
Isn't it that everyone adds what he does well?

3558
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:10,930
(Smiling)

3559
02:17:10,931 --> 02:17:12,199
(Being serious, suddenly)

3560
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:15,100
I could have created only what I could do.

3561
02:17:15,229 --> 02:17:18,369
But being chosen by others was the top priority.

3562
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:22,239
Taking easy steps appeared to be better.

3563
02:17:22,370 --> 02:17:23,769
(Young Woong is fully focused.)

3564
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:25,708
But for me, instead of Hyeok Jung,

3565
02:17:25,709 --> 02:17:28,079
I was worried about Young Woong.

3566
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:29,879
I'm confident.

3567
02:17:30,350 --> 02:17:31,919
Things only I can do.

3568
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:33,950
It might be difficult for others.

3569
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:36,419
Korean dancers are good at creating these movements.

3570
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:37,520
I saw a monster there.

3571
02:17:37,719 --> 02:17:39,359
(Who is the monster in the Korean dancer group?)

3572
02:17:39,360 --> 02:17:40,888
How can he...

3573
02:17:40,889 --> 02:17:42,889
Look at his movement.

3574
02:17:43,629 --> 02:17:45,599
(The monster, Choi Ho Jong)

3575
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:47,559
He's crazy. He's just so good at it.

3576
02:17:48,299 --> 02:17:49,499
I'm at a loss for words.

3577
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,228
(His movements overwhelm all of the others.)

3578
02:17:51,229 --> 02:17:52,469
Of course, it's Choi Ho Jong.

3579
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,840
Everybody expects his great performance.

3580
02:17:53,969 --> 02:17:56,540
Ho Jong's choreography may be a good choice.

3581
02:17:56,770 --> 02:17:59,939
When creating choreography is given to me,

3582
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:02,578
it's better to give up...

3583
02:18:02,579 --> 02:18:04,148
if you aren't ready yet.

3584
02:18:04,149 --> 02:18:05,549
But I'm so ready.

3585
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:08,249
But the skills are not all when choosing the best choreography.

3586
02:18:08,250 --> 02:18:10,548
I should modify it a little so others can do well too.

3587
02:18:10,549 --> 02:18:12,488
Choosing the choreography that suits me the best...

3588
02:18:12,489 --> 02:18:14,919
will finally lead me to the next mission.

3589
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,829
- I won't vote for you. - You dance like a machine.

3590
02:18:17,059 --> 02:18:18,229
Just seeing it makes me feel burdened.

3591
02:18:18,530 --> 02:18:21,000
- No one can do that! - How could we choose that?

3592
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:25,769
It should be the choreography created with the best movements.

3593
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:28,170
"I will go with the easy ones. I will choose what I can do well."

3594
02:18:28,569 --> 02:18:30,909
Then, who would see our performance and who would dance with it?

3595
02:18:36,379 --> 02:18:37,379
Is it your concept?

3596
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:40,920
I know more about the current trend, aren't I?

3597
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:42,290
Because I'm young.

3598
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:43,919
I can create well.

3599
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:46,388
But I can't be sure of it...

3600
02:18:46,389 --> 02:18:49,659
as other choreography may suit me better.

3601
02:18:49,729 --> 02:18:52,059
(Taking a lunch break)

3602
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:54,100
Am I allowed to ask such things?

3603
02:18:54,530 --> 02:18:57,999
- What do you mean? - I mean the criteria to choose.

3604
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,999
We should be a strategist for this.

3605
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,239
I mean whenever we choose this kind of thing.

3606
02:19:01,969 --> 02:19:03,309
It's all about psychological warfare.

3607
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:05,238
"It's so cool!"

3608
02:19:05,239 --> 02:19:06,409
By the way, should I perform that?

3609
02:19:07,239 --> 02:19:08,549
That's what you think.

3610
02:19:08,579 --> 02:19:10,010
Even if you say, "That's so fun!"

3611
02:19:10,049 --> 02:19:11,110
Whose will be chosen?

3612
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:15,519
(In the meantime, the ballet dancers in the First Class group...)

3613
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:18,958
(Just staring the floor)

3614
02:19:18,959 --> 02:19:21,218
(When their eyes meet,)

3615
02:19:21,219 --> 02:19:23,388
(they just run away.)

3616
02:19:23,389 --> 02:19:25,530
(Smiling bitterly)

3617
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:28,429
(Just staring at the ceiling)

3618
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:31,099
(Is there something over there?)

3619
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:32,339
(Spacing out)

3620
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:33,539
(Sighing)

3621
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:37,238
The thing is, in ballet,

3622
02:19:37,239 --> 02:19:38,780
we don't create much choreography.

3623
02:19:39,239 --> 02:19:40,309
It was a shock.

3624
02:19:41,010 --> 02:19:42,110
I was stunned.

3625
02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:45,679
That is, you will have a chance to create your choreography,

3626
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:49,290
which will be used in the choreography combination audition.

3627
02:19:49,549 --> 02:19:51,020
(Eyes getting bigger)

3628
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:53,219
(Eyes widely opening)

3629
02:19:53,489 --> 02:19:54,519
(Shocked)

3630
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:56,889
I was out of my mind since then.

3631
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:58,898
(What should I do?)

3632
02:19:58,899 --> 02:20:01,529
The thing is, in ballet,

3633
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:03,200
we don't create much choreography.

3634
02:20:03,399 --> 02:20:04,899
I was so nervous.

3635
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:07,199
We always have the structure.

3636
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:08,738
We have a storyline to perform.

3637
02:20:08,739 --> 02:20:10,369
Then, we take turns.

3638
02:20:10,370 --> 02:20:13,110
I'm ready to perform if somebody points me out.

3639
02:20:13,139 --> 02:20:15,209
But we're not a composer.

3640
02:20:15,850 --> 02:20:17,208
(Just laughing)

3641
02:20:17,209 --> 02:20:19,218
It's not a benefit,

3642
02:20:19,219 --> 02:20:21,180
but a special training.

3643
02:20:21,319 --> 02:20:22,590
I never imagined...

3644
02:20:23,549 --> 02:20:25,260
creating my choreography.

3645
02:20:25,319 --> 02:20:26,690
I did once, but...

3646
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:30,329
We are not the kind of creators.

3647
02:20:31,629 --> 02:20:33,128
I was rather embarrassed.

3648
02:20:33,129 --> 02:20:34,759
Creating something is...

3649
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:36,228
beyond my imagination.

3650
02:20:36,229 --> 02:20:37,969
Being First might have been my mistake.

3651
02:20:38,670 --> 02:20:40,700
I just can't. What should I do?

3652
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:42,409
- We can. - Seriously.

3653
02:20:42,739 --> 02:20:43,770
Be confident.

3654
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:45,279
(Someone is creating choreography very quickly.)

3655
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,340
I was quite confident, to be honest.

3656
02:20:48,549 --> 02:20:52,648
Because I became First...

3657
02:20:52,649 --> 02:20:54,849
as I impressed others...

3658
02:20:54,850 --> 02:20:57,148
after creating the choreography.

3659
02:20:57,149 --> 02:20:58,459
They recognized it.

3660
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:01,790
(Looking sharply)

3661
02:21:02,229 --> 02:21:04,329
I thought that Gyeong Ho's choreography...

3662
02:21:05,059 --> 02:21:08,298
would be less ordinary than others.

3663
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:09,529
(Watching carefully)

3664
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:12,540
I was half worried and half wary.

3665
02:21:13,239 --> 02:21:15,609
(Concentrating 200 percent)

3666
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:19,239
When you hope to do it better than others,

3667
02:21:19,639 --> 02:21:21,110
nothing is possible.

3668
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:26,120
Let's choreograph something that's different from others.

3669
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:28,849
Compared to other dancers in First Class,

3670
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:30,190
I'm likely to have more experience.

3671
02:21:30,389 --> 02:21:31,959
I must win this no matter what.

3672
02:21:32,260 --> 02:21:35,259
I believe that I'm a dancer...

3673
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:37,429
who makes it in pressing situations.

3674
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:41,200
People will be flustered by my choreography.

3675
02:21:41,829 --> 02:21:42,969
Everyone, look forward to it.

3676
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:47,398
Amazing music, amazing situation, and amazing background.

3677
02:21:47,399 --> 02:21:48,539
(Full of confidence)

3678
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:50,670
They deserve an amazing choreography.

3679
02:21:51,469 --> 02:21:55,250
(Among First Class dancers in every genre,)

3680
02:21:55,450 --> 02:21:57,279
(whose choreography will be chosen...)

3681
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:59,319
(for the Class Battle?)

3682
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:02,950
(The Class Battle)

3683
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:05,120
(The next day at STF Dance Company)

3684
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:07,458
Hello.

3685
02:22:07,459 --> 02:22:08,459
(The dancers arrive in the locker room.)

3686
02:22:08,629 --> 02:22:11,259
- Did you sleep well? - I slept well.

3687
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:12,359
- You did? - Yes.

3688
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:14,159
My thighs aren't working.

3689
02:22:14,659 --> 02:22:16,799
Oh, no. It looks like you had a rough night.

3690
02:22:17,299 --> 02:22:18,299
It's funny...

3691
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:21,299
how familiar it feels here just because we were here yesterday.

3692
02:22:21,969 --> 02:22:23,569
Under. Gosh.

3693
02:22:23,809 --> 02:22:24,969
Huddle up, Under Class.

3694
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:27,509
The vibe is clearly different from yesterday.

3695
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:28,510
Right.

3696
02:22:29,049 --> 02:22:32,520
I felt camaraderie between me and the other Under Class dancers...

3697
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:34,049
because I was the first to join.

3698
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:36,920
They said that Class Battle would be cruel.

3699
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:38,419
It's cruel for the four of us.

3700
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:39,888
(Kim Tae Yeon, Park Min Woo, and Choi Kyu Tae in Under Class)

3701
02:22:39,889 --> 02:22:42,030
- Right. - It's very cruel for us.

3702
02:22:42,329 --> 02:22:43,790
We listened to the music yesterday.

3703
02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:45,899
Did any of you feel confident?

3704
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:48,059
I think I'll do better than you.

3705
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:50,599
(You're in Under Class. Feeling dizzy)

3706
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:53,299
Are you being bossy with the Under Class already?

3707
02:22:53,469 --> 02:22:54,968
It can't be helped. I'm sorry,

3708
02:22:54,969 --> 02:22:56,239
but Under Class dancers should be quiet.

3709
02:22:56,840 --> 02:22:59,839
I was aware of Min Chan's presence...

3710
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:02,379
because I wanted to make his position mine.

3711
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:05,180
During the Class Battle,

3712
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:07,920
I'll get out of Under Class no matter what.

3713
02:23:08,049 --> 02:23:09,548
(Korean dance locker room)

3714
02:23:09,549 --> 02:23:10,920
(Patting)

3715
02:23:11,649 --> 02:23:13,158
(Falling off)

3716
02:23:13,159 --> 02:23:14,360
Thank you for taking off my Second Class tag.

3717
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:16,489
It's okay. I'm in Under Class.

3718
02:23:16,829 --> 02:23:18,128
(You're better off than me.)

3719
02:23:18,129 --> 02:23:21,229
All I could do was feel jealous of them.

3720
02:23:21,899 --> 02:23:22,968
I'm so sleepy.

3721
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:24,700
I was so angry with myself...

3722
02:23:24,969 --> 02:23:26,270
that I couldn't sleep.

3723
02:23:26,899 --> 02:23:28,039
(They also feel uneasy.)

3724
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:29,639
- Let's get promoted. - Definitely.

3725
02:23:29,909 --> 02:23:30,968
(A weak handshake)

3726
02:23:30,969 --> 02:23:32,309
- See you in the class above. - I think...

3727
02:23:32,909 --> 02:23:34,109
I'll get promoted.

3728
02:23:34,110 --> 02:23:35,510
I'm too good for this class.

3729
02:23:35,909 --> 02:23:37,350
- Really? - I feel it.

3730
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:39,519
It was very embarrassing.

3731
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:42,449
I was determined to move up fast.

3732
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:43,819
To First Class no matter what.

3733
02:23:44,719 --> 02:23:47,620
I wonder what kind of choreography they came up with.

3734
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:49,359
(Second and Under Class dancers are curious about the choreography.)

3735
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:50,429
Who will it be?

3736
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:52,859
We won't get the right to vote, right?

3737
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:53,929
Of course not.

3738
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:55,299
(Laughing sadly)

3739
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:58,370
There will be dances of various styles.

3740
02:23:59,069 --> 02:24:01,600
They won't pick something odd to keep themselves in check, right?

3741
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:03,370
I thought about that too.

3742
02:24:03,940 --> 02:24:05,308
I hope that it won't involve a lot of technique.

3743
02:24:05,309 --> 02:24:06,680
- Please. - I agree.

3744
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,610
My technique is on the weaker side.

3745
02:24:09,909 --> 02:24:11,979
I was very worried about that.

3746
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:13,719
Please leave technique out of it.

3747
02:24:13,879 --> 02:24:15,790
I hope that it'll be Hyeok Jung's choreography.

3748
02:24:16,889 --> 02:24:18,958
I felt that Hyeok Jung's dance style...

3749
02:24:18,959 --> 02:24:21,260
was similar to mine.

3750
02:24:22,090 --> 02:24:23,430
I could steal it from him.

3751
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:25,129
I thought that...

3752
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:28,360
I could steal his choreography that he worked hard on.

3753
02:24:28,870 --> 02:24:30,000
I root for Hye Hyun.

3754
02:24:30,299 --> 02:24:31,369
- Really? - Yes.

3755
02:24:31,370 --> 02:24:34,199
Hye Hyun's dancing style is calm...

3756
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,808
and clean.

3757
02:24:35,809 --> 02:24:38,139
His choreography would be easy to follow.

3758
02:24:38,709 --> 02:24:41,739
What kind of choreography did First Class dancers come up with?

3759
02:24:42,610 --> 02:24:44,578
Whose choreography do you want to avoid?

3760
02:24:44,579 --> 02:24:46,180
Yu Chan.

3761
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:47,619
(He completely agrees.)

3762
02:24:47,620 --> 02:24:50,419
His dancing style isn't easy for men.

3763
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:52,360
Any choreography except Yu Chan's would be fine.

3764
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:55,888
I thought that he'd make us stretch our legs and be flexible.

3765
02:24:55,889 --> 02:24:58,529
If he choreographs it with a skill that only he can pull off,

3766
02:24:58,530 --> 02:25:00,600
we would be completely doomed.

3767
02:25:01,059 --> 02:25:04,298
I think Min Kwon's choreography might be...

3768
02:25:04,299 --> 02:25:06,138
easier than others.

3769
02:25:06,139 --> 02:25:08,770
- Yes. - We went to the same school,

3770
02:25:08,969 --> 02:25:11,270
but I've never seen his creation.

3771
02:25:11,770 --> 02:25:14,679
I've been doing classical ballet.

3772
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:16,850
We have never done contemporary dance,

3773
02:25:17,079 --> 02:25:20,179
but the choreography will include classical ballet moves.

3774
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:22,649
If Min Kwon's choreography gets chosen,

3775
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:24,489
I will have the upper hand.

3776
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:25,959
I can't wait to find out.

3777
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:28,420
Whose choreography got chosen?

3778
02:25:29,129 --> 02:25:31,129
I bet all of them...

3779
02:25:31,530 --> 02:25:35,129
came up with an intense choreography with a lot of moves.

3780
02:25:35,299 --> 02:25:37,600
The music leaves a strong impression.

3781
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,599
You can't dance slowly to the fast beat.

3782
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:41,638
I'm curious.

3783
02:25:41,639 --> 02:25:43,669
I hope that there won't be any rolling on the floor.

3784
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:45,708
There will be a lot in Hyo Joon's choreography.

3785
02:25:45,709 --> 02:25:47,340
What kind of dance style will it be?

3786
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:49,109
I know his dancing style,

3787
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:50,479
so I could imagine it.

3788
02:25:50,909 --> 02:25:52,649
I bet Ho Jong made it difficult.

3789
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:54,549
It will be intense...

3790
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:56,120
with moves like this.

3791
02:25:56,121 --> 02:25:59,218
Choi Ho Jong is the dancer among dancers.

3792
02:25:59,219 --> 02:26:01,360
He's at the top,

3793
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:03,559
so I didn't want to do his choreography.

3794
02:26:03,959 --> 02:26:05,629
As long as I don't compete against Ho Jong,

3795
02:26:05,829 --> 02:26:07,899
I can make it to First Class.

3796
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:11,530
Kyu Nyeon will include his typical moves...

3797
02:26:12,069 --> 02:26:14,170
like this.

3798
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:17,609
Similar to his usual moves, Kyu Nyeon will...

3799
02:26:17,610 --> 02:26:20,238
probably include many segments in his dance.

3800
02:26:20,239 --> 02:26:21,680
He's also good at it.

3801
02:26:22,309 --> 02:26:24,478
I don't care about the choreography.

3802
02:26:24,479 --> 02:26:26,649
What's important is joining the First Class.

3803
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:27,850
I need to change this.

3804
02:26:30,049 --> 02:26:31,690
Did you finish making the choreography?

3805
02:26:32,319 --> 02:26:35,760
We worked hard to earn the First Class tag.

3806
02:26:36,129 --> 02:26:37,559
Let's make it worth it.

3807
02:26:38,190 --> 02:26:39,399
Let's compete.

3808
02:26:39,829 --> 02:26:41,829
(Ballet Dance Film Class Battle Choreography Nominees are revealed.)

3809
02:26:42,129 --> 02:26:43,129
(Surprised)

3810
02:26:43,130 --> 02:26:44,370
(Very curious)

3811
02:26:45,069 --> 02:26:46,439
(First choreographer, Kim Tae Seok)

3812
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,799
- There it is. - Tae Seok.

3813
02:26:48,299 --> 02:26:49,370
Our prince.

3814
02:26:50,139 --> 02:26:52,780
(Choreography Nominee 1, Kim Tae Seok)

3815
02:26:55,139 --> 02:26:56,680
It has a clear theme.

3816
02:26:57,379 --> 02:26:58,479
He looks like a swan.

3817
02:26:59,319 --> 02:27:03,719
He obviously thought of the swan as the only theme.

3818
02:27:04,049 --> 02:27:07,020
Anyone could have come up with such a choreography.

3819
02:27:07,489 --> 02:27:08,620
Are you saying that it's cliche?

3820
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:09,989
(Nodding)

3821
02:27:10,629 --> 02:27:14,459
(Choreography Nominee 2, Kang Gyeong Ho)

3822
02:27:15,059 --> 02:27:16,930
(Gyeong Ho shows strong energy from the start.)

3823
02:27:18,069 --> 02:27:19,600
(Exclaiming)

3824
02:27:20,069 --> 02:27:21,469
He's a technician.

3825
02:27:22,069 --> 02:27:24,609
It only involves strong moves...

3826
02:27:24,610 --> 02:27:26,479
that only Gyeong Ho can do.

3827
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:27,739
Amazing.

3828
02:27:28,309 --> 02:27:29,309
(Feeling proud)

3829
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:30,409
It's amazing, but...

3830
02:27:31,010 --> 02:27:33,020
- It's difficult. - Only Gyeong Ho can do it.

3831
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:36,290
Why can't you do it?

3832
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:39,059
Is he...

3833
02:27:39,719 --> 02:27:40,859
looking down on us?

3834
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:42,929
The moves were powerful like Gyeong Ho.

3835
02:27:42,930 --> 02:27:44,090
It's so Gyeong Ho.

3836
02:27:45,090 --> 02:27:46,159
Are they keeping me in check?

3837
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:49,270
I don't think it's that hard to do.

3838
02:27:50,030 --> 02:27:53,100
I think Yu Chan didn't want mine to get picked.

3839
02:27:54,170 --> 02:27:56,739
(Choreography Nominee 3, Kim Yu Chan)

3840
02:27:57,010 --> 02:27:59,309
(Yu Chan starts with gentle movements.)

3841
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:01,239
It's slightly jazzy.

3842
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:03,010
It looks lyrical.

3843
02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:05,850
As expected, it's detailed...

3844
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:07,579
and pretty.

3845
02:28:08,649 --> 02:28:09,819
It isn't suitable for me.

3846
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:12,019
(Exclaiming)

3847
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:13,589
It's better than I expected.

3848
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:15,458
- It was surprising. - His dancing was unexpected.

3849
02:28:15,459 --> 02:28:16,459
Right.

3850
02:28:16,460 --> 02:28:18,329
It was the opposite of Gyeong Ho's.

3851
02:28:19,959 --> 02:28:21,629
- It's ballet. - It's the first position.

3852
02:28:22,930 --> 02:28:27,340
(Choreography Nominee 3, Shin Min Kwon)

3853
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:29,969
It looked too easy.

3854
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:32,979
Overall, it looked like a combination in the classroom.

3855
02:28:33,409 --> 02:28:34,780
He stuck to the basic moves.

3856
02:28:35,809 --> 02:28:38,180
Isn't this a variation of what we did in Round One?

3857
02:28:38,649 --> 02:28:41,149
There's too much focus on one's foundation.

3858
02:28:41,450 --> 02:28:44,589
His choreography only shows...

3859
02:28:44,590 --> 02:28:47,760
basic ballet technique.

3860
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:50,989
I want to avoid his choreography the most.

3861
02:28:51,829 --> 02:28:53,059
- Me too. - Me too.

3862
02:28:53,559 --> 02:28:55,000
I wouldn't look good doing it.

3863
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:59,540
Will First Class dancers think what we think?

3864
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:02,369
Their priority is getting their choreography picked.

3865
02:29:02,370 --> 02:29:04,309
It will be their priority.

3866
02:29:04,709 --> 02:29:07,110
A choreography that isn't difficult might get picked.

3867
02:29:07,909 --> 02:29:09,078
I wonder which one they picked.

3868
02:29:09,079 --> 02:29:10,180
(Worried)

3869
02:29:10,409 --> 02:29:12,949
Let's start by taking out the worst one.

3870
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:14,849
(Eliminating the worst choreography first)

3871
02:29:14,850 --> 02:29:18,549
I think Yu Chan's choreography is the worst.

3872
02:29:19,290 --> 02:29:20,319
My pick is...

3873
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:22,459
Tae Seok's.

3874
02:29:22,729 --> 02:29:24,360
I think that it's Tae Seok's.

3875
02:29:25,129 --> 02:29:26,458
(With a majority vote, Kim Tae Seok is eliminated.)

3876
02:29:26,459 --> 02:29:27,500
I accept.

3877
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:30,899
The three of you remain.

3878
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,069
First of all,

3879
02:29:33,739 --> 02:29:37,309
I thought that my choreography was easy.

3880
02:29:37,870 --> 02:29:40,809
It's only because I danced it with my style.

3881
02:29:41,139 --> 02:29:44,350
I think you'll be able to dance it better than me.

3882
02:29:44,979 --> 02:29:46,979
I said this to convince you.

3883
02:29:48,149 --> 02:29:49,790
My choreography isn't difficult.

3884
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:52,559
However, it's true that I made it advantageous for me.

3885
02:29:52,959 --> 02:29:54,260
I wanted mine to get chosen.

3886
02:29:58,329 --> 02:29:59,430
For me,

3887
02:30:00,799 --> 02:30:02,299
I have a lot of experience in choreography.

3888
02:30:02,799 --> 02:30:04,670
If my choreography gets selected,

3889
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:08,940
I can include each dancer's personality and style.

3890
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:12,510
I hope that you'll consider this aspect.

3891
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:16,850
It was brutal.

3892
02:30:17,549 --> 02:30:18,680
To be honest,

3893
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:21,718
I wasn't confident about my choreography,

3894
02:30:21,719 --> 02:30:24,950
so I knew that it'd be between Yu Chan and Gyeong Ho.

3895
02:30:26,260 --> 02:30:28,059
(What's the result of this intense war of nerves?)

3896
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:31,090
(Shin Min Kwon's choreography is chosen.)

3897
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:32,959
(Oh, no.)

3898
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:34,398
This is the worst.

3899
02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:35,728
(Under Class dancers are in despair.)

3900
02:30:35,729 --> 02:30:36,770
I got this.

3901
02:30:36,899 --> 02:30:39,440
I'd have the upper hand in Min Kwon's choreography.

3902
02:30:39,799 --> 02:30:42,370
That's why I was happy inside.

3903
02:30:43,139 --> 02:30:44,139
Three.

3904
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:46,940
(Min Kwon's choreography is picked automatically.)

3905
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:51,479
He picked me again as the worst.

3906
02:30:51,809 --> 02:30:53,450
I didn't feel good about it.

3907
02:30:54,149 --> 02:30:56,049
Could you tell me why you picked me?

3908
02:30:58,250 --> 02:30:59,420
Keep it honest and simple.

3909
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:02,590
I think Min Kwon's choreography will be easier...

3910
02:31:02,690 --> 02:31:04,430
for everyone to follow.

3911
02:31:05,389 --> 02:31:06,559
- So you picked mine. - Yes.

3912
02:31:07,729 --> 02:31:08,759
In Yu Chan's choreography,

3913
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:11,299
femininity is the strength.

3914
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:14,500
I don't want to do that. It isn't the style I pursue.

3915
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:16,139
"Don't make a choreography only you can do."

3916
02:31:16,639 --> 02:31:18,170
(Min Kwon's choreography gets chosen without much work.)

3917
02:31:18,409 --> 02:31:19,409
I was really happy.

3918
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:22,209
The odds of me staying in the First Class...

3919
02:31:22,409 --> 02:31:24,049
went up.

3920
02:31:24,579 --> 02:31:26,919
I was really happy, but it put a lot of pressure on me.

3921
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:28,549
(Half happy and half pressured)

3922
02:31:30,190 --> 02:31:32,290
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

3923
02:31:33,319 --> 02:31:34,520
Thank you for your hard work.

3924
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:36,628
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

3925
02:31:36,629 --> 02:31:39,360
(The atmosphere turns gloomy with the 4 dancers' entrance.)

3926
02:31:40,459 --> 02:31:43,770
(Silence fills the room.)

3927
02:31:44,370 --> 02:31:45,899
No one is saying a thing.

3928
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:48,898
(The First Class dancers find it hard to open their mouths.)

3929
02:31:48,899 --> 02:31:51,609
Min Kwon, when you choreographed the dance,

3930
02:31:51,610 --> 02:31:54,539
what were your intentions and thoughts?

3931
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:55,609
(Well)

3932
02:31:55,610 --> 02:31:57,649
I came up with the simple choreography...

3933
02:31:58,010 --> 02:32:00,718
everyone could do.

3934
02:32:00,719 --> 02:32:02,419
You thought...

3935
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:04,488
- everyone could pull it off. - Yes.

3936
02:32:04,489 --> 02:32:05,689
(Min Kwon picked the basic moves for friendly rivalry.)

3937
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:08,159
There was a reason behind his standard.

3938
02:32:09,559 --> 02:32:10,628
There was a deep meaning.

3939
02:32:10,629 --> 02:32:11,690
(He meant well with his choice.)

3940
02:32:11,989 --> 02:32:15,399
He added all the moves I hated. He added all the moves I never use.

3941
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:18,170
He won't care as long as he can do well.

3942
02:32:18,829 --> 02:32:20,969
- That's how it is. - Seriously.

3943
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:25,770
Hello, ballerinos.

3944
02:32:26,010 --> 02:32:28,010
I'm the host of Stage Fighter, Kang Daniel.

3945
02:32:28,809 --> 02:32:31,909
The evaluation of the Class Battle will be done in groups.

3946
02:32:32,579 --> 02:32:33,648
My goodness.

3947
02:32:33,649 --> 02:32:35,649
Each group will have two Under Class dancers,

3948
02:32:36,190 --> 02:32:39,559
four Second Class dancers, and two First Class dancers.

3949
02:32:39,659 --> 02:32:41,059
Three classes will make up a group.

3950
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:44,389
The eight dancers must prove themselves...

3951
02:32:44,590 --> 02:32:46,629
in their respective classes.

3952
02:32:47,059 --> 02:32:48,260
That means there will be two groups.

3953
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:51,670
Class Battle of the team of eight dancers...

3954
02:32:51,930 --> 02:32:54,600
will determine the final number of dancers in each class.

3955
02:32:55,170 --> 02:32:57,369
After the Class Battle, the number of dancers...

3956
02:32:57,370 --> 02:32:59,510
who'll join the First Class is...

3957
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:02,309
only one.

3958
02:33:03,709 --> 02:33:04,779
(In each group, only 1 dancer will join the First Class!)

3959
02:33:04,780 --> 02:33:06,180
Everyone will join the Under Class.

3960
02:33:06,379 --> 02:33:07,578
There will be more Under Class dancers.

3961
02:33:07,579 --> 02:33:08,648
This is insane.

3962
02:33:08,649 --> 02:33:11,690
Now, the groups will be revealed.

3963
02:33:11,989 --> 02:33:13,889
Let's go with this combination.

3964
02:33:14,190 --> 02:33:17,430
They'll compete and show us who's more noble.

3965
02:33:18,059 --> 02:33:19,089
Good idea.

3966
02:33:19,090 --> 02:33:20,159
(Happy)

3967
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:22,770
I think the groups will be important.

3968
02:33:23,129 --> 02:33:24,228
My throat suddenly feels dry.

3969
02:33:24,229 --> 02:33:25,270
(Their throats go dry due to nervousness.)

3970
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:27,670
(Group 1 of the Ballet Class Battle is revealed.)

3971
02:33:28,069 --> 02:33:29,100
Will we see all the names?

3972
02:33:29,569 --> 02:33:30,839
(Group 1: Kim Tae Yeon, Kang Yun Gu, Moon Jun On, Kang Gyeong Ho,)

3973
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:32,069
(Kim Yu Chan, Jeon Tae Hu, Kim Sang Young, Choi Kyu Tae)

3974
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:34,940
(What?)

3975
02:33:35,239 --> 02:33:36,709
(Chuckling)

3976
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:39,648
- A big match. - Strength versus gentleness.

3977
02:33:39,649 --> 02:33:40,649
(It'll be a big match between strength and gentleness.)

3978
02:33:41,149 --> 02:33:42,850
- What a tasty lineup. - My goodness.

3979
02:33:43,989 --> 02:33:45,020
Okay.

3980
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:48,790
I wanted to have a faceoff with Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho.

3981
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:50,860
The time has come. Let's fight.

3982
02:33:51,229 --> 02:33:52,289
(Group 2: Park Min Woo, An Si On, Jung Sung Wook, Kim Tae Seok,)

3983
02:33:52,290 --> 02:33:53,360
(Shin Min Kwon, Kim Kyung Won, Jung Min Chan, Lee Ha Nel)

3984
02:33:53,799 --> 02:33:55,899
- It's neck-and-neck. - Gosh.

3985
02:33:56,729 --> 02:33:59,700
In Group 2, the 2nd Class dancers are quite strong.

3986
02:33:59,799 --> 02:34:01,340
(The 2nd Class dancers make Group 2 strong.)

3987
02:34:02,170 --> 02:34:03,409
I must join the First Class.

3988
02:34:03,739 --> 02:34:05,669
Both groups are intense.

3989
02:34:05,670 --> 02:34:06,909
(Which 2 dancers will join the 1st Class?)

3990
02:34:07,239 --> 02:34:08,439
(The 1st Class dancers of Korean dance gather around.)

3991
02:34:08,440 --> 02:34:10,610
Does anyone want to go first?

3992
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:12,579
(Reading the room)

3993
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:14,020
(Reading the room)

3994
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:16,590
I'll go first.

3995
02:34:17,219 --> 02:34:18,249
(Getting up)

3996
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:19,250
(The spirit of the youngest dancer)

3997
02:34:19,489 --> 02:34:20,690
(Choreography Nominee, Kim Min Suk)

3998
02:34:20,889 --> 02:34:22,059
Here it comes.

3999
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:25,129
I wonder how the youngest members did.

4000
02:34:25,229 --> 02:34:26,299
(How will be Kim Min Suk's choreography?)

4001
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:27,799
(The older members focus.)

4002
02:34:28,329 --> 02:34:31,499
(Choreography Nominee 1, Kim Min Suk)

4003
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:34,270
I could see the traces of his new attempts.

4004
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:37,569
He tried to come up with a witty choreography.

4005
02:34:37,969 --> 02:34:39,270
But it was weak.

4006
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:41,309
It was like a student's work.

4007
02:34:41,639 --> 02:34:43,879
It wasn't a professional's work.

4008
02:34:44,250 --> 02:34:46,780
It isn't bad, but I think there'll be a better one.

4009
02:34:49,489 --> 02:34:50,819
I'm curious about this one.

4010
02:34:51,149 --> 02:34:52,219
I think there'll be many techniques.

4011
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:53,790
(Dancer Cho Tae Yoon is a former acrobat.)

4012
02:34:53,989 --> 02:34:55,420
(He proved himself to be the master of techniques.)

4013
02:34:56,030 --> 02:34:58,489
He did the corkscrew and the swan.

4014
02:34:59,030 --> 02:35:00,930
(Choreography Nominee 2, Cho Tae Yoon)

4015
02:35:02,059 --> 02:35:04,299
I didn't really want to do the dance.

4016
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:06,899
He didn't add many techniques.

4017
02:35:07,299 --> 02:35:08,569
It was a dance anyone could do.

4018
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:10,869
He probably knew that adding techniques...

4019
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:13,139
would keep his choreography from getting picked.

4020
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:16,079
(Choreography Nominee 3, Kim Kyu Nyeon)

4021
02:35:16,750 --> 02:35:18,379
He didn't show his potential fully.

4022
02:35:18,909 --> 02:35:21,920
I feel like it's weaker than his recent choreography.

4023
02:35:22,719 --> 02:35:25,649
(Choreography Nominee 4, Kim Hyo Joon)

4024
02:35:26,159 --> 02:35:27,659
It wasn't very memorable.

4025
02:35:28,059 --> 02:35:30,589
He came up with an easy choreography so that others would select it.

4026
02:35:30,590 --> 02:35:32,059
But it wasn't very tasteful.

4027
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:34,398
They could've thought of it as a benefit...

4028
02:35:34,399 --> 02:35:37,469
and came up with a choreography with moves they were good at.

4029
02:35:37,569 --> 02:35:40,600
It wasn't a choreography that was worth selecting.

4030
02:35:41,469 --> 02:35:42,669
I'll go next.

4031
02:35:42,670 --> 02:35:43,709
(After the unsatisfied assessment, Kim Si Won goes next.)

4032
02:35:44,239 --> 02:35:45,370
At this point,

4033
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:47,808
I can't predict his choreography even though I know his dance...

4034
02:35:47,809 --> 02:35:49,209
- very well. - I know.

4035
02:35:50,149 --> 02:35:51,750
(What kind of choreography will Kim Si Won show?)

4036
02:35:52,110 --> 02:35:55,020
(Choreography Nominee 5, Kim Si Won)

4037
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:57,989
He expresses the Korean vibe in a cool way.

4038
02:35:58,350 --> 02:35:59,789
That choreography...

4039
02:35:59,790 --> 02:36:01,589
suits the music more.

4040
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:05,159
There were aspects Korean dancers could pull off well.

4041
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:07,760
I think it was quite approachable.

4042
02:36:09,329 --> 02:36:12,129
(Kim Si Won's choreography ends.)

4043
02:36:12,670 --> 02:36:15,540
There were moves Korean dancers were used to.

4044
02:36:15,870 --> 02:36:18,639
It was a choreography that made good use...

4045
02:36:18,739 --> 02:36:22,039
of the line of the Korean dance.

4046
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:23,149
I think everyone will be able to do the dance.

4047
02:36:23,350 --> 02:36:25,708
If you make such an easy choreography,

4048
02:36:25,709 --> 02:36:28,780
someone else will pull it off better.

4049
02:36:29,049 --> 02:36:30,049
It's quite doable.

4050
02:36:30,750 --> 02:36:33,190
I think I can do that dance well.

4051
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:35,218
I can bring out the details.

4052
02:36:35,219 --> 02:36:37,959
Those were the movements I could pull off well.

4053
02:36:38,329 --> 02:36:40,658
That choreography is the most likely to be selected.

4054
02:36:40,659 --> 02:36:41,860
I think mine will get selected.

4055
02:36:42,059 --> 02:36:44,299
My strategy wasn't wrong.

4056
02:36:44,569 --> 02:36:47,840
(Lastly, Choi Ho Jong's choreography gets revealed.)

4057
02:36:48,069 --> 02:36:49,100
The time has come.

4058
02:36:49,639 --> 02:36:51,809
Ho Jong's choreography is bound to be good.

4059
02:36:52,069 --> 02:36:56,950
(Amidst everyone's expectations, Choi Ho Jong's choreography begins.)

4060
02:36:57,350 --> 02:37:00,850
(Choreography Nominee 6, Choi Ho Jong)

4061
02:37:00,979 --> 02:37:02,020
(Impressed)

4062
02:37:02,149 --> 02:37:03,520
The movements were unique.

4063
02:37:05,190 --> 02:37:06,219
He's such a pervert.

4064
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:09,690
He really made what he wanted to do.

4065
02:37:10,389 --> 02:37:12,090
I found it charming.

4066
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,430
It was something only he could do well.

4067
02:37:20,170 --> 02:37:22,339
(Choi Ho Jong's choreography ends.)

4068
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:23,340
All right.

4069
02:37:23,341 --> 02:37:24,440
(Nodding)

4070
02:37:24,709 --> 02:37:26,680
(Silence fills the room.)

4071
02:37:26,979 --> 02:37:28,709
(A round of applause breaks the silence.)

4072
02:37:29,079 --> 02:37:30,780
It was insane.

4073
02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:32,450
It was bad.

4074
02:37:32,451 --> 02:37:34,819
I thought my choreography would get selected,

4075
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:37,920
but Ho Jong made a cool dance people would want to copy.

4076
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:41,219
But it looked too difficult.

4077
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:42,590
I don't know if I'll be able to do it.

4078
02:37:43,229 --> 02:37:46,200
How do I do that kind of dance?

4079
02:37:46,899 --> 02:37:48,628
I don't think I can do that.

4080
02:37:48,629 --> 02:37:50,829
I won't be able to bring out the special vibe.

4081
02:37:50,930 --> 02:37:52,430
I'll look like an octopus if I do the dance.

4082
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:53,540
(Chuckling)

4083
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:55,399
I really enjoyed the dance.

4084
02:37:55,700 --> 02:37:58,339
- It suited my taste. - Thank you.

4085
02:37:58,340 --> 02:37:59,780
What's unfortunate is...

4086
02:38:00,110 --> 02:38:02,509
that the dance is...

4087
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:03,510
too difficult...

4088
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:06,619
for a large number of people. Because of that...

4089
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:09,350
I didn't think about whether everyone could do the dance.

4090
02:38:09,819 --> 02:38:11,819
I don't think...

4091
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:14,119
the quality of the choreography should be adjusted...

4092
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:16,190
for the sake of competition.

4093
02:38:16,530 --> 02:38:18,159
So I didn't adjust the difficulty level.

4094
02:38:18,729 --> 02:38:20,559
I'm just worried about...

4095
02:38:20,729 --> 02:38:24,298
how we'd teach the choreography.

4096
02:38:24,299 --> 02:38:25,430
(They have many worries regarding the difficult choreography.)

4097
02:38:25,569 --> 02:38:26,569
(Let me think.)

4098
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:29,439
So you're worried about people not being able to do this?

4099
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:31,010
(So you're worried about people not being able to do this?)

4100
02:38:32,139 --> 02:38:34,180
(How strange)

4101
02:38:34,510 --> 02:38:37,549
- The difficulty level... - The difficulty level...

4102
02:38:38,209 --> 02:38:40,048
- Well... - If you can't do this dance...

4103
02:38:40,049 --> 02:38:42,519
(If you can't do this dance...)

4104
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:43,520
You should go home.

4105
02:38:44,250 --> 02:38:45,250
You should go home.

4106
02:38:45,719 --> 02:38:47,559
I guess some people will go home.

4107
02:38:47,659 --> 02:38:48,719
(Glancing over)

4108
02:38:52,459 --> 02:38:55,199
If my choreography doesn't get selected,

4109
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:56,699
I'll focus my attention...

4110
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:59,430
on doing much better than other choreographers.

4111
02:38:59,739 --> 02:39:00,939
So make a wise decision.

4112
02:39:00,940 --> 02:39:02,699
(Smiling, Laughing)

4113
02:39:02,700 --> 02:39:03,739
(Choking)

4114
02:39:06,979 --> 02:39:09,850
All the votes will go to Choi Ho Jong and Kim Si Won.

4115
02:39:10,149 --> 02:39:13,578
The First Class dancers were racking their brains and thinking,

4116
02:39:13,579 --> 02:39:15,319
"How can I come out on top?"

4117
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:16,850
I'm so torn.

4118
02:39:17,219 --> 02:39:20,559
I know that there's a strategic choice.

4119
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:22,689
Si Won and Ho Jong.

4120
02:39:22,690 --> 02:39:24,760
Whose choreography should I choose?

4121
02:39:25,329 --> 02:39:28,658
Choi Ho Jong is already unrivaled in terms of dance skills.

4122
02:39:28,659 --> 02:39:31,169
If his choreography gets chosen as well,

4123
02:39:31,170 --> 02:39:33,540
the First Class dancers will be threatened.

4124
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:36,069
I think Si Won's choreography will be easier.

4125
02:39:36,270 --> 02:39:39,209
I wouldn't know what to do with Ho Jong's choreography.

4126
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:42,809
The choreography you can copy easily is Kim Si Won's.

4127
02:39:43,209 --> 02:39:46,749
The choreography that'll show each person's dance skills...

4128
02:39:46,750 --> 02:39:48,420
is Ho Jong's.

4129
02:39:49,049 --> 02:39:50,090
That's why I like it.

4130
02:39:50,750 --> 02:39:51,790
That's why I like it.

4131
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:54,059
We should shake things up.

4132
02:39:54,690 --> 02:39:55,760
(The final choreography gets revealed.)

4133
02:39:56,860 --> 02:39:59,700
- My goodness. - Did they pick a choreography?

4134
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Please.

4135
02:40:01,399 --> 02:40:04,030
(Choi Ho Jong's choreography is chosen.)

4136
02:40:04,629 --> 02:40:05,898
We need to learn that choreography now, right?

4137
02:40:05,899 --> 02:40:07,299
(He gets a reality check.)

4138
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:09,839
(Ho Jong)

4139
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:10,909
(The majority chose Ho Jong's choreography.)

4140
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:12,270
(Disappointed)

4141
02:40:12,979 --> 02:40:16,578
I think it's quite distinguished from the easy choreographies.

4142
02:40:16,579 --> 02:40:19,109
A difficult choreography will show who's better.

4143
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:21,280
I'll be able to show my talent more.

4144
02:40:21,579 --> 02:40:22,649
I have a chance.

4145
02:40:23,090 --> 02:40:25,289
I learned from Ho Jong,

4146
02:40:25,290 --> 02:40:27,319
so I can pull off his choreography.

4147
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:29,420
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

4148
02:40:29,889 --> 02:40:31,059
I was quite disappointed.

4149
02:40:31,829 --> 02:40:34,299
But since things have come to this, I'll do a better job.

4150
02:40:34,530 --> 02:40:36,530
- What's this? - My goodness.

4151
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:38,099
(The groups will be revealed.)

4152
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:39,100
Oh, no.

4153
02:40:39,299 --> 02:40:41,540
The First Class dancers in your group will be important.

4154
02:40:41,739 --> 02:40:43,110
I just hope it isn't Choi Ho Jong.

4155
02:40:43,569 --> 02:40:46,209
You wouldn't be in his group since it happened once already.

4156
02:40:46,610 --> 02:40:47,839
If it happens again, it'll be unreasonable.

4157
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:48,908
(Group 1)

4158
02:40:48,909 --> 02:40:49,979
(Park Jun Woo: This can't be happening.)

4159
02:40:50,049 --> 02:40:52,709
(Park Jun Woo's days of struggle)

4160
02:40:53,450 --> 02:40:55,950
The world is out to get me.

4161
02:40:56,149 --> 02:40:59,049
I must defeat him to become a First.

4162
02:40:59,290 --> 02:41:00,459
I felt anxious about it.

4163
02:41:01,489 --> 02:41:03,158
(The big match between Kim Si Won and Choi Ho Jong)

4164
02:41:03,159 --> 02:41:05,459
(It has finally come.)

4165
02:41:05,860 --> 02:41:07,798
The person in 1st Class is being reduced to 1,

4166
02:41:07,799 --> 02:41:10,468
and it's too big a shame for Ho Jong and I...

4167
02:41:10,469 --> 02:41:11,529
to face one another.

4168
02:41:11,530 --> 02:41:13,398
(He can only laugh.)

4169
02:41:13,399 --> 02:41:14,638
But it's entertaining.

4170
02:41:14,639 --> 02:41:15,670
(Group 2)

4171
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:17,209
This one will be interesting too.

4172
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:18,840
Gosh, what do we do?

4173
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:20,539
I want to steal it.

4174
02:41:20,540 --> 02:41:22,739
Oh, this will be my stage.

4175
02:41:22,879 --> 02:41:24,180
I'll take the First Class.

4176
02:41:24,709 --> 02:41:26,649
Gosh, I really have to keep my spot.

4177
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,989
This could really be a difficult fight.

4178
02:41:30,590 --> 02:41:32,250
(Group 3)

4179
02:41:33,290 --> 02:41:34,658
This group is tough too.

4180
02:41:34,659 --> 02:41:37,359
Moo Gan or Kyu Nyeon...

4181
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:38,558
will definitely try to come up.

4182
02:41:38,559 --> 02:41:40,859
That's why I think I should be more alert too.

4183
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:43,468
I'm confident. I don't think there's anyone...

4184
02:41:43,469 --> 02:41:45,128
who seems to be a threat to my First Class.

4185
02:41:45,129 --> 02:41:47,238
I'm in a position where I must go up.

4186
02:41:47,239 --> 02:41:48,699
Hyo Joon and Kyu Nyeon.

4187
02:41:48,700 --> 02:41:50,939
I think I should just look toward those two.

4188
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:54,238
(The beginning of the contemporary dance Class Battle)

4189
02:41:54,239 --> 02:41:55,839
(The fierce competition of the two Firsts, Young Woong and Hye Hyun)

4190
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:58,449
(The battle between awe-inspiring flashy technique...)

4191
02:41:58,450 --> 02:42:00,950
(and bountiful expression)

4192
02:42:01,049 --> 02:42:05,289
(What was the result that left everyone in shock?)

4193
02:42:05,290 --> 02:42:06,889
(To be continued)

4194
02:42:07,889 --> 02:42:09,489
(Day of the Class Battle)

4195
02:42:09,690 --> 02:42:11,029
(The stage lights come on...)

4196
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:12,690
(for the fierce battle of the STF dancers.)

4197
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:17,629
(The first to enter the Class Battle are the ballerinos.)

4198
02:42:18,629 --> 02:42:20,370
The scale is so huge.

4199
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,440
It felt very overwhelming.

4200
02:42:23,909 --> 02:42:25,440
Now, it's really the beginning.

4201
02:42:26,069 --> 02:42:28,079
I should take the First Class.

4202
02:42:28,409 --> 02:42:29,479
(Next, the Korean dancers enter.)

4203
02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:32,648
Let's just do well this once.

4204
02:42:32,649 --> 02:42:33,718
Let's go to First.

4205
02:42:33,719 --> 02:42:36,079
I was nervous, for sure.

4206
02:42:36,250 --> 02:42:38,020
Let's escape from the Under Class.

4207
02:42:38,719 --> 02:42:40,159
It's a battle between Ho Jong and me.

4208
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:42,690
I have no intention of going down from First Class.

4209
02:42:43,590 --> 02:42:45,590
(Lastly, the contemporary dancers enter.)

4210
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:48,930
All the guys who do contemporary dance have great bodies.

4211
02:42:50,299 --> 02:42:52,828
I created this choreography, so I should keep my place.

4212
02:42:52,829 --> 02:42:56,239
I thought I wouldn't feel nervous, but I was so nervous.

4213
02:42:56,510 --> 02:42:58,569
I really want to become First.

4214
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:01,209
(While everyone is bracing themselves before the Class Battle)

4215
02:43:01,510 --> 02:43:02,809
(What is it?)

4216
02:43:04,579 --> 02:43:05,680
(MC Kang Daniel appears, looking out at the dancers.)

4217
02:43:06,079 --> 02:43:07,119
Oh, it's Kang Daniel.

4218
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:08,180
(Amazed)

4219
02:43:08,780 --> 02:43:09,819
It's a celebrity.

4220
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:12,619
The class battle of dancers where they fight with their bodies,

4221
02:43:12,620 --> 02:43:14,259
Stage Fighter. Hello.

4222
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:17,029
I continue to join you dancers since the "Street" series.

4223
02:43:17,030 --> 02:43:19,489
I'm your MC, Kang Daniel. Please look kindly upon me.

4224
02:43:20,430 --> 02:43:23,029
(A rowdy cheer)

4225
02:43:23,030 --> 02:43:24,968
(It's nice to meet you.)

4226
02:43:24,969 --> 02:43:28,799
Today is the day of Stage Fighter's Class Battle.

4227
02:43:29,139 --> 02:43:30,139
(His gaze changes.)

4228
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:33,009
Based on the class you're given in the Class Battle,

4229
02:43:33,010 --> 02:43:35,138
your roles in the first mission of Stage Fighter,

4230
02:43:35,139 --> 02:43:38,610
the Dance Film, will be decided.

4231
02:43:38,809 --> 02:43:42,019
The Firsts will get leading roles who will be able to have solo parts.

4232
02:43:42,020 --> 02:43:43,719
The Seconds will get supporting roles.

4233
02:43:44,049 --> 02:43:45,988
The Unders will be dancing in a large group...

4234
02:43:45,989 --> 02:43:47,760
as an ensemble.

4235
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:49,420
Let's just avoid becoming an Under.

4236
02:43:49,659 --> 02:43:51,429
Becoming an Under would hurt my pride.

4237
02:43:51,430 --> 02:43:53,398
I didn't want to go into the ensemble.

4238
02:43:53,399 --> 02:43:56,458
The Class Battle will be done in Class Movement Evaluations.

4239
02:43:56,459 --> 02:43:59,599
In the Class Movement Evaluations, each dancer must endlessly prove...

4240
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:01,638
that he has the correct level of talent,

4241
02:44:01,639 --> 02:44:03,670
befitting the class he is in.

4242
02:44:04,409 --> 02:44:05,439
This is hard.

4243
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:07,308
We don't know how many dances we will be performing.

4244
02:44:07,309 --> 02:44:08,509
How about he comes to Second?

4245
02:44:08,510 --> 02:44:10,110
Yes.

4246
02:44:10,579 --> 02:44:12,779
(The classes change according to how well they prove themselves.)

4247
02:44:12,780 --> 02:44:13,979
This is humiliating.

4248
02:44:14,219 --> 02:44:15,420
Darn it.

4249
02:44:15,549 --> 02:44:16,690
This is tough.

4250
02:44:17,049 --> 02:44:18,218
I think he is Under.

4251
02:44:18,219 --> 02:44:19,620
Oh, back to Under.

4252
02:44:19,649 --> 02:44:20,889
This is bleeding me dry.

4253
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:22,519
I think I only kept sighing.

4254
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:24,189
If you prove yourself,

4255
02:44:24,190 --> 02:44:28,129
you can keep your class or be promoted to a higher class.

4256
02:44:28,530 --> 02:44:29,859
The dancer who will be promoted from Under...

4257
02:44:29,860 --> 02:44:31,628
- This is an extreme plot twist. - I'm getting goosebumps.

4258
02:44:31,629 --> 02:44:33,169
If you cannot do so,

4259
02:44:33,170 --> 02:44:36,100
you could get demoted to a lower class.

4260
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:38,609
Through the Class Battle, there will only be one dancer...

4261
02:44:38,610 --> 02:44:41,009
who will become the First...

4262
02:44:41,010 --> 02:44:42,308
in each group.

4263
02:44:42,309 --> 02:44:43,449
(There is only 1 1st in each group.)

4264
02:44:43,450 --> 02:44:45,509
There was only 1 spot for the 1st.

4265
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:47,879
This is a spot we need to fight tooth and nail for.

4266
02:44:48,020 --> 02:44:49,619
I really want to take this spot.

4267
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:51,049
I will never go back down.

4268
02:44:51,489 --> 02:44:53,120
I don't want anyone to take it. It's mine.

4269
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:56,019
I hope you soar high to the class you want...

4270
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:58,729
by showing off all of the skills that you have.

4271
02:44:58,829 --> 02:45:01,798
Believe in yourselves and exude all of your passion.

4272
02:45:01,799 --> 02:45:03,870
From now on, it's war.

4273
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,398
Since I choreographed this, I believe I'll take First.

4274
02:45:07,399 --> 02:45:10,170
I'm confident my class won't change.

4275
02:45:10,969 --> 02:45:13,878
Soon, the Class Battle for ballet...

4276
02:45:13,879 --> 02:45:16,340
will begin on Stage Fighter.

4277
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:18,548
The ballerinos of Ballet Group 1,

4278
02:45:18,549 --> 02:45:21,649
please wait backstage.

4279
02:45:22,750 --> 02:45:23,819
I want to see it soon.

4280
02:45:24,020 --> 02:45:25,619
I am curious about the ballet performance.

4281
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:27,360
- About what they'll do. - I think it'll be interesting.

4282
02:45:27,860 --> 02:45:29,089
Is it starting now?

4283
02:45:29,090 --> 02:45:31,829
The Under Class ballerinos will enter first.

4284
02:45:32,059 --> 02:45:33,829
Ballerino Choi Kyu Tae.

4285
02:45:34,559 --> 02:45:36,430
Ballerino Kim Tae Yeon.

4286
02:45:36,770 --> 02:45:37,799
Looking good!

4287
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:40,139
The vibe they have from the moment they come onstage...

4288
02:45:40,370 --> 02:45:41,500
That's important.

4289
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:43,269
Right, they're taking the stage.

4290
02:45:43,270 --> 02:45:44,739
He's entering with determination.

4291
02:45:45,069 --> 02:45:46,680
I like this kind of vibe.

4292
02:45:47,340 --> 02:45:50,350
The Second Class, Ballerino Kim Sang Young.

4293
02:45:50,879 --> 02:45:52,780
Ballerino Moon Jun On.

4294
02:45:53,049 --> 02:45:55,078
- Ballerino Kang Yun Gu. - Looking good!

4295
02:45:55,079 --> 02:45:56,790
Ballerino Jeon Tae Hu.

4296
02:45:57,319 --> 02:45:58,389
They must be nervous.

4297
02:45:58,649 --> 02:46:00,558
Lastly, the First Class.

4298
02:46:00,559 --> 02:46:02,488
Ballerino Kim Yu Chan.

4299
02:46:02,489 --> 02:46:04,489
- Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho. - Nice.

4300
02:46:04,690 --> 02:46:06,958
These are all eight dancers of the Ballet Class Battle,

4301
02:46:06,959 --> 02:46:09,200
judging group one.

4302
02:46:09,430 --> 02:46:12,129
Ballerinos have such beautiful physiques.

4303
02:46:12,430 --> 02:46:14,370
They have long legs and beautiful builds.

4304
02:46:14,670 --> 02:46:15,969
I know. They have such nice proportions.

4305
02:46:16,770 --> 02:46:19,010
How can they be like that? Why couldn't they share some with me?

4306
02:46:19,370 --> 02:46:20,779
I wish I could have some more length in my legs.

4307
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:21,909
Hey, butt out.

4308
02:46:22,379 --> 02:46:24,479
I'm right here. I'm the more urgent case.

4309
02:46:24,879 --> 02:46:27,280
Yu Chan. Gosh, his waist would be worth a million dollars.

4310
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:31,020
The guy on the left in the middle. His looks are all I can see.

4311
02:46:31,549 --> 02:46:34,260
Yu Chan and Gyeong Ho are rivals to begin with.

4312
02:46:34,489 --> 02:46:37,690
I totally want to beat Kang Gyeong Ho.

4313
02:46:38,430 --> 02:46:40,429
It bothers me a lot that it's Yu Chan.

4314
02:46:40,430 --> 02:46:41,860
I really want to beat him, actually.

4315
02:46:42,500 --> 02:46:45,299
(And the 2nd and Under dancers are vying for the 1st Class.)

4316
02:46:45,629 --> 02:46:46,669
(Glancing)

4317
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:48,739
I really wanted the spot in the front.

4318
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:50,940
Let's try to take it.

4319
02:46:51,340 --> 02:46:53,738
I think it's more entertaining...

4320
02:46:53,739 --> 02:46:55,239
to take someone else's spot.

4321
02:46:56,010 --> 02:46:59,280
Now, we will begin the Class Battle of Ballet Group One.

4322
02:46:59,979 --> 02:47:01,579
I'm so looking forward to this. Goodness.

4323
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,120
I'm nervous.

4324
02:47:03,790 --> 02:47:04,920
First position.

4325
02:47:08,559 --> 02:47:09,590
Lights.

4326
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:14,600
Music, start.

4327
02:47:15,930 --> 02:47:17,828
Five, four,

4328
02:47:17,829 --> 02:47:21,670
three, two, one. Go.

4329
02:47:22,069 --> 02:47:26,110
(Who will be the one to take the only 1st spot in Group 1?)

4330
02:47:26,739 --> 02:47:28,639
(Next week)

4331
02:47:33,250 --> 02:47:34,450
(What do we do about the left side?)

4332
02:47:35,149 --> 02:47:36,548
(I haven't thought of that yet.)

4333
02:47:36,549 --> 02:47:37,649
I haven't thought of that yet.

4334
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:39,318
(But you're our teacher.)

4335
02:47:39,319 --> 02:47:41,289
(Keep acting like a fool.)

4336
02:47:41,290 --> 02:47:42,859
(That'll be good for me.)

4337
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:45,329
(If he's like this, I could go up to First.)

4338
02:47:45,829 --> 02:47:47,559
(This is my chance. I have to grab it, no matter what.)

4339
02:47:48,129 --> 02:47:50,030
(I could go up.)

4340
02:47:50,729 --> 02:47:52,398
(Stirring)

4341
02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:53,469
(Please...)

4342
02:47:53,770 --> 02:47:55,699
(I wish they wouldn't do techniques.)

4343
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:58,270
(We have to avoid technique the most.)

4344
02:47:58,909 --> 02:48:00,679
(Hyeok Jung is the one who's good at doing the fancy stuff.)

4345
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:02,879
(Please let it be something I can get promoted with.)

4346
02:48:06,649 --> 02:48:07,679
(This is big trouble.)

4347
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:09,249
(HIs choreography won't be enough.)

4348
02:48:09,250 --> 02:48:10,619
(I was a little anxious.)

4349
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:13,489
(I'm not sure I can do Hyeok Jung's choreography.)

4350
02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:15,459
(The Contemporary Dance Class Battle judging group 2 is revealed.)

4351
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:17,489
(I think Young Woong will be in Group 2 as well.)

4352
02:48:17,790 --> 02:48:18,790
(If you make one wrong move,)

4353
02:48:18,791 --> 02:48:20,299
(you might lose your spot.)

4354
02:48:20,729 --> 02:48:21,729
(Do you know what's important?)

4355
02:48:21,730 --> 02:48:22,959
(We're doing this position.)

4356
02:48:23,059 --> 02:48:24,529
(I think I was anxious.)

4357
02:48:24,530 --> 02:48:26,069
(Who'll take the leading role in the Contemporary Dance Class Battle?)
