1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,820
(Stage Fighter)

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,018
Please tell us the class you got...

3
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,359
in the Class Battle.

4
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,460
Under Class.

5
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:24,760
I got Under Class.

6
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,000
- Under Class. - Under Class.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm in Under Class.

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,640
I felt really ashamed and embarrassed.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,169
I'm worse than Yun Hyeok Jung?

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,578
This feels wrong. Gosh.

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,679
It's right.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,280
I'm jealous.

13
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,749
Being in Under Class is humiliating.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,789
Darn it.

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,389
Under Class gets a stool.

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,759
Our backs will hurt after the show.

17
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,630
First Class is sitting in the front.

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,729
The First Class seats are like from a screening.

19
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,929
Under Class is doing the group dance.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,029
(Group dance: A dance performed in a group onstage...)

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,438
(by people who are not the main characters)

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,010
I'm in the ensemble for the Dance Film.

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,079
We're the ones decorating the back,

24
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,480
like a nice backdrop.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,609
I might barely be seen on the screen.

26
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,280
It's a shame I'm in the ensemble.

27
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,419
I'm infuriated.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,219
Leading role, supporting role, and ensemble.

29
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,120
These classes are unfair.

30
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,689
Our makeup and outfits are very different.

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,000
It made me realize the class I'm in is critical.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,029
I'll take the next chance.

33
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,968
(The brutal hierarchy is felt by every part of the body.)

34
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:41,009
There's no end when you wonder...

35
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,438
why you're in such a situation.

36
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,379
Do your best in the given situation,

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,149
and someone will see...

38
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,609
and acknowledge you one day.

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,349
The group dance is amazing.

40
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,019
Nice.

41
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,120
- They are wonderful. - Right?

42
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,719
That's a perfect group dance.

43
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,090
(Amazed)

44
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:01,489
Good job.

45
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,560
(This is what you call a group dance.)

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,959
How cool.

47
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,468
Either way, we're Under Class.

48
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,629
We might as well ace it.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,240
- Cheer up, guys! Let's do this! - Let's do this!

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,169
We'll show everyone what group dance is.

51
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,739
Without the ensemble,

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,009
First and Second Classes can't shine.

53
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,550
The more we support the main role, the more we'll shine.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,020
We must make the leading and supporting roles shine.

55
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,918
You look good in that.

56
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,120
Though I won't appear much, I'm doing my best...

57
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,990
in the group dance.

58
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,400
Salute to them.

59
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,330
Nice.

60
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,969
When it comes to dance, group dance must exist.

61
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,509
I lacked in many parts.

62
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,550
But the ensemble helped me out a lot.

63
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,218
Thank you for following my poor instructions.

64
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,050
- Don't say that. - Well done.

65
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,188
- You're the best! - Let's go!

66
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,289
Let's go.

67
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,460
Great work, ensemble.

68
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,929
Thanks to your hard work,

69
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,659
the main roles shined more.

70
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,530
- Good job. - Well done.

71
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:17,840
I was very grateful to the ensemble.

72
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,569
Thank you,

73
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,770
ensemble dancers.

74
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,409
I appreciate the ensemble.

75
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,610
Thank you, ensemble.

76
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,619
(With great passion and effort, )

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,650
(the ensemble brings light to the performance.)

78
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,259
(Thank you to the 40 ensemble dancers.)

79
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,250
(Stage Fighter)

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,150
The genre of the next class evaluation is...

81
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,179
contemporary dance.

82
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,379
(The day has come!)

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,688
(Let's go, contemporary dance!)

84
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,718
Let's go.

85
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,089
(The princes are excited.)

86
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,360
It'll be fun.

87
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,560
I'm curious. Very curious.

88
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,529
Here's the cast lineup, decided through the Casting Audition,

89
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,470
for the work's main roles.

90
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,000
Why am I nervous?

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,370
(What happened at the Casting Audition?)

92
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,569
We can...

93
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,739
What's that?

94
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,579
- "Vampire Sonata?" - The song title is "Bones."

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,050
The leading roles are the Count Vampire and his two sons.

96
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,578
- Nice. - We're counts.

97
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,019
- Count Vampire. - I know, right?

98
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,490
What are we?

99
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,959
"Hunter Leader 1, Hunter Leader 2, Vampires 1, 2, 3, and 4."

100
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,459
I want to become the leader.

101
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,758
It's obvious I'm the hunter leader.

102
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,888
Count me in.

103
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,629
Let's shoot arrows.

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,199
We're the hunters hunting down vampires.

105
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,569
I'm a hunter. We'll catch the vampires.

106
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,239
The "Hunters 1, 2, and 3" hurt my pride.

107
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,300
- It can't be helped. - What?

108
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,909
(Contemporary Dance Main Supporting Role Casting Audition)

109
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,109
- How does the supporting role work? - It's us six, right?

110
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,810
The six of us will go through war.

111
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,008
The 3 leading roles will each select 2 supporting roles...

112
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,350
and audition together.

113
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,818
- Is the 1st Class choosing us? - Yes, 2 each.

114
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:15,819
I see.

115
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,758
The leading roles can choose the same supporting dancer.

116
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,828
Get chosen again, and we might have to dance three times.

117
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,790
You get more auditions by being chosen.

118
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,929
Supporting roles not chosen by leading roles...

119
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,500
can audition at the choreographer's discretion.

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,639
- So we might not get chosen? - Yes, it's a possibility.

121
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,769
We need to beg them to choose us.

122
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,709
Look at them with begging eyes.

123
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,939
Picking the right pair is crucial too.

124
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,879
The three must be on the same page.

125
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,680
One, two, three.

126
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,148
Fall back, then stretch.

127
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:49,750
Pull down. One, two.

128
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,259
- This is how much I memorized. - That's a lot.

129
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,560
(Focused)

130
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,199
(Come to me, main supporting role.)

131
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,829
(In the zone)

132
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:02,729
- How does it start? - Jin Ho...

133
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,769
was doing everything he could.

134
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,110
I will be First Class.

135
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,639
It's about time I got the main role. Let's do this.

136
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,540
(Yun Hyeok Jung is quietly practicing alone.)

137
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,610
I'm confident in dancing such moves.

138
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,180
I'll most likely be the best among the six.

139
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,720
Let's do it.

140
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,719
As it's a duet, our moves must be identical...

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,860
to grab attention. That's why I had Hyeok Jung in mind.

142
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,560
(My plan is all set.)

143
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,230
(Kim Hyun Ho is here to select the supporting roles.)

144
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,399
(Nervous)

145
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:38,540
I have an idea in mind.

146
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,669
Can you dance with all you've got?

147
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,670
- Okay. - Okay.

148
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,980
- Dance powerfully? - I can pull it off.

149
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,708
Jae Jin and Tae Young.

150
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,649
Hyeok Jung and Jin Ho. You're a team.

151
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,250
Can Hye Hyun's team step aside?

152
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,119
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

153
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,319
(They didn't get chosen.)

154
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,290
All of them are physically incredible.

155
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,559
We do lack physically.

156
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,758
(Bummed out)

157
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,019
(The first pair is Ryu Tae Young and Kim Jae Jin.)

158
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
(Staggering)

159
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,259
(Glaring)

160
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:08,069
This is bad. I couldn't seem energetic.

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,870
(Reading his face)

162
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,139
(Watching closely)

163
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,109
(Ryu Tae Young and Kim Jae Jin finish with disappointment.)

164
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,779
(Kim Hyun Ho is making a strange face.)

165
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,509
Jae Jin.

166
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,278
You have a big body. The moves have to be powerful.

167
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,350
Does it look weak?

168
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
It's over if we don't exceed his expectations.

169
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,688
(Focused)

170
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,660
(The second pair is Yun Hyeok Jung and Park Jin Ho.)

171
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,829
(Powerful)

172
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,160
Gosh.

173
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,899
(A light jump)

174
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,459
(Wary)

175
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,470
(Yun Hyeok Jung and Park Jin Ho have finished.)

176
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,209
(Like this.)

177
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:51,709
They're good.

178
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,209
(Nodding)

179
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,620
The dancers who will audition with me are...

180
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,319
- Yun Hyeok Jung... - That's it. I knew it.

181
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,619
I became desperate.

182
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,688
(His mouth is dry.)

183
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:05,689
(Please.)

184
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,259
And Park Jin Ho.

185
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,789
I choose you two.

186
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,089
(Yun Hyeok Jung and Park Jin Ho are chosen.)

187
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,160
Those three are in great harmony.

188
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,069
The work will look nice if the three dance together.

189
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,970
Their energy complemented each other.

190
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,269
Here's our First Class. Our hero.

191
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,810
- Are you confident in lifting? - I'm confident in everything.

192
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,850
I can do anything. Use me to your heart's content.

193
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
Awesome.

194
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,389
Eun Hyuk and Jae Jin.

195
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,148
Tae Young and Hyeok Jung.

196
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,690
Hye Hyun and Jin Ho.

197
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,360
Can you dance all at the same time?

198
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,190
Three duets altogether.

199
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,590
I must catch his eye no matter what.

200
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,100
I will have him feel my energy this time.

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,870
We should be in sync, but I'll attract more attention.

202
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:51,169
(The 6 main supporting role candidates start to dance in pairs.)

203
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,669
(A powerful rotation)

204
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,549
(Focused)

205
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,360
(The pairs are done with the choreography.)

206
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,889
Goodness.

207
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,629
(Contemplating deeply)

208
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,230
(The supporting dancers put up a fight.)

209
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,570
You're light...

210
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,638
compared to Hyeok Jung.

211
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,870
(You punk.)

212
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,740
The two supporting roles taking the audition with me are...

213
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,709
Kim Hye Hyun...

214
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,778
(For main lead role candidate Kim Young Woong)

215
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,250
and Park Jin Ho.

216
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,450
Okay. Thank you.

217
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,850
- Thank you. - Thank you.

218
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,850
(Anxious)

219
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,720
- Hi. - He's here. Our First Class.

220
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,629
I'm looking...

221
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,359
for the cleanest moves.

222
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
- Got it. - All right.

223
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:52,658
(Okay.)

224
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,399
- Okay. - Understood.

225
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,370
Hyeok Jung and Hye Hyun. Please be a pair.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,970
(The first pair is Kim Hye Hyun and Yun Hyeok Jung.)

227
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
(Jumping high)

228
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,538
I can't lift you higher than that, so give off a better vibe.

229
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,610
(Okay.)

230
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,750
(Kim Hye Hyun and Yun Hyeok Jung are done.)

231
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:18,460
Thank you.

232
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:20,990
(The second pair is Kim Jae Jin and Park Jin Ho.)

233
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,870
(Wary)

234
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,029
(Completely focused)

235
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,940
(Kim Jae Jin and Park Jin Ho are done.)

236
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,378
(It's time for him to choose after watching the pairs.)

237
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,850
The two dancers who will take the audition with me are...

238
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,389
Yun Hyeok Jung and Kim Hye Hyun.

239
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,190
You had a heavier and cleaner vibe.

240
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,690
(Smiling brightly)

241
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:55,960
Thank you.

242
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,429
(Bummed out)

243
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,460
Let's wait a bit.

244
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,139
I no longer have the opportunity to audition together...

245
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,840
with a First Class dancer.

246
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,740
I might not even get any auditions.

247
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,778
That was what I thought.

248
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,980
(How will the Main Supporting Role Casting Audition go?)

249
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,109
The Main Supporting Role Casting Audition...

250
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,120
will begin.

251
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,148
This is where the killers hunt down...

252
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,320
the Count Vampire.

253
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,018
As the supporting roles can outshine...

254
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,229
the main lead role, the Count Vampire, in this part,

255
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,259
please pull it off well.

256
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,058
Only when I become...

257
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,668
the main supporting role can I move up to First Class.

258
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,299
I must take the main role.

259
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,870
It's time I got the main role. Let's do this.

260
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,268
The first main lead role candidate,

261
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,340
Jung Hye Seong, chose...

262
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,909
Yun Hyeok Jung and Kim Hye Hyun.

263
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,750
Yun Hyeok Jung's flexibility and physique...

264
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,610
could be a difficult hurdle to overcome.

265
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,219
If I become the hunter leader,

266
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,750
it'll be sexy.

267
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,620
It'll look sexy and powerful,

268
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,288
like a cherry on top.

269
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:00,319
(Laughing)

270
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,389
That's what I think.

271
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,590
First position.

272
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,299
Music,

273
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,570
start.

274
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,829
(Main Supporting Role Casting Audition)

275
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,139
(Jung Hye Seong, lead role, Hyeok Jung and Hye Hyun, supporting roles)

276
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,610
(Amazed)

277
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:18,909
Gorgeous.

278
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,109
(Their techniques are in sync.)

279
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,450
They're good.

280
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,278
(Keeping in check)

281
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,319
(Yun Hyeok Jung and Kim Hye Hyun do the difficult techniques well.)

282
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,259
The three are great but not in harmony.

283
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,090
(The three dancers were not dancing together in the trio part.)

284
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,428
There was a lack of connection among the three.

285
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,159
- They didn't feel like a whole. - They weren't complete.

286
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,099
There was a part where you three could connect.

287
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,169
But even in that part, you all danced separately.

288
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,138
Excuse me for saying this,

289
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,808
but here's what I felt from Yun Hyeok Jung.

290
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,840
(Nervous)

291
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,279
He's never giving up the main lead role.

292
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,278
(He got busted.)

293
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,350
It has to be him.

294
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,289
(When the Main Supporting Role Casting Audition was revealed)

295
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,259
(The main lead role is for me!)

296
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,819
(For me, too!)

297
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,658
(No. My body is perfect for it.)

298
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,558
(A useless competition among main supporting roles)

299
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,829
(That should be mine.)

300
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,860
(What a bummer.)

301
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,969
(His dark intentions can be felt in his dance moves.)

302
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,730
Your feelings sure are expressed in dance.

303
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,470
His muscles are full of ambition.

304
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,168
A contest is done alone.

305
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,309
But this is a group project.

306
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,678
It's not something you can ignore.

307
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,409
And he noticed that objectively.

308
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,378
It's a shame that my desire to become...

309
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,619
the main supporting role, at least,

310
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,950
ruined the trio's harmony.

311
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,619
Kim Young Woong chose...

312
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Park Jin Ho and Kim Hye Hyun.

313
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,500
Jin Ho will do his best.

314
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,330
I was worried and held him in check.

315
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,069
I shouldn't lose the role and regret it.

316
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,600
The hunter leader. It belongs to me.

317
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,138
(Main Supporting Role Casting Audition)

318
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,370
(Kim Young Woong, lead role, Jin Ho and Hye Hyun, supporting roles)

319
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,308
(Lifting)

320
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,740
- Nice. - Nice.

321
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,479
(Jin Ho grooves to the rhythm like flowing water.)

322
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,549
(Amazed)

323
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,480
They're good.

324
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,548
Connection, yes.

325
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,490
This is good.

326
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:20,499
(The three finished the performance without any mistakes.)

327
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,000
Very good.

328
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,529
That was cool.

329
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,798
It was much better.

330
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,999
It was a much better performance.

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,308
(Bothered)

332
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,939
Jin Ho and Hye Hyun left a good impression.

333
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,479
And I believe you played the powerful count killer...

334
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,048
perfectly.

335
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,210
You made me proud as the choreographer.

336
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,950
I think I can get the main supporting role.

337
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,449
Hyun Ho, I want to know...

338
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,590
why you chose those two.

339
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,119
I chose...

340
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,289
the 2 best dancers in the 2nd Class.

341
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,859
They look alike.

342
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,158
They all have the lizard or dinosaur face.

343
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,168
You're right.

344
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,768
During practice,

345
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,240
I realized that the three of us could put on a great performance.

346
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,538
Hyeok Jung and I make a good team,

347
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,039
and we feed off each other's energy.

348
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,039
Hyeok Jung and Jin Ho look great together.

349
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,808
I thought that the three of us would create...

350
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,449
better energy and synergy.

351
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,018
I want to make up...

352
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,820
for what I failed to show previously.

353
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Go.

354
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:20,019
(Hyun Ho, lead role, Jin Ho and Hyeok Jung, supporting roles)

355
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,169
I like the expression.

356
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:33,470
They even have the perfect height.

357
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,740
That's so cool.

358
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,049
That's good.

359
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,418
They're good.

360
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,389
Hyeok Jung looks like a hunter.

361
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,590
He's got a strong energy. He might catch him.

362
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,789
Good connection.

363
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,730
Very nice.

364
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,100
Nice.

365
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,299
- They're cool. - That was strong. Jin Ho.

366
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,038
He was a real hunter.

367
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,869
Yes. I liked the hunters.

368
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,709
Hyeok Jung and Jin Ho.

369
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,709
You two perfectly supported Hyun Ho together,

370
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,319
and it even made him look better.

371
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,219
I could tell that it was a scene of the hunters...

372
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,049
hunting the count.

373
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,089
We had such good teamwork.

374
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,959
And I could feel the energy as we performed.

375
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,590
I doubt that anyone can beat us.

376
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,600
I thought the three of us might get the part.

377
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,999
Don't you think the three of them will get it?

378
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,529
They looked pretty cool.

379
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,870
I think we have the winners in Second Class.

380
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,499
What about the ones that weren't chosen, though?

381
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,870
I know, right? They don't even get a chance?

382
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,739
I heard that we would get a chance to audition...

383
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,378
if the coaches wanted,

384
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,480
but that still wasn't a sure opportunity.

385
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,610
I thought that I might not even get a chance to audition.

386
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,479
They were all standing there and performing,

387
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,089
and I was only sitting there.

388
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,850
That made me feel ashamed.

389
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,028
We would like to see another combination.

390
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,729
We wanted to see the supporting roles...

391
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,299
that weren't chosen by the lead roles.

392
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,798
Ryu Tae Young.

393
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,568
(My time has come.)

394
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,338
I could at least show them my dance.

395
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,439
I was relieved.

396
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,669
(Tae Young got to audition with Young Woong and Hyeok Jung.)

397
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,640
(Getting nervous for no reason)

398
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,439
(Exhaling)

399
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,679
Music...

400
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,250
I got the opportunity to stand here,

401
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,250
so I wanted to make it mine.

402
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,519
(What's Tae Young's performance like after a long wait?)

403
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,489
That's cool.

404
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,529
(Gulping)

405
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,500
Tae Young is good.

406
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,640
I was going to crush it.

407
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,108
(The highlight)

408
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,139
(Thrilled)

409
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,670
(He knows what's up.)

410
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,410
- I got the chills. - Right.

411
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,920
It's such a different hunter.

412
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,848
Right? With Hyeok Jung.

413
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:03,849
It wasn't so bad.

414
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,890
- This is the problem. - I know.

415
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,858
His hair was...

416
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:07,859
(His hair fluttered!)

417
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,460
I told you that his long hair beat mine from the get-go.

418
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,459
You should also let your hair down next time.

419
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,799
I can't do it like him, though.

420
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,528
If I do it...

421
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,599
(Seductive?)

422
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,140
I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?

423
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:24,909
Tae Young was an unexpected rival.

424
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,480
I was very worried.

425
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,910
Jin Ho was pretty good.

426
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,808
He and Hyeok Jung made...

427
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,150
- A good pair. - a good pair.

428
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,049
But Tae Young showed up out of nowhere.

429
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,149
At first, he was the hunter I had in mind.

430
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,490
But he gives off a different hunter's vibe.

431
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,058
So, you have to choose.

432
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,460
(What's Seong Chang Yong's choice?)

433
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,899
I will now announce Hunter Leaders 1 and 2,

434
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,229
the main supporting roles...

435
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,769
of the Contemporary Dance Film.

436
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,869
Either Hyeok Jung and Tae Young or Hyeok Jung and Jin Ho.

437
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,069
I believe so too.

438
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,839
The dancers who are cast as the main supporting roles are...

439
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,609
Yun Hyeok Jung...

440
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,149
Hyeok Jung and Jin Ho.

441
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,419
They had such good chemistry,

442
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,920
so I wasn't sure if they'd cast me.

443
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,358
It felt like my life was on a scale.

444
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,019
I was worried that I'd lose this chance right before my eyes.

445
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,400
And Ryu Tae Young.

446
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:19,729
Congratulations.

447
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,029
(Trying to smile)

448
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,670
- This is so dramatic. - It really is.

449
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,239
To prove that the judges were right,

450
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,779
I promised myself to try harder.

451
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,548
(And the most upset person)

452
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,379
I'm always in second place, and it's driving me insane.

453
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm always in second place.

454
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,449
I'll do my best.

455
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,548
(The main supporting role is excited in front of him.)

456
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,749
I was looking forward to performing with you.

457
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,920
So was I.

458
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,018
(Contemporary Dance Film main supporting roles)

459
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,319
(Yun Hyeok Jung and Ryu Tae Young)

460
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:47,859
I'll risk my life for this.

461
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,130
- Even your life? - I'll risk my life.

462
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:51,930
You're very determined.

463
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,729
(When the Casting Audition was announced)

464
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,868
"Main lead roles?"

465
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,329
Turn your survival mindset on.

466
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,538
It's a battle between us three.

467
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,569
(Only 1 lead role will get the main lead role.)

468
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,409
- There are Part 1 and Part 2. - You're right.

469
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,509
We perform with the ensemble once and the supporting roles once.

470
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:09,380
Part 2 is 1 main lead role and 15 ensemble dancers.

471
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,018
The main lead roles set the formation with 15 people,

472
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,190
and they judge you 1 by 1.

473
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,719
Maybe, Hye Seong will go 1st with the 15 dancers.

474
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,629
Then, Young Woong will go. It's 1 by 1.

475
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,629
So, we have to dance three times.

476
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,460
- You're right. - This should be tough for us.

477
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,200
But the ones...

478
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,799
who have experience in choreographing will do well.

479
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,069
In the First Class...

480
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,739
(The 3 1st dancers are practicing the audition part for lead roles.)

481
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
(Jumping high)

482
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,608
(The two lead role candidates are practicing hard, )

483
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,680
(but he tilts his head.)

484
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,649
(Hyun Ho tries the move by himself.)

485
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,549
I thought that I might be at a disadvantage here.

486
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,219
(When the Casting Audition was announced)

487
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,649
(The main lead role's movements required classical fundamentals.)

488
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,118
(Worried)

489
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,288
Hyun Ho...

490
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:55,788
majored in street dance,

491
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,098
and he found it difficult to express the lines.

492
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,160
So, he seemed to be struggling with this mission.

493
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,169
They would obviously be good at this,

494
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,839
so what winning move could I add to beat them?

495
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,970
Then, it hit me. I should focus on stage directions.

496
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,508
I have a lot of experience as a dancer.

497
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:15,650
I've learned how to change formations too.

498
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,250
I was thinking about which dancer would be good at these moves.

499
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:21,919
- Okay. - I wanted to...

500
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,019
differentiate myself from them.

501
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,258
Cheer up, guys.

502
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:29,630
Let's find our way up.

503
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,058
Under. Let's go!

504
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,730
- Let's go! - Let's go!

505
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:35,028
- You were so cool. - I'm Under.

506
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,599
I know. You performed as an Under dancer should.

507
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,838
(Their friendship crumbles.)

508
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,368
You don't float as you jump. It's like,

509
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,869
"Let's go!" and you come back.

510
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,369
"Let's go!" and you come back.

511
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,278
"Come on!" and come back. Okay?

512
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,150
- Okay. - Having Dong Hoon makes it so easy.

513
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,809
He's here.

514
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,920
- Hello. - Mr. Kim!

515
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,849
- You're finally here. - All right!

516
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,619
Were you all practicing hard?

517
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,528
First of all,

518
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,088
I want the better dancers to be in the front. So...

519
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,558
(He wants to put the ace dancers in the front.)

520
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,159
- Jang June Hyuk? - Yes.

521
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,029
Yang Seong Yun, Kwon Yo Han, and Go Dong Hoon.

522
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,400
Stand here, please.

523
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm motivated all of a sudden.

524
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,170
I start at the center at first.

525
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,839
Jin Woo needs to follow me here.

526
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:20,410
Yes, spread out.

527
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,479
I wanted to come up with stage directions...

528
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,679
that would make us look like one organism,

529
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,220
rather than having me stand out.

530
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,749
And I thought simply.

531
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,890
It was drawing figures for me.

532
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,389
Make a U.

533
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,058
And an upside-down U.

534
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,990
In diagonal lines.

535
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,589
Good.

536
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,430
We go down in that part.

537
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,068
I'll give you the directions. First...

538
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,528
He kept the moves...

539
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,740
and only told us where to go.

540
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:52,008
I believe Hyun Ho is the one who yielded the biggest effect...

541
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:53,240
with the least change.

542
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,180
Mind the gap, guys.

543
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,379
Go deep.

544
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,749
- Like this? - Yes.

545
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,249
Go down! Down! Up! Down!

546
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,219
We had to pull this off in a short time,

547
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,118
so I thought Hyun Ho was a great leader...

548
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,989
in that he gave us firm directions...

549
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,859
and yielded the best possible results.

550
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,858
That will be all. Thank you.

551
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,969
- Good work. - Great work.

552
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,099
- Nice. - Good work.

553
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,200
I like the formation.

554
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,739
- You can go now. Please, leave. - Sorry?

555
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,909
- Get out of here? Bye. - Yes.

556
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,910
(Losing all his charisma)

557
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,710
It's a wound of honor.

558
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,809
You should throw that out.

559
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,150
This is not easy.

560
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,450
- He's here. - Welcome.

561
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,149
Hello.

562
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,650
(The second lead role, Jung Hye Seong, enters.)

563
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,460
We're halfway there.

564
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,420
He starts right away.

565
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,289
He must have chosen the dancers too.

566
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,130
Do you get it?

567
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:48,670
That's the rank insignia for a sergeant first class.

568
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,500
He's detailed, as expected.

569
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,299
Can you start by holding each other's arms?

570
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,039
To look strong.

571
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,970
This is cool.

572
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,479
I'll show you the second formation.

573
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,808
- Okay. - He's thorough.

574
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,480
He came up with good formations.

575
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,150
You extend as you spread out.

576
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,619
Then, overlap.

577
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,720
I want you to come in tighter.

578
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,690
Hye Seong already had everything in his head.

579
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,588
He had planned who should stand where,

580
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,730
and I thought he was meticulous.

581
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,299
I think we should try this with Hye Seong.

582
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,669
Right. But I'm barely in the formation.

583
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,699
Is that right?

584
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,399
I move separately,

585
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,140
so maybe, we can try the last part where I go in.

586
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,608
I'll only be in the front, not in the formation.

587
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,609
Okay.

588
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,279
Are you going to stand here, Hye Seong?

589
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,848
No, I'll be over here.

590
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,179
(Right in front of them)

591
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,720
So, you should have your back to us.

592
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,750
We should probably show our arms only.

593
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,059
The ensemble and the solo dancer were separate,

594
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,220
so we felt like backup dancers.

595
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:50,390
Hye Seong and we were performing separately.

596
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,598
If we were to do the Dance Film this way,

597
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,559
we would barely be seen.

598
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Thank you.

599
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,028
- Good work. - Good work.

600
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,669
- He gave neat directions, though. - Right?

601
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,768
- I loved your directions. - Me too.

602
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:02,868
- Good luck. - Thanks!

603
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:03,869
(Feeling bitter)

604
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,140
There's only one left, at least.

605
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,440
We do this and memorize the order.

606
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,909
- He's here. - The hero is here.

607
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,950
Master!

608
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,650
He's finally here!

609
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,149
First, I thought we had an opposing relation.

610
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,819
So, we're going to stand apart.

611
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:20,788
And we meet as we move.

612
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,930
Then, we stand in a line.

613
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,460
And we turn that into two lines.

614
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,298
Split into two teams,

615
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,529
and we can make a new boundary.

616
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,969
We could gather in the ending...

617
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,500
and create another story.

618
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,739
It was very complicated.

619
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,868
When there are too many different cuts,

620
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,639
it confuses us.

621
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,279
I was slightly worried.

622
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,108
(Young Woong checks the first run.)

623
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,278
Like this.

624
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,319
Could you go like this as you move?

625
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:48,588
- Forward? - Yes.

626
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,189
I think we can do it if we let ourselves loose.

627
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,759
- Let's give it a try. - Sure.

628
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,160
Could you change directions in the same spot?

629
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,329
I think we need a change here.

630
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,690
(Another change?)

631
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:59,598
We need to memorize three of these.

632
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,758
If it gets too complicated...

633
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,268
We had to switch directions...

634
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,068
from the way we memorized them...

635
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,169
and had additional steps.

636
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,440
There was a lot of pressure, for sure.

637
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:09,669
I have too many directions, right?

638
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,709
- No. - Please help me.

639
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,778
I must have gotten too greedy, trying to look for variety.

640
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,480
I was worried.

641
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,380
Thank you.

642
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,118
- Good work. - Good work.

643
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,349
Let's practice the moves.

644
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,118
There are some changes as we move,

645
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,549
so I think we can do it as long as we organize those.

646
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,689
Come up slowly.

647
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,288
(The ensemble practices Young Woong's formation.)

648
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,359
And up.

649
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,730
Go. And 1 and 2.

650
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,058
And three.

651
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,630
- And 5. - And 5.

652
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,999
(Which of these 3 1st dancers will get the main lead role?)

653
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,139
(The Main Lead Role Casting Audition follows.)

654
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
We will now begin the Main Lead Role Casting Audition...

655
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,369
for "Vampire Sonata."

656
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,179
(Contemporary Dance Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

657
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,279
The main lead role, Count Vampire,

658
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,679
is a ruler of a kingdom,

659
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,750
and he's a character with power and charisma.

660
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,749
I'm the oldest of the three.

661
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,389
I can't play the son.

662
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,389
My skin tone is fairer than the other two,

663
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,258
so I think I'm a better fit for Count Vampire.

664
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,759
I was confident that I could get the main lead role.

665
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:06,499
The main lead role candidate,

666
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,069
Kim Young Woong, will go first.

667
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,999
I put emphasis on the relationship...

668
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,900
between the hunter and the vampire.

669
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,109
Music, start.

670
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,579
Five, four,

671
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,509
three, two, one.

672
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,150
Go.

673
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:25,779
It already looks cool.

674
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:38,598
(The hunters busily move behind the main lead role.)

675
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,599
(Well...)

676
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:45,639
(The formations change too frequently in a short part.)

677
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,199
They constantly move at the same time,

678
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,410
so there's no highlight. Right?

679
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,479
(Powerful)

680
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,808
(Still, Young Woong finished it nicely.)

681
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,078
I liked the ending.

682
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,018
(The Casting Audition for Kim Young Woong, )

683
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,788
(a main lead role candidate, ends.)

684
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:04,319
He could have structured it to show himself better,

685
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,219
so I thought that was a shame.

686
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,059
He lacked in terms of detail.

687
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:12,259
But Young Woong's energy...

688
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,659
that I saw last time...

689
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,799
- I didn't feel that. - I didn't.

690
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,839
I think he focused on the ensemble more, though.

691
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:23,009
The formation itself seemed messy.

692
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,109
So, I didn't get a clear picture.

693
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,048
In the moments where you had to stand out,

694
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,348
there were lots of things happening behind you.

695
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:36,190
So, I didn't know where to look.

696
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,819
You could have done better in that sense.

697
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:40,359
It was a bummer.

698
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,389
I got too greedy with the ensemble,

699
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,200
so they must have found it difficult to accept it.

700
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,799
So I felt that I wasn't good enough.

701
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:53,838
Next, Jung Hye Seong, please step forward.

702
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,038
Simple is best.

703
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,669
We kept the directions simple,

704
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,880
but I needed to do really well.

705
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,009
Three, two, one.

706
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,680
Go.

707
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:05,779
(Concentrating)

708
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,729
(It's a simple production with no major changes.)

709
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,990
(Well...)

710
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,529
The production is weak.

711
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,730
(Hye Seong moves away from the ensemble.)

712
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,838
(The main lead role seems remote from the ensemble.)

713
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,440
It's like they're dancing separately.

714
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,008
(The Casting Audition for Jung Hye Seong, )

715
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:40,078
(a main lead role candidate, ends.)

716
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,118
(Hye Seong's audition with the ensemble ends, )

717
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,518
(and the coaches don't look so happy.)

718
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,990
I think the problem was that it was too simple.

719
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:47,858
The way that he ended it by looking behind...

720
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,089
- could have been better. - It was unimpressive.

721
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:53,659
I reckon the ensemble's directions were too simple.

722
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,799
It's true that Hye Seong's movements stood out,

723
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,568
but it made me think that you weren't dancing with the ensemble.

724
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:06,480
So, it could have been better in that sense.

725
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,150
I feel as if the composition was out of balance.

726
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,579
So, I didn't know exactly where to look.

727
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,819
First of all, I wasn't sure about myself.

728
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,650
And I desperately wanted the main lead role...

729
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,720
that I overlooked the harmony with the ensemble.

730
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,220
All I had in mind was to do well and stand out.

731
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,160
So, I misjudged that part.

732
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,029
Kim Hyun Ho, please step forward.

733
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,730
There's a formation that I believe is the highlight.

734
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,469
I'd be grateful...

735
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,410
- if you could look for that. - We need to look for it. Yes.

736
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,640
Oh, he starts at the center.

737
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,808
(Hyun Ho goes into the center of the ensemble.)

738
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:42,048
I usually like surprises.

739
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,078
And I wanted to make a surprise entrance.

740
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,778
He was hiding at first.

741
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:46,880
It was so new.

742
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,890
I realized that you could make yourself stand out that way.

743
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,419
(Looking forward to it)

744
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,459
(Curious)

745
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,960
(What's Hyun Ho's surprise performance?)

746
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,558
(All eyes on him)

747
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,630
He puts the focus on himself.

748
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,130
(Impressed)

749
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,799
(Reading the judges)

750
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,569
(Admiring)

751
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,838
They support him from behind, and he stands out more.

752
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,609
We were able to focus on him sooner as they opened up.

753
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,220
(Highlight 1: Spreading out from the upside-down U formation)

754
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,798
(Highlight 2: Using the 2 diagonal lines)

755
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,000
Nice. Beautiful.

756
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,299
That's nice.

757
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:37,670
It's so good.

758
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:43,670
He stands out more.

759
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,308
(The Casting Audition for Kim Hyun Ho, )

760
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,309
(a main lead role candidate, ends.)

761
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,909
(His choreography caught our attention...)

762
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,108
(with its unique composition.)

763
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:52,149
There were parts where he had good synergy with the ensemble,

764
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,420
so I got anxious.

765
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,319
I could clearly see the highlights...

766
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,859
that you mentioned.

767
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,859
The two diagonal lines and the N-shaped formation.

768
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,528
It was very visible...

769
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,229
that you connected with the ensemble.

770
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,459
(Bowing)

771
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,240
It's interesting because you used the 15 ensemble dancers very well.

772
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,140
Thank you for the performance.

773
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,008
"I've done it."

774
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,509
"I showed them everything I prepared." That was my thought.

775
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,838
I will announce the dancer who will get the main lead role...

776
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,549
as Count Vampire...

777
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,578
in "Vampire Sonata," the Contemporary Dance Film.

778
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,319
I was confident that I could play the part well.

779
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,518
I wanted to give a great performance.

780
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,789
I thought that I could pull it off.

781
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,259
The main lead role, Count Vampire, goes to...

782
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:38,959
(Even I'm getting nervous.)

783
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,858
(Who is it?)

784
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:42,429
(Who's the one dancer to take the main lead role?)

785
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,470
Kim Hyun Ho.

786
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,969
(I've done it.)

787
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,569
You got the part.

788
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,269
Congratulations.

789
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,639
I had a feeling that Hyun Ho would get the main lead role.

790
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,210
He was overwhelmingly better, so he looked cool.

791
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,479
I think I should change my competitors.

792
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,819
I want to place 1st of all 3 genres.

793
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,848
I want to let people know how cool...

794
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,319
contemporary dance is.

795
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:08,558
(Contemporary Dance Film Main Lead Role)

796
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,630
(Kim Hyun Ho)

797
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,730
Is this the abandoned factory?

798
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,499
What is that?

799
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,629
Isn't that Hyun Ho?

800
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,069
The main lead role!

801
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:18,028
(What stirs them before the shoot?)

802
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,038
What's that?

803
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,769
"We look forward to Kim Hyun Ho as Count Vampire."

804
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,910
I want that. I should move up to First.

805
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,739
(A coffee truck only for the main lead role)

806
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,950
The main lead role certainly gets special treatment.

807
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,180
I was jealous.

808
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:34,019
It's embarrassing to have my face all over it.

809
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,450
It was touching, in fact.

810
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,859
The main lead role gets treated differently, indeed.

811
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,959
Guys, this is how great being the main lead role is.

812
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,759
(Hundreds of eyes are aiming at the next opportunity.)

813
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,629
Good luck with today's shoot as well!

814
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,259
- Good luck! - Good luck!

815
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,569
I really will do my best.

816
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,499
(Grinning widely)

817
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,269
(It's time for the ensemble hunters to get changed before filming.)

818
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:57,338
(Checking how they look very seriously)

819
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:58,639
I look great.

820
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,940
Men should have nice hips.

821
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,578
The view from the back. It's very nice.

822
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,018
- It's really pretty. - It makes my legs look long.

823
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,480
- It's neat. - It's comfortable too.

824
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,049
(They finish getting changed.)

825
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,320
- The hunters look like models. - This...

826
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,759
(It's time for some makeup now.)

827
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,860
The ensemble got smokey makeup.

828
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,158
The lead roles got the makeup that made them look handsome.

829
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,799
(Getting handsome)

830
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,769
I was very jealous of the glitters.

831
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,170
I thought, "It would've looked much better on me."

832
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:30,709
"There are no Under and Second Classes for me next time."

833
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,309
(The waiting time before filming)

834
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,010
Is this our waiting room?

835
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,909
There must not have been a space...

836
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,610
to fit all 15 of us in.

837
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,650
We were put in a spare space beside the abandoned factory.

838
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,719
Is this very different from what the lead roles get?

839
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,719
- Theirs is really nice and neat. - Really?

840
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,960
They are treated differently.

841
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,159
Those that didn't get the lead roles must feel so upset.

842
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,130
But I'm not one of them, so it's fine.

843
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,499
The waiting room was very nice, which made me very happy.

844
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,699
We were treated better because we got the lead roles.

845
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,039
- This is so fancy. - This is nice.

846
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,739
I'm so upset.

847
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,170
I should climb up the ranks.

848
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,480
I have a feeling there's something else.

849
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,340
(He is spot on.)

850
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,578
- What is it? - It's playing. What is it?

851
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,448
Hello. I'm Kang Daniel, the MC of Stage Fighter.

852
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:16,320
(Clapping)

853
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,960
- He's here. - Kang Daniel.

854
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,230
Contemporary Dance Film Evaluation for the Class Movement Ceremony...

855
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,829
will be evaluated by other classes.

856
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:27,099
"Evaluated by other classes?"

857
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,559
The dancers in First Class...

858
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,969
will evaluate the dancers in Second and Under Classes.

859
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,469
The dancers in Second Class...

860
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:35,139
will evaluate the dancers in First and Under Classes.

861
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,510
The dancers in Under Class...

862
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,780
will evaluate the dancers in 1st and 2nd Classes.

863
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,009
We can't evaluate ourselves,

864
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,178
- but we'll evaluate other classes. - Other classes.

865
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:43,948
Anyway, we can't get demoted further.

866
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:46,649
It's all about who becomes the candidate to be promoted.

867
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,480
- We have nothing to lose. - We have nothing to lose.

868
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,519
This is the best class.

869
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,559
We're in First Class, so the only thing waiting for us is demotion.

870
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,558
Either get demoted or stay in the same class.

871
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,760
Not getting demoted is most important.

872
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,659
- That's right. - Since we're in the middle.

873
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,130
The dancers to be promoted and demoted...

874
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,400
will be decided by the masters and coaches' final evaluation.

875
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,039
Starting this moment,

876
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,710
evaluate the dancers in the other classes precisely.

877
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,980
It won't be easy to pick one.

878
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,449
But what can we do? That's hierarchy.

879
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,809
This is cruel.

880
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,319
We need to get in...

881
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,189
other class' dancers' good books.

882
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,820
We should do our best.

883
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,960
We're the first Under Class members.

884
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,589
- Let's not forget each other. - Right.

885
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,129
People like him will draw the line as soon as they're promoted.

886
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,189
(Laughing)

887
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,359
- The upper... - "Gosh, Under Class smells."

888
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,428
(He'll cut ties with them faster than anyone else!)

889
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:37,828
(The Under Class dancers enjoy the warm moment.)

890
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,900
(Joking)

891
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:41,340
Under Class has a chance now.

892
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,670
We're no longer inferior.

893
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,380
They won't end this nicely, as I had thought.

894
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,709
This is hard.

895
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,380
(They start filming the Contemporary Dance Film.)

896
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,779
(The dancers prepare themselves physically and mentally.)

897
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,480
We'll start the blocking rehearsal.

898
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,419
(At that moment, something enters the filming site.)

899
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,459
(What is it?)

900
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,289
Hold on. What's that?

901
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,229
He gets a chair.

902
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,388
The main lead role gets a chair.

903
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,428
- The main lead role. - Kim Hyun Ho.

904
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,829
Gosh. They're treating him this well?

905
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,029
That should have been my chair.

906
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,369
My name will be written on the chair next time. "Park Jin Ho."

907
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,340
I gave it my all and became First Class,

908
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,468
but I realized again that this was a survival show.

909
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,939
There was a difference...

910
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,678
between the main lead role and the sub lead role too.

911
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,710
I felt a bit upset.

912
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:25,380
We'll start when you're ready.

913
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,920
It's really cool.

914
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,019
It looks so nice on the screen.

915
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,549
Those two are the sons,

916
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,019
- and he is the father, right? - Yes.

917
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,289
Hyun Ho was just good. He really looked like a count.

918
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:37,460
He was cool.

919
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,960
He stood out a lot. I was jealous.

920
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,030
He should use more of his facial expressions.

921
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,300
He was good in the practice room, but here...

922
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,339
- He's a bit lacking. - He is, in terms of energy.

923
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,169
Young Woong looked like he wasn't giving it his all...

924
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,538
with the facial expressions.

925
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,539
I thought he could do better.

926
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,579
Okay, let's stop here.

927
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,908
(Under Class' group dance begins.)

928
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,289
Three, two, one. Music, start.

929
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,690
(The group dance portrays the energy that comes with numbers.)

930
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,889
(The dancers move perfectly as soon as the music plays.)

931
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:10,788
It's a war here.

932
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,529
(They're pretty good.)

933
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,058
Every time they were caught on camera,

934
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,428
they showed off different charms.

935
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:18,199
- They felt that desperate. - They were really cool.

936
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,000
- Who is he? - He has such a nice figure.

937
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,840
(Staring intently)

938
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,169
- It's him, right? - Yes.

939
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,409
- I think he is June Hyuk. - Really?

940
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,238
June Hyuk stood out a lot.

941
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,579
- He has a good figure. - He poured all his energy into it.

942
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,380
He really went all out.

943
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,820
He caught my eyes.

944
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,149
We'll stop it here.

945
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,459
(A round of applause for the ensemble)

946
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,460
(Full of respect)

947
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:41,759
- The formation will change... - We'll proceed with the next part.

948
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,828
For the chorus.

949
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:43,889
This is the front.

950
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,829
But start diagonally. Here.

951
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,658
From here. Do you understand?

952
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,070
(The dancers are confused with the sudden change in formation.)

953
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,170
I think we're supposed to look this way.

954
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,839
For the part where 24 of us danced together, Hye Hyun's eyes...

955
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,968
suddenly changed.

956
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,839
He was sorting out the formation from the back.

957
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,909
- We don't spin? Okay. - Like this.

958
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,279
Eun Hyuk, you need to jump quickly.

959
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,610
After this, face this way.

960
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,949
- We should try one more time. - They first...

961
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,948
Among the supporting roles,

962
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,619
he kept everyone grounded quietly.

963
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,789
I thought, "He is pretty good."

964
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,629
(The Dance Film of the 24 contemporary dancers...)

965
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:26,070
(will be revealed soon.)

966
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,999
(After all the filming is over for Contemporary Dance Film, )

967
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,170
(the evaluations begin for the other classes.)

968
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,379
How was it?

969
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,909
Except Hyun Ho, nobody really impressed me.

970
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:39,179
- I don't remember Young Woong. - He didn't stand out much.

971
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,488
He didn't show the energy and performance...

972
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:44,349
that we saw in the practice room.

973
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,789
Jung Hye Seong...

974
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,388
stood out so much.

975
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,928
(Eye-catching)

976
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:53,260
Hye Seong looks like an idol.

977
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,070
He didn't blend in with the others.

978
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,729
Is it because they have no experience in Dance Film?

979
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,969
They didn't look cool.

980
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:04,268
Honestly, it felt like Jae Jin just went with the flow.

981
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:06,709
Both Jae Jin and Jin Ho...

982
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,238
didn't stand out to me.

983
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,979
I didn't see Jin Ho practice much...

984
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,408
because he was unwell.

985
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:13,718
(During the practice)

986
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,319
Just dancing a bit hurts.

987
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,348
(Jin Ho couldn't take part in the practice properly.)

988
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:20,320
His back injury must've affected him a lot.

989
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,130
I may sound very cold, but self-care is a skill too.

990
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,429
What do you think about Go Dong Hoon?

991
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,999
- He was memorable... - He was memorable to me too.

992
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,529
Because he did this at the end.

993
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,538
(This)

994
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:33,839
(The ending part of Contemporary Dance Film)

995
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,908
(Go Dong Hoon supported Kim Hyun Ho with his shoulders.)

996
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:41,380
- His shoulders... - His shoulders were totally chafed.

997
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,479
- It doesn't hurt. - Tomorrow, I...

998
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,209
(His shoulder is chafed red.)

999
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,449
He didn't show it at all.

1000
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,218
(The dancers evaluate carefully...)

1001
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,689
(as it affects the promotion and demotion.)

1002
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,718
(Thinking carefully)

1003
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,489
(They select the other classes' promotion and demotion candidates.)

1004
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,260
We'll start the class evaluation of 24 contemporary dancers...

1005
00:40:57,429 --> 00:41:00,699
by watching the Contemporary Dance Film, "Vampire Sonata."

1006
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,268
(Revealing the Contemporary Dance Film)

1007
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:04,300
Okay, let's go.

1008
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,170
Come on!

1009
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,000
I can't wait to watch it.

1010
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,340
I'm so curious.

1011
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,969
- I really love vampire movies. - I see.

1012
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,308
- It's a very charming character. - Yes.

1013
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,879
I'm looking forward to it.

1014
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,750
(I'm looking forward to it too.)

1015
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,980
I'm feeling nervous.

1016
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,348
(He is nervous too.)

1017
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:22,419
("Vampire Sonata," choreographed by Seong Chang Yong and Kim Hye Hyun)

1018
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,750
- It's about a vampire. - It's going to be so cool.

1019
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:26,960
Let's watch.

1020
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:34,029
(Tiger Hyun appears.)

1021
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,399
(Everyone is shocked.)

1022
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,530
Was there such a scene?

1023
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,969
When did he film that?

1024
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,638
Goodness, I got the chills.

1025
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:44,510
- Gosh, Hyun Ho. - That was good.

1026
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,309
It feels so cool.

1027
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,078
(Count Vampire finally awakens.)

1028
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,209
He's cool.

1029
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,809
It's so cool. It was filmed in a very contemporary dance style.

1030
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,949
- Look at his physique. - He is like a beast.

1031
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,719
- He looks cool. - He is sexy.

1032
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,190
I got goosebumps.

1033
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,118
(Sub lead roles, the count's sons, Kim Young Woong and Jung Hye Seong)

1034
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,360
- The count's sons. - They're so cool.

1035
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:05,928
These two in the same frame...

1036
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:06,929
(It's nice.)

1037
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,469
- It's like a movie. - It's cool.

1038
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,630
So sexy.

1039
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,969
- It's so cool. - He is so charismatic.

1040
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,739
Hyun Ho stands out.

1041
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,848
- I agree. - He is good.

1042
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:26,119
(Focused and serious)

1043
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,750
Kim Hyun Ho is...

1044
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,690
- What's that? - That's crazy.

1045
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,789
(They're cool.)

1046
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:35,420
I like this scene.

1047
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,729
This was really cool.

1048
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,959
- This is so cool. - It's so cool.

1049
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,989
Goodness.

1050
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,670
It's cool.

1051
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,569
It's a high-quality production.

1052
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,039
Their figures look so nice, thanks to the lighting.

1053
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:49,639
Look at Hyeok Jung's figure.

1054
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,239
The way they face each other.

1055
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,510
- That was Tae Young, right? - Yes.

1056
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
He really stands out.

1057
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,920
- Nice. - That's so cool.

1058
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,219
They are so in sync.

1059
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,519
The main choreography is very cool.

1060
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:07,788
(That's crazy.)

1061
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:08,960
(Shocked)

1062
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:11,859
(The ensemble and the main lead role's wonderful joint work)

1063
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,058
They did a great job.

1064
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:15,130
It looks so cool.

1065
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,130
The song quality is on another level.

1066
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,469
The group dance stands out clearly.

1067
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:22,969
It was choreographed nice and feral.

1068
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,408
(A feral jump)

1069
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:27,939
(Smiling automatically)

1070
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,808
(Contemporary dance is cool!)

1071
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,510
- Look at that. - They are dancing in sync.

1072
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,579
Look at the blocking.

1073
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,750
- It's a nice formation too. - June Hyuk.

1074
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,750
He killed it in that scene.

1075
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,759
I should be watching Hyun Ho,

1076
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,159
but my eyes are drawn to the group dance.

1077
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,698
(A shining solo)

1078
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:47,729
A solo dance.

1079
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,500
(What a powerful tiger.)

1080
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:50,969
That was nice.

1081
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,869
He clearly is the main lead role.

1082
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,239
He is the main lead role.

1083
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,409
- He is amazing. - That's insane.

1084
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,139
This part is cool.

1085
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,239
- Solo. - Gosh, he's so cool.

1086
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:04,909
He's cool.

1087
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,449
Go, Hyun Ho.

1088
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,719
(This is an amazing, golden-like group dance.)

1089
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,420
The group dance is cool, I'm telling you.

1090
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,729
We worked really hard.

1091
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,460
The group dance is so cool.

1092
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:21,730
(Feeling proud and touched)

1093
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,868
It's so nice. They have such nice figures.

1094
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:27,170
It feels different with their tops off.

1095
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:28,638
Seong Yun.

1096
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:29,639
(Very focused)

1097
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,669
Something is coming.

1098
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,670
(They're looking forward to a big one.)

1099
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,409
(An explosion of energy)

1100
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:37,908
A group dance has that energy.

1101
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,279
- The group dance is cool. - The group dance sure is cool.

1102
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,519
(A group dance is the best. He loves the group dance.)

1103
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,119
Tae Young.

1104
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,260
Who is the one in white pants?

1105
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:48,960
He stood out so much just now.

1106
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,960
- He is Tae Young. - He has an amazing figure.

1107
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:57,469
Those at the back flew. They did the techniques.

1108
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,440
I love the vibe.

1109
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,309
It feels feral.

1110
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,839
We did really well.

1111
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,840
- We look so desperate. - Exactly.

1112
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,449
They're pretty much actors now.

1113
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,190
(The 3 lead roles shine.)

1114
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,449
Young Woong is good.

1115
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,259
- He has good expressions. - Yes.

1116
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,260
(The main lead role...)

1117
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,860
(and the main supporting roles)

1118
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:25,659
- Nice. - I...

1119
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,059
- Nice. - I love this part.

1120
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,400
They are the main lead role and the main supporting roles.

1121
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,529
This is the section for the three dancers.

1122
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,569
You're right.

1123
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,139
- This is my favorite scene. - Me too.

1124
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:38,570
Tae Young is so cool.

1125
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:42,238
Here.

1126
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,550
(The most impactful part)

1127
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,788
The hunters.

1128
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,118
These two look really good.

1129
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,460
Those at the back stand out a lot.

1130
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:55,489
(Focused)

1131
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,789
(It's my turn.)

1132
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:59,189
He spins so well.

1133
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,199
(Gulping)

1134
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,468
- Nice. - I'm getting the chills.

1135
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:09,739
- It's so nice. - Goodness.

1136
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:11,469
(They can't believe what they saw.)

1137
00:46:11,909 --> 00:46:12,979
I got the chills.

1138
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,010
The group dance is so cool.

1139
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:17,209
You need some tangling of the bodies.

1140
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,750
- It's classical. - Yes.

1141
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,679
The highlight.

1142
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,079
This is crazy.

1143
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,289
It's so cool.

1144
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:32,659
It's like an art film.

1145
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,499
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

1146
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,369
(You can listen to the music in the Dance Film on various platforms.)

1147
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,909
It sure looks different to watch it post-production.

1148
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,739
It portrayed our hard work well.

1149
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:47,109
(They acknowledge the dancers.)

1150
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,078
- It's so nice. - It's so cool.

1151
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,150
It's so cool.

1152
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,050
It's so cool.

1153
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:53,849
Everyone gets at least one second of screen time.

1154
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,650
I know, right?

1155
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:57,319
The sub lead roles didn't stand out.

1156
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,049
- He stood out a lot. - How did you find it?

1157
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,090
His looks too.

1158
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,320
He is fair.

1159
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,659
The sub lead roles didn't stand out as much as I'd hoped.

1160
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,869
I think the main supporting roles stood out more.

1161
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,399
I will announce the final number and the names...

1162
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,069
of the candidates to be promoted and demoted,

1163
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,738
selected by the contemporary dancers themselves...

1164
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:21,340
via the class evaluation by other classes.

1165
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,979
(It's finally here.)

1166
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,250
I'm so nervous.

1167
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,019
- Think about demotion candidates? - This is so cruel.

1168
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,518
I will announce the promotion candidates...

1169
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:30,619
of Under Class of contemporary dance.

1170
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:32,518
(Is he going to reveal it right away?)

1171
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,920
The promotion candidates of Under Class...

1172
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:36,328
are two voted by the First Class dancers...

1173
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:39,360
and two voted by the Second Class dancers.

1174
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:41,328
The dancers the two classes chose...

1175
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:43,429
did not overlap.

1176
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:44,469
(Surprised)

1177
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,698
The total number of Under Class dancers...

1178
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:46,940
selected as the promotion candidate...

1179
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,699
are four.

1180
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,440
(The ensembles have hope.)

1181
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:51,809
Four?

1182
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,380
That's a lot.

1183
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,579
It felt like the chance was given to a lot of people.

1184
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:00,679
The first promotion candidate of Under Class is...

1185
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,149
Go Dong Hoon.

1186
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,860
(The 1st promotion candidate from Under to 2nd, Go Dong Hoon)

1187
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,360
Nice.

1188
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,860
"I knew it." I felt proud of myself.

1189
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:16,968
The fact that he can lead the group in the filming site,

1190
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:19,130
the practice room, and that atmosphere itself...

1191
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,099
- I agree. - shows his skill too, I believe.

1192
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:24,570
Let's try the formation.

1193
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,138
Let's succeed at once. We can do it.

1194
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,139
(The ensemble leader Go Dong Hoon cheered up the ensembles.)

1195
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,578
First Class Kim Young Woong...

1196
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:29,979
who chose Under Class Go Dong Hoon...

1197
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,848
as the promotion candidate wrote,

1198
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:34,649
"He led other dancers very well,"

1199
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,920
"and he carried out his duty."

1200
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:39,718
The second promotion candidate of Under Class...

1201
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:42,260
decided by the evaluation of other classes is...

1202
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,589
It might be you.

1203
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,988
(Nervous)

1204
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,059
I don't know.

1205
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,629
He is taking his time on purpose.

1206
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,468
(The candidate is revealed.)

1207
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,629
(Surprised)

1208
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,828
(Lee Jin Woo, 2 out of 3 1st Class dancers voted.)

1209
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,099
Lee Jin Woo.

1210
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,368
(The 2nd promotion candidate from Under to 2nd Class, Lee Jin Woo)

1211
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:59,510
I didn't even get my hopes up.

1212
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,308
First Class Kim Young Woong...

1213
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:02,779
who chose Under Class Lee Jin Woo...

1214
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,609
as the promotion candidate wrote,

1215
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,078
"His powerful energy stood out,"

1216
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,018
"and he showed off his own style of dancing."

1217
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:10,618
"I would like to see more of it."

1218
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,719
- I should treat him to nice food. - First Class Jung Hye Seong...

1219
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,988
He didn't stand out in the group dance,

1220
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:17,189
but he stilled showed his own style of dancing.

1221
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:20,000
I thought Jin Woo was good in that sense.

1222
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,098
- Crawl like this. - Yes.

1223
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:27,038
(Lee Jin Woo took the initiative to suggest ideas...)

1224
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,210
(and helped Young Woong.)

1225
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,909
(Feeling proud of him)

1226
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:37,480
Next, I'll announce the third promotion candidate of Under Class.

1227
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,079
The promotion candidate of Under Class is...

1228
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,719
Yang Seong Yun.

1229
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,389
Seong Yun.

1230
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,518
"This actually happened."

1231
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,260
(Yang Seong Yun, 4 out of 6 2nd Class dancers voted.)

1232
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:50,928
When Seong Yun did the group dance with Hyun Ho,

1233
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:52,658
in that specific group dance scene,

1234
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,058
Seong Yun was the only dancer I could see.

1235
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:55,598
He has a great figure.

1236
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,329
The movement suited him well.

1237
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,968
Three out of four promotion candidates...

1238
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,670
of Under Class are revealed.

1239
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,610
There is only one spot left.

1240
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,940
- There aren't many spots available. - Other classes' evaluation...

1241
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,238
(It's hard to get promoted!)

1242
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,250
- This is tough. - Which dancer will secure the spot?

1243
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,920
Why am I feeling nervous?

1244
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,079
"Can I secure that spot?"

1245
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,389
The final promotion candidate of Under Class is...

1246
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,059
Drum roll.

1247
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,090
Jang June Hyuk.

1248
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,989
- Yes. - Nice.

1249
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,300
June Hyuk.

1250
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:30,169
"They called my name as I thought. Thank goodness."

1251
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,368
June Hyuk stood out a lot in the center.

1252
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:33,499
He had nice expressions.

1253
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,299
I could feel him throwing his energy outward.

1254
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,610
He was my favorite.

1255
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:40,339
With that, all the promotion candidates of Under Class...

1256
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,150
decided by the evaluation of other classes are revealed.

1257
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:45,848
The 11 dancers who didn't become...

1258
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:47,049
the promotion candidates...

1259
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,679
cannot be promoted anymore.

1260
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,949
(Sighing)

1261
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:53,889
I just feel so futile.

1262
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,590
How can I prove myself in the group dance?

1263
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:02,300
Next, I'll reveal the demotion candidate of Second Class.

1264
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,968
(Contemporary Dance 2nd Class Demotion Candidates)

1265
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,229
(Somebody...)

1266
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,599
(needs to step down.)

1267
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,500
- This is driving me mad. - Demotion candidate...

1268
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:11,969
I can't get demoted.

1269
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,980
Doesn't someone need to be demoted for someone to be promoted?

1270
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,479
They need to be demoted so we can get promoted.

1271
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,579
(A hyena appears.)

1272
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:19,209
Please don't call my name.

1273
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,218
(Trembling)

1274
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,480
The number of demotion candidates of Second Class...

1275
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,420
- is... - Two?

1276
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,919
Three.

1277
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,320
- Goodness. - That's a lot.

1278
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,488
(Shocked)

1279
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:29,689
- Three? - Three.

1280
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,860
- That's half of them. - Three.

1281
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,500
- That's half of them. - That is crazy.

1282
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,730
The 1st demotion candidate of 2nd Class is...

1283
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,169
(I don't want to see it.)

1284
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:40,768
(None of the 6 2nd Class dancers can let their guards down.)

1285
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:42,469
Kim Jae Jin.

1286
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:43,939
(Kim Jae Jin, 3 out of 3 1st Class dancers...)

1287
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,010
(and 3 out of 14 Under Class dancers voted.)

1288
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,339
(Thank you for your attention.)

1289
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,408
Jae Jin.

1290
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,448
Under Class Kim Seung Wook wrote,

1291
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:52,880
"He didn't stand out much during the practice and filming,"

1292
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:54,420
in his evaluation.

1293
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,489
(Unexpectedly walking on eggshells)

1294
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,948
This is so brutal.

1295
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,459
- Is he going to read it all out? - Under Class...

1296
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,159
I can't believe he read out the name.

1297
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,558
- This is brutal. - How can we continue...

1298
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:04,789
filming together?

1299
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,900
I'll take note of it.

1300
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:10,170
He had that grasshopper attitude.

1301
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,130
He was just seated in one corner.

1302
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,599
I'd like to dance.

1303
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,369
This is just nice for me.

1304
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,039
This is my favorite. Standing still and conserving energy.

1305
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,210
He looked lethargic.

1306
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,110
He didn't make a positive impression on the filming site.

1307
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,479
A more desperate dancer...

1308
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,820
should take his spot.

1309
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,889
The 2nd demotion candidate of 2nd Class is...

1310
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,820
(It's hard to breathe.)

1311
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,619
Who is it?

1312
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,489
(Anxious)

1313
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,630
Park Jin Ho.

1314
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,399
(Park Jin Ho. 10 out of 14 Under Class dancers voted.)

1315
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,058
(Surprised)

1316
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,670
(Really?)

1317
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:45,899
(Surprised)

1318
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,238
(I can't accept that.)

1319
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:49,440
(The 2nd demotion candidate from 2nd to Under Class, Park Jin Ho)

1320
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,070
"Why? Why me?"

1321
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,340
Jin Ho didn't stand out much.

1322
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,848
He was swept past like a passing scene.

1323
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:00,948
He wasn't memorable.

1324
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:03,319
Under Class Kwon Yo Han wrote,

1325
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,889
"He was outshined by other dancers and didn't stand out,"

1326
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,420
in his evaluation.

1327
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:09,659
This is interesting.

1328
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,730
I think they only saw one side of it.

1329
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:15,329
I was not outshone at all.

1330
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,869
I will reveal the final demotion candidate...

1331
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:19,300
of Second Class.

1332
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:20,670
The final one.

1333
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:22,070
Who is it?

1334
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,839
The 2nd Class dancer chosen both by 1st Class and Under Class...

1335
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,480
as a demotion candidate is...

1336
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,079
By both classes?

1337
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:30,780
I think I know who.

1338
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,420
Kim Eun Hyuk.

1339
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,280
I think I kind of saw it coming.

1340
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:39,848
Under Class I Ban who chose Kim Eun Hyuk...

1341
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:42,388
as the demotion candidate wrote,

1342
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,460
"He has no presence."

1343
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:44,959
(He has no presence.)

1344
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,460
(Holy moly!)

1345
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:47,899
- My goodness! - That's harsh.

1346
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,459
Oh, my gosh.

1347
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,599
(Goodness)

1348
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,199
(Brutal I Ban)

1349
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,440
- That was legendary. - Was I too blunt?

1350
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,440
But he didn't have much presence.

1351
00:53:58,510 --> 00:53:59,769
(Uncomfortable)

1352
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,440
Next, I'll announce the candidates...

1353
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:05,179
for demotion in the First Class.

1354
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:06,848
(The big one is here.)

1355
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:07,949
It's finally here.

1356
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,949
The number of candidates for demotion...

1357
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,789
in the 1st Class is 2.

1358
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,519
There are two?

1359
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:16,119
It means that one of them will stay.

1360
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,090
Even if they get demoted, they'll be in the Second Class.

1361
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:21,960
The 1st candidate for demotion in the 1st Class is...

1362
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:24,130
It can't be Hyun Ho.

1363
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,130
It'll be between the two from Sejong University.

1364
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,440
It's Jung Hye Seong.

1365
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,968
(1st Class Candidate 1 for demotion: Jung Hye Seong)

1366
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,070
(5 votes from the 2nd, 13 votes from the Under Class)

1367
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,179
I knew it subconsciously...

1368
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:36,780
that I would be picked.

1369
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,149
Park Jin Ho in the Second Class wrote...

1370
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,319
(Lowering his head)

1371
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,719
It's a family fight.

1372
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,649
"It's important to stand out,"

1373
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,488
"but he needs to be more aware of the environment."

1374
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:47,219
(Sejong University Class of 2021)

1375
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:49,519
Yun Hyeok Jung in the Second Class wrote,

1376
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,689
"He tried to stand out so much..."

1377
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,500
"that it ruined the vibe of the trio."

1378
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,099
I wrote that, too.

1379
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:58,369
- I bet the majority wrote that. - Right.

1380
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,670
He obviously tried to stand out more than the main lead dancer.

1381
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,969
I believe that...

1382
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:09,039
I did a good job on playing my role.

1383
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,750
(I see.)

1384
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,549
From the Main Lead Role Casting Audition until now,

1385
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:17,219
people have been saying that I stood out.

1386
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,289
It's needless to say that skillful dancers stand out.

1387
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:23,389
I want to stand out.

1388
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,230
Between Kim Hyun Ho and Kim Young Woong,

1389
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,899
which one of you...

1390
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,099
will be the candidate for demotion?

1391
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,598
It can't be Hyun Ho.

1392
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,069
If it's Hyun Ho, it will be a total surprise.

1393
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,439
But it can't be Young Woong either.

1394
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,539
Who knows? There are also votes from the Second Class.

1395
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,139
The second candidate for demotion is...

1396
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:44,479
(Who will it be?)

1397
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,179
It's Dancer Kim Young Woong.

1398
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,448
(5 out of 6 2nd Class dancers, )

1399
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:48,449
(and 12 out of 14 Under Class dancers voted.)

1400
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,489
This mission is Dance Film Mission.

1401
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,590
Considering that, I'd pick Young Woong.

1402
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:57,860
I think that he was too expressionless.

1403
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:02,300
He was very visible in the practice room.

1404
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:05,198
However, on the film set, I don't think that...

1405
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:07,099
he was as energetic as before.

1406
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,070
It was very regretful.

1407
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,009
I don't think that I played the character well.

1408
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,010
(Regretful)

1409
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,579
As Kim Young Woong is the candidate for demotion,

1410
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:17,209
Kim Hyun Ho will remain...

1411
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,309
in the First Class.

1412
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:20,619
Nice.

1413
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,078
Didn't he do well?

1414
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,519
He did a good job. It was flawless.

1415
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,860
I just think that I got lucky.

1416
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,659
Everyone worked very hard.

1417
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,159
The video looked amazing.

1418
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,329
The main lead was excellent.

1419
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,129
Lastly, for contemporary dance class evaluation,

1420
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:41,800
I will announce the dancer to be promoted from the Second Class.

1421
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:44,170
The 1st 2nd Class candidate to be promoted is...

1422
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,339
Tae Young or Hyeok Jung.

1423
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,409
- It will be them. - I feel that too.

1424
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:51,579
- Hye Hyun probably got many votes. - Hye Hyun did well.

1425
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,820
But he got less screen time.

1426
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,150
It's Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung.

1427
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,820
(2nd Class Candidate 1 for promotion: Yun Hyeok Jung)

1428
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,559
I felt that I got one step closer to joining the First Class.

1429
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,530
I thought, "I should hurry and go up."

1430
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,329
Honestly, Hyeok Jung was really good today.

1431
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,300
Not only did he move well,

1432
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,230
but he was also absorbed in his character.

1433
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:14,170
The remaining Second Class dancers are...

1434
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,039
Kim Hye Hyun and Ryu Tae Young.

1435
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,638
Between them,

1436
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,940
who will be the Second Class candidate for promotion?

1437
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:22,808
I had little screen time,

1438
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:24,980
but I think that I showed my everything.

1439
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,348
As I showed a lot as the main supporting role,

1440
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:29,380
I had hopes.

1441
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,920
Here is the second candidate for promotion.

1442
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:34,190
Will it be Tae Young or Hye Hyun?

1443
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,029
Tae Young has a strong physique...

1444
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,629
- and a strong aura. - I agree.

1445
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,530
Mr. Mozart nailed it completely.

1446
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:43,570
Even when he wasn't dancing, his hair was swaying.

1447
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,329
I couldn't help but look at him.

1448
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:50,909
Hye Hyun was clear and reliable in his place.

1449
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:53,779
This is our last pose.

1450
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,909
- This must be the move. - Then how about this?

1451
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,050
This is the front, so you should face this way.

1452
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,420
Even if he's in the First Class,

1453
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:05,389
he would do his best to play his role.

1454
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,690
The 2nd 2nd Class candidate for promotion is...

1455
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:09,090
I don't want to look.

1456
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,159
(Who will it be?)

1457
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:12,888
(Ryu Tae Young)

1458
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,630
It's Ryu Tae Young.

1459
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,170
Anyway, I got a ticket, so I have a chance to move up.

1460
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:21,369
I was very disappointed.

1461
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,969
The remaining Second Class dancer is Kim Hye Hyun.

1462
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,079
Will Kim Hye Hyun also be a candidate for promotion?

1463
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,510
Or will he remain in the Second Class?

1464
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,420
The last Second Class candidate for promotion...

1465
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,750
(What?)

1466
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,449
What? Is there one more?

1467
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,889
He might say that there isn't.

1468
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,090
- Or it could be Hye Hyun. - I see.

1469
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,760
He'll probably say that there isn't.

1470
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:45,960
I thought that I could stay.

1471
00:58:46,429 --> 00:58:47,629
(2nd Class Candidate 3 for promotion: Kim Hye Hyun)

1472
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,530
It's Kim Hye Hyun.

1473
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:51,399
(The third candidate for promotion: Kim Hye Hyun)

1474
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,469
(From 2nd to 1st)

1475
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:54,400
This is so competitive.

1476
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,069
Yang Seong Yun from the Under Class wrote,

1477
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,308
"He showed himself as the supporting role."

1478
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:02,010
"He took care of other dancers during practice."

1479
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,340
That's how he evaluated him.

1480
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:05,749
The total number of candidates for promotion...

1481
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,820
from the 2nd Class is 3.

1482
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:09,619
So the candidates have been determined?

1483
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,219
All six of them will be either promoted or demoted.

1484
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,389
This is intense.

1485
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:16,960
All three of us are candidates for demotion.

1486
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:18,389
It's 3 against 3.

1487
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,888
(3 candidates for promotion, 3 candidates for demotion)

1488
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,030
(The Second Class dancers are facing a turning point.)

1489
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,299
We don't know if they'll be demoted or not, right?

1490
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,329
Right.

1491
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:27,738
Which dancer will be promoted,

1492
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:29,800
and which dancer will be demoted?

1493
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:31,908
You will find out at the Class Movement Ceremony.

1494
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:34,980
(STF Dance Company)

1495
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,479
Sixty-four dancers on Stage Fighter.

1496
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,718
Through their first mission called Dance Film, they were evaluated...

1497
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,420
on how well they played their role according to their class.

1498
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,449
Based on the result,

1499
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,590
the Class Movement will take place now.

1500
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,029
For the Class Movement, there are promotion stairs...

1501
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,029
that lead you to a higher class.

1502
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,059
There are demotion stairs that lead you...

1503
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:57,428
to a lower class.

1504
00:59:57,429 --> 00:59:59,670
Which dancer will get to enjoy the honor of promotion...

1505
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,340
and go to the First Class Locker Room?

1506
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,440
Which dancer will get demoted...

1507
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,679
and go to the Under Class Locker Room?

1508
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,408
Stage Fighter dancers' competitive Class Movement...

1509
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:12,809
will start now.

1510
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,448
(Stage Fighter)

1511
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:17,489
(1st, 2nd, and Under Class)

1512
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:20,119
The first dance genre for the Class Movement is...

1513
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,760
contemporary dance.

1514
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,530
Finding out our class will be nerve-racking.

1515
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:29,630
"Class Movement?"

1516
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,530
Hurry up and show me.

1517
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,500
Will they show us the result on the screen?

1518
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,440
I think so.

1519
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:39,368
On Stage Fighter,

1520
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,880
the first Class Movement Ceremony will start.

1521
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,909
Before the Class Movement for contemporary dance,

1522
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,449
I'll announce the dancers whose class has been determined.

1523
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,879
When your name is called,

1524
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,219
please check your class in the Class Confirmation Zone.

1525
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:55,190
Then, move to your Class Locker Room.

1526
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,230
Kwon Yo Han.

1527
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,760
Please check your class in the Class Confirmation Zone.

1528
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,799
Then, move to your Class Locker Room.

1529
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,399
Kwon Yo Han in the Under Class.

1530
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,569
(Under Class Kwon Yo Han)

1531
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,400
He'll remain in the Under Class.

1532
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,210
I should make more effort.

1533
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,809
Now that my goal is getting promoted,

1534
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,280
I must reach it.

1535
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:17,550
(Under Class Locker Room)

1536
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,449
(It's filled with chairs.)

1537
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,920
It changed completely.

1538
01:01:21,921 --> 01:01:23,050
(Under Class Locker Room changed according to the Class Movement.)

1539
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,820
(A place for 40 Under Class dancers)

1540
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,919
Dancer Choo Seok Ho and Ha Won Jun.

1541
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,630
They will stay in the Under Class.

1542
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,229
Kim Seung Wook, Kim Do Hyun,

1543
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,530
Lee Jeong Hoon.

1544
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,300
They will stay in the Under Class.

1545
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:42,039
Han Jeong Bin.

1546
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,170
Oh Hyeok Heon.

1547
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,239
I did my best.

1548
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:48,079
Kim Tae Gang.

1549
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:50,380
- Hello. - Hey.

1550
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,348
I Ban.

1551
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:54,820
They will stay in the Under Class.

1552
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:57,789
Dancers who failed to move their class...

1553
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:00,319
and remain in the Under Class...

1554
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,260
have been revealed.

1555
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,488
We have to do the group dance again?

1556
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:05,489
Seriously.

1557
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,730
- Group dance is the hardest. - Right.

1558
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,529
By proving himself in his position,

1559
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,399
he remains in the First Class.

1560
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,799
Kim Hyun Ho, please move to your Class Locker Room.

1561
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,070
(First Class Kim Hyun Ho checks his class.)

1562
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,210
Enjoy it for now. I'll catch up soon.

1563
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,079
Kim Hyun Ho.

1564
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:24,150
He will remain in the First Class.

1565
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:25,710
First.

1566
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,250
It reminded me of a locker room for soccer players.

1567
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,119
I felt like I became the top athlete.

1568
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:36,718
The main dancer of Stage Fighter?

1569
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,029
(Totally happy)

1570
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,599
I will stay in the First Class until the end.

1571
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,299
The Class Movement...

1572
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,300
for Second Class demotion will start.

1573
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,300
During the Dance Film Evaluation,

1574
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:49,799
candidates for demotion in the Second Class,

1575
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,309
chosen by people in the First and Under Classes, are...

1576
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:55,179
Kim Eun Hyuk, Kim Jae Jin,

1577
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,510
and Park Jin Ho. There are a total of three.

1578
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,250
Who will join the Under Class?

1579
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:02,250
This is cruel.

1580
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,689
The first dancer to move his class is...

1581
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:05,750
(Which will be the first to move his class?)

1582
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,820
Kim Eun Hyuk.

1583
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,229
- Eun Hyuk will probably join us. - I think so too.

1584
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,360
(He'll probably join us.)

1585
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:15,960
If I get demoted to the Under Class now,

1586
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:18,130
it will be hard...

1587
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:21,639
to stand out more than now.

1588
01:03:21,739 --> 01:03:23,500
(Class Confirmation Zone)

1589
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:26,670
It's better when one more spot becomes available.

1590
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,439
Kim Eun Hyuk.

1591
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,050
(Will he be able to stay in the Second Class?)

1592
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:33,279
(Kim Eun Hyuk is demoted to the Under Class.)

1593
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,219
He's been demoted from Second to the Under Class.

1594
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:38,448
To be honest,

1595
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:40,449
no one really mentions Eun Hyuk.

1596
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,059
- It's hard to notice him. - There's one spot open.

1597
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,400
Kim Jae Jin and Park Jin Ho's Class Movement will start.

1598
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,630
Please check your class in the Class Confirmation Zone.

1599
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,469
Then, move to your Class Locker Room.

1600
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:56,070
(The door to the stairs opens.)

1601
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,710
(One of them descends on the demotion stairs.)

1602
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,339
- He's here. - Who is it?

1603
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,038
- He got demoted. - Why are you here?

1604
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,679
(Kim Jae Jin is demoted from Second to the Under Class.)

1605
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,979
How you dress during practice is also important.

1606
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,819
On the first day of practice, Jae Jin was the only one...

1607
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,420
wearing a cap.

1608
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,789
(Kim Jae Jin was the only one wearing a cap during practice.)

1609
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,288
You can't see his facial expression...

1610
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:19,488
- when he's wearing a cap. - Right.

1611
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:21,800
We have to check everything about the dancer.

1612
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:24,570
It means that he was unwilling to concentrate.

1613
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,399
(That's not what I meant.)

1614
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,400
From now on,

1615
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,869
I'll be passionate during practice.

1616
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:33,268
I don't think Jin Ho will be demoted.

1617
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,179
Right, the coaches know how good he is.

1618
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:38,050
(There's a knock at the Under Class Locker Room.)

1619
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:39,210
What?

1620
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,380
(Groaning)

1621
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,420
- Hello. - Gosh.

1622
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,848
Is it three of you?

1623
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:48,090
Park Jin Ho has been demoted from Second to the Under Class.

1624
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,928
If we didn't see Tae Young dance,

1625
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,759
the role belonged to Jin Ho.

1626
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,599
- Was it originally Jin Ho? - He just got unlucky.

1627
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:01,940
(The coaches were watching Park Jin Ho carefully.)

1628
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,169
(However, after an additional audition, )

1629
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,210
(the main supporting role was given to Ryu Tae Young.)

1630
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:07,809
Congratulations.

1631
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:12,380
I felt bad and a little angry.

1632
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:16,279
Then three of them will get promoted.

1633
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,388
One of them will come back here.

1634
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:19,590
Yes, one of them will return to the Under Class.

1635
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:23,589
The total number of Under Class dancers to be promoted...

1636
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,089
to the 2nd Class is 3.

1637
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,460
The Class Movement of Under Class dancers to be promoted will start.

1638
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:29,659
Dancer Lee Jin Woo.

1639
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,969
I was the first one to be called.

1640
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,868
He's killing me so fast.

1641
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:36,800
(He's killing me so fast.)

1642
01:05:37,869 --> 01:05:40,238
Lee Jin Woo.

1643
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:42,939
(Under Class Lee Jin Woo)

1644
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,479
(He's promoted to the Second Class.)

1645
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,449
He's promoted to the Second Class.

1646
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,619
(Lee Jin Woo enters the Second Class Locker Room.)

1647
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,179
I miss my friends in the Under Class.

1648
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,090
(He's coming to see him now.)

1649
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:56,420
(Another dancer climbs up the promotion stairs and faces him.)

1650
01:05:56,659 --> 01:05:58,129
(Who is it?)

1651
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,159
My gosh.

1652
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,860
- My gosh. - Good work.

1653
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,800
Jang June Hyuk.

1654
01:06:05,469 --> 01:06:06,500
He's promoted...

1655
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,269
from the Under Class to the Second.

1656
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:12,469
I was so happy.

1657
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,879
I moved down from First to the Under Class.

1658
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,079
After that, I moved up from Under to Second Class.

1659
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:21,320
I feel confident about becoming the First Class.

1660
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,480
I wanted to move up higher.

1661
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:27,288
Including Lee Jin Woo and Jang June Hyuk,

1662
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:30,489
two dancers got promoted to the Second Class.

1663
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:34,059
Now, there is only one dancer who can get promoted.

1664
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,368
Between Yang Seong Yun and Go Dong Hoon,

1665
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:39,300
who will be the last one to get promoted?

1666
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:41,868
This is crazy. Is it 1 of the 2?

1667
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:43,038
It's either Dong Hoon...

1668
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,909
I think that it'll be Dong Hoon who excelled during practice.

1669
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,679
It'll probably be Dong Hoon.

1670
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,480
Will it be Dong Hoon or Seong Yun?

1671
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:52,110
Both of them are really good.

1672
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:56,550
(They check their class at the same time.)

1673
01:06:57,489 --> 01:07:00,889
(Which dancer will climb up the promotion stairs?)

1674
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:02,619
(Knocking)

1675
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:07,190
(Surprised)

1676
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,329
(Under Class Locker Room)

1677
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,968
(Exclaiming)

1678
01:07:10,969 --> 01:07:13,070
- What's going on? - Goodness!

1679
01:07:13,699 --> 01:07:15,340
- Why... - Is this really happening?

1680
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,739
(They just checked their class a moment ago.)

1681
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,380
(Yang Seong Yun is promoted to the Second Class.)

1682
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,210
(Go Dong Hoon remains in the Under Class.)

1683
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,010
I was very flustered.

1684
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:27,550
I couldn't believe it.

1685
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,150
Is this right?

1686
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:32,420
When I glanced at him, I saw that he was looking at mine.

1687
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:34,889
I tried not to smile.

1688
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,630
I'm a robot. Don't make it obvious.

1689
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,059
- Gosh. - This is unbelievable.

1690
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:43,759
- Is this really happening? - You must feel so bitter.

1691
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,000
- You must be having a breakdown. - Could you turn off the cameras?

1692
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,440
Exactly. This is how you feel.

1693
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:51,969
- You must feel disappointed. - Goodness.

1694
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:55,809
I gave it a lot of thought,

1695
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:57,949
but I still can't figure out why.

1696
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:01,880
It's dangerous because while he was a leader,

1697
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,949
he was very busy talking and not listening.

1698
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,489
We're not trying to pick the best leader.

1699
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:10,190
We're choosing the best dancer.

1700
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:12,360
He should have focused more on his dancing.

1701
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:14,730
He should have let Matthew...

1702
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:17,159
lead the group instead.

1703
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,569
(Look over there.)

1704
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,568
(Celebrating taking back the Second Class)

1705
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:23,569
Second.

1706
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:27,368
He has my favorite type of physique.

1707
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:32,279
He danced to my choreography in the most refreshing way.

1708
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:34,750
It's Yang Seong Yun.

1709
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,449
(Contemporary Dance Final Second Class)

1710
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:40,890
We will continue with the Class Movement for First Class.

1711
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:44,329
Candidates to be demoted from the First Class are...

1712
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,090
Kim Young Woong...

1713
01:08:46,329 --> 01:08:48,500
and Jung Hye Seong.

1714
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:51,300
Who will be demoted from the First Class?

1715
01:08:51,369 --> 01:08:53,868
Please check your class in the Class Confirmation Zone.

1716
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:55,569
Then, move to your Class Locker Room.

1717
01:08:56,869 --> 01:09:00,010
I'm a candidate for demotion, but it doesn't disturb me at all.

1718
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:03,038
I've been in competitions for six years.

1719
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,049
There's no reason to be happy or sad over small things.

1720
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,819
I'll just continue on my way.

1721
01:09:08,119 --> 01:09:09,649
Kim Young Woong.

1722
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,119
He's been demoted to the Second Class.

1723
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,560
Good work.

1724
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:17,859
You still fought well.

1725
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:19,489
Good job.

1726
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,300
Since Hye Seong didn't get...

1727
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:23,698
the main lead role,

1728
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:26,199
he probably had a mental breakdown.

1729
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,669
Compared to the energy that he had before,

1730
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:29,999
it's gotten much weaker.

1731
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,368
I think Young Woong has been undervalued.

1732
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,710
He's very skilled as a dancer,

1733
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,578
but maybe he lacks experience.

1734
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:38,680
- That's important too. - That's what I thought.

1735
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:41,020
(Hyun Ho found out what happened to Young Woong and Hye Seong.)

1736
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,520
Both of them got demoted.

1737
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:46,550
It's brutal that Young Woong and Hye Seong are in the Second.

1738
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,619
The competition will be fierce in the Second Class.

1739
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:50,890
I need to focus on the next mission.

1740
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:53,359
I'll focus and move back to the First Class.

1741
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,600
I'll have to get used to getting demoted.

1742
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:57,828
I performed so well...

1743
01:09:57,829 --> 01:10:00,829
during the mission that I don't regret anything.

1744
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,439
I don't feel embarrassed...

1745
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:04,810
about being in the Second Class.

1746
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:07,939
(Contemporary Dance Final Second Class)

1747
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,880
The total number of dancers...

1748
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:12,279
who got demoted from 1st to 2nd Class is 2.

1749
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,279
It determined the number of dancers to be promoted from the Second.

1750
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,488
The number of dancers to be promoted from 2nd to 1st Class is...

1751
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:20,189
two.

1752
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,789
Who will be promoted to the First Class?

1753
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:25,960
- Who will be in the 1st Class? - The 2 main supporting roles will.

1754
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:28,430
- I think so, too. - Then Hye Hyun gets promoted.

1755
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:30,699
Right. That would be dramatic.

1756
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:34,569
The Class Movement of Second Class candidates for promotion will start.

1757
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:38,010
Yun Hyeok Jung, Kim Hye Hyun, and Ryu Tae Young.

1758
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,479
Which dancer will be the first to move his class?

1759
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,739
It's Ryu Tae Young.

1760
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:47,510
Among Second Class dancers, I was wary about him the most.

1761
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:51,050
I hope that I'll move to First.

1762
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,189
I really want to join the First Class.

1763
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,260
It's impossible not to feel...

1764
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:58,260
ambitious.

1765
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:03,060
Ryu Tae Young in the Second Class.

1766

(Welcome to the First Class.)

1767
01:11:06,869 --> 01:11:08,969
He's been promoted to the First Class.

1768
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,140
(Ryu Tae Young is promoted to the First Class.)

1769
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,368
He got really absorbed in his role.

1770
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:16,409
He made it his and beyond.

1771
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,679
He keeps going up.

1772
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,948
I need to discourage him now.

1773
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:22,948
You sound malicious.

1774
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:24,550
I'm going to destroy them all.

Ryu Tae Young.

1776
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:29,890
He's been promoted to the First Class.

1777
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,890
It was either me or Hyeok Jung.

1778
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:36,630
I started to think that I might stay in Second.

1779
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,669
I didn't want to stay here.

1780
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,770
I only thought about moving up.

1781
01:11:41,069 --> 01:11:42,199
I will go up.

1782
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,069
I have no idea about this one.

1783
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,409
It'll be incredible if it's Hye Hyun.

1784
01:11:45,909 --> 01:11:48,609
Who do you think will be the last member in the First Class?

1785
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:51,079
It might be Hyeok Jung.

1786
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:53,180
- Hyeok Jung? - He has a bit more chance.

1787
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:56,520
The two dancers' Class Movement will start now.

1788
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,220
(Yun Hyeok Jung and Kim Hye Hyun check their class at the same time.)

1789
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:03,689
(Lowering their heads)

1790
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:05,329
I'm sorry.

1791
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,600
Oh, this is the First Class Locker Room.

1792
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,999
The result on the screen downstairs...

1793
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
(Opening suddenly)

1794
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:13,068
Hello.

1795
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:15,398
(Yun Hyeok Jung is promoted to the First Class.)

1796
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:17,140
Hello.

1797
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:18,510
Could it be...

1798
01:12:18,609 --> 01:12:19,869
(Seriously?)

1799
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:24,579
(Kim Hye Hyun is demoted to the Second Class.)

1800
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:29,379
He was the shortest in the group.

1801
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:32,350
- To keep the energy... - Physically, yes.

1802
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:35,619
Equally distributed on both sides,

1803
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,859
he executed the choreography so well.

1804
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,288
- He's very reliable. - Yes.

1805
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:43,559
Yun Hyeok Jung has to be one of the top...

1806
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,569
- to stand out more. - He would stand out.

1807
01:12:45,899 --> 01:12:48,500
(Contemporary Dance Final Class)

1808
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:50,269
(He's changing.)

1809
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,569
(Ballet Dance Film Main Role Casting Audition starts.)

1810
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:55,509
(Coldhearted evaluations on other class dancers)

1811
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,839
(What will be the result of Ballet Dance Film Mission?)

1812
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,050
(Korean Dance Class Movement Candidates are announced.)

1813
01:13:01,579 --> 01:13:05,119
(What will happen to the Korean dancers?)

1814
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:08,460
The next dance genre for the class evaluation is ballet.

1815
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:09,959
(Let's go, ballet.)

1816
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,329
Let's go.

1817
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:13,859
As there were dancers from other genres,

1818
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,300
I felt very nervous.

1819
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,169
It was determined by the Casting Audition.

1820
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:21,000
We'll reveal the casting board.

1821
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,369
I'm looking forward to watching ballet so much.

1822
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:26,069
I'm so curious.

1823
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,039
I was at a loss.

1824
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,539
I felt very nervous.

1825
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,679
I was tense.

1826
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,778
(What's the result of the Casting Audition for Ballet Dance Film?)

1827
01:13:32,779 --> 01:13:35,049
(Ballet Locker Room after the class was announced)

1828
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:36,050
(What?)

1829
01:13:36,051 --> 01:13:38,788
We'll reveal the casting board for Ballet Dance Film.

1830
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:39,919
(Devil Swan)

1831
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,760
The main lead role is Devil Swan.

1832
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:43,459
(Lead roles, supporting roles, ensemble)

1833
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,229
Two main supporting roles.

1834
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,090
I wanted the main lead role.

1835
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:50,299
I think that I'm closer to the Devil character.

1836
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,429
It's one of the hashtags on my profile.

1837
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:56,439
As a villain, I was perfect for the mission.

1838
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,809
(Casting Audition for "Devil Swan" Main Lead Role)

1839
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,739
Two lead dancers will choose two supporting dancers...

1840
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,510
to audition with.

1841
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,309
The chosen supporting dancers will get...

1842
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,608
a chance to audition.

1843
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,550
I'll have to make them pick me no matter what.

1844
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,849
Whom we pick is very important.

1845
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:11,250
Those who make a good match.

1846
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,250
Please pick me.

1847
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,488
It's a fight among supporting dancers.

1848
01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:18,528
Two of them become the main, and the other two become the sub.

1849
01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:20,559
I wasn't too worried.

1850
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,260
They will definitely pick me, right?

1851
01:14:22,329 --> 01:14:25,130
I wasn't wary of any of the dancers.

1852
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:26,769
I still felt confident,

1853
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:28,739
but I was a little worried.

1854
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,469
(First Class competing for the main lead role)

1855
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:33,969
(Second Class competing to be chosen for main supporting roles)

1856
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,278
(Relaxed)

1857
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:37,809
(Which dancer will get the main role for Ballet Dance Film?)

1858
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,050
(Supporting role practice room)

1859
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:42,380
Of course, I feel depressed.

1860
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,749
I started as the choreographer.

1861
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,349
(Although he was the choreographer, Min Kwon got demoted to Second.)

1862
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:47,619
I got demoted.

1863
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,019
However, I'm still motivated.

1864
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,489
Let's get picked no matter what.

1865
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:53,529
I felt confident.

1866
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,930
Whom you dance with will be important too.

1867
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,129
- Do you want to try it properly? - Sure.

1868
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:02,769
(Kim Kyung Won and Kim Yu Chan practice together quickly.)

1869
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,939
Yu Chan and Kyung Won made a good pair.

1870
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:06,510
I feel extremely nervous right now.

1871
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,738
(The first Main Lead Dancer Jung Sung Wook appears.)

1872
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:09,840
What's up?

1873
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,010
Hello.

1874
01:15:11,609 --> 01:15:14,108
I have to be picked by him...

1875
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,479
to get a chance to show myself.

1876
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,880
I should show him.

1877
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,818
Can I see you dance in pairs first?

1878
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:22,858
(First pair, Shin Min Kwon and Jeon Tae Hu)

1879
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:24,890
(Keeping an eagle eye)

1880
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:28,299
(Shin Min Kwon and Jeon Tae Hu aren't dancing in sync.)

1881
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,698
(Thinking)

1882
01:15:30,699 --> 01:15:32,270
(Min Kwon and Tae Hu's pair choreography is over.)

1883
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,969
Gosh, I ruined it.

1884
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:34,970
(Glancing)

1885
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:37,538
(Jung Sung Wook doesn't show much reaction.)

1886
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:39,339
I was worried...

1887
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:42,039
that my mistakes would affect Min Kwon.

1888
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,438
(Second pair, Kim Kyung Won and Kim Yu Chan)

1889
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,949
(Nodding)

1890
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:51,949
(As they practiced beforehand, they dance well as a pair.)

1891
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:57,560
I really liked their synergy effect.

1892
01:15:57,659 --> 01:16:01,090
Yu Chan and Kyung Won danced so much better as a pair.

1893
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,358
We have to dance together.

1894
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,130
I'd like to audition with you two.

1895
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:07,599
I got anxious.

1896
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,140
There was only Gyeong Ho left.

1897
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,640
Hello.

1898
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:13,769
(Restless)

1899
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:14,839
All four of you.

1900
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,340
- Tae Hu, come this way. - From the back?

1901
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:17,909
Yes.

1902
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,409
This time, I must get picked no matter what.

1903
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:21,319
(4 supporting dancers start at the same time.)

1904
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:27,390
(What's going on?)

1905
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,188
(Jeon Tae Hu didn't learn the choreography well.)

1906
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:30,560
My mind went blank.

1907
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:34,130
Min Kwon was dancing so well.

1908
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,760
He kept catching my attention.

1909
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,199
Tae Hu made so many mistakes in the combination.

1910
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:43,140
Tae Hu, you aren't familiar with the choreography.

1911
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:45,010
I must have lost my chance.

1912
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:46,510
It was a great sight.

1913
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:48,210
Tae Hu definitely won't make it.

1914
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:50,439
Tae Hu.

1915
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,010
Is the combination too difficult?

1916
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,219
I'm quite slow when it comes to memorizing combinations.

1917
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,219
I'll base it on my feelings.

1918
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:02,060
Whom did Sung Wook choose?

1919
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:03,858
He chose Kyung Won and Yu Chan.

1920
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:05,089
It was what I expected.

1921
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,960
Of course, you want to pick the best dancers.

1922
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:09,629
This time, I must get picked no matter what.

1923
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:10,930
My decision is...

1924
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,738
Shin Min Kwon.

1925
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:17,140
I felt relieved. He was right to recognize me.

1926
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:20,170
You will be dancing as a pair.

1927
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:21,578
Yes.

1928
01:17:21,579 --> 01:17:22,579
(Jeon Tae Hu is the only one who didn't get picked.)

1929
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:24,379
(Kang Gyeong Ho remains thoughtful until the end.)

1930
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,579
And...

1931
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,079
I thought that I'd definitely get picked.

1932
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,689
This could be risky, but...

1933
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:34,390
I'm sure that he'll do well.

1934
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,488
Tae Hu, let's audition together.

1935
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:38,858
(He picks Jeon Tae Hu.)

1936
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:40,359
I found it strange.

1937
01:17:41,329 --> 01:17:43,028
I didn't want to dance with him.

1938
01:17:43,029 --> 01:17:44,799
In a pair choreography,

1939
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,228
it looks fantastic only when both dancers do well.

1940
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,399
The dance looks better.

1941
01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:51,269
To be honest,

1942
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:53,568
I didn't pick Tae Hu because he danced well.

1943
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,210
Tae Hu's eyes...

1944
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:57,739
They were really...

1945
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:01,010
He had the eyes of a deer in front of a savage beast.

1946
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,220
I saw his attitude instead.

1947
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:04,720
He was earnest.

1948
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:07,889
You struggle with a few things from time to time.

1949
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:10,489
If you fix them, you'll improve a lot.

1950
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:13,659
- It's important to stretch it long. - Okay.

1951
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,829
Watch out the arms.

1952
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:17,960
Your movements aren't bad,

1953
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,328
so be more clear.

1954
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,398
Min Kwon has more movements.

1955
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:24,339
Min Kwon has to move faster,

1956
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:26,038
and you have to wait a little.

1957
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:28,039
I felt more confident then.

1958
01:18:28,109 --> 01:18:30,479
He was clearly improving.

1959
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,549
(Staring)

1960
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:33,749
Let's see how the other pair is doing.

1961
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,449
Don't we have to dance better than them?

1962
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,318
When we focused and practiced hard several times,

1963
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:40,549
we were getting in sync.

1964
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,389
Overall, they got much better.

1965
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:45,689
However, I felt confident about winning.

1966
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,489
No one can predict the result.

1967
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,560
(Ballet Casting Audition, STF Dance Company)

1968
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,568
(Ballet Coach Ryu Hoi Woong and Han Seong Woo arrive.)

1969
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:56,269
(Everyone applauds.)

1970
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,399
(Nervous)

1971
01:18:57,539 --> 01:19:00,309
I'm Ryu Hoi Woong, the choreographer of "Devil Swan."

1972
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:01,778
(Ryu Hoi Woong is a ballet coach and Dance Film choreographer.)

1973
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:02,909
(Welcoming)

1974
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:05,279
I'm Ballet Coach Han Seong Woo.

1975
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:07,810
(We look forward to it.)

1976
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:10,679
"Devil Swan" Main Supporting Role Casting Audition...

1977
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,819
will start now.

1978
01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:15,559
Main Supporting Roles, Black Swan Leader 1 and 2.

1979
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,359
Two of you will be cast.

1980
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:20,059
During the audition, you'll be evaluated...

1981
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,358
on how well you deliver the story...

1982
01:19:22,359 --> 01:19:25,199
and how well you dance with other characters.

1983
01:19:25,869 --> 01:19:28,169
If you don't get cast,

1984
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:30,269
you will get the sub supporting role...

1985
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,640
that supports the main supporting role.

1986
01:19:32,109 --> 01:19:33,710
I must play the main supporting role no matter what.

1987
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:36,079
(Ballet Main Supporting Role Casting Audition)

1988
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:39,148
Main supporting role candidates picked by Kang Gyeong Ho.

1989
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:42,119
Jeon Tae Hu and Shin Min Kwon, take your places.

1990
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:45,849
I wasn't wary of either of them,

1991
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:47,449
particularly Jeon Tae Hu.

1992
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:50,359
I'll just have to play my part.

1993
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,858
When you watch them dance, you get the idea.

1994
01:19:53,859 --> 01:19:56,460
Main supporting roles will probably be me and Yu Chan.

1995
01:19:56,729 --> 01:19:59,599
I should do everything to show them.

1996
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,539
I must take over the main role.

1997
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:03,099
(Glistening)

1998
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,100
(Good job.)

1999
01:20:04,101 --> 01:20:05,470
I'm confident about getting the main supporting role.

2000
01:20:06,409 --> 01:20:10,279
Three, two, one. Go.

2001
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,680
Oh, good.

2002
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,778
(Keeping them in check)

2003
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:20,389
It was clean, and they turned it into their own style.

2004
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:22,020
It was quite impressive.

2005
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:25,760
(Shin Min Kwon's clean moves)

2006
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,299
(Spotting with the eagle eye)

2007
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,429
(Jeon Tae Hu is one beat late.)

2008
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,430
(Late on the move)

2009
01:20:30,431 --> 01:20:31,800
(Late on the move)

2010
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:34,199
(Staggering)

2011
01:20:35,069 --> 01:20:36,600
(He makes a mistake on the jump.)

2012
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,210
Is he really the Second Class?

2013
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:41,139
Tae Hu was rushing.

2014
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:44,738
I felt nervous and pressured to do well.

2015
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:47,109
My body became tense, and I couldn't dance well.

2016
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:51,079
(Shin Min Kwon and Jeon Tae Hu's pair choreography is over.)

2017
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,318
Okay.

2018
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:53,319
(Thinking)

2019
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,520
(They clap for now.)

2020
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,220
It's obvious that Tae Hu isn't experienced.

2021
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,589
That's unfortunate.

2022
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:02,028
Jeon Tae Hu, what were you doing?

2023
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:04,699
You looked awkward including your gaze.

2024
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,170
I probably lost my main supporting role.

2025
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,899
During the shoot, I felt the most disheartened then.

2026
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,839
I couldn't remove the white swan image...

2027
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,209
from Shin Min Kwon.

2028
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:16,839
(Is it a harsh criticism for Shin Min Kwon?)

2029
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,978
I could see the black swan's dark side in you,

2030
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:21,720
so I want to compliment you.

2031
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:22,819
Thank you.

2032
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:25,619
I felt relieved. I thought that I might make it.

2033
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:27,619
Tae Hu, are you okay?

2034
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:28,859
I'm sorry.

2035
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:30,318
You did a good job.

2036
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,460
(The older dancers comfort him with affection.)

2037
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:35,028
Next up are two candidates chosen by Jung Sung Wook.

2038
01:21:35,029 --> 01:21:36,358
Let's start.

2039
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:37,500
First position.

2040
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:39,329
Music, start.

2041
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,469
(How will Kyung Won and Yu Chan perform as main supporting roles?)

2042
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,470
(Nervous)

2043
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:43,699
Go.

2044
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,279
(Glancing)

2045
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,719
(They move perfectly in sync like decalcomania.)

2046
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,779
They're good.

2047
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,390
They moved in harmony.

2048
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:03,859
(This is it.)

2049
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,590
(Splitting)

2050
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:08,760
(In awe)

2051
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:11,899
(Kim Kyung Won and Kim Yu Chan's pair choreography is over.)

2052
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,099
(They applaud at Kyung Won and Yu Chan's performance.)

2053
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,500
That was amazing.

2054
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,738
For me, Kim Yu Chan is one of the top...

2055
01:22:18,739 --> 01:22:21,269
most talented dancers on the show.

2056
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,479
I thought that he had a good chance.

2057
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,509
Kim Kyung Won showed his masculine beauty...

2058
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:29,520
and sexiness like the black swan.

2059
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:30,649
Both of them were incredible.

2060
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,220
He made a good choice.

2061
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:35,288
Main supporting roles...

2062
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:38,329
belonged to Kim Yu Chan and Kim Kyung Won.

2063
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:40,028
I'm sorry,

2064
01:22:40,029 --> 01:22:42,329
but Min Kwon and Tae Hu should be excluded.

2065
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:44,659
I was very worried.

2066
01:22:45,069 --> 01:22:46,829
(While the casting result seems predictable, )

2067
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,198
(Coach Ryu Hoi Woong is silent.)

2068
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,170
(Just clicking his pen)

2069
01:22:51,369 --> 01:22:53,938
(Why isn't he saying anything?)

2070
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:56,680
Then, I'd like to see a different pair this time.

2071
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,880
(A different pair?)

2072
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,880
(Taken aback)

2073
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:01,579
Kyung Won, please step out for a bit.

2074
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,419
Min Kwon, do you perhaps...

2075
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,090
Min Kwon, do you perhaps know the choreography for the other side?

2076
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,619
- Yes. - Is that possible?

2077
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,019
- Yes. - Then,

2078
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:11,960
let's see how it looks with Min Kwon in the picture.

2079
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:14,529
That's crazy.

2080
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:17,659
He must be contemplating between me and Kyung Won.

2081
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:20,500
I think I have better physical attributes.

2082
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,140
It's bothering me quite a lot.

2083
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,339
Still, I think I danced more naturally and smoothly.

2084
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:28,210
I think that's true.

2085
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,479
First position.

2086
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:31,439
Music, start.

2087
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:33,909
- I have to do well here. - Five, four,

2088
01:23:34,149 --> 01:23:35,720
- That's how I'll get the main role. - three, two,

2089
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,618
one. Go.

2090
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:40,189
(How will Shin Min Kwon's dance be when he's gritting his teeth?)

2091
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,960
(Shin Min Kwon dances naturally although it's the opposite part.)

2092
01:23:47,229 --> 01:23:48,229
(Changing drastically as the black swan)

2093
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,430
Oh, his gaze.

2094
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:52,369
His gaze suddenly changed.

2095
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:55,300
He gritted his teeth and changed his image too.

2096
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,238
(Kim Yu Chan and Shin Min Kwon's pair dance...)

2097
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:58,769
(for supporting roles ends.)

2098
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,770
(Satisfied)

2099
01:24:00,909 --> 01:24:04,180
I asked to see that very suddenly, but it was still good.

2100
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,948
(It bothers him.)

2101
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:08,050
I was glad. I thought I'd get the main supporting role.

2102
01:24:08,779 --> 01:24:12,920
I didn't think he'd move so well.

2103
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,989
This might be a bit tough.

2104
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,028
I'll see one more pair.

2105
01:24:19,029 --> 01:24:20,059
This time...

2106
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,629
(Once more?)

2107
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:24,300
Let's have Kyung Won take Yu Chan's place as the last pair.

2108
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,199
(Nervous)

2109
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,039
(The last chance to confirm his spot as the main supporting dancer)

2110
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,408
I'm confident.

2111
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:34,010
Let's get chosen this time, no matter what.

2112
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,439
I think it'll be fun.

2113
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:37,779
Let's begin.

2114
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:39,350
First position.

2115
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:41,350
Music, start.

2116
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,779
- I'm confident. - Five, four,

2117
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,449
- Let's do it just once more. - three, two, one.

2118
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:48,149
Go.

2119
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:53,930
(Scanning)

2120
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:01,599
In Kim Kyung Won's case,

2121
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,800
I could feel the energy he was exuding. That caught my eye.

2122
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,739
(Then, what about Shin Min Kwon?)

2123
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:10,809
(He misses the arm movement.)

2124
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,050
(He misses the turn.)

2125
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:13,579
Oh, dear.

2126
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,719
I just blew it.

2127
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,819
I suddenly lost my mind.

2128
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,250
I forgot the order.

2129
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:23,060
(Fumbling)

2130
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:24,890
I was totally out of it after getting the order wrong.

2131
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:26,930
I think I wasn't able to do much after that.

2132
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:31,060
(He keeps making mistakes as he felt out of it.)

2133
01:25:32,029 --> 01:25:33,029
(Oh, no)

2134
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:36,399
Oh, dear.

2135
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,470
(Kim Kyung Won and Shin Min Kwon's pair dance ends.)

2136
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:39,039
Okay.

2137
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,840
I'm doomed.

2138
01:25:43,609 --> 01:25:45,009
I will annouce...

2139
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,680
the ballet dance film's main supporting dancer.

2140
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:51,349
The first ballerino to be cast is Kim Yu Chan.

2141
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:53,419
(Kim Yu Chan is cast as the main supporting role, black swan leader.)

2142
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,090
(Congratulations.)

2143
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:56,689
(Giving him recognition)

2144
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,460
The second dancer is...

2145
01:25:58,989 --> 01:26:00,029
(Anxious and nervous)

2146
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,630
(Also anxious and nervous)

2147
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:03,299
The second dancer is...

2148
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,858
(Which dancer will take the remaining spot?)

2149
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:06,769
Kim Kyung Won. Congratulations.

2150
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:08,028
(Kim Kyung Won is cast as the main supporting role, black swan leader.)

2151
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:09,868
(Min Kwon did well too.)

2152
01:26:09,869 --> 01:26:11,399
(You worked hard.)

2153
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,938
(Feeling disappointed)

2154
01:26:12,939 --> 01:26:14,108
Honestly, I felt devastated,

2155
01:26:14,109 --> 01:26:17,979
because I felt like I was slipping step by step from First Class.

2156
01:26:18,279 --> 01:26:19,349
(He only got to be happy about getting First Class...)

2157
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:20,510
(for a little while until the Class Battle.)

2158
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,579
(He was demoted and came down to Second Class.)

2159
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:25,949
In a way, I'm in a lower position within the Second Class.

2160
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:30,420
I suddenly thought that I might go down to Under Class soon.

2161
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,260
Still, I will shoot the dance film well...

2162
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:35,500
and try to look better than the main supporting dancers.

2163
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:37,599
(Ballet Dance Film Main Supporting Dancers Casting Results)

2164
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,770
(Kim Kyung Won, Kim Yu Chan)

2165
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:41,369
"The main lead roles..."

2166
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,198
"The 2 main leads must choreograph the 10 ensemble members' formation."

2167
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,068
Oh, we have to choreograph it.

2168
01:26:46,069 --> 01:26:49,609
The main leads have to come up with the ensemble formation.

2169
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,339
That must be really hard for the main leads.

2170
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,009
The main leads must be busy.

2171
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:54,850
The main leads have so much pressure.

2172
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,019
(Kang Gyeong Ho and Jung Sung Wook start choreographing...)

2173
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,478
(their ensemble formations.)

2174
01:26:58,479 --> 01:26:59,488
(His hands move without hesitation.)

2175
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:01,189
First of all, Gyeong Ho...

2176
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:04,189
is good at choreography.

2177
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:08,029
I think I'd be lying if I said I wasn't wary of him.

2178
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:10,959
I wanted to put meaning into the group dance.

2179
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,930
When you think of a swan, the wings stand out.

2180
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:16,840
I think I wanted a formation that split everyone to the sides.

2181
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,608
(Jung Sung Wook was listening to "Swan Lake.")

2182
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:21,010
(Come to me, inspiration.)

2183
01:27:21,409 --> 01:27:22,909
The theme is a swan.

2184
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:26,350
I was inspired by the original classical ballet, "Swan Lake."

2185
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,948
In the last act of "Swan Lake,"

2186
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:30,578
the swans make a path in a diagonal line.

2187
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:33,149
I thought it would be good to copy that.

2188
01:27:33,619 --> 01:27:36,318
- One, two, three, four, - One, two, three, four,

2189
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:38,158
- five, six, seven, - five, six, seven...

2190
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,159
- eight. - Wait, and one!

2191
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,089
- Pas de chat, pose. - Nice.

2192
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:44,028
(Jung Sung Wook, the first candidate for the main lead appears.)

2193
01:27:44,029 --> 01:27:45,099
He brought something.

2194
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,600
You were all working really hard.

2195
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:50,099
- What did he bring? - Did he bring a self portrait?

2196
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,239
I came up with my own version of the formation.

2197
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:56,379
The formation was really simple.

2198
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:57,409
(A diagonal formation)

2199
01:27:58,439 --> 01:27:59,849
- So, this is... - Going in between like this?

2200
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:00,879
Yes.

2201
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,849
Unlike what I was worried about,

2202
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:05,079
the dancers in the back were visible too.

2203
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:06,488
I have an opinion.

2204
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:07,688
(An opinion?)

2205
01:28:07,689 --> 01:28:09,759
Wouldn't it be better to have the shorter dancers on this side?

2206
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,719
If the taller dancers stand here, they'll be hidden more.

2207
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,189
(Contemplating)

2208
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,328
It's just my opinion. Would it be better to have the taller guys here?

2209
01:28:15,329 --> 01:28:16,760
No, I'll just fix it like this.

2210
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,229
Oh, okay.

2211
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,299
It felt like he was just ordering us to do what he thought was right.

2212
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,699
I was walking on eggshells a bit.

2213
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,239
I have to take charge of a large group of people.

2214
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,369
I thought I should show them my strong side.

2215
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:31,179
When you look at foreign dance troupes, they don't care about age.

2216
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,609
Class should be all that matters here too.

2217
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,948
Let's try marking in this formation.

2218
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:37,050
- Can we do that? - Okay.

2219
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:40,849
(The ensemble rehearses the part they practiced.)

2220
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:42,158
(Making a mistake)

2221
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,788
(Jung Sung Wook checks the progress of their practice.)

2222
01:28:44,789 --> 01:28:46,028
(The swans have different timing and movements.)

2223
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,159
(Jumping)

2224
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,599
(Feeling dissatisfied)

2225
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,600
(Gritting his teeth)

2226
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:52,368
From what I saw now,

2227
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:53,970
the details are not fully there yet.

2228
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:57,238
For example, the parts where you move your arms like a swan's wings.

2229
01:28:57,239 --> 01:29:01,408
Some of you are moving them like an actual swan's wings,

2230
01:29:01,409 --> 01:29:02,810
but some of you are...

2231
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,039
moving like this.

2232
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,350
- Let's just try it once more. - Okay.

2233
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:09,118
(The ensemble rehearses again after Jung Sung Wook's feedback.)

2234
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:10,778
(Scanning)

2235
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:12,019
Watch the formation.

2236
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,318
This side slipped out right now.

2237
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:14,550
Watch the formation right here.

2238
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,920
Feel the people around you.

2239
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:19,189
Si On, didn't you go back a bit just now?

2240
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:21,859
There's about a step in difference.

2241
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:23,930
Kyu Tae, please move a little.

2242
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,828
You too. As much as you can.

2243
01:29:25,829 --> 01:29:26,829
That's it.

2244
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:29,569
He really emphasized being totally in sync for the group dance.

2245
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:32,068
- Could I see that once more? - Okay.

2246
01:29:32,069 --> 01:29:33,908
Once more. Just this part.

2247
01:29:33,909 --> 01:29:35,038
Once more.

2248
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:36,179
Let's try it once more.

2249
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,180
(The swans are fully trained.)

2250
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,880
I made you work so hard without any breaks.

2251
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:42,279
Let's take a short break,

2252
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:45,249
and it would be great if you could think about the comments...

2253
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,550
that I gave you.

2254
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:48,319
Why is it so hard?

2255
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:50,420
The ensemble isn't even being judged, but it's the hardest.

2256
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:55,829
(The practice kept going even after that.)

2257
01:29:56,359 --> 01:29:58,500
I think the most important part of the group dance...

2258
01:29:58,829 --> 01:30:01,100
is that it has to be pretty and beautiful.

2259
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:03,899
I think it was a rehearsal where we made things more complete.

2260
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,539
(Monitoring their practice video)

2261
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,539
- It looks so pretty now. - That's cool.

2262
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,409
It is pretty cool to see the diagonal lines like that.

2263
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:14,050
- Doesn't it look picturesque? - I know.

2264
01:30:14,949 --> 01:30:15,978
Thank you.

2265
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:17,219
(The group dance teaching ended without a hitch.)

2266
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,350
You all worked so hard.

2267
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:21,550
I have confidence. I think I'll be able to do well.

2268
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,259
(Kang Gyeong Ho, the second candidate...)

2269
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,419
(for the main lead appears.)

2270
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,420
He's here.

2271
01:30:25,489 --> 01:30:29,500
I think we have to go through some trial and error.

2272
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:32,770
Let's have you stand according to your heights.

2273
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:34,728
Yes, in order of your heights.

2274
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:37,670
And the reason why I came up with this formation...

2275
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,538
was to make you look like wings.

2276
01:30:40,539 --> 01:30:41,809
(Wings? Got it.)

2277
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:44,038
Let's have the group of three move a little to the back.

2278
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:45,238
(To the back)

2279
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:46,408
Let's come closer together a little.

2280
01:30:46,409 --> 01:30:47,409
Yes.

2281
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:48,710
Let's bring it in closer here.

2282
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,249
Really close. Yes.

2283
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,879
I was going to stand in a diagonal,

2284
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,390
but we don't have much time.

2285
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,420
So, we're just going to stand in a straight line.

2286
01:30:56,789 --> 01:30:58,359
I don't think this is going to work.

2287
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,560
(Kang Gyeong Ho seems to have a lot on his mind.)

2288
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:03,930
Will I be able to bring the things in my mind to reality?

2289
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,000
I kept wondering about that.

2290
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,140
(In the end, they start rehearsing in an incomplete formation.)

2291
01:31:09,699 --> 01:31:10,739
It was ruined.

2292
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:15,539
The wings I had in mind didn't happen at all.

2293
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,938
(Feeling mixed emotions)

2294
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:19,478
One, two, three...

2295
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:23,019
Could we change the direction of the wing movements a little?

2296
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,278
You're supposed to go like this.

2297
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:26,119
But let's change this slightly.

2298
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:28,859
I think you could make your arms almost like this.

2299
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,189
And I don't think you should look directly forward.

2300
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:32,630
This will be confusing.

2301
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,399
He still thought of something and tried hard.

2302
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,399
The movements kept changing so much.

2303
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:41,100
I'm done now. I've used my brain too much.

2304
01:31:41,569 --> 01:31:44,369
There's one thing I want to add.

2305
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,369
You know this motion in the middle?

2306
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,180
I don't really know what Gyeong Ho is thinking.

2307
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,438
Let's try to bring this out until the end.

2308
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:53,180
(Will Gyeong Ho's idea of wings be completed safe and sound?)

2309
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:56,749
(There's a nervous tension at STF Dance Company.)

2310
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:58,419
(The day of the Casting Audition for the Ballet Main Lead Dancer)

2311
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:00,049
We'll begin the audition now.

2312
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,220
The sub lead dancer will play the angel swan.

2313
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:04,189
The main lead is the devil swan.

2314
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:08,529
Two of the one lead dancers will be cast as the main lead.

2315
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:10,158
The audition will be on...

2316
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:12,600
the part where ten ensemble members dance with the main lead dancer.

2317
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:16,039
We will be judging you on choreography and creativity.

2318
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,800
- Kang Gyeong Ho. - Yes?

2319
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:19,538
Could you tell us which scene you thought of...

2320
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:22,579
as you choreographed the group dance formation?

2321
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,408
At first, it's in disorder,

2322
01:32:24,409 --> 01:32:27,009
but later, I wanted it to look like wings spreading out.

2323
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,219
That was what I was going for.

2324
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,680
So we can imagine wings spreading out as we watch?

2325
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:32,919
Yes, please.

2326
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,050
Then, please get ready.

2327
01:32:35,189 --> 01:32:36,890
- Yes. - Get into your first positions.

2328
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,460
Come forward here, and go back here.

2329
01:32:39,859 --> 01:32:41,259
At first, separate like this.

2330
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,999
As they lead the ensemble,

2331
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,228
they show whether they have what it takes to be the main lead.

2332
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:48,328
- That's it. - I think I was anxious.

2333
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:49,539
We're competitors.

2334
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:53,340
Honestly, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't wary of him.

2335
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:55,108
- Are you all ready? - Yes.

2336
01:32:55,109 --> 01:32:56,539
Yes, first position.

2337
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:58,739
Music,

2338
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:00,210
start.

2339
01:33:00,211 --> 01:33:03,649
Three, two, one. Go.

2340
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,159
(Suddenly, Kang Gyeong Ho moves forward.)

2341
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,789
Wait, what's happening now?

2342
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:16,229
Where are the wings?

2343
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,029
(The wing formation that Kang Gyeong Ho intended)

2344
01:33:19,869 --> 01:33:21,930
(The ensemble doesn't move even as the dance continues.)

2345
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,869
- There are no changes. - This was a big change?

2346
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,710
What did they practice?

2347
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:28,239
(Tilting his head)

2348
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:32,779
(They're not even dancing in sync.)

2349
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:36,180
(A deep sigh)

2350
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:37,849
(Kang Gyeong Ho can't look directly at the coaches.)

2351
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:38,880
(Dropping his head)

2352
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,550
That's too bad.

2353
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:42,590
The image that Gyeong Ho wanted...

2354
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:45,989
where the wings spread out...

2355
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:49,929
Honestly, I can't tell what that was at all.

2356
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:51,300
I can't tell what that was at all.

2357
01:33:51,399 --> 01:33:53,328
The ensemble remained in the same place from start to finish.

2358
01:33:53,329 --> 01:33:55,300
(There were no movements in Kang Gyeong Ho's formation.)

2359
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:56,970
I want to be nice,

2360
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,069
but there's really nothing nice to say.

2361
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,238
I felt like I had been stripped naked.

2362
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:05,010
I thought maybe this was my limit...

2363
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,109
in terms of choreographing the group dance.

2364
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:09,750
It's important to dance well as a ballerino,

2365
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:12,148
but I believe having a creative ability...

2366
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:13,618
is also important.

2367
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:15,220
I kept wondering...

2368
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:18,020
what Gyeong Ho actually did.

2369
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:19,159
Shall we see the second group?

2370
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,960
(Jung Sung Wook starts the dance in a diagonal formation.)

2371
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,430
The moves are visible overall.

2372
01:34:24,199 --> 01:34:26,829
- Then how will it change from here? - Right.

2373
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:29,939
(A good timing for the formation to move)

2374
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,300
(The dance continues without any changes in the diagonal formation.)

2375
01:34:32,739 --> 01:34:34,210
(This is even worse.)

2376
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:36,479
I don't know where to look.

2377
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:38,979
The music just...

2378
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:41,310
changed rhythms and tempos.

2379
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:43,520
But you don't see any changes.

2380
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:47,090
I was relieved, to be honest.

2381
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,260
(Well...)

2382
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:52,659
(The coaches are at a loss for words at the same situation.)

2383
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,460
If I knew it would be like this, I should've gone first.

2384
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,460
Was it your concept to stand in a diagonal formation?

2385
01:34:58,960 --> 01:34:59,970
The path of the swan?

2386
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:03,500
My intention was to express that.

2387
01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:06,408
Then, I don't think you directed anything.

2388
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:07,670
I don't think you directed anything.

2389
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,380
"Just dance in a diagonal formation."

2390
01:35:09,939 --> 01:35:11,380
I think that was it.

2391
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,278
But what I thought was...

2392
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:14,879
But what I thought was...

2393
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,119
that we could see those variations in other scenes.

2394
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,920
I thought that would be enough.

2395
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:21,449
But for this audition,

2396
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:23,420
in order to see results,

2397
01:35:23,819 --> 01:35:26,158
we wanted to see various movements...

2398
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:29,529
and how it works into this entire piece.

2399
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,659
If it were me,

2400
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:34,170
I would've made it work, even if I became a madman.

2401
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:37,140
I thought that the mission...

2402
01:35:37,569 --> 01:35:39,539
was a failure for both of them.

2403
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,069
Was that all they could've created...

2404
01:35:41,609 --> 01:35:43,939
with ten ensemble members?

2405
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:46,180
As the First Class,

2406
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:49,149
I thought they weren't entirely capable.

2407
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:51,880
I felt even more embarrassed.

2408
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:55,319
It was enough to feel humiliated.

2409
01:35:55,689 --> 01:35:57,459
Ballerinos actually don't...

2410
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,858
have much chances to create new choreography.

2411
01:35:59,859 --> 01:36:02,389
So, we wanted to see your abilities in that aspect,

2412
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,460
which was why we gave you this mission.

2413
01:36:04,659 --> 01:36:06,100
Actually, it was really difficult.

2414
01:36:06,199 --> 01:36:08,470
Ballet as a genre...

2415
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:09,969
is one where you dance...

2416
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:12,269
in a set repertoire.

2417
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:14,810
That's how it usually is, so I felt a bit lost.

2418
01:36:14,909 --> 01:36:16,639
I think our expectations were too high.

2419
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,038
Then, how do we judge them?

2420
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:20,779
The main leads, just 1 on 1? Okay.

2421
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:22,720
Thank you for that. Now,

2422
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:25,419
it's hard for us to choose a main lead dancer...

2423
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:27,149
based on the dances you performed with the ensemble.

2424
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:30,460
So, we will choose the main lead with a 1-on-1 battle.

2425
01:36:31,289 --> 01:36:34,760
This is a chance for me to make up for the mistake I made.

2426
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:37,399
I can do it. I'll be able to do it.

2427
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,199
I think I felt more sure than before.

2428
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:41,828
We will see...

2429
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:44,538
who has the acting skills and dancing abilities...

2430
01:36:44,539 --> 01:36:46,770
befitting the role of the Devil Swan.

2431
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,210
Jung Sung Wook will go first.

2432
01:36:49,909 --> 01:36:51,538
You can show us the solo part.

2433
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:54,180
Thinking that the villain is the main role,

2434
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:55,949
I wanted it even more.

2435
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:57,779
Go.

2436
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,420
(His facial expression changes suddenly.)

2437
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:03,158
He really looks like a black swan.

2438
01:37:03,159 --> 01:37:04,189
(All eyes are on him.)

2439
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:13,399
The lead dancers are the lead dancers, indeed.

2440
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,699
(Slipping)

2441
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:19,100
(Watching closely)

2442
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:22,609
- I might win if I get lucky. - Let's show them for sure.

2443
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:27,409
(The eyes of a hawk)

2444
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:33,449
He did well.

2445
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,989
I can't say anything about him in terms of personal abilities.

2446
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,390
Gosh, I really can't tell.

2447
01:37:39,689 --> 01:37:41,229
I wasn't certain at all at that point.

2448
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:42,800
Let's have Kang Gyeong Ho go right away.

2449
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,569
No matter how I think about it, I'm more suited to be the devil.

2450
01:37:46,829 --> 01:37:47,899
(Wiggling)

2451
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:49,500
He's transforming.

2452
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:52,000
- He has really gritted his teeth. - Here he goes.

2453
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:53,470
Go.

2454
01:37:57,609 --> 01:37:58,680
How does he do that?

2455
01:37:59,479 --> 01:38:00,750
(Coach Ryu Hoi Woong watches more seriously than ever.)

2456
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:09,220
There was an intensity you could feel from his facial expression.

2457
01:38:09,319 --> 01:38:11,090
He's like a crazy black swan.

2458
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:14,359
He's really good at acting.

2459
01:38:14,789 --> 01:38:15,829
He looks like an animated character.

2460
01:38:16,899 --> 01:38:18,600
(Kang Gyeong Ho showed a dominating ability for expression.)

2461
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:28,310
(Lead dancer Kang Gyeong Ho's solo dance is finished.)

2462
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:30,210
(Clapping and giving him recognition)

2463
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,739
He has sharpened his sword.

2464
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:33,380
Who do you think will become the main lead?

2465
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:36,720
Sung Wook seems to have inherent emotions.

2466
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:40,789
(Jung Sung Wook showed a devilish side within softness.)

2467
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,989
And Gyeong Ho seemed to express and exude his emotions.

2468
01:38:45,289 --> 01:38:48,329
(Kang Gyeong Ho expressed the devil through intense acting.)

2469
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:50,698
I think it will depend on who was closer to...

2470
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:54,069
the Black Devil Swan that the choreographer had in mind.

2471
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:56,799
This was a very difficult decision.

2472
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,068
We will announce the ballerino who has been cast...

2473
01:38:59,069 --> 01:39:02,140
in the role of the Devil Swan in the Ballet Dance Film.

2474
01:39:02,369 --> 01:39:04,908
I thought I could win because of the fact...

2475
01:39:04,909 --> 01:39:06,649
that the villain is the main lead.

2476
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:10,079
I was pretty satisfied. I felt rather confident.

2477
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:13,319
The main lead role of the Devil Swan...

2478
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:16,090
(Jung Sung Wook versus Kang Gyeong Ho)

2479
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:18,319
(Heart pounding and highly expectant)

2480
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:21,288
The role goes to Kang Gyeong Ho. Congratulations.

2481
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,289
(Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho is cast as the main lead role...)

2482
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,329
(of the Ballet Dance Film.)

2483
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,260
(Applauding and congratulating him)

2484
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:26,399
(Grinning)

2485
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:28,399
The Devil Swan that I imagined...

2486
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:31,499
was a character full of coldness and intensity.

2487
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,770
The intense...

2488
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:36,778
and powerful moves showed by Kang Gyeong Ho...

2489
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:39,510
seemed suited for the Devil Swan. That was why we chose him.

2490
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:42,649
I think I got really lucky this time.

2491
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:46,750
Although I'm the sub lead dancer, I'm still the only one in this role.

2492
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:48,649
I should steal people's eyes away.

2493
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:51,618
(Ballet Dance Film Main Lead Dancers Casting Results)

2494
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:53,789
(Main lead: Kang Gyeong Ho, Sub-lead: Jung Sung Wook)

2495
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:57,060
(The day of the Ballet Dance Film shoot)

2496
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,229
(A fancy makeup zone for the ballerinos)

2497
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:02,068
(The ballerinos are busy getting ready for the performance.)

2498
01:40:02,069 --> 01:40:03,139
(Taking off his top)

2499
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:06,140
(The ballerinos are busy getting ready for the performance.)

2500
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:08,408
- Gyeong Ho, you're the main lead? - Yes.

2501
01:40:08,409 --> 01:40:09,779
We'll give you this.

2502
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,409
- I'm even wearing a corset? - Yes.

2503
01:40:11,609 --> 01:40:13,149
Go and follow him.

2504
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:16,680
I think the key point of the main lead's costume is the corset.

2505
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,520
A man wearing a corset?

2506
01:40:18,619 --> 01:40:21,148
It could be a bit ironic,

2507
01:40:21,149 --> 01:40:23,459
but that corset could have the power...

2508
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:26,659
to grab people's attentions. I wanted that so badly.

2509
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:28,729
- My gosh. - Goodness.

2510
01:40:28,989 --> 01:40:30,399
- Coffee. - What's this?

2511
01:40:30,829 --> 01:40:31,829
What is this?

2512
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,599
- What is this? - Goodness.

2513
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:35,670
What is this? Is he an idol?

2514
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,269
- A coffee truck for the main lead? - What is this?

2515
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:39,539
Gosh, this is amazing.

2516
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:42,039
I wish I could get something like this sent to me.

2517
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:43,709
Gosh, I'm jealous.

2518
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:44,710
(The main lead dancer and recipient of the coffee truck appears.)

2519
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:45,710
That's awesome.

2520
01:40:45,711 --> 01:40:48,049
My face was on a huge banner.

2521
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:50,750
They even do this for me? I can't give this up.

2522
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,489
I'm also a lead dancer.

2523
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:56,890
Couldn't they have split the truck in half and put me on there too?

2524
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:59,119
I was really jealous as I saw that.

2525
01:40:59,529 --> 01:41:04,460
(The lead roles check their outfits one last time before shooting.)

2526
01:41:04,659 --> 01:41:06,169
- My gosh. - Gosh, that's crazy.

2527
01:41:06,170 --> 01:41:07,270
What's up with their outfits?

2528
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,769
They look like actual white and black swans.

2529
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:11,100
They get a definite perk.

2530
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,369
Honestly, in terms of judgment,

2531
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:17,180
it was easier for the 1st and 2nd Classes to judge us.

2532
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:21,779
(The ballerinos heard about the judging by other classes too.)

2533
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,979
(So the 1st and 2nd classes will be judging us?)

2534
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,350
(Surprised)

2535
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,619
(That's scary.)

2536
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,119
Just think of it simply.

2537
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:29,788
Minus one point for each mistake.

2538
01:41:29,789 --> 01:41:30,819
(Bursting into laughter)

2539
01:41:30,859 --> 01:41:32,359
Minus one point if he makes the wrong step?

2540
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,229
(They start with the 2-man scene with the lead dancers first.)

2541
01:41:36,029 --> 01:41:37,029
Oh, dear.

2542
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,560
(Kang Gyeong Ho loses his balance and staggers.)

2543
01:41:38,899 --> 01:41:39,970
(Oh, dear)

2544
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,199
(What will he do?)

2545
01:41:45,369 --> 01:41:47,039
(Kang Gyeong Ho grabs the inside of his thigh.)

2546
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:49,479
My adductor muscle had ruptured.

2547
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,978
I'm in really bad condition right now.

2548
01:41:51,979 --> 01:41:55,108
I think that will be included in the judging criteria too.

2549
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:56,720
That made me anxious.

2550
01:41:57,479 --> 01:42:00,149
Gyeong Ho seems to be in bad condition. What will he do?

2551
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:03,119
I know. You can tell he's not feeling great.

2552
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:09,159
(Next, the group rehearsal with everyone follows.)

2553
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:11,528
Moon Jun On was outside the angle.

2554
01:42:11,529 --> 01:42:12,929
Either just leave the angle,

2555
01:42:12,930 --> 01:42:15,630
or just stick right to the curtains here at the edge.

2556
01:42:15,869 --> 01:42:18,439
- Here? - Just stay here at the edge.

2557
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,270
Tae Seok showed us...

2558
01:42:20,369 --> 01:42:23,109
how good he was on a daily basis.

2559
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:25,879
(The ensemble practice for the Ballet Dance Film...)

2560
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:28,210
(was led by Kim Tae Seok.)

2561
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:30,920
(Soutenu. That's the important part.)

2562
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,050
(Hold it up.)

2563
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:33,350
(That's it!)

2564
01:42:33,449 --> 01:42:35,420
His years of experience and the skillful attitude from it.

2565
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,318
I could definitely see that in him.

2566
01:42:37,319 --> 01:42:39,220
He's not someone who should be in the Under Class.

2567
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:43,100
(The Ballet Ensemble's group shoot is up next.)

2568
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,260
(Stretching)

2569
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,699
(His back muscles are bulging.)

2570
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:54,170
Even from the monitor, I can tell Yun Gu has a nice body.

2571
01:42:54,369 --> 01:42:57,979
Kang Yun Gu stood out more than usual today.

2572
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:01,249
The outfit revealed his body explicitly.

2573
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:03,578
He knew he had a nice build...

2574
01:43:03,579 --> 01:43:07,090
and how to make use of it.

2575
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,460
(The supporting roles are shooting next.)

2576
01:43:12,289 --> 01:43:13,760
(A light jump)

2577
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:17,398
(Kim Kyung Won and Kim Yu Chan show strong energy as main lead roles.)

2578
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:19,528
(Perfect teamwork)

2579
01:43:19,529 --> 01:43:20,529
(Stretching his leg)

2580
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:22,669
Yu Chan stands out.

2581
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:23,869
(Stealing attention)

2582
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:30,239
Yu Chan was so cool. He was amazing.

2583
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:31,738
I got the chills.

2584
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:34,679
The sub supporting roles are just subs.

2585
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,279
All I could see were the two in front.

2586
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:38,979
People in the back didn't catch my attention at all.

2587
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:41,720
Even though they didn't catch my attention, Tae Hu got it wrong.

2588
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:45,920
(Jeon Tae Hu was the only one late.)

2589
01:43:46,329 --> 01:43:48,528
The gap between main and sub supporting roles...

2590
01:43:48,529 --> 01:43:49,800
was too big.

2591
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:53,368
I got the feeling he'd be brought down from Second Class.

2592
01:43:53,369 --> 01:43:55,269
(After shooting the Dance Film)

2593
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:59,469
(The dancers began voting for promotion and demotion.)

2594
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:01,969
I can't wait to see what they think of me.

2595
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:03,510
But I'm also worried at the same time.

2596
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:05,778
I hope they recognize me...

2597
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:08,850
and promote me.

2598
01:44:09,479 --> 01:44:12,578
(Promotion and demotion candidates are ready.)

2599
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:16,858
We will begin the ballerinos' class evaluation...

2600
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:19,889
through the Ballet Dance Film, "Devil Swan."

2601
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:20,890
Good luck.

2602
01:44:20,891 --> 01:44:22,228
(Revealing the Ballet Dance Film)

2603
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:23,828
(Let's go, ballet!)

2604
01:44:23,829 --> 01:44:25,259
(Expectant)

2605
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:26,300
Let's go!

2606
01:44:27,369 --> 01:44:28,369
(Thumbs-up)

2607
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:30,439
The climax of beauty.

2608
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:33,408
The king of black swans, the Devil Swan.

2609
01:44:33,409 --> 01:44:35,538
That means the Devil Swan has to be very strong.

2610
01:44:35,539 --> 01:44:37,339
Is it seductive and strong?

2611
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:39,608
I think he did a good job of expressing it.

2612
01:44:39,609 --> 01:44:40,879
- But we'll have to see. - Right.

2613
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,710
I'm so excited for this video.

2614
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,590
Why am I getting nervous?

2615
01:44:47,289 --> 01:44:48,390
I can't watch it.

2616
01:44:49,819 --> 01:44:50,890
"Devil Swan."

2617
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:52,689
It's beyond "Black Swan."

2618
01:44:53,789 --> 01:44:55,560
I can't wait to watch ballet.

2619
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,259
(The swans appear.)

2620
01:44:58,260 --> 01:44:59,630
(Everyone exclaims.)

2621
01:45:02,199 --> 01:45:04,270
- They nailed it. - It's already so impressive.

2622
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,909
That's so cool.

2623
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:09,810
That's marvelous.

2624
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:13,448
(The swans' elegant move)

2625
01:45:13,449 --> 01:45:14,880
- It's artistic. - Their muscles...

2626
01:45:15,909 --> 01:45:17,520
Look at Yun Gu's body.

2627
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:19,250
Look at their bodies.

2628
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:30,960
Their lines are so neat.

2629
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:32,529
It's beautiful.

2630
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:34,069
It's wonderful.

2631
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:36,739
The weight of classical music.

2632
01:45:41,409 --> 01:45:42,539
Gosh, Gyeong Ho.

2633
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,978
He's sexy.

2634
01:45:46,979 --> 01:45:48,109
Ballet is remarkable.

2635
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:54,220
- It's so cool. - They're all very good.

2636
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,189
They look light.

2637
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,189
Ballet is really beautiful.

2638
01:46:08,869 --> 01:46:10,340
I love it.

2639
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,640
All I see is the main lead role.

2640
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:19,750
The group dance is easily seen.

2641
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:22,210
It's giving me goosebumps.

2642
01:46:25,319 --> 01:46:26,818
Let's go.

2643
01:46:26,819 --> 01:46:28,119
Show us.

2644
01:46:28,789 --> 01:46:32,658
(The Devil Swan's seductive movement)

2645
01:46:32,659 --> 01:46:33,659
That's so pretty.

2646
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,029
I'm getting the chills.

2647
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:37,630
It's beautiful.

2648
01:46:40,869 --> 01:46:42,130
We appear a lot.

2649
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,840
More than expected.

2650
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,340
It must've been so hard to be in sync.

2651
01:46:48,539 --> 01:46:50,279
He's in the spotlight alone.

2652
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:53,579
That's really neat.

2653
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:56,920
They're amazing.

2654
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:00,250
They really look like black swans and white swans.

2655
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:02,449
They're flying.

2656
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:07,130
It's fun to watch ballet skills.

2657
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:08,889
The sub supporting roles don't stand out.

2658
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:10,300
I don't see them.

2659
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,270
That's really elegant.

2660
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,600
How can they be human legs?

2661
01:47:20,039 --> 01:47:22,810
(The lead roles appear.)

2662
01:47:23,069 --> 01:47:25,340
(That's crazy.)

2663
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:27,279
The pirouette battle.

2664
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:29,148
Right. Ballet is all about the turns.

2665
01:47:29,149 --> 01:47:30,220
So cool.

2666
01:47:33,289 --> 01:47:34,890
The chandeliers are nice.

2667
01:47:36,689 --> 01:47:37,689
They're so pretty.

2668
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:39,930
I can tell the set cost a lot.

2669
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:42,460
That's what you call ballet.

2670
01:47:45,729 --> 01:47:47,898
Two men doing a pas de deux.

2671
01:47:47,899 --> 01:47:50,039
(Perfect teamwork)

2672
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,710
Even the supporting roles look awesome.

2673
01:47:55,909 --> 01:47:57,010
Look at Yu Chan.

2674
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:59,810
- That's crazy. - Yu Chan is amazing.

2675
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:02,109
(Frowning)

2676
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:06,890
- I can feel the weight. - Stretching the leg.

2677
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:11,220
Men's duet?

2678
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:12,819
I love it.

2679
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,159
It's pretty.

2680
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:18,199
(Jumping)

2681
01:48:19,029 --> 01:48:20,130
(Jumping again)

2682
01:48:21,329 --> 01:48:22,698
That's terrific.

2683
01:48:22,699 --> 01:48:23,699
(Super focused)

2684
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:25,369
Ballet is cool.

2685
01:48:26,909 --> 01:48:27,938
What?

2686
01:48:27,939 --> 01:48:29,880
- The highlight is clear. - I know.

2687
01:48:33,649 --> 01:48:34,779
I'm getting the chills.

2688
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:39,279
This is the trio choreography.

2689
01:48:40,289 --> 01:48:41,590
They're clearly energetic.

2690
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,060
All I see are the lead roles.

2691
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,729
The white swan stands out so much.

2692
01:48:50,729 --> 01:48:52,029
So cool.

2693
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:55,100
I can't believe how high they can jump.

2694
01:48:55,829 --> 01:48:56,939
(The Angel Swan appears.)

2695
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,609
This is so cool.

2696
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:05,380
Even the sub lead role is good.

2697
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:11,079
It looks like the white swan is the main lead role.

2698
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:15,020
Sung Wook's energy outdoes Gyeong Ho.

2699
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:19,260
(Manege by supporting roles around the Angel Swan)

2700
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:24,859
The supporting roles barely stand out.

2701
01:49:27,369 --> 01:49:29,130
It's nice and tough.

2702
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,699
They look terrific.

2703
01:49:33,939 --> 01:49:35,470
Gosh, they nailed it.

2704
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:38,738
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

2705
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:41,309
(You can listen to the music in the Dance Film on various platforms.)

2706
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:43,049
(That's ballet for you.)

2707
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:44,050
Bravo!

2708
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:46,550
(Applauding in satisfaction)

2709
01:49:46,989 --> 01:49:49,020
- That was nice. - It was beautiful.

2710
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:51,420
It was awesome. I got the chills.

2711
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:53,260
Ballet is crazy.

2712
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:55,630
Good job, ballet.

2713
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:59,199
You could barely see them.

2714
01:49:59,899 --> 01:50:01,600
The ensemble stood out more.

2715
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:04,539
I looked forward to it a lot,

2716
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:06,170
but I was barely seen.

2717
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,839
I don't know where it went wrong.

2718
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,680
I was confused.

2719
01:50:11,579 --> 01:50:13,710
Sung Wook played the sub lead role.

2720
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:17,180
He did capture everyone's attention.

2721
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:20,549
I think I wasn't good enough...

2722
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:22,590
to lead the play this time.

2723
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,390
I was worried a lot.

2724
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:29,029
I think everyone focused on me.

2725
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:32,560
I wouldn't be demoted.

2726
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:34,169
(Ballet Dance Film Judge Zone)

2727
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:38,000
I felt the energy from the start.

2728
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:40,809
I knew it couldn't help but be terrific.

2729
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:42,639
Honestly,

2730
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:44,880
the ballerinos that caught my attention...

2731
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:46,510
were only a few in number.

2732
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:50,148
Rather than lead roles and supporting roles,

2733
01:50:50,149 --> 01:50:52,520
I think the ensemble did better.

2734
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:56,389
Now, through the class evaluation,

2735
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:59,719
I'll announce the number of promotion candidates...

2736
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,328
and demotion candidates and their names...

2737
01:51:02,329 --> 01:51:03,500
voted by the ballerinos.

2738
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,698
I will announce the promotion candidates...

2739
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,000
of the Under Class of ballet.

2740
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:08,930
Two promotion candidates of Under Class...

2741
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,500
were voted by First Class,

2742
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,738
and another 2 by 2nd Class.

2743
01:51:14,739 --> 01:51:16,709
Among the ballerinos selected by the two classes,

2744
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:18,710
there was no duplicate.

2745
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:22,448
No?

2746
01:51:22,449 --> 01:51:24,920
The number of promotion candidates of Under Class...

2747
01:51:26,789 --> 01:51:28,119
is four.

2748
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:29,788
Right.

2749
01:51:29,789 --> 01:51:30,988
There are only 4 people in 2nd Class,

2750
01:51:30,989 --> 01:51:32,389
and we're all at risk.

2751
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,090
Four means a lot to them.

2752
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:36,859
Wait. Then I might have a chance.

2753
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:40,430
I think I made it within the four.

2754
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:43,898
The first promotion candidate of Under Class is...

2755
01:51:43,899 --> 01:51:45,539
I'm so nervous. Why am I so nervous?

2756
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:47,640
My heart is pounding.

2757
01:51:48,039 --> 01:51:49,608
(Under Class promotion candidate 1: Kim Tae Seok)

2758
01:51:49,609 --> 01:51:51,479
It's Kim Tae Seok.

2759
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:53,079
Nice.

2760
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:55,108
Nice.

2761
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:56,149
(4 votes out of 6)

2762
01:51:56,409 --> 01:51:58,148
(Looking elegant)

2763
01:51:58,149 --> 01:51:59,350
He looks like he's up for a mayor election.

2764
01:51:59,649 --> 01:52:01,249
(The first promotion candidate, Kim Tae Seok)

2765
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:03,149
(He was the ensemble leader in ballet.)

2766
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,390
(To enhance the quality of the group dance, )

2767
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:09,228
(Kim Tae Seok volunteered to be a leader and led the ensemble.)

2768
01:52:09,229 --> 01:52:11,529
Jung Sung Wook in First Class said,

2769
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,868
"The best leadership. He already has what it takes."

2770
01:52:14,869 --> 01:52:17,539
"Hurry up and come up."

2771
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:20,809
(Thanks, Wook.)

2772
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:23,478
Jeon Tae Hu in Second Class said,

2773
01:52:23,479 --> 01:52:25,380
"It's a shame that his prime is over."

2774
01:52:25,479 --> 01:52:26,849
"But he put on a good show..."

2775
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:29,179
"based on his experience and age."

2776
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,180
(Wary)

2777
01:52:31,479 --> 01:52:33,720
- "His prime is over." - "Prime."

2778
01:52:33,819 --> 01:52:34,819
"Prime."

2779
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:36,590
It's true, though.

2780
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:38,760
It's been a decade since it was over.

2781
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:40,960
The youngest provokes him.

2782
01:52:41,729 --> 01:52:43,089
I will continue to reveal the promotion candidates...

2783
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,500
of Under Class.

2784
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:47,430
The next promotion candidate of Under Class is...

2785
01:52:48,029 --> 01:52:49,029
Please.

2786
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,799
(Under Class promotion candidate 2: Kang Yun Gu)

2787
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,969
- It's Kang Yun Gu. - Oh, Yun Gu.

2788
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:54,409
That's the way it should be.

2789
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,769
I knew I'd make the promotion candidate.

2790
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,609
I wasn't so surprised.

2791
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:00,779
Kang Gyeong Ho in First Class said,

2792
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:03,479
"I want to see more of his dance."

2793
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:04,979
That was short and to the point.

2794
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:07,090
Jeon Tae Hu in Second Class said,

2795
01:53:08,189 --> 01:53:09,519
"He has a nice build..."

2796
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,220
"and pulled off the choreography easily."

2797
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,589
- "Easily." - "Easily."

2798
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:15,960
(A somewhat obscure compliment)

2799
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,100
I will reveal the next promotion candidate of Under Class.

2800
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,100
It's Choi Kyu Tae.

2801
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:24,839
Hey.

2802
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,970
(1 out of 2 votes from 1st Class, 1 vote out of 6)

2803
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:30,069
Jung Sung Wook in First Class said,

2804
01:53:30,939 --> 01:53:32,639
"The way he dances with sincerity..."

2805
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:35,479
"should be highly evaluated."

2806
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:37,279
That's true.

2807
01:53:37,779 --> 01:53:39,318
(Three promotion candidates are announced.)

2808
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:41,489
Now, only one spot remains.

2809
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,619
I put my soul into it.

2810
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,420
So I had my hopes up.

2811
01:53:47,159 --> 01:53:49,189
I thought I'd become a candidate.

2812
01:53:50,229 --> 01:53:51,999
The promotion candidate of Under Class...

2813
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,399
decided by class evaluation.

2814
01:53:53,729 --> 01:53:55,029
The last candidate is...

2815
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:58,198
Please make me the candidate.

2816
01:53:58,199 --> 01:53:59,539
Please. Seriously.

2817
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:02,310
(Desperate)

2818
01:54:04,109 --> 01:54:06,209
Park Min Woo.

2819
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:07,649
(3 out of 4 votes from 2nd Class, 3 votes out of 6)

2820
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:09,879
Good job.

2821
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,380
- Min Woo pulled it off well. - He did.

2822
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:13,988
Min Woo has...

2823
01:54:13,989 --> 01:54:16,050
- nice basic skills. - Right.

2824
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:19,289
That can certainly become his strength.

2825
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,228
But due to the shape of his body,

2826
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:23,429
it's been neglected.

2827
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:24,499
It's a bummer.

2828
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,828
His skills were hidden by that.

2829
01:54:26,829 --> 01:54:27,829
Right.

2830
01:54:28,199 --> 01:54:30,340
Kim Kyung Won in Second Class said,

2831
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:32,170
"Only if he loses weight."

2832
01:54:32,539 --> 01:54:33,809
"he'll move more softly..."

2833
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:36,840
"than the previous First Class."

2834
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:38,409
I am trying.

2835
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,310
Now that four promotion candidates of Under Class have been announced,

2836
01:54:42,649 --> 01:54:44,349
the other six ballerinos in Under Class,

2837
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:46,219
except for the four promotion candidates,

2838
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:48,920
will remain in Under Class once again.

2839
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:51,319
I was disheartened.

2840
01:54:51,819 --> 01:54:53,520
Did I not do well compared to others?

2841
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:55,029
Did I not stand out?

2842
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:57,199
It doesn't make any sense.

2843
01:54:58,630 --> 01:54:59,858
Next, I will announce...

2844
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:03,739
the demotion candidates of Second Class.

2845
01:55:04,869 --> 01:55:06,500
The demotion candidate of Second Class is...

2846
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:08,608
(The 2 demotion candidates of 2nd Class)

2847
01:55:08,609 --> 01:55:10,310
Two people in total.

2848
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:11,909
That's half.

2849
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:13,849
(2 out of 4 are demotion candidates.)

2850
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:16,408
Both First and Under Classes...

2851
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:20,489
voted for the same ballerinos.

2852
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:22,119
(Shocked)

2853
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:24,659
The 1st demotion candidate of 2nd Class is...

2854
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:28,529
Jeon Tae Hu.

2855
01:55:30,029 --> 01:55:32,159
Jung Sung Wook in First Class said,

2856
01:55:32,699 --> 01:55:33,699
(Me?)

2857
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:36,930
"He still lacks experience."

2858
01:55:38,199 --> 01:55:39,399
In Under Class...

2859
01:55:39,539 --> 01:55:40,969
Don't mention my name.

2860
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:42,340
Kim Tae Seok said,

2861
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:44,380
(Oh, no.)

2862
01:55:44,739 --> 01:55:46,880
"He's too young."

2863
01:55:47,609 --> 01:55:49,079
How was his performance?

2864
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:51,719
When he was dancing,

2865
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:54,390
he looked flustered.

2866
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,949
He looked clumsy for that reason.

2867
01:55:58,220 --> 01:55:59,220
He's cute.

2868
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:01,829
He's cute. Period.

2869
01:56:02,229 --> 01:56:03,759
I'll be straightforward.

2870
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,760
He should give up on Second Class.

2871
01:56:05,899 --> 01:56:07,069
That's intense.

2872
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:11,569
Jeon Tae Hu, how do you feel?

2873
01:56:12,199 --> 01:56:14,010
(I can't watch this.)

2874
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:16,170
That doesn't bother me at all.

2875
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:19,309
Whether it's Under Class or Second Class,

2876
01:56:19,310 --> 01:56:21,309
that's only part of the process...

2877
01:56:21,310 --> 01:56:23,550
to reach First Class.

2878
01:56:24,149 --> 01:56:25,949
I will make it to First Class soon.

2879
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:28,689
You better watch out.

2880
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,989
Nice.

2881
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,789
- That's war. - I know.

2882
01:56:34,359 --> 01:56:35,430
This is intriguing.

2883
01:56:35,689 --> 01:56:37,029
The confident youngest.

2884
01:56:37,329 --> 01:56:39,199
Do you think you will be demoted?

2885
01:56:40,529 --> 01:56:45,399
People in Under Class think I'm easy to deal with.

2886
01:56:46,539 --> 01:56:47,539
(What's wrong with him?)

2887
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:48,669
He's so strong.

2888
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:50,710
I think I'll be demoted.

2889
01:56:50,979 --> 01:56:54,579
But it's more fun when I reach the top...

2890
01:56:54,949 --> 01:56:57,350
from the bottom.

2891
01:56:57,779 --> 01:56:59,720
Did someone give him arginine or something?

2892
01:57:00,619 --> 01:57:01,789
That's insane.

2893
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:04,819
I will make it real fun.

2894
01:57:05,989 --> 01:57:07,020
The youngest.

2895
01:57:08,359 --> 01:57:09,659
- Cool. - Nice.

2896
01:57:10,659 --> 01:57:11,760
The gourmet.

2897
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:14,500
I will announce the second candidate.

2898
01:57:15,399 --> 01:57:17,399
The 2nd demotion candidate of 2nd Class is...

2899
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:20,738
(2nd Class demotion candidate 2: Shin Min Kwon)

2900
01:57:20,739 --> 01:57:23,539
Shin Min Kwon.

2901
01:57:24,039 --> 01:57:25,979
- Isn't he the choreographer? - Yes.

2902
01:57:26,609 --> 01:57:28,379
He was demoted to 2nd from 1st.

2903
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,380
- And now from 2nd to... - Shin Min Kwon...

2904
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:34,550
Min Kwon wasn't enthusiastic...

2905
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:37,889
nor was he aware...

2906
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:39,920
of the competition.

2907
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:41,459
Here is what I think.

2908
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:43,329
If he didn't stand out or play much of a role,

2909
01:57:43,729 --> 01:57:45,629
he should've talked to the choreographer.

2910
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:47,499
But he didn't do that.

2911
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:50,028
He just watched it with no part.

2912
01:57:50,029 --> 01:57:51,100
I think that was...

2913
01:57:52,069 --> 01:57:53,099
offensive.

2914
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,608
You mean his attitude...

2915
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:56,010
He had an attitude problem?

2916
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:59,278
Moon Jun On in Under Class said,

2917
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:01,979
"He doesn't look passionate or desperate."

2918
01:58:02,579 --> 01:58:06,050
"It wasn't an irreplaceable dance."

2919
01:58:06,619 --> 01:58:08,590
- That's intense. - Shin Min Kwon...

2920
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:11,719
It doesn't feel nice.

2921
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,059
But I pulled myself together...

2922
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,729
and clenched my teeth.

2923
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,359
If I'm demoted to Under Class,

2924
01:58:19,159 --> 01:58:21,699
I will be fiercer.

2925
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:24,600
You better be ready.

2926
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:30,439
Next, I will announce the promotion candidate of Second Class.

2927
01:58:32,039 --> 01:58:33,039
So nervous.

2928
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:35,809
I felt confident about this mission.

2929
01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:39,318
I thought I deserved to be the promotion candidate.

2930
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:40,619
I had my hopes up.

2931
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:42,920
The 1st promotion candidate of 2nd Class is...

2932
01:58:45,989 --> 01:58:47,119
(Ballet 2nd Class Promotion Candidate)

2933
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:50,289
Kim Yu Chan.

2934
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:53,359
I've seized my chance.

2935
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:56,099
Kim Yu Chan proved himself...

2936
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:58,239
by winning the main supporting role.

2937
01:58:58,899 --> 01:59:02,509
Did Kim Kyung Won, who played the main supporting role...

2938
01:59:02,510 --> 01:59:04,340
with Kim Yu Chan, become a promotion candidate?

2939
01:59:05,010 --> 01:59:06,909
I will reveal it now.

2940
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:09,448
(2nd Class promotion candidate 2: Kim Kyung Won)

2941
01:59:09,449 --> 01:59:10,749
Kim Kyung Won became...

2942
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:13,119
another promotion candidate in Second Class.

2943
01:59:13,819 --> 01:59:15,189
(Both main supporting roles won the chance to be promoted.)

2944
01:59:15,449 --> 01:59:17,319
(A harmony of soft and strong created the best synergy.)

2945
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:19,259
(The two main supporting roles were as good as the lead roles.)

2946
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:21,228
This is what Kang Gyeong Ho in First Class said...

2947
01:59:21,229 --> 01:59:23,489
about the main supporting role, Kim Kyung Won.

2948
01:59:24,060 --> 01:59:26,800
"First place in Dance Film."

2949
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:29,100
And about Kim Yu Chan, he said,

2950
01:59:29,729 --> 01:59:31,769
"Good at ballet."

2951
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:32,840
(Good at ballet)

2952
01:59:33,069 --> 01:59:34,069
(Mr. Good At Ballet and Mr. 1st Place In Dance Film are touched.)

2953
01:59:34,069 --> 01:59:35,069
Nice.

2954
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:36,339
(Mr. Good at Ballet and Mr. 1st Place In Dance Film are touched.)

2955
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:37,439
I agree.

2956
01:59:37,539 --> 01:59:38,909
It can't get any better than that.

2957
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:40,609
Thanks.

2958
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:44,849
Next, I will announce the demotion candidates of First Class.

2959
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:46,250
(Nervous)

2960
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:50,090
The 1st demotion candidate of 1st Class is...

2961
01:59:50,989 --> 01:59:53,858
By first, does he mean both people could be demotion candidates?

2962
01:59:53,859 --> 01:59:55,130
What if they're both mentioned?

2963
01:59:55,390 --> 01:59:56,689
The opinions were divided.

2964
01:59:57,699 --> 01:59:59,829
This is solely my opinion.

2965
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:03,698
I think Gyeong Ho's expression is fragmentary.

2966
02:00:03,699 --> 02:00:05,869
We've only seen how energetic he could be.

2967
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:08,939
Sung Wook ran out of what he had.

2968
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:10,579
It feels like he's run out.

2969
02:00:10,909 --> 02:00:12,979
I'm not looking forward to seeing his next move.

2970
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:14,478
I think Gyeong Ho should stay,

2971
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:16,909
and Sung Wook should be demoted.

2972
02:00:17,079 --> 02:00:20,750
It's better to keep Sung Wook in First Class.

2973
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:21,989
I can never choose.

2974
02:00:22,149 --> 02:00:24,119
It's difficult.

2975
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,430
Based on the Dance Film mission,

2976
02:00:27,789 --> 02:00:32,130
I think I captured everyone's attention.

2977
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,569
I wouldn't be demoted.

2978
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:39,300
I believe I did what I had to do.

2979
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:42,710
Nothing really worries me that much.

2980
02:00:43,409 --> 02:00:45,839
(Who will become the demotion candidate among the two?)

2981
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,309
(Ballet 1st Class Demotion Candidate)

2982
02:00:47,310 --> 02:00:48,679
(1st Class demotion candidate: Jung Sung Wook)

2983
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:50,109
It's Jung Sung Wook.

2984
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:54,220
It felt like I got backstabbed big time.

2985
02:00:54,520 --> 02:00:56,050
I had all kinds of thoughts.

2986
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,259
(On eggshells)

2987
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,459
Shin Min Kwon in Second Class,

2988
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,689
who chose Jung Sung Wook as the demotion candidate, said,

2989
02:01:03,859 --> 02:01:06,759
"He expressed the white swan, which didn't match him."

2990
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:09,500
"It was evident that he tried."

2991
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,698
"However, I don't expect him to express well..."

2992
02:01:12,699 --> 02:01:14,109
"in future missions."

2993
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:16,270
That was his comment.

2994
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,109
That basically means he just tried his best.

2995
02:01:21,949 --> 02:01:23,449
(Grabbing)

2996
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:31,989
The fact that a 2nd Class commented on a 1st Class...

2997
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,289
(Crying)

2998
02:01:34,659 --> 02:01:36,430
(Who are you to evaluate me?)

2999
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,460
(Eyes open wide)

3000
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,869
- That was intense. - This is it.

3001
02:01:41,399 --> 02:01:42,899
(It's fun to watch ballet.)

3002
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:46,470
It doesn't make sense to me.

3003
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:48,409
Still, everyone...

3004
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:50,340
- Cool. - has their opinion.

3005
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:52,279
I respect it, but that's it.

3006
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:54,380
Okay.

3007
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:56,510
Ballerinos are fierce.

3008
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:58,049
Ballerinos are fierce.

3009
02:01:58,050 --> 02:01:59,079
They're fierce.

3010
02:01:59,319 --> 02:02:00,350
They're scary.

3011
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:02,619
The remaining First Class member is...

3012
02:02:02,819 --> 02:02:05,359
Kang Gyeong Ho, who played the main lead role.

3013
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:08,060
Will he remain in First Class...

3014
02:02:08,289 --> 02:02:10,029
or become a demotion candidate?

3015
02:02:10,590 --> 02:02:12,229
I will reveal it now.

3016
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:15,929
The votes might be divided.

3017
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:17,228
They might both be candidates.

3018
02:02:17,229 --> 02:02:18,438
(Ballerinos expect both members to be demotion candidates.)

3019
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:19,939
What's going to happen to ballet, then?

3020
02:02:20,770 --> 02:02:21,938
It'll be fun.

3021
02:02:21,939 --> 02:02:23,209
(So cool)

3022
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:24,239
What...

3023
02:02:26,739 --> 02:02:27,750
It's on.

3024
02:02:29,149 --> 02:02:31,179
(1st Class demotion candidate 2: Kang Gyeong Ho)

3025
02:02:31,180 --> 02:02:32,578
Kang Gyeong Ho also...

3026
02:02:32,579 --> 02:02:34,789
became a demotion candidate of First Class.

3027
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,849
- Is this possible? - Is this possible?

3028
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:39,020
Because there are 2 people in 1st Class for ballet,

3029
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:40,889
we drew 1 from 2nd Class...

3030
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:43,359
and the other from Under Class.

3031
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:47,328
When the two classes made a choice,

3032
02:02:47,329 --> 02:02:48,430
there was no overlap.

3033
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:51,270
The 2 in Ballet 1st Class have become...

3034
02:02:51,439 --> 02:02:52,939
demotion candidates.

3035
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:56,909
I thought there would be only one candidate, of course.

3036
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:59,839
One will secure his position,

3037
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,948
and the other will enter a fiery pit.

3038
02:03:01,949 --> 02:03:03,250
That was my guess.

3039
02:03:03,649 --> 02:03:06,350
However, this program never disappoints me.

3040
02:03:07,989 --> 02:03:10,448
Choi Kyu Tae in Under Class, who nominated Kang Gyeong Ho...

3041
02:03:10,449 --> 02:03:12,589
as the demotion candidate, said,

3042
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:13,590
(Did I?)

3043
02:03:13,591 --> 02:03:15,528
"His technique and energy on the stage are perfect,"

3044
02:03:15,529 --> 02:03:17,528
"but his expression and acting were disappointing,"

3045
02:03:17,529 --> 02:03:20,100
"compared to Jung Sung Wook."

3046
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,630
(Anxious)

3047
02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:25,539
(I want to hide.)

3048
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:28,340
He's definitely angry.

3049
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:31,408
Anybody would've felt the same.

3050
02:03:31,409 --> 02:03:34,250
I felt so bad, of course.

3051
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:37,148
Among the promotion and demotion candidates...

3052
02:03:37,149 --> 02:03:39,279
selected by the ballerinos,

3053
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,219
who will be promoted...

3054
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:44,188
and who will be demoted?

3055
02:03:44,189 --> 02:03:46,619
It'll be revealed in the Class Movement Ceremony.

3056
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:49,389
(At the Class Movement Ceremony for ballet, )

3057
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:51,300
(what changes will take place in the Class Pyramid?)

3058
02:03:52,329 --> 02:03:57,999
(Ballerinos gathered together for the Class Movement Ceremony.)

3059
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,500
The Class Movement Ceremony for ballet begins now.

3060
02:04:00,869 --> 02:04:03,639
(The Ballet Class Movement Ceremony)

3061
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:05,839
Before the ceremony,

3062
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,948
dancers who will remain in Under again...

3063
02:04:08,949 --> 02:04:10,778
without being able to be promoted,

3064
02:04:10,779 --> 02:04:12,680
will be revealed.

3065
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,818
Please, if your name is called,

3066
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:17,119
move to the locker room for Under Class.

3067
02:04:17,289 --> 02:04:20,590
Dancers Kim Sang Young, Moon Jun On, and Lee Ha Nel...

3068
02:04:22,859 --> 02:04:24,759
remain in Under.

3069
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:29,130
Dancers An Si On, Kim Tae Yeon, and Jung Min Chan...

3070
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:32,339
also remain in Under.

3071
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:34,608
(Those six dancers remain in Under Class again.)

3072
02:04:34,609 --> 02:04:36,010
I should be promoted.

3073
02:04:36,439 --> 02:04:37,679
(Sighing)

3074
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:39,310
I had mixed feelings...

3075
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:43,609
and wondered what I should do more.

3076
02:04:43,979 --> 02:04:47,920
Now, the ceremony for the remaining ten ballerinos begins.

3077
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:51,089
First, we have two demotion candidates...

3078
02:04:51,090 --> 02:04:52,920
from Second to Under.

3079
02:04:53,159 --> 02:04:54,960
Dancers Shin Min Kwon...

3080
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:57,800
and Jeon Tae Hu. Two in total.

3081
02:04:57,899 --> 02:05:01,028
"I can remain in Second, right?"

3082
02:05:01,029 --> 02:05:02,399
That's what I thought.

3083
02:05:02,899 --> 02:05:05,469
I'll remain in Second Class.

3084
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:07,339
Tae Hu is...

3085
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,608
not mature enough when dancing,

3086
02:05:09,609 --> 02:05:10,770
so he'll be demoted.

3087
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:12,579
(At the time of the Dance Film evaluation)

3088
02:05:12,909 --> 02:05:14,609
They ran neck-and-neck.

3089
02:05:14,909 --> 02:05:16,749
But when we only focused on that video,

3090
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:18,749
Jeon Tae Hu's movement was...

3091
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:21,549
more appealing like the black swan.

3092
02:05:21,550 --> 02:05:23,549
In my opinion, Min Kwon was...

3093
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:24,589
far better.

3094
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:28,289
Then, this dancer should be demoted, and the other promoted.

3095
02:05:28,630 --> 02:05:31,658
(The two dancers enter the Class Confirmation Zone.)

3096
02:05:31,659 --> 02:05:33,929
(Jeon Tae Hu and Shin Min Kwon checked their new classes.)

3097
02:05:33,930 --> 02:05:36,068
(Shin Min Kwon shows a mysterious facial expression.)

3098
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:38,398
(Will they be able to secure Second Class?)

3099
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:41,210
(What will be the result of the two dancers' Class Movement?)

3100
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:43,139
(Opening)

3101
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:44,169
(What?)

3102
02:05:44,170 --> 02:05:45,609
(The Under Class Locker Room is surprised by someone's appearance.)

3103
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:51,349
(Jeon Tae Hu enters the Under Class Locker Room.)

3104
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:53,919
Jeon Tae Hu is demoted from Second...

3105
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:55,519
(Jeon Tae Hu is demoted from Second to Under.)

3106
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,590
to Under Class.

3107
02:05:57,789 --> 02:05:58,858
(Sighing)

3108
02:05:58,859 --> 02:06:00,019
I feel bitter.

3109
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:01,529
It's so cruel as expected.

3110
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:04,189
Tae Hu, are you okay?

3111
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:05,729
Of course, I'm mad.

3112
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:07,398
You said you felt fine before.

3113
02:06:07,399 --> 02:06:08,630
Then, Min Kwon is promoted?

3114
02:06:09,369 --> 02:06:13,199
(What's the fate of Min Kwon, the other demotion candidate?)

3115
02:06:15,569 --> 02:06:18,908
(Shin Min Kwon is also demoted to Under.)

3116
02:06:18,909 --> 02:06:19,909
Min Kwon, you finally came!

3117
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:21,148
(Welcome!)

3118
02:06:21,149 --> 02:06:22,209
(Hurry up, Min Kwon!)

3119
02:06:22,210 --> 02:06:23,549
I knew you were coming.

3120
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:24,720
Hey, my partner!

3121
02:06:25,319 --> 02:06:27,350
- "Hey, my partner." - It's okay. Come over here.

3122
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,149
My brother, come here. It's okay.

3123
02:06:29,319 --> 02:06:33,259
(As expected, Min Kwon failed to keep his position and was demoted.)

3124
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:34,629
The two smiled so brightly.

3125
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:36,358
They were like white swans.

3126
02:06:36,359 --> 02:06:38,600
Only their faces changed like this.

3127
02:06:39,199 --> 02:06:41,728
- They were not black swans. - That was...

3128
02:06:41,729 --> 02:06:43,828
- I agree. They're not black swans. - No.

3129
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:46,398
Now, the two candidates' ceremony in Second Class...

3130
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:47,970
has been finished.

3131
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:49,938
As a result,

3132
02:06:49,939 --> 02:06:52,409
two dancers will be promoted.

3133
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:56,380
The first promotion candidate is Kim Tae Seok.

3134
02:06:56,779 --> 02:06:59,978
Would they promote the first-nominated candidate here?

3135
02:06:59,979 --> 02:07:00,989
I don't believe it.

3136
02:07:01,550 --> 02:07:04,859
I thought being called first wasn't a good sign.

3137
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:07,389
(Kim Tae Seok checks his class first.)

3138
02:07:07,390 --> 02:07:08,390
(Disappointed)

3139
02:07:08,391 --> 02:07:10,289
Kim Tae Seok was...

3140
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,629
already leading when practicing.

3141
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:16,769
He also performed well like a veteran.

3142
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:18,770
I should hold him in check.

3143
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:21,770
No one would argue, even if he's promoted.

3144
02:07:22,909 --> 02:07:24,269
(Can he be promoted as everyone expects?)

3145
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:25,479
(Striding)

3146
02:07:25,779 --> 02:07:27,810
(Kim Tae Seok moves to his Class Locker Room.)

3147
02:07:28,109 --> 02:07:29,478
(He's strolling around the Under Class Locker Room.)

3148
02:07:29,479 --> 02:07:34,689
(He suddenly turns around and moves back.)

3149
02:07:35,289 --> 02:07:38,159
(He's at the promotion stairs.)

3150
02:07:38,789 --> 02:07:40,089
(Nervous)

3151
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:41,488
(Ta-da)

3152
02:07:41,489 --> 02:07:43,060
Isn't it shiny?

3153
02:07:43,529 --> 02:07:44,699
I feel so good.

3154
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,599
Tae Sook was First and even demoted to Under.

3155
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:51,839
He has great leadership.

3156
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:52,840
He's different from the others.

3157
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:54,408
- He was surely... - Yes, with his experience...

3158
02:07:54,409 --> 02:07:55,738
superior.

3159
02:07:55,739 --> 02:07:56,938
He also has great basic skills.

3160
02:07:56,939 --> 02:07:58,439
(Second Class Locker Room)

3161
02:07:59,079 --> 02:08:00,108
Nice to meet you.

3162
02:08:00,109 --> 02:08:02,648
Of course, I'm not satisfied here.

3163
02:08:02,649 --> 02:08:05,649
I'll head to First.

3164
02:08:05,979 --> 02:08:07,449
Only one candidate for promotion is left now?

3165
02:08:07,649 --> 02:08:08,789
That's right.

3166
02:08:09,090 --> 02:08:10,549
Next, the promotion...

3167
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:12,189
of Under Class candidates continues.

3168
02:08:12,359 --> 02:08:14,358
Choi Kyu Tae, please move.

3169
02:08:14,359 --> 02:08:15,760
(The 2nd candidate from Under to 2nd, Choi Kyu Tae)

3170
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:19,960
(Choi Kyu Tae enters somewhat nervously.)

3171
02:08:22,630 --> 02:08:26,199
I really want this.

3172
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:28,509
(He remains in Under Class.)

3173
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:31,239
Dancer Choi Kyu Tae remains in Under Class.

3174
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:32,938
Kyu Tae is quite powerful...

3175
02:08:32,939 --> 02:08:35,049
and energetic,

3176
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:37,448
but he lacks some basic skills.

3177
02:08:37,449 --> 02:08:39,449
- So he was a bit lacking. - His movement was weak.

3178
02:08:39,619 --> 02:08:43,788
We have the ceremony for Dancers Kang Yun Gu and Park Min Woo left.

3179
02:08:43,789 --> 02:08:45,389
Between us,

3180
02:08:45,390 --> 02:08:47,158
one will be promoted, and the other will remain here.

3181
02:08:47,159 --> 02:08:48,789
I want to dance in Second Class.

3182
02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:51,300
Please, move at the same time.

3183
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,060
- Please, move. - Should we go together?

3184
02:08:53,329 --> 02:08:55,328
(The two dancers move together to check their classes.)

3185
02:08:55,329 --> 02:08:56,529
It's too cruel.

3186
02:08:57,630 --> 02:09:01,139
(Only one of them will be promoted.)

3187
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:03,009
Okay.

3188
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:04,839
- Okay. - Okay.

3189
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:05,840
(They move back with mysterious looks.)

3190
02:09:05,841 --> 02:09:08,948
Group dances are all about unity.

3191
02:09:08,949 --> 02:09:11,979
I think Park Min Woo is the top in that regard.

3192
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:15,118
Impressing the audience with looks is very important in ballet.

3193
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,688
Regarding that, Kang Yun Gu shows...

3194
02:09:17,689 --> 02:09:20,890
great strength with his physique.

3195
02:09:21,529 --> 02:09:22,889
(Who will step up the promotion stairs?)

3196
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:24,529
Between the two dancers,

3197
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:27,529
who will go up the stairs?

3198
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:33,238
It's Kang Yun Gu.

3199
02:09:33,239 --> 02:09:35,209
(Kang Yun Gu is promoted to Second Class.)

3200
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:36,868
- I knew it! - I expected it too.

3201
02:09:36,869 --> 02:09:37,879
(Under Class also hears about the news.)

3202
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:39,609
Brother, welcome.

3203
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:41,879
As I was promoted to Second Class,

3204
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:44,749
I became very confident and thought I could be First too.

3205
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:46,219
Let's go for First.

3206
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:49,219
(The promoted dancer from Under to 2nd, Kang Yun Gu)

3207
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:50,318
(Park Min Woo enters a Class Locker Room.)

3208
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:52,159
Dancer Park Min Woo...

3209
02:09:52,359 --> 02:09:54,289
remains in Under Class.

3210
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:58,198
I knew you were coming.

3211
02:09:58,199 --> 02:09:59,898
(Park Min Woo, no class change)

3212
02:09:59,899 --> 02:10:03,269
Min Woo was not easily visible in the Dance Film.

3213
02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:06,469
I believe real experts shine on the stage.

3214
02:10:06,470 --> 02:10:09,368
So unlike Yun Gu, if his physique isn't his strength,

3215
02:10:09,369 --> 02:10:11,738
he should quickly find...

3216
02:10:11,739 --> 02:10:13,479
what his strength can be.

3217
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:15,579
I want to dance in Second.

3218
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:18,850
I was just a Second Class candidate.

3219
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:21,420
So I really want to be part of them now.

3220
02:10:22,189 --> 02:10:24,118
Now, the Class Movement Ceremony...

3221
02:10:24,119 --> 02:10:25,489
of First Class begins.

3222
02:10:25,989 --> 02:10:28,460
I think only one person will be demoted.

3223
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,989
What matters is who it will be.

3224
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:33,929
When we only consider the Dance Film,

3225
02:10:33,930 --> 02:10:36,299
Gyeong Ho suited it very well.

3226
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:37,398
I agree.

3227
02:10:37,399 --> 02:10:39,100
If I could demote someone, it would be Sung Wook.

3228
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:41,139
- I can't be sure of anything. - Me neither.

3229
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:43,509
I think Sung Wook will remain in First.

3230
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:45,009
I think so too.

3231
02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:46,779
But what if both are demoted?

3232
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:48,180
(Gasping)

3233
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:50,809
First, Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho,

3234
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:54,079
check your class and move to the Class Locker Room.

3235
02:10:55,649 --> 02:10:57,550
I felt the time had finally come.

3236
02:10:57,619 --> 02:10:59,459
I had a lot on my mind.

3237
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:01,590
"Can I stay in First Class?"

3238
02:11:02,189 --> 02:11:07,199
(Will Kang Gyeong Ho maintain his position in First Class?)

3239
02:11:07,399 --> 02:11:08,899
Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho is...

3240
02:11:09,069 --> 02:11:10,429
(Nervous)

3241
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:11,698
If he were demoted,

3242
02:11:11,699 --> 02:11:15,170
I felt there would be a chance for me.

3243
02:11:15,970 --> 02:11:19,238
The right performance at the right time determines...

3244
02:11:19,239 --> 02:11:20,739
who gets to remain.

3245
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:24,009
Right now, when I imagine if he would be...

3246
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:26,250
a good figure for that position,

3247
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:27,949
(Glancing)

3248
02:11:28,149 --> 02:11:29,850
Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho,

3249
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:31,919
from the First Class...

3250
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:34,889
(To be continued)

3251
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:36,630
Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho,

3252
02:11:37,590 --> 02:11:38,729
from the First Class,

3253
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:45,438
is demoted to Second Class.

3254
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:48,710
(He's demoted to Second Class.)

3255
02:11:50,409 --> 02:11:52,109
(Really?)

3256
02:11:53,609 --> 02:11:55,379
(Shocked)

3257
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:56,510
(Surprised)

3258
02:11:57,210 --> 02:11:59,948
- He's demoted. - Gyeong Ho might turn bad.

3259
02:11:59,949 --> 02:12:01,220
- He's never been in the class. - I know.

3260
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:04,189
The mood will become somber.

3261
02:12:04,789 --> 02:12:07,488
When we perform with an injury,

3262
02:12:07,489 --> 02:12:08,858
- you control yourself more... - Right.

3263
02:12:08,859 --> 02:12:10,228
So that it doesn't get worse.

3264
02:12:10,229 --> 02:12:12,459
I could see him dancing like that.

3265
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:15,929
I'm very sorry to him to say this,

3266
02:12:15,930 --> 02:12:17,429
- but the audience... - They don't know.

3267
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:20,038
- doesn't know if he's injured... - They don't know.

3268
02:12:20,039 --> 02:12:22,510
- or caught a cold. - Right.

3269
02:12:22,609 --> 02:12:25,380
(Kang Gyeong Ho is demoted from 1st Class to 2nd Class.)

3270
02:12:25,479 --> 02:12:27,239
(Second Class Locker Room)

3271
02:12:28,479 --> 02:12:30,578
- Hello. - I shouldn't clap.

3272
02:12:30,579 --> 02:12:32,619
You worked hard.

3273
02:12:34,119 --> 02:12:35,319
You worked hard.

3274
02:12:36,489 --> 02:12:38,060
Oh, my. You did your best.

3275
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:40,959
The remaining demotion candidate of First Class...

3276
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,430
is Jung Sung Wook.

3277
02:12:43,090 --> 02:12:45,658
If you ask if there's anyone...

3278
02:12:45,659 --> 02:12:49,300
who could replace me, I honestly don't think there is.

3279
02:12:49,529 --> 02:12:51,340
I think I'll keep my position.

3280
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:55,039
(Sung Wook opens the box to check his class.)

3281
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:58,239
(Will he keep his position in First Class?)

3282
02:13:01,279 --> 02:13:02,949
Jung Sung Wook...

3283
02:13:05,779 --> 02:13:07,020
is...

3284
02:13:07,649 --> 02:13:08,989
(Focused)

3285
02:13:09,949 --> 02:13:12,090
(I said I was certain, but...)

3286
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:18,029
(1st Class Jung Sung Wook)

3287
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:20,199
I'm still in First Class.

3288
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,399
Jung Sung Wook remains in First Class.

3289
02:13:22,699 --> 02:13:24,429
Jung Sung Wook remains in First Class.

3290
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,600
(Nodding)

3291
02:13:26,199 --> 02:13:27,269
(They acknowledge it.)

3292
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:29,809
- I acknowledge it. - Sung Wook.

3293
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:30,908
(First Class Locker Room)

3294
02:13:30,909 --> 02:13:32,938
(The ballet dancer enters.)

3295
02:13:32,939 --> 02:13:34,810
- Hello. - Hello.

3296
02:13:35,149 --> 02:13:36,408
(Awkward)

3297
02:13:36,409 --> 02:13:37,608
- Oh, my. - Hello.

3298
02:13:37,609 --> 02:13:39,949
I had no doubts.

3299
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:41,619
I'll show you...

3300
02:13:41,819 --> 02:13:44,050
what a First Class dancer is like.

3301
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:46,460
(He's happy.)

3302
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:49,228
It didn't feel like Gyeong Ho's story.

3303
02:13:49,229 --> 02:13:51,759
It felt like Gyeong Ho participated in Sung Wook's story.

3304
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:53,729
- I could see he had energy... - His experience.

3305
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:56,068
And experience clearly.

3306
02:13:56,069 --> 02:13:59,100
The title is "Devil Swan." But it felt like "Angel Swan."

3307
02:13:59,699 --> 02:14:03,369
As a result, there's only one dancer who will be promoted...

3308
02:14:04,039 --> 02:14:05,079
from 2nd Class to 1st Class.

3309
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:09,380
Kim Yu Chan's class movement will begin first.

3310
02:14:09,479 --> 02:14:12,050
He called Yu Chan first.

3311
02:14:12,149 --> 02:14:13,879
"The main characters..."

3312
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:16,250
"usually go last, don't they?"

3313
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:17,319
(Trying his best to think positively)

3314
02:14:17,619 --> 02:14:20,259
That's what I thought at the moment.

3315
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:23,189
So I still had hope.

3316
02:14:24,289 --> 02:14:25,629
(Kim Yu Chan enters the room to check his class.)

3317
02:14:25,630 --> 02:14:27,899
I've never been nervous until then.

3318
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:32,340
(He opens the box himself to check his class.)

3319
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:33,739
I think he'll be promoted.

3320
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:37,139
The guy with defined facial features.

3321
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:39,239
- Kyung Won. - Who do you think it will be?

3322
02:14:39,579 --> 02:14:41,409
The dancer you just said.

3323
02:14:41,649 --> 02:14:43,309
Who do you think will remain in Second Class?

3324
02:14:43,310 --> 02:14:45,078
(Thinking)

3325
02:14:45,079 --> 02:14:46,079
Yu Chan?

3326
02:14:48,189 --> 02:14:49,250
Kim Yu Chan...

3327
02:14:51,819 --> 02:14:53,688
If I don't become First Class,

3328
02:14:53,689 --> 02:14:56,159
I might be very disappointed this time.

3329
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:00,100
(Yu Chan stops in front of the Second Class Locker Room?)

3330
02:15:00,329 --> 02:15:01,399
(Good luck.)

3331
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:05,939
(Yu Chan turns back in front of the Second Class Locker Room.)

3332
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:07,368
From Second Class...

3333
02:15:07,369 --> 02:15:08,939
(Where is he going?)

3334
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:10,010
(Knocking)

3335
02:15:11,409 --> 02:15:13,340
(Ta-da)

3336
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:15,180
Hello.

3337
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:16,710
Hello.

3338
02:15:16,949 --> 02:15:17,949
(Welcome.)

3339
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:19,578
(Kim Yu Chan is promoted to First Class.)

3340
02:15:19,579 --> 02:15:20,619
(Congratulations.)

3341
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:23,019
Kim Yu Chan is promoted to First Class.

3342
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:25,060
(He can't hide his complicated feelings about Yu Chan's promotion.)

3343
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:27,589
Yu Chan definitely showed...

3344
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:30,459
the line that was made when the move was executed perfectly,

3345
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:32,429
- which touched my heart. - Yes.

3346
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:35,099
It overshadowed Kyung Won.

3347
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:36,170
As a choreographer,

3348
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:39,100
the dancer I liked working with...

3349
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:42,270
and expressed my moves better was Yu Chan.

3350
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:45,279
(Kim Kyung Won maintains in his position in 2nd Class.)

3351
02:15:45,409 --> 02:15:48,310
(Kim Kyung Won checks his class again.)

3352
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:50,810
Should I say it hurt my pride a lot?

3353
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:54,579
I was mad at myself as well.

3354
02:15:54,779 --> 02:15:57,449
I worked hard...

3355
02:15:57,550 --> 02:15:59,220
because I wanted to become First Class.

3356
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:03,029
So I'll start over to become First Class.

3357
02:16:03,529 --> 02:16:08,029
(Final Classes of Ballet Dancers)

3358
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:10,469
The first class evaluation is for Korean dance.

3359
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:11,640
(The first Dance Film class evaluation is for Korean Dance.)

3360
02:16:11,869 --> 02:16:14,000
The scale is different.

3361
02:16:16,369 --> 02:16:17,369
(Exclaiming)

3362
02:16:20,510 --> 02:16:21,510
(Excited)

3363
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:22,510
(Grooving)

3364
02:16:22,609 --> 02:16:24,350
Here it comes.

3365
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:27,019
(Show us the group dance!)

3366
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:28,079
Let's go!

3367
02:16:28,319 --> 02:16:29,649
The group dance is so cool.

3368
02:16:30,149 --> 02:16:32,290
- It's amazing. - It's so cool.

3369
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:36,689
(This is Korean dance!)

3370
02:16:36,690 --> 02:16:37,790
Come on!

3371
02:16:38,129 --> 02:16:39,129
This is Korean dance.

3372
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,360
I couldn't see the main lead dancer.

3373
02:16:42,129 --> 02:16:43,398
I'm the main lead dancer.

3374
02:16:43,399 --> 02:16:44,699
Sang Ha looked like the main character.

3375
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:46,000
I'll move up from Under Class.

3376
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,469
Let's begin the class evaluation.

3377
02:16:48,569 --> 02:16:51,339
We've conducted a vote to select candidates...

3378
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:54,180
for promotion and demotion from classes other than your own.

3379
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:56,209
Among these candidates,

3380
02:16:56,809 --> 02:16:59,779
the Master, the Coaches, and the Rehearsal Director...

3381
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:02,690
will decide on the dancers to be promoted or demoted.

3382
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:04,690
- Oh, my. - It's so...

3383
02:17:05,459 --> 02:17:07,489
It's so cool.

3384
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:10,628
I was very impressed by this group of dancers.

3385
02:17:10,629 --> 02:17:12,299
For me,

3386
02:17:12,459 --> 02:17:14,860
Korean traditional dance is very fresh.

3387
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:16,969
So it's exciting for me.

3388
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:20,100
Some of the dancers caught my eye.

3389
02:17:20,270 --> 02:17:22,839
Some of them owned the moves.

3390
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:25,578
I think Ho Jong is a dancer who certainly knows it...

3391
02:17:25,579 --> 02:17:27,610
and has skills that match his confidence.

3392
02:17:27,879 --> 02:17:30,750
He didn't overdo it to draw attention,

3393
02:17:31,350 --> 02:17:33,249
but he shined enough in his position,

3394
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:36,290
- Yes. - which caught my eye even more.

3395
02:17:36,389 --> 02:17:38,419
Si Won...

3396
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:40,388
- looks very charismatic. - Yes.

3397
02:17:40,389 --> 02:17:43,030
But Jun Woo looks more charismatic than him.

3398
02:17:43,229 --> 02:17:44,229
You're right.

3399
02:17:44,329 --> 02:17:46,999
He has beautiful lines.

3400
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,799
So he stands out when he does that.

3401
02:17:48,930 --> 02:17:51,129
Jun Woo was perfect on the set.

3402
02:17:51,799 --> 02:17:53,238
As for group dance,

3403
02:17:53,239 --> 02:17:55,909
there are moments when they should keep the balance.

3404
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:58,270
Some of them executed it well.

3405
02:17:58,639 --> 02:18:01,009
Sang Ha kept catching my eye.

3406
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:02,180
(Baek Sang Ha kept catching her eye.)

3407
02:18:02,579 --> 02:18:04,249
I can feel that Sang Ha was enjoying it...

3408
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:06,919
- in the video. - Yes.

3409
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:09,289
- He was feeling... - He was so happy.

3410
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,850
- every move. - Yes.

3411
02:18:11,049 --> 02:18:13,958
I'm sorry to say this, but the group dance was so powerful...

3412
02:18:13,959 --> 02:18:16,259
- that the king was... - A little overshadowed?

3413
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:17,289
(Oh, my)

3414
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:20,398
Overall, the two dancers on each side...

3415
02:18:20,399 --> 02:18:22,568
looked perfect...

3416
02:18:22,569 --> 02:18:24,329
in terms of energy and emotion.

3417
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:26,600
Ho Jong and Jong Cheol...

3418
02:18:26,739 --> 02:18:28,870
in this scene stole the show.

3419
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:31,840
They really stole the spotlight from Moo Gan.

3420
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:33,239
That's a little disappointing.

3421
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:35,648
Now, I will announce the names...

3422
02:18:35,649 --> 02:18:39,949
and the number of candidates for promotion and demotion...

3423
02:18:39,950 --> 02:18:43,250
chosen by dancers in other classes.

3424
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:46,790
Here are the promotion candidates in Under Class.

3425
02:18:46,889 --> 02:18:49,859
It's driving me crazy. I think I'll lose weight.

3426
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:51,389
Let's not get hurt.

3427
02:18:51,629 --> 02:18:52,958
I'm shaking.

3428
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:55,270
Promotion candidates in Under Class of Korean Dance.

3429
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:57,600
Two people were chosen by dancers in First Class...

3430
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:00,799
and 2 people were chosen by dancers in 2nd Class.

3431
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,170
There might be four candidates in total.

3432
02:19:03,069 --> 02:19:04,139
Do you think so?

3433
02:19:04,969 --> 02:19:06,940
As some of them were chosen twice,

3434
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:10,779
the number of promotion dancers in Under Class is...

3435
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:13,379
How many would it be? I think it's three.

3436
02:19:13,719 --> 02:19:14,780
It'll be three.

3437
02:19:15,350 --> 02:19:17,420
- I think I know. - The people we thought of?

3438
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:19,318
There are 15 of us.

3439
02:19:19,319 --> 02:19:22,389
I hope more candidates are chosen.

3440
02:19:22,489 --> 02:19:25,500
The number of promotion dancers in Under Class...

3441
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:27,360
is two in total.

3442
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:29,569
(The number of promotion candidates from Under to 2nd Class is 2.)

3443
02:19:30,069 --> 02:19:31,700
(The ensemble is shocked.)

3444
02:19:32,069 --> 02:19:34,540
(The dancers in Under Class is shocked by the small number.)

3445
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:35,670
No way.

3446
02:19:36,139 --> 02:19:38,170
It means everyone had the same opinion.

3447
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:39,840
(Sighing)

3448
02:19:39,979 --> 02:19:43,109
More people could've shined.

3449
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:46,319
I was shocked when I saw that it was only two.

3450
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:49,590
Since I was demoted from First to Under Class, I've been working hard.

3451
02:19:49,690 --> 02:19:52,159
So I wanted to become a candidate to be promoted at least.

3452
02:19:52,290 --> 02:19:54,759
As for the jump techniques,

3453
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,930
I think I did well.

3454
02:19:57,229 --> 02:19:58,499
(I have a headache.)

3455
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:01,260
I'm in Under Class, but I'm overweight.

3456
02:20:01,329 --> 02:20:02,469
So I might go up.

3457
02:20:02,569 --> 02:20:04,669
The promotion candidate in Under Class is...

3458
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:05,899
This is nerve-wracking.

3459
02:20:06,569 --> 02:20:07,840
I'm on edge.

3460
02:20:08,469 --> 02:20:09,770
(Who is the first promotion candidate in Under Class?)

3461
02:20:10,139 --> 02:20:11,940
It's Choi Jong In.

3462
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:13,708
It's Choi Jong In.

3463
02:20:13,709 --> 02:20:15,850
(He was chosen as a candidate.)

3464
02:20:15,879 --> 02:20:17,878
I felt proud just by being chosen as a candidate.

3465
02:20:17,879 --> 02:20:18,879
(Proud)

3466
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:22,149
(Under Class promotion candidate 1: Choi Jong In)

3467
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:25,520
The dancer who led the group dance well and showed his skills...

3468
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:27,359
was Jong In in my opinion.

3469
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:29,689
He worked hard in Under Class with a sense of responsibility,

3470
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:31,059
- which was touching. - Yes.

3471
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:35,270
(Ensemble leader)

3472
02:20:35,629 --> 02:20:38,068
Think that you'll put your foot here.

3473
02:20:38,069 --> 02:20:40,599
Kim Jong Cheol in First Class...

3474
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:42,909
who chose Kim Jong In as a promotion candidate wrote,

3475
02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:45,309
"Both his leadership and dance are good."

3476
02:20:45,409 --> 02:20:47,808
Park Jun Woo in Second Class wrote,

3477
02:20:47,809 --> 02:20:50,179
"The core of perfectly-synced group dance."

3478
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:51,250
(- I love you. - Me too.)

3479
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:52,920
He really worked hard.

3480
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:54,649
Yes. I acknowledge him.

3481
02:20:54,719 --> 02:20:57,120
There's only one spot left.

3482
02:20:57,219 --> 02:20:59,389
The second promotion candidate in Under Class is...

3483
02:20:59,590 --> 02:21:01,659
I think I know.

3484
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:03,290
You don't have to say it.

3485
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:06,059
He left a strong impression in the group dance scene.

3486
02:21:06,329 --> 02:21:08,569
The second promotion candidate in Under Class is...

3487
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,729
Baek Sang Ha.

3488
02:21:11,969 --> 02:21:14,270
I thought one of them would be me.

3489
02:21:14,600 --> 02:21:16,569
(Under Class promotion candidate 2: Baek Sang Ha)

3490
02:21:16,870 --> 02:21:19,440
Sang Ha caught my eye a lot today.

3491
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:21,540
I think he might be the biggest beneficiary...

3492
02:21:21,850 --> 02:21:23,280
of this Dance Film mission.

3493
02:21:23,409 --> 02:21:24,750
Was it the fire scene?

3494
02:21:24,909 --> 02:21:27,649
Everyone said Sang Ha did a great job.

3495
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:30,950
Sang Ha was so good on set.

3496
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:33,290
Sang Ha kept catching my eye.

3497
02:21:34,290 --> 02:21:36,290
I think this part is the highlight.

3498
02:21:36,389 --> 02:21:38,699
Kim Jong Cheol in First Class wrote,

3499
02:21:38,700 --> 02:21:41,629
"He's a dancer with overwhelming skills."

3500
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:45,169
The 13 dancers in Under Class who couldn't become candidates...

3501
02:21:45,170 --> 02:21:47,200
will no longer move to other classes.

3502
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:50,909
I tried not to have my hopes up, but I was very disappointed.

3503
02:21:51,069 --> 02:21:52,609
My heart was heavy,

3504
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:53,939
but I thought I'd have a bigger sense of responsibility...

3505
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:55,249
if I'm promoted to Second Class.

3506
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:57,548
I'll reveal the number of demotion candidates...

3507
02:21:57,549 --> 02:21:59,318
in 2nd Class 1st.

3508
02:21:59,319 --> 02:22:01,079
Right away?

3509
02:22:01,579 --> 02:22:03,488
The position of the dancers in Second and Under Classes...

3510
02:22:03,489 --> 02:22:05,048
might switch again.

3511
02:22:05,049 --> 02:22:06,920
The number of demotion candidates in Second Class is...

3512
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:09,829
- Three? - Two?

3513
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:11,529
It could be four.

3514
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:13,129
Does it mean there will be more dancers in Under Class?

3515
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:15,929
It's two in total.

3516
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:16,968
Two?

3517
02:22:16,969 --> 02:22:18,329
(Oh, my gosh)

3518
02:22:18,430 --> 02:22:20,139
It means everyone chose the same dancers.

3519
02:22:20,569 --> 02:22:22,139
I guess they all agreed.

3520
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:24,940
It's intense. This is how survival shows go.

3521
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:27,479
The 1st demotion candidate in 2nd Class is...

3522
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:31,450
(Who is the 1st candidate in 2nd Class to be demoted to Under Class?)

3523
02:22:31,709 --> 02:22:32,850
Who would it be?

3524
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:35,790
It's Dancer Kim Sang Gil.

3525
02:22:36,049 --> 02:22:38,520
(2nd Class demotion candidate 1: Kim Sang Gil)

3526
02:22:39,159 --> 02:22:40,819
I expected it.

3527
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:43,530
Choi Ho Jong in First Class...

3528
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:46,030
who chose Kim Sang Gil as a demotion candidate wrote,

3529
02:22:46,399 --> 02:22:48,500
"His moves don't go well with other dancer's."

3530
02:22:49,299 --> 02:22:51,099
(Glancing)

3531
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:52,600
"He should work on his basic techniques."

3532
02:22:53,899 --> 02:22:55,369
(Lowering his head)

3533
02:22:55,370 --> 02:22:57,068
(This is intense.)

3534
02:22:57,069 --> 02:22:58,139
It was harsh.

3535
02:22:58,979 --> 02:23:02,579
Basic techniques are the pride of a dancer.

3536
02:23:02,709 --> 02:23:03,809
It's like saying,

3537
02:23:04,079 --> 02:23:05,879
"You're Korean, but your Korean is bad."

3538
02:23:06,149 --> 02:23:08,379
To put it easily, it's like saying, "You're a bad dancer."

3539
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:11,249
Looking at Sang Gil's dance style,

3540
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:14,590
it doesn't look like he studied Korean dance.

3541
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:16,690
He has great moves,

3542
02:23:17,059 --> 02:23:19,329
but I wonder if it's Korean.

02:23:23,799 --> 02:23:25,000
We're a set.

3545
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:28,138
"I couldn't see him."

3546
02:23:28,139 --> 02:23:29,139
(Oh, my gosh)

3547
02:23:29,809 --> 02:23:30,869
Blinded.

3548
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:31,870
(Oh, no)

3549
02:23:32,639 --> 02:23:34,979
It felt like they were dragging me down there.

3550
02:23:35,139 --> 02:23:38,579
Being in Second Class makes you extremely anxious.

3551
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:40,850
There are five dancers left.

3552
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:43,718
The last demotion candidate in Second Class is...

3553
02:23:43,719 --> 02:23:45,290
(Who is the last demotion candidate among the 5 dancers?)

3554
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:47,290
It's Cho Tae Yoon.

3555
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:49,989
(2nd Class demotion candidate 2: Cho Tae Yoon)

3556
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:51,359
I expected it.

3557
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:52,360
(Trying to smile)

3558
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,360
So I tried to accept it.

3559
02:23:53,361 --> 02:23:55,399
Bang Seong Hyun in Under Class...

3560
02:23:55,569 --> 02:23:57,468
who chose Cho Tae Yoon as a demotion candidate wrote,

3561
02:23:57,469 --> 02:23:58,569
(Is it my turn?)

3562
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:00,539
(Glaring)

3563
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:02,870
"I've never seen him practicing passionately."

3564
02:24:03,370 --> 02:24:04,540
That's his comment.

3565
02:24:05,209 --> 02:24:07,040
"What is this?"

3566
02:24:07,209 --> 02:24:08,879
I was honest.

3567
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:10,879
This is intense.

3568
02:24:11,049 --> 02:24:12,280
This is intense.

3569
02:24:12,879 --> 02:24:15,249
As Tae Yoon was very slow in learning,

3570
02:24:15,250 --> 02:24:17,190
we had to stop practicing many times.

3571
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:19,558
(During the group practice for the Dance Film)

3572
02:24:19,559 --> 02:24:20,789
(Throwing)

3573
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:22,989
Let's do it again. You might make a mistake at this rate.

3574
02:24:23,329 --> 02:24:24,388
(Slow)

3575
02:24:24,389 --> 02:24:26,030
Slowly. Do it slowly 1 by 1.

3576
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:30,399
I thought he still lacked a little when it comes to dance.

3577
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:33,040
Now, I'll announce the demotion candidates...

3578
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:36,469
in First Class of Korean dance.

3579
02:24:36,809 --> 02:24:38,510
- I can't make any predictions. - Finally.

3580
02:24:39,239 --> 02:24:41,378
I don't know who will become demotion candidates in First Class.

3581
02:24:41,379 --> 02:24:42,379
I wonder.

3582
02:24:42,809 --> 02:24:44,780
I think I got a little nervous.

3583
02:24:45,049 --> 02:24:48,020
The sub lead role didn't appear a lot.

3584
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:50,189
(Choi Ho Jong wasn't chosen as the main lead dancer...)

3585
02:24:50,190 --> 02:24:51,549
(in the casting audition.)

3586
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:54,420
It's sad. My jabans are good too.

3587
02:24:55,559 --> 02:24:57,489
The sub lead dancers don't have many things to do.

3588
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:00,399
I could be in danger too.

3589
02:25:01,159 --> 02:25:03,128
The number of demotion candidates in First Class...

3590
02:25:03,129 --> 02:25:06,100
chosen by dancers in other classes is two in total.

3591
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:08,238
(Oh, my)

3592
02:25:08,239 --> 02:25:09,239
(Pouting)

3593
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:10,870
Only one of them survived?

3594
02:25:11,069 --> 02:25:13,940
The 1st demotion candidate in 1st Class is...

3595
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:15,379
Jong Cheol?

3596
02:25:15,479 --> 02:25:16,479
(Oh, my)

3597
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:18,750
(Jong Cheol?)

3598
02:25:18,950 --> 02:25:20,950
I came without any expectations.

3599
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:23,790
I was ready to accept the result.

3600
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,190
The Dance Film was so cool.

3601
02:25:26,389 --> 02:25:27,888
But why do I feel like I'll be demoted?

3602
02:25:27,889 --> 02:25:30,989
I can't force myself to be confident right now.

3603
02:25:31,129 --> 02:25:32,860
The demotion candidate in First Class...

3604
02:25:33,729 --> 02:25:35,500
is Ki Moo Gan.

3605
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:37,870
(He tries to stay calm.)

3606
02:25:38,629 --> 02:25:39,839
(Surprised)

3607
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:41,869
(Surprised)

3608
02:25:41,870 --> 02:25:43,870
(The dancers are surprised by the unexpected result.)

3609
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:46,309
They revealed him first.

3610
02:25:47,379 --> 02:25:49,648
I've had a bad feeling since morning.

3611
02:25:49,649 --> 02:25:50,908
(Upset)

3612
02:25:50,909 --> 02:25:53,549
I had a bad dream.

3613
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:56,019
The one who chose Ki Moo Gan as a demotion candidate is...

3614
02:25:56,020 --> 02:25:58,250
Please don't say my name.

3615
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:00,290
- This is not good. - Please.

3616
02:26:00,590 --> 02:26:01,620
I have bad feelings about it.

3617
02:26:02,629 --> 02:26:03,888
- Whose name will he say? - Kim Kyu Nyeon...

3618
02:26:03,889 --> 02:26:05,329
in Second Class.

3619
02:26:05,559 --> 02:26:07,128
- Hey. - Hey.

3620
02:26:07,129 --> 02:26:09,500
This is what Kim Kyu Nyeon in Second Class wrote...

3621
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:13,170
about Ki Moo Gan in First Class who was the main lead dancer.

3622
02:26:13,370 --> 02:26:15,170
"He suited the role."

3623
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:17,738
(Interesting)

3624
02:26:17,739 --> 02:26:19,440
"But I wish he danced better."

3625
02:26:20,110 --> 02:26:21,110
(Glancing)

3626
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:22,909
Holy moly.

3627
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:24,649
It's him.

3628
02:26:24,809 --> 02:26:25,979
He talked about his dance?

3629
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:28,079
This is bad.

3630
02:26:29,319 --> 02:26:30,818
(Kyu Nyeon isn't here.)

3631
02:26:30,819 --> 02:26:32,790
Choi Ji Won in Under Class wrote,

3632
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:34,659
Why did he say my name?

3633
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:36,089
"I wonder if he's the king..."

3634
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:37,629
"that suits the theme, the reign of peace."

3635
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:39,459
He read it exactly.

3636
02:26:40,260 --> 02:26:41,699
He was really good.

3637
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:44,398
But he looked like a tyrant rather than a king.

3638
02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:45,899
A tyrant?

3639
02:26:46,299 --> 02:26:47,839
Rather than a good king.

3640
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:49,208
"I liked his moves and how he expressed it,"

3641
02:26:49,209 --> 02:26:51,139
"but Ho Jong caught my eye more."

3642
02:26:51,610 --> 02:26:52,780
That's his comment.

3643
02:26:53,879 --> 02:26:56,110
- I can tell Moo Gan is mad. - The dancers in other classes...

3644
02:26:57,309 --> 02:26:59,180
I'll keep that in mind.

3645
02:27:00,219 --> 02:27:02,289
(I'm scared.)

3646
02:27:02,290 --> 02:27:03,290
(Shaking)

3647
02:27:03,291 --> 02:27:05,020
I think we made a mistake.

3648
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:07,589
I'm so scared.

3649
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:08,620
I can't breathe.

3650
02:27:08,889 --> 02:27:10,888
"Everyone was talking about Ki Moo Gan,"

3651
02:27:10,889 --> 02:27:12,559
"but he's not special." I'm afraid they might say that.

3652
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:14,059
I'm embarrassed.

3653
02:27:14,299 --> 02:27:16,399
Listening to their honest opinions,

3654
02:27:16,530 --> 02:27:18,270
I thought, "I'm sure I'm still better than you."

3655
02:27:18,829 --> 02:27:21,000
The 2nd demotion candidate in 1st Class is...

3656
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:25,169
I think Jong Cheol might be in danger.

3657
02:27:25,170 --> 02:27:26,179
(Agreeing)

3658
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,479
He's a perfect target.

3659
02:27:27,709 --> 02:27:28,979
Jong Cheol went out of the frame once.

3660
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:30,779
He should go home then.

3661
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:32,010
He'll go home.

3662
02:27:32,750 --> 02:27:34,349
I'm getting ready to be beaten up.

3663
02:27:34,350 --> 02:27:35,850
You are? I apologize in advance.

3664
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:39,058
"Jong Cheol isn't as good as the others."

3665
02:27:39,059 --> 02:27:40,520
This was the general opinion.

3666
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:44,090
So I tried not to have my hopes up.

3667
02:27:44,389 --> 02:27:47,959
I thought I could work harder and sweat more.

3668
02:27:48,129 --> 02:27:49,399
Among the three lead dancers,

3669
02:27:49,569 --> 02:27:51,670
I could only see Ho Jong in the rehearsal.

3670
02:27:51,870 --> 02:27:53,069
Now, I can only see Moo Gan.

3671
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:56,040
The 2nd demotion candidate in 1st Class...

3672
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:58,209
is Kim Jong Cheol.

3673
02:27:58,469 --> 02:28:00,609
(1st Class demotion candidate 2: Kim Jong Cheol)

3674
02:28:00,610 --> 02:28:02,379
Choi Ji Won in Under Class wrote,

3675
02:28:02,909 --> 02:28:04,408
"His facial expressions could've been better."

3676
02:28:04,409 --> 02:28:06,049
"He made small mistakes here and there."

3677
02:28:07,149 --> 02:28:08,149
Oh, my.

3678
02:28:08,150 --> 02:28:09,318
(His rhythm and movements didn't match.)

3679
02:28:09,319 --> 02:28:11,449
- It doesn't match. Oh, no. - Oh, my gosh.

3680
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:14,389
Jong Cheol did make a few mistakes.

3682
02:28:16,989 --> 02:28:18,090
It's Bang again?

02:28:18,530 --> 02:28:20,828
"There's nothing I remember."

3684
02:28:20,829 --> 02:28:22,369
(Hurting his feelings)

3685
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:23,429
Are you evil?

3686
02:28:23,430 --> 02:28:24,670
I'm just honest.

3687
02:28:25,030 --> 02:28:26,039
My gosh.

3688
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:27,539

Jang Sung Bum in Under Class wrote,

3690
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:31,309
It's Sung Bum again?

3691
02:28:31,909 --> 02:28:34,308
"Among the dancers in First Class, he showed the least,"

3692
02:28:34,309 --> 02:28:36,708
"and his facial expressions and aura seemed lacking."

3693
02:28:36,709 --> 02:28:38,078
In the scene with the three of them,

3694
02:28:38,079 --> 02:28:39,978
objectively speaking,

3695
02:28:39,979 --> 02:28:41,579
I could tell he wasn't as good as the others.

3696
02:28:44,889 --> 02:28:48,790
I've been in First Class so far,

3697
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:51,629
but I'm sure they're not that offended...

3698
02:28:52,190 --> 02:28:54,229
by me being in an upper class than them.

3699
02:28:54,899 --> 02:28:55,899
(Oh, my)

3700
02:28:56,270 --> 02:28:57,468
(As expected...)

3701
02:28:57,469 --> 02:28:59,039
(of Ho Jong)

3702
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:00,100
He provoked them.

3703
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:01,440
That was cool.

3704
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:03,638
Lastly,

3705
02:29:03,639 --> 02:29:04,968
the class evaluation for Korean dance.

3706
02:29:04,969 --> 02:29:06,280
The number of promotion candidates...

3707
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:09,850
in 2nd Class is 2 in total.

3708
02:29:10,379 --> 02:29:12,819
It's always two for us.

3709
02:29:12,979 --> 02:29:14,579
- I guess they chose the same ones. - I guess so.

3710
02:29:14,879 --> 02:29:17,389
The 1st promotion candidate in 2nd Class is...

3711
02:29:17,649 --> 02:29:19,020
It's hard to predict who would be promoted from Second Class.

3712
02:29:19,459 --> 02:29:20,559
Who would it be?

3713
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:21,719
(Pointing)

3714
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:23,790
When Jun Woo was standing...

3715
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:26,058
while covering his face with a fan,

3716
02:29:26,059 --> 02:29:28,430
he was dominating others with his body shape and stuff.

3717
02:29:28,530 --> 02:29:31,100
He had a different kind of aura.

3718
02:29:31,569 --> 02:29:33,200
He definitely has a great body.

3719
02:29:33,870 --> 02:29:36,940
Kyu Nyeon stood out to me.

3720
02:29:37,110 --> 02:29:40,279
As they put two powerful dancers together and weaker ones together,

3721
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:43,250
Kyu Nyeon kept catching my eye.

3722
02:29:43,709 --> 02:29:45,679
In terms of leadership, I think Si Won...

3723
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:48,249
could be the main.

3724
02:29:48,250 --> 02:29:51,319
You can see his aura in the image or the film.

3725
02:29:51,549 --> 02:29:52,919
Hyo Joon has no ups and downs.

3726
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:54,659
He danced as he always did.

3727
02:29:54,989 --> 02:29:56,759
I could see Hyo Joon's moves from time to time.

3728
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:58,690
And it grabbed my attention.

3729
02:29:59,430 --> 02:30:02,030
The 1st promotion candidate in 2nd Class is...

3730
02:30:02,299 --> 02:30:03,329
I'm nervous.

3731
02:30:04,729 --> 02:30:05,739
I'm really curious.

3732
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:08,039
(2nd Class promotion candidate 1: Kim Si Won)

3733
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:09,909
It's Dancer Kim Si Won.

3734
02:30:10,469 --> 02:30:11,638
Hey.

3735
02:30:11,639 --> 02:30:13,010
(Extremely thankful)

3736
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:16,209
I think I might be able to go back to my place.

3737
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:19,849
I'll reveal the last promotion candidate in Second Class.

3738
02:30:19,850 --> 02:30:21,250
There's only one candidate left.

3739
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:22,620
It'll be me.

3740
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:26,888
I thought I didn't lack when it comes to dance at least.

3741
02:30:26,889 --> 02:30:29,458
But when I watched the video, I couldn't see myself.

3742
02:30:29,459 --> 02:30:31,359
Based on the Dance Film,

3743
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:34,030
I thought I wouldn't make it.

3744
02:30:34,629 --> 02:30:36,700
The last promotion candidate in Second Class is...

3745
02:30:36,969 --> 02:30:39,500
- Who would it be? - I can't make any predictions.

3746
02:30:39,639 --> 02:30:40,700
I'm really curious.

3747
02:30:42,409 --> 02:30:43,769
(2nd Class promotion candidate 2: Kim Hyo Joon)

3748
02:30:43,770 --> 02:30:45,370
It's Kim Hyo Joon.

3749
02:30:45,569 --> 02:30:48,309
(Hyo Joon is proud.)

3750
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:50,149
(Oh, my)

3751
02:30:50,549 --> 02:30:52,209
It was Hyo Joon.

3752
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:53,919
I don't have a chance this time.

3753
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:57,020
But I still think I can dance just as well as him.

3754
02:30:57,389 --> 02:30:59,860
About Kim Hyo Joon in Second Class,

3755
02:31:00,159 --> 02:31:02,090
Kim Jong Cheol in First Class wrote,

3756
02:31:02,629 --> 02:31:03,658
"He's good at everything."

3757
02:31:03,659 --> 02:31:05,829
It was a short but impactful comment.

3758
02:31:06,459 --> 02:31:07,558
He wrote he was an all-rounder.

3759
02:31:07,559 --> 02:31:08,628
It was short but impactful.

3760
02:31:08,629 --> 02:31:10,529
"He's good at everything." Those simple words...

3761
02:31:10,530 --> 02:31:12,170
made me happier than other compliments.

3762
02:31:12,370 --> 02:31:15,099
(2nd Class promotion candidates: Kim Si Won and Kim Hyo Joon)

3763
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:17,039
Park Jun Woo and Kim Kyu Nyeon...

3764
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:19,378
who didn't become candidates...

3765
02:31:19,379 --> 02:31:21,809
will stay in Second Class without moving to other classes...

3766
02:31:22,079 --> 02:31:23,979
in the Class Movement Ceremony this time.

3767
02:31:24,280 --> 02:31:26,048
I've never become First Class.

3768
02:31:26,049 --> 02:31:27,180
I was always in second place.

3769
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:29,149
Always in Second Class.

3770
02:31:29,290 --> 02:31:32,459
All I thought was, "I should show them now."

3771
02:31:33,090 --> 02:31:35,218
The next mission given to the dancers...

3772
02:31:35,219 --> 02:31:36,930
in the increasingly fierce class battle.

3773
02:31:37,690 --> 02:31:39,399
Stage Choice by Public.

3774
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:41,359
(What's this?)

3775
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:42,360
(Surprised)

3776
02:31:42,569 --> 02:31:43,798
(The public will cast us!)

3777
02:31:43,799 --> 02:31:44,799
What?

3778
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:46,200
(This is crazy.)

3779
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:47,798
For the first time in Stage Fighter,

3780
02:31:47,799 --> 02:31:50,440
the casting audition will be assessed based on the public choice.

3781
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:53,579
The main lead dancer will be decided by the result of the mission.

3782
02:31:53,639 --> 02:31:55,279
(Concept keywords: Addiction, dash, salvation, nightmare)

3783
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:58,850
"Choose 1 of the 4 keywords to create choreography."

3784
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:02,279
Which one will be chosen by the most people...

3785
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:05,590
to be cast as the main lead dancer?

3786
02:32:06,989 --> 02:32:09,359
(Cast your vote on THE CHOOM right now.)

3787
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:10,860
Please vote for the dancer.

3788
02:32:11,159 --> 02:32:13,000
(The next mission in Stage Fighter...)

3789
02:32:13,299 --> 02:32:14,860
(is the Mega Stage Mission.)

3790
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:16,798
(A casting audition will be conducted...)

3791
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:18,530
(to choose the main lead dancer for the Mega Stage Mission.)

3792
02:32:18,899 --> 02:32:20,299
(I want to become the main lead dancer.)

3793
02:32:20,569 --> 02:32:21,600
(I should take the main lead role!)

3794
02:32:21,899 --> 02:32:25,770
(I want to become the main lead dancer...)

3795
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:29,979
(and prove myself for sure this time.)

3796
02:32:30,309 --> 02:32:31,349
("A Dance That Consoles Death")

3797
02:32:31,350 --> 02:32:32,850
(Main lead roles)

3798
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:34,920
(There are only three main lead roles!)

3799
02:32:35,889 --> 02:32:37,420
(I was a little scared.)

3800
02:32:37,719 --> 02:32:38,719
(It felt...)

3801
02:32:39,049 --> 02:32:40,920
(like I've joined the fight.)

3802
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:42,828
(The casting audition to choose the main lead dancers...)

3803
02:32:42,829 --> 02:32:44,129
(for the Mega Stage Mission begins.)

3804
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:50,629
(After a fierce main lead audition)

3805
02:32:52,069 --> 02:32:53,440
(Everyone cheers.)

3806
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:56,409
(It makes the dancers go crazy.)

3807
02:32:57,409 --> 02:32:59,780
(I'll announce the result of the casting audition.)

3808
02:33:00,340 --> 02:33:01,780
(Who will become the main lead dancers?)
