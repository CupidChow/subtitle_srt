1
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:18,183
(Stage Fighter)

2
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,278
(Lead role: The main character on the stage)

3
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:24,893
I'm the lead role in almost every work.

4
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,654
(Former National Dance Company of Korea Lead Role, Choi Ho Jong)

5
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,523
In the State of Ballet Georgia,

6
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:30,365
I frequently worked in the lead role.

7
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,195
He was a lead dancer in Georgia.

8
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:34,535
Isn't he cool?

9
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,035
I must be the leading role.

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,975
I love it when the spotlight is on me.

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,075
Anyone who's on stage wants the lead role.

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,744
The qualifications of a lead role...

13
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:49,214
The lead role's air.

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,654
Dazzling, popular, and acknowledged.

15
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:53,053
Someone worthy of the spotlight.

16
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,524
He must be able to carry the weight.

17
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:58,994
But everyone can't take on the same role.

18
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:02,324
In Stage Fighter, classes are important...

19
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:04,964
as they will decide the dancer's role.

20
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:08,065
First Class gets the lead role with a solo part.

21
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,505
Second Class gets the supporting role as a duo or trio.

22
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:15,375
Under Class will be in the ensemble dancing as a group.

23
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,544
Some people will be heartbroken.

24
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,014
I'm starting to get annoyed.

25
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:24,414
I wanted the leading role but ended up in the ensemble.

26
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,684
- Is it okay to between you two? - Of course.

27
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:30,285
Can I really be here?

28
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:32,395
It was very embarrassing.

29
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:35,994
I was desperate to break free from the ensemble.

30
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:37,565
I was jealous.

31
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:41,205
A lead role is an extremely cool position.

32
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,335
And others will be in total bliss.

33
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:48,875
Either way, we were brought up in such an environment.

34
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:52,044
It's an environment we are used to.

35
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,614
Dancers climb up from the bottom...

36
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,115
and block from the above.

37
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:58,884
Not everyone is fit to be the lead role.

38
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,484
If you're First Class, you would be...

39
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,524
the lead role or principal dancer in a dance company.

40
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:08,663
Only those chosen can be the lead role.

41
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:10,695
(Which dancer will become the lead role?)

42
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,484
(Stage Fighter)

43
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,815
(Stage Fighter)

44
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:33,285
(It's finally the day of the Class Battle.)

45
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,725
(Through the Class assigned in the Class Battle,)

46
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:39,524
(the role in Stage Fighter's first mission, Dance Film,)

47
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,065
(will be decided.)

48
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:42,793
(First Class is the leading role.)

49
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,065
(Second Class is the supporting role.)

50
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,465
(Under Class is in the ensemble.)

51
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:49,535
I got the lead role ever since I was young.

52
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,134
(It'll be the fight for the lead role.)

53
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:53,275
(I'd hate to lose my lead role. It's mine.)

54
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:55,174
(I don't want to be in the ensemble.)

55
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,445
(We're not here for the ensemble.)

56
00:02:58,174 --> 00:02:59,775
(It'll be a deadly battle.)

57
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,583
(The Class Battle has become more intense...)

58
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,255
(with the Dance Film role at stake.)

59
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:06,555
(Who will advance to First Class and get the lead role?)

60
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,884
(The day of ballet's Class Battle)

61
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,995
The Class Battle for Stage Fighter's ballet...

62
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:15,764
will soon begin.

63
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:18,034
Ballet dancers of Group One,

64
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:21,104
please stand by on the right side of the backstage.

65
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,534
I'm dying to see them.

66
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,004
I wonder what ballet...

67
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,035
- they will do. - It'll be interesting.

68
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:30,074
The Under Class ballerinos will go on stage first.

69
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:32,074
Ballerino Choi Kyu Tae.

70
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,514
Ballerino Kim Tae Yeon.

71
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:35,815
You're looking cool.

72
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:38,215
He already has this air as he walks in.

73
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:41,185
- That's needed. - Because he seems reliable.

74
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,824
Kyu Tae walked in with determination.

75
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,894
I love this atmosphere.

76
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:48,424
Second Class. Ballerino Kim Sang Young.

77
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:50,894
Ballerino Moon Jun On.

78
00:03:51,195 --> 00:03:52,935
Ballerino Kang Yun Gu.

79
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:54,834
Ballerino Jeon Tae Hu.

80
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,465
They must be nervous.

81
00:03:56,834 --> 00:04:00,204
Lastly, First Class. Ballerino Kim Yu Chan.

82
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:02,405
Ballerino Kang Gyeong Ho.

83
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:05,614
Yu Chan and Gyeong Ho were already rivals.

84
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:09,785
I first met Yu Chan at a dance competition in grade eight.

85
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:11,084
He crushed me.

86
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:13,555
I didn't win any awards.

87
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:15,625
From what I remember, he got the Grand Prize.

88
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:18,394
I'll go to Group D, then.

89
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:22,625
I don't start fights that I know I'm going to lose.

90
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:28,404
(They finally compete against each other in the Class Battle.)

91
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:31,474
Gyeong Ho jumps really well. Gosh, seriously.

92
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:34,744
Gyeong Ho's power and masculinity...

93
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:36,774
are his strongest points.

94
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,175
However,

95
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,713
unlike Gyeong Ho,

96
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,484
I have a beautiful figure,

97
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:46,115
which I'm very confident about.

98
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,284
I should use my figure.

99
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:49,985
What kind of expression do I make?

100
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:53,394
I think a push and pull of expressions,

101
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,425
starting with a cool expression and then smiling,

102
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:58,634
is more artistic.

103
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:01,365
- What do you want to do, Gyeong Ho? - I will start with a smile.

104
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:04,175
I feel it's a good idea to catch the eyes...

105
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,305
with a facial expression first.

106
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,203
I received feedback...

107
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,574
that I lacked expressiveness.

108
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,474
(During the Physical and Technique Audition)

109
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,784
(Your techniques were great.)

110
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:18,714
(But you could make better facial expressions.)

111
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,013
(You lack artistic expression.)

112
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:23,055
(I hope you can work on it a little more.)

113
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,454
I should show my expressiveness more.

114
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,224
(Kim Yu Chan will use his strong points to the max.)

115
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:31,634
(Kang Gyeong Ho will improve the faults pointed out.)

116
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:33,064
(Second and Under Classes are after First Class.)

117
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,134
(Glancing)

118
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,235
The front spots looked nice.

119
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:38,404
Let's take it from them.

120
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,904
I think it's more entertaining...

121
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,774
to take someone else's spot.

122
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:46,644
Now, we will begin the Class Battle of Ballet Group One.

123
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,815
I'm so looking forward to this. Goodness.

124
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,084
I'm nervous.

125
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,255
First position.

126
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,454
Light.

127
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:57,894
Music, start.

128
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,393
Five, four...

129
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,523
(Under Class Kim Tae Yeon, Second Class Kang Yun Gu)

130
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:03,624
(Second Class Moon Jun On, First Class Kang Gyeong Ho)

131
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,695
One.

132
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,464
(The look in his eyes changes.)

133
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:09,704
Nice, Gyeong Ho.

134
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:13,944
(Under Class Kim Tae Yeon, Second Class Kang Yun Gu)

135
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,175
(Second Class Moon Jun On, First Class Kang Gyeong Ho)

136
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,245
(The ballerinos dance in their style.)

137
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,974
(The thrill)

138
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,555
Gyeong Ho pops out.

139
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:29,824
Yun Gu is amazing.

140
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,795
(Cheering)

141
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:38,034
(Pleased)

142
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,774
(A clean finish with the last pose)

143
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,444
(First Class Kim Yu Chan, Second Class Jeon Tae Hu)

144
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:48,805
(Second Class Kim Sang Young, Under Class Choi Kyu Tae)

145
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:50,074
(Focused)

146
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,584
Okay.

147
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,755
Tae Hu's battu was nice.

148
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,255
Goodness.

149
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,724
Good. The arabesque was great.

150
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:11,834
My gosh.

151
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:13,935
(Let's go.)

152
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,165
Okay.

153
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:17,474
Nice.

154
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,474
They're so cool.

155
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,415
(Ballet Group 1's 1st Class Movement Evaluation has ended.)

156
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,513
- Goodness. - Okay.

157
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,644
Good.

158
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,284
(Great job.)

159
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,185
(Cheering loudly)

160
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:32,615
Bravo!

161
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,784
(Jawdropping)

162
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,154
- Ballet sure is cool. - Should I attend a ballet academy?

163
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,194
Our legs are too thick for it.

164
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:41,224
(Laughing)

165
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,195
(The master and coaches are discussing.)

166
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:45,695
I think Gyeong Ho should stay in First Class.

167
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:49,333
Yu Chan didn't catch my eye. What do you think?

168
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,334
Let's bump Kang Yun Gu up.

169
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:53,534
How about we change Kyu Tae with Sang Young?

170
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,105
(Kim Sang Young made a mistake.)

171
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,344
(Bummed out)

172
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:01,284
- Shall we wrap it up here for now? - Yes.

173
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:03,814
The promotion and demotion evaluation process...

174
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,555
of Ballet Group One will begin.

175
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:07,985
The dancer promoted in the Second Class is...

176
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,424
Kang Yun Gu.

177
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:11,695
(Kang Yun Gu is promoted to First Class.)

178
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,593
As Second Class Kang Yun Gu has been promoted,

179
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,625
the demoted First Class dancer is...

180
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,795
Kim Yu Chan.

181
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:22,034
(Kim Yu Chan is demoted to Second Class.)

182
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,534
I was bummed out. Very bummed out, at that.

183
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,974
Kim Yu Chan.

184
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:29,045
(Surprised)

185
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,974
- It's Yu Chan. - This is crazy.

186
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,243
- It can happen. - Of course.

187
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:34,714
- You never know. - You don't.

188
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,713
Yun Gu shined more on stage...

189
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:40,015
than in the practice room.

190
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:43,284
Dancers who try to stand out...

191
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:46,895
by expressing themselves really grab the attention.

192
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:48,895
Kim Yu Chan.

193
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,363
You know your strong points...

194
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,234
very well.

195
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,064
Contrary to that,

196
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:57,364
you failed to make up for your weak points.

197
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:01,074
Being smooth, beautiful, and pretty is great.

198
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:05,114
But from what I saw, you lacked a lot...

199
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:07,685
in power and speed.

200
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:10,243
Second Class Kang Yun Gu...

201
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:11,953
and First Class Kim Yu Chan.

202
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:13,953
Please move positions.

203
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,555
(1st Class Kim Yu Chan and 2nd Class Kang Yun Gu move classes.)

204
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:19,425
I wasn't happy about it.

205
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:23,265
Standing behind Kang Gyeong Ho hurt my pride.

206
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:25,594
I will go back to First Class.

207
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:28,635
The dancer demoted in the Second Class is...

208
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:30,333
Kim Sang Young.

209
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:31,935
(Upset)

210
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,344
The dancer promoted in the Under Class is...

211
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:37,775
Choi Kyu Tae.

212
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:39,774
You must've come on stage with determination.

213
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:43,213
Your energy, eyes, and mental attitude...

214
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,654
were depicted in the dance. Great job.

215
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:46,655
Thank you.

216
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,953
Please move to your class positions.

217
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:51,024
(2nd Class Kim Sang Young and Under Class Choi Kyu Tae...)

218
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,054
(move classes.)

219
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:53,824
(Ballet Group 1's 2nd Class Movement Evaluation)

220
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:55,895
One. Go.

221
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,535
(As expected from them)

222
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:01,264
(Kang Gyeong Ho and Choi Kyu Tae show their styles.)

223
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:02,804
Nice jump!

224
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:03,864
(Kang Gyeong Ho and Choi Kyu Tae show their styles.)

225
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,104
(Cheering and impressed)

226
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,545
Gyeong Ho is killing everyone.

227
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,275
Oh, my gosh.

228
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,714
(His heart is pounding.)

229
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:17,244
Kyu Tae started off with cool poses.

230
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,315
I was anxious.

231
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:21,425
It could be the last chance to get promoted.

232
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,555
We will watch you a second time.

233
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,054
(We will watch you a second time!)

234
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:27,525
(This is my chance!)

235
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,364
We'll keep our expectations high.

236
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,994
There's another chance left. Let's seize it.

237
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:36,734
We will proceed with the next Class Movement Evaluations.

238
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:39,334
This time, I should make up for my weaknesses.

239
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,074
One. Go.

240
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,415
(Cheering)

241
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:54,954
I'll show them for sure.

242
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,824
Yu Chan has pulled himself together this time.

243
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:01,994
(This is amazing.)

244
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:04,025
He's good.

245
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:05,834
Let's not falter.

246
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:17,305
Gosh, how clean.

247
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:23,415
- Bravo! - Well done!

248
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,254
They were absolutely cool.

249
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:27,015
They killed it.

250
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,484
Yu Chan beat everyone this round.

251
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,824
He kept dancing smoothly, then changed it as it didn't work.

252
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:37,195
Yu Chan is the definition of classical.

253
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,395
But Gyeong Ho is very charming.

254
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:42,405
- Let's decide who is First Class. - Yes.

255
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,473
I will reveal the dancers' final classes...

256
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:48,074
of Ballet Group One.

257
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:50,704
Firstly, the Under Class.

258
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,645
The Under Class dancers are...

259
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,714
Kim Tae Yeon,

260
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:57,285
Kim Sang Young,

261
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,655
Moon Jun On,

262
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:03,724
Kang Yun Gu, and sadly,

263
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,425
Choi Kyu Tae.

264
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:08,895
They're going back to the Under Class?

265
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:14,165
(During the third Class Movement Evaluations)

266
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:16,435
It's too unimpressive.

267
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,775
Kyu Tae doesn't have the fundamentals.

268
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:22,544
The first dancer...

269
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:24,344
to be in the Second Class is...

270
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:26,274
Jeon Tae Hu.

271
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:28,214
(Ballet, Group 1, 2nd Class, Jeon Tae Hu)

272
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:31,514
He didn't exactly appeal to me in Physical and Technique Audition.

273
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:34,154
But when he was actually on the stage,

274
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:35,953
he started showing his charms...

275
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,484
perhaps because he was more confident.

276
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,854
I'd like to give him a chance.

277
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:42,295
Good luck.

278
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,864
There are only two left.

279
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,765
Kang Gyeong Ho...

280
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,565
and Kim Yu Chan.

281
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:51,974
(Can we...)

282
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,945
(What is it?)

283
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,404
Can we...

284
00:12:57,405 --> 00:12:59,015
have the two perform again?

285
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:03,184
(The judges ask for a rematch between Gyeong Ho and Yu Chan.)

286
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,555
Gosh, it's 1 on 1?

287
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:06,055
Just those two?

288
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:08,885
I was expecting it.

289
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:10,224
It had finally come.

290
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,555
I was worried because it was Yu Chan.

291
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:13,824
I badly want to win.

292
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,994
- This is a head-on match. - Yes.

293
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:18,963
(For the one spot in the First Class,)

294
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,004
(they have the final match.)

295
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:23,464
First position.

296
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:25,435
Light.

297
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,474
Music, start.

298
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,843
- I was more than determined. - Five, four...

299
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,613
I'll give it my all in these 30 seconds.

300
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:36,114
One. Go.

301
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,515
- They have such different styles! - That's too...

302
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:43,224
That's it.

303
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:51,394
(That's what I'm talking about.)

304
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,665
(Grinning from ear to ear)

305
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,364
They're like swans.

306
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:03,603
Yes!

307
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:04,675
(Clapping)

308
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,234
- Bravo! - Bravo!

309
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:28,435
(Clapping automatically)

310
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:29,704
That was so cool.

311
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,604
Now, that's...

312
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,574
(Clasping hands together)

313
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,114
Who's going to the First Class?

314
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,915
Gyeong Ho is good.

315
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:43,445
Gyeong Ho's technique is still just as good as Yu Chan's.

316
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,584
Yu Chan's moves are so delicate.

317
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,185
Wasn't Yu Chan so beautiful just now?

318
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,624
(The judges' opinions differ. Who will they choose?)

319
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,924
I will announce the dancer...

320
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,065
who proved his skills and will be in the First Class.

321
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,565
I was thinking that I'd beat him again.

322
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,504
I want to beat him this time.

323
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:05,135
The dancer in Group 1 to go to the 1st Class is...

324
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,374
(Who will be in the First Class and play the lead in the Dance Film?)

325
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:12,815
Kang Gyeong Ho.

326
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:16,284
First Class Kang Gyeong Ho...

327
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:18,954
will play the lead role in the Ballet Dance Film.

328
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,254
Congratulations.

329
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:21,983
Kang Gyeong Ho.

330
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:26,324
(Yu Chan lost his spot in the First Class.)

331
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,264
Yu Chan will be in the Second Class.

332
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:30,564
(Group 1, 2nd Class, Kim Yu Chan)

333
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:32,435
(Well done.)

334
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,665
I liked Yu Chan more in this one.

335
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,333
But what's more important is that I could only see Gyeong Ho...

336
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,775
when they were all on the stage.

337
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:43,573
It's just as crucial to stand out at first.

338
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,275
- That's true. - And Gyeong Ho...

339
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:47,315
- did that perfectly. - Right.

340
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,784
(After the Class Battle of Ballet Group 1)

341
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:51,014
Second.

342
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,253
Under.

343
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:54,724
(The dancers got the armbands according to their classes.)

344
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,655
I'm in the Second Class.

345
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,854
I could have done better,

346
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:00,353
but the supporting actors...

347
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,265
often make it bigger in a drama.

348
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:04,765
It felt good. I had done it.

349
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,333
I went against Yu Chan,

350
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,204
so I certainly felt proud when I beat him.

351
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:12,204
I want to try harder to deserve this spot.

352
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:15,873
(The ballet dancers' first practice day after choosing the choreography)

353
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,713
(The ballet dancers chose Shin Min Kwon's choreography.)

354
00:16:18,714 --> 00:16:20,144
(Clapping)

355
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,145
(Welcome.)

356
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,483
I'm Shin Min Kwon, who's going to teach you today.

357
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,614
Shall we begin right away?

358
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:26,915
- Yes. - Yes.

359
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,353
Is this the formation we're going with?

360
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,884
You can tell the ones you don't like to go to the back.

361
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,493
No, they should come forward.

362
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:32,524
(Flustered)

363
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,195
I thought, "This is insane."

364
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:36,565
- That's brutal. - That's even harsher.

365
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:37,964
So, he wants to humiliate us.

366
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,395
I came up with the choreography, so I was confident.

367
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:41,764
Let's start.

368
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,334
Take one breath.

369
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:46,703
To the inside... I should face you to see your arms.

370
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:47,775
Take one breath.

371
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:51,244
To the inside. One, two, three, four.

372
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,544
- It's confusing. - Can you do the mirror mode?

373
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,385
- I will. - Mirror mode, please.

374
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,414
Forward.

375
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:58,953
(Master Shin's ballet class begins in earnest.)

376
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:00,113
Okay. Good.

377
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:02,853
Mr. Shin, after we do this,

378
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,053
do we take another step before the spin?

379
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:06,494
- Yes, take another step. - Okay.

380
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:07,994
(Is he spinning right away?)

381
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:10,324
- After the spin... - Didn't he spin right away?

382
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:11,335
Give me a second.

383
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,063
None of us were showing it,

384
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:15,904
but I'm sure all of us were puzzled.

385
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:17,635
We were like, "What's wrong with this guy?"

386
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:18,974
(Realizing)

387
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:20,905
I think we can go like this.

388
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,274
(Embarrassed)

389
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:23,774
How do we go left?

390
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:27,014
Left? I haven't thought of that.

391
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:28,714
But you're our teacher.

392
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:31,885
(Reading the room)

393
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,753
As we normally say, he was bewildered.

394
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,855
He hasn't taught anyone before,

395
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:38,195
so he seemed to be easily swayed by us.

396
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:41,095
After the jump,

397
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,164
- do we go right away? - Yes.

398
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,324
Right after the jump,

399
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:46,794
take a step... Just a moment.

400
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:50,835
It could have been way better.

401
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,803
He wasn't prepared for it.

402
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:55,875
I should say that he wasn't sure about his own moves.

403
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,114
(Min Kwon goes over his choreography again for a long time.)

404
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,473
(Was it this?)

405
00:18:00,474 --> 00:18:01,814
It was frustrating.

406
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,415
This is driving me insane.

407
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:07,314
- I can't keep up. - Even he's not sure about it.

408
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,924
- Just do it the way you want. - But some of us...

409
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:11,424
are taking our left feet...

410
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,753
- Doesn't that matter? - It's the left foot.

411
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:14,554
- Is it? - We're taking another step, right?

412
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,023
- Yes. - After the pose.

413
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:17,594
(The ballet dancers ask each other to get the details right.)

414
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,263
I thought we were running out of time as it was a competition.

415
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:22,664
But we were wasting our time away,

416
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:23,865
so I was very frustrated.

417
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,105
(Seething)

418
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,404
- Mr. Shin? - Yes.

419
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:32,013
After the turn, do we spin our arms inside?

420
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:34,273
Can you show me what to do with my arms and legs...

421
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:35,884
after the entrelace?

422
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:38,854
Can you give us the directions about the beat there?

423
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,484
Where do we look during that part?

424
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:43,984
I should have made up my mind before this.

425
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:46,993
Your choreography has already been chosen,

426
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,764
so keep pushing forward with it.

427
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,395
(Tension builds.)

428
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,665
If you're confused, it ends up confusing all of us.

429
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,664
I thought, "Yes, keep being stupid."

430
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,135
"That'll be great news for me."

431
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:02,074
I was having a mental breakdown.

432
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,303
Although I had created it, I had such a short time...

433
00:19:04,304 --> 00:19:07,543
that even I wasn't familiar with it yet.

434
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:09,585
But they were asking me about all the minute details,

435
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,714
and I had a brain overload.

436
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,784
(The 1st Class dancers from Group 2 practice first.)

437
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:15,385
(Slipping)

438
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,425
I thought, "I could beat him."

439
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:21,763
He didn't seem so confident.

440
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:24,263
I thought that I could make it to First Class.

441
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,434
This was my chance. I had to take it.

442
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,864
I was positive that I could move up.

443
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,834
I have to keep my place in the First Class.

444
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,834
I'm sure Min Kwon will be demoted to the Second Class.

445
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:36,575
I think I'll be in the 1st Class in Group 2.

446
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,114
(The 2nd Class dancers aiming at the 1st Class)

447
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:39,674
I think Min Kwon's choreography...

448
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:42,314
suits me better than him.

449
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:44,983
Whether it's Min Kwon or Tae Seok,

450
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,685
I think I can take their spot.

451
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,554
I was very worried. It was my choreography, after all.

452
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:53,493
Group Two? I believe there will be...

453
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:54,595
some huge changes.

454
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:57,365
Even the Under Class dancers could go up.

455
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,665
I'll crush 2nd Class and go to 1st Class.

456
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,733
(What's the result of Group 2's Class Battle?)

457
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,503
(Group 2)

458
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,204
The competition is fierce in this group.

459
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:08,544
Now, we will begin the Class Battle...

460
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:09,674
of Ballet Group Two.

461
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,075
I think I'll take First Class.

462
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:13,145
I believe I'll keep my position.

463
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,714
It was my choreography, so I was confident.

464
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,185
First position.

465
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:19,655
Light.

466
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,385
Music, start.

467
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:26,624
(Park Min Woo, An Si On, Jung Sung Wook, and Kim Tae Seok)

468
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,324
Four, three...

469
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:29,594
(Looking forward to it)

470
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,395
One. Go.

471
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,365
- How are they so good? - That's fabulous.

472
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:39,234
(Tae Seok moves his head violently after every movement.)

473
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,504
(Looking closely)

474
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,544
(The ballet dancers portray a swan in their own styles.)

475
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:44,774
I feel like they'll fly away.

476
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,645
That's fantastic.

477
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:50,914
He's too slow.

478
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:52,214
(Disappointed)

479
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:54,585
He's so good that I keep comparing him.

480
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,155
Sung Wook is way too good.

481
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,023
(A perfect turn)

482
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,294
(Impressed)

483
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,695
Great techniques by Sung Wook.

484
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:05,164
Tae Seok does seem a bit heavy.

485
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,435
(Feeling bad)

486
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:11,574
(Sung Wook and Tae Seok finished it in two very different styles.)

487
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:13,635
(Shin Min Kwon, Kim Kyung Won, Jung Min Chan, and Lee Ha Nel)

488
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:14,803
(Focused)

489
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,774
I can't wait to see how the choreographer does it.

490
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:18,415
Go.

491
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:22,014
His upper body movements are so neat.

492
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:23,185
(Exclaiming)

493
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,684
(He pulls it off neatly as he created the choreography.)

494
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,855
(Adding a little wave)

495
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:30,054
(His eyes grow bigger.)

496
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,754
I like that vibe.

497
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:35,394
(On the other hand, Kyung Won moves with power.)

498
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,564
It's very masculine.

499
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:39,794
They're like rivals, right?

500
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,135
(Slipping)

501
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,135
(He notices it.)

502
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,804
(But Kyung Won did the same part without a mistake.)

503
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:58,483
(Min Kwon and Kyung Won had very different styles.)

504
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,513
(Exclaiming)

505
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:01,554
(Applauding)

506
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,425
That was sick.

507
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,895
Sung Wook definitely caught my attention.

508
00:22:07,024 --> 00:22:08,155
Min Kwon...

509
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:09,325
(Nervous)

510
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,963
seemed emotionless.

511
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,665
Kyung Won was great, wasn't he?

512
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:14,063
Right? He's so good.

513
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:15,503
So many changes.

514
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:16,963
(He acknowledges it.)

515
00:22:16,964 --> 00:22:20,335
I will announce the dancer to be promoted from the Second Class.

516
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:24,044
The dancer to be promoted in the Second Class...

517
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:26,974
is Jung Sung Wook.

518
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,314
(Sung Wook is promoted to the First Class.)

519
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:32,615
I did see it coming, to some extent.

520
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:34,553
You stood out so much.

521
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:38,084
Your position and choreography were both accurate,

522
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:42,165
but your arm movements and expressions were unique too.

523
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:45,793
I saw how you kept the same distance from the dancers next to you...

524
00:22:45,794 --> 00:22:48,865
when the dance switched to the left side.

525
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:51,234
Sung Wook is too good.

526
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,675
That's a great compliment.

527
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,404
As Sung Wook is promoted from the Second Class,

528
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,575
I will announce who will be demoted from the First Class.

529
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,945
To be honest, I hope it's not me.

530
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:02,983
Although I was confident as it was my choreography,

531
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:04,644
I was still a bit worried.

532
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:06,854
I don't think Min Kwon will be demoted.

533
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:09,054
- I think he will be. - No way.

534
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,794
The dancer to be demoted from the First Class...

535
00:23:12,554 --> 00:23:15,464
is Shin Min Kwon, unfortunately.

536
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,165
Oh, no. He's the choreographer.

537
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,395
Min Kwon,

538
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:24,335
you made this choreography yourself.

539
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,774
It doesn't seem like you have any idea...

540
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:30,204
what you're doing as you dance.

541
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,244
(Dropping his head)

542
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:36,115
(Min Kwon danced without any expressions.)

543
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:38,983
(And he even made a mistake.)

544
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,253
The First Class is for dancers...

545
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:44,584
who play the lead role in a dance company.

546
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:48,425
I don't think you set an example to deserve that spot.

547
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:50,425
He's so harsh with his words.

548
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:52,095
It was such a shock...

549
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,395
that it felt like a smack on the head.

550
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:57,834
The choreographers certainly have more on their shoulders.

551
00:23:57,835 --> 00:23:58,835
(Agreeing)

552
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,904
You can't really focus on practicing.

553
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:01,905
(Agreeing)

554
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:04,003
Second Class Jung Sung Wook...

555
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:05,944
and First Class Shin Min Kwon.

556
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,784
Please move positions.

557
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:10,283
(1st Class Shin Min Kwon and 2nd Class Jung Sung Wook...)

558
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,284
(move classes.)

559
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,514
I didn't exactly feel bad.

560
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,855
I was finally at a place that I deserved.

561
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,984
I was relieved.

562
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,754
In Ballet Group Two,
[Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin]

563
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,224
I will announce the dancer to be promoted from the Second Class.

564
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,694
("Promoted?")

565
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:27,763
(Another promotion?)

566
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:29,704
The dancer to be promoted from the Second Class...

567
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,435
is Kim Kyung Won.

568
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,145
The dancer to be demoted from the First Class is...

569
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:39,645
Kim Tae Seok.

570
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,044
- No way. - They were both replaced?

571
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:43,984
Please move positions.

572
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:47,813
(1st Class Kim Tae Seok and 2nd Class Kim Kyung Won...)

573
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:49,684
(move classes.)

574
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:53,053
In Tae Seok's case, I could tell that you had your way...

575
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:55,864
of expressing it with your unique character and drama, but...

576
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:58,365
Everything was expressed only in emotions.

577
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,764
That could have been better.

578
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:01,733
I wasn't discouraged...

579
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,865
because I was sure that there would be another chance.

580
00:25:05,274 --> 00:25:06,734
This place is terrifying.

581
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:08,104
Ballet Group Two,

582
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:10,875
there will be another Class Movement Evaluation.

583
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:14,014
I meant to show them everything without any mistakes.

584
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:15,314
Let's get back up there.

585
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,684
What you do after you're replaced...

586
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,553
- is what matters. - Right.

587
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:21,384
- It's the most important. - The attitude...

588
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:22,754
counts.

589
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,224
Music.

590
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:26,754
Start.

591
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,764
(Which ballerino will prove himself through this performance?)

592
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:31,325
Go.

593
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:35,405
Kyung Won is so good.

594
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:37,034
He's sexy.

595
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:39,404
Sung Wook is trying to keep his place.

596
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,734
(He's trying to stay in the First Class.)

597
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,175
Sung Wook is amazing.

598
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:45,845
I was determined to be in the First Class.

599
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,244
Nice.

600
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,054
Very good.

601
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:58,554
I haven't shown them my entire confidence about my moves.

602
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:02,195
That's fantastic.

603
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:03,994
I kept telling myself, "I can do it."

604
00:26:06,895 --> 00:26:07,934
That's right!

605
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,105
(Cheering)

606
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:11,875
I couldn't let my guard down.

607
00:26:13,534 --> 00:26:15,144
(Admiring)

608
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:16,303
(Gasping)

609
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,304
Beautiful.

610
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,445
Ballet is cool.

611
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:24,743
(Shin Min Kwon, Kim Tae Seok)

612
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:29,724
(Kim Kyung Won, Jung Sung Wook)

613
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:31,424
(Ballet Group 2's 2nd performance ends.)

614
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:34,994
It gets more dynamic over time.

615
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:36,664
He's really good.

616
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:37,894
The new guy in the First Class.

617
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,335
Sung Wook killed it.

618
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,195
Isn't it obviously Sung Wook?

619
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:43,064
He's definitely in the First Class.

620
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:44,905
Sung Wook? Right? He's so good.

621
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,604
We have to pick the ones for the Second Class,

622
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,203
- so it should be these four. - Yes.

623
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:50,905
We'd like to take another look at some of them.

624
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:52,844
(Flinching)

625
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,185
Kim Tae Seok, Shin Min Kwon,

626
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:58,243
Kim Kyung Won, and Jung Min Chan.

627
00:26:58,244 --> 00:26:59,415
May we take another look?

628
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:01,615
- It's been decided. - They chose the First Class.

629
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,655
It's probably Sung Wook.

630
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:06,855
I was thinking, "I must be in the First Class."

631
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,824
The competition is fierce for the Second Class.

632
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:10,524
All the dancers in the Second Class are so good.

633
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,034
I can't wait to watch this.

634
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:16,404
I realized that I'd be in the Under Class if I didn't do well.

635
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:18,834
"If I do poorly here, I'm going to end up in the Under Class."

636
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:20,803
"Let's show them what I've got."

637
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:23,704
I meant to show them whatever I had left.

638
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,744
First position.

639
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:27,814
Light.

640
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,214
Music.

641
00:27:31,544 --> 00:27:32,585
Start.

642
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:34,713
Their emotions are...

643
00:27:34,714 --> 00:27:36,125
Even their facial expressions changed.

644
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:37,524
Go.

645
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:41,825
Kyung Won looks amazing.

646
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:46,135
They look great.

647
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:47,895
Min Kwon is good.

648
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,764
Good energy right now.

649
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:56,704
(Pleased)

650
00:27:57,774 --> 00:27:59,075
How is Kyung Won so sexy?

651
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,144
(Oh, my swans.)

652
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:03,445
I'd like to be in the Second Class at least.

653
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:04,543
I was worried.

654
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:05,914
Going to the Under Class meant...

655
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:07,784
all of my efforts going down the drain.

656
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:10,254
I feel so bad for them.

657
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:12,425
(Getting emotional with them)

658
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:15,294
I'm not worried because I'm confident.

659
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,865
(Getting immersed)

660
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:30,374
(Shin Min Kwon, Kim Tae Seok, Kim Kyung Won)

661
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,544
Okay.

662
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:32,713
Nice!

663
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:34,313
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

664
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:36,244
- Amazing. - I know.

665
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:37,284
I honestly can't tell.

666
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:38,614
(Fallen in the Swan Lake)

667
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:40,115
Their strengths and weaknesses are so clear.

668
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:42,524
This is tough.

669
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:46,794
I will announce the final classes of Ballet Group Two.

670
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:49,064
First,

671
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:53,934
the Under Class.

672
00:28:53,935 --> 00:28:55,263
(Announcing the Under Class)

673
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:56,264
(Group 2, Under Class)

674
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:58,774
The dancers in the Under Class are...

675
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,474
Lee Ha Nel,

676
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,044
An Si On,

677
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:04,244
Park Min Woo,

678
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:07,774
and Jung Min Chan.

679
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:09,584
(Sighing out of sadness)

680
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:11,584
(One more spot left in the Under Class)

681
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,685
Kim Tae Seok,

682
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:14,185
Kim Kyung Won,

683
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:15,855
Shin Min Kwon,

684
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,484
and Jung Sung Wook.

685
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,825
One of these four dancers will be...

686
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,425
in the Under Class.

687
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:24,195
I know because I've been demoted before,

688
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:26,763
and it breaks your heart when you're demoted among four.

689
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,665
I don't think Min Kwon will be demoted.

690
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,963
He did it pretty neatly.

691
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:34,434
But Tae Seok has a lead role's appearance.

692
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:35,704
He's got the face.

693
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,644
How is Kyung Won so sexy?

694
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,313
He looks like he's not Korean.

695
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:42,514
Sung Wook showed an insane sense of balance.

696
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:43,944
It's a narrow margin.

697
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:45,115
(The 4 skilled dancers showed their unique styles.)

698
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:48,415
One of the four dancers going to the Under Class is...

699
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,723
Kim Tae Seok.

700
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:52,453
(Kim Tae Seok is in the Under Class of Group 2.)

701
00:29:52,454 --> 00:29:53,925
Tae Seok...

702
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:58,665
has been demoted from the First Class to the Under Class.

703
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:02,064
He made it sure there.

704
00:30:02,464 --> 00:30:05,835
You were demoted from the First Class to the Second Class,

705
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,134
and it probably made you feel anxious.

706
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:09,945
We could see that.

707
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:12,945
It's nice to turn it into your style,

708
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:14,474
but it wasn't classical enough.

709
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:17,514
I felt some of that.

710
00:30:17,744 --> 00:30:20,415
I realized it after listening to his review.

711
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:22,453
That I ruined my own performance.

712
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,824
I kept reminding myself...

713
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,855
of what I've been missing.

714
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,394
(Nodding)

715
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,964
The dancer in the First Class...

716
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:33,595
is Jung Sung Wook.

717
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:35,964
Jung Sung Wook in the First Class...

718
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:38,935
will play the lead role in the Ballet Dance Film.

719
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:43,345
I will announce the dancers in the Second Class.

720
00:30:43,804 --> 00:30:45,474
It's Kim Kyung Won.

721
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:50,043
My goal was the First Class, so I couldn't be satisfied yet.

722
00:30:50,044 --> 00:30:51,914
But I believe this will allow me...

723
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:54,184
to keep my eyes on the goal.

724
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,855
Shin Min Kwon will be in the Second Class.

725
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,523
If only I hadn't made a mistake,

726
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,394
I might have defeated Sung Wook.

727
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:02,395
It was a bummer.

728
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,993
I started out as the choreographer...

729
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,563
and ended up in the Second Class.

730
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:09,504
But I'm going to finish in the First Class.

731
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:14,474
I wasn't too happy about being demoted to the Under Class.

732
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,375
I'll probably make a resolution as I look at that armband.

733
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:21,415
I got the First Class today.

734
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:23,145
I was exhilarated,

735
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:27,085
but I'll probably do my best to play the part...

736
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:28,655
responsibly.

737
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,054
(Final Ballet Classes)

738
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:34,994
Now, we will begin Stage Fighter's Class Battle...

739
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,324
in the contemporary dance category,

740
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:38,994
Choreographed Combination Audition.

741
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,605
The dancers in the Under Class will enter first.

742
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:45,405
Under Class, Oh Hyeok Heon.

743
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:48,375
Second Class, Lee Jin Woo,

744
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,345
Park Jin Ho,

745
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,214
Kim Tae Gang,

746
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,244
and Lee Jeong Hoon.

747
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:58,244
Lastly, the First Class of Group Two will enter.

748
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:01,714
First Class Kim Hye Hyun.

749
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:05,054
First Class Kim Young Woong.

750
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:06,395
What a good lineup of First Class.

751
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:08,754
Kim Young Woong and Kim Hye Hyun.

752
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:11,925
That is all for Group Two of Contemporary Dance.

753
00:32:12,635 --> 00:32:14,533
The choreographer of this mission...

754
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:16,734
is in this group.

755
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,074
It's Kim Hye Hyun.

756
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:20,335
How do you feel? Are you happy?

757
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:23,504
I'm feeling very nervous because I need to do well.

758
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:24,704
He must feel pressured.

759
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:27,844
Was there any dancer who pulled off...

760
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,044
the dance better than you?

761
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:31,784
(Hesitating)

762
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:35,053
(Who made the choreographer feel nervous?)

763
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,425
I didn't look at the other dancers much.

764
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:40,524
(Stone-faced)

765
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:45,223
Kim Hye Hyun's choreography was selected,

766
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:46,963
so he must understand the flow and the texture of the dance...

767
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,733
better than anyone else.

768
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,435
So I felt a bit pressured.

769
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:52,834
(When the groups were revealed)

770
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:53,874
(Contemporary Dance Group 2 has Kim Hye Hyun, the choreographer.)

771
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,074
- My gosh. - Goodness.

772
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:56,303
(Jawdropping)

773
00:32:56,304 --> 00:32:57,405
(Glancing at him)

774
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:59,214
This won't be an easy fight.

775
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,713
One slip, and he might take First Class from you.

776
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:01,714
(A bitter laugh)

777
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:03,915
Beating Hye Hyun with his choreography?

778
00:33:04,244 --> 00:33:05,953
Is that possible?

779
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:07,954
Something I was concerned about came true.

780
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,784
The choreographer pulls off his own choreography best.

781
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,895
But I'm going to take First Class no matter what.

782
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,964
"Let's make those movements mine."

783
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:17,325
(The morning of Class Battle)

784
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,294
(The contemporary dancers are practicing hard.)

785
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:21,233
(He keeps looking at someone during the practice.)

786
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:23,435
This is competition.

787
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:26,135
So I observed the details of his movements carefully.

788
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:28,175
To take them.

789
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:29,344
(Give them to me.)

790
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:31,044
- Hye Hyun, can you show me this? - Okay.

791
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,675
Spin, and here.

792
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,344
I needed to make Hye Hyun's dance mine.

793
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:38,415
I asked him a lot of questions to dance exactly like him.

794
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,954
- "I'll steal your place." - Do I go down?

795
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:44,483
He taught me in detail even though I was his competitor.

796
00:33:44,484 --> 00:33:45,554
I thought he was very kind.

797
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,054
It's a survival show. I wouldn't have taught others.

798
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:49,993
If I didn't teach them the details,

799
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:52,994
I thought that would be below the belt.

800
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:56,835
It was my choreography anyway, so I wasn't worried.

801
00:33:57,534 --> 00:34:00,635
But I didn't want to compete against Kim Young Woong.

802
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,674
(Kim Young Woong and Kim Hye Hyun met in the same group.)

803
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,145
(He realizes it won't be easy.)

804
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:06,415
This group has such competent First Classes.

805
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:07,944
Will it be Seoul International or Korea International?

806
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,414
They're both solid.

807
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:12,184
I think he'll be good, so I'm a bit worried.

808
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,115
Young Woong...

809
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:16,955
has the untouchable vibe.

810
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:20,955
Young Woong might look good on the stage.

811
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:22,694
- I'm looking forward to him. - Me too.

812
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:24,163
It feels like a master that was hiding on a mountain...

813
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,635
came down to the society.

814
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:26,734
He is an ascetic.

815
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,004
(An ascetic)

816
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:31,434
I don't like the feeling of breaking out of the immersion.

817
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:33,404
I tend to stay alone to get immersed...

818
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,205
into the task I need to complete.

819
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:37,274
There's no camera to film you if you dance here.

820
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:38,773
It's fine even if I don't get filmed.

821
00:34:38,774 --> 00:34:39,774
(He gives up on being filmed to get immersed.)

822
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:42,584
As I kept practicing, I thought...

823
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:44,785
I could make the choreography into mine.

824
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:46,785
I could join the First Class.

825
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,725
I made the choreography, so I'm confident.

826
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:52,394
I'll keep being in the First Class.

827
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:56,163
Until we find the right class for the dancers,

828
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:58,195
Class Movement Evaluations will continue...

829
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,564
for Class Battle.

830
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:01,933
Who is the one dancer that will prove himself...

831
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:03,905
and become the First Class?

832
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,464
Contemporary Dance Group Two's...

833
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:07,705
Class Battle starts now.

834
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:09,544
(Contemporary Dance Class Battle)

835
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:11,044
You can do it.

836
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:13,414
Everyone, do your best.

837
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:14,814
First position.

838
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:16,285
Light.

839
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:19,354
Music, start.

840
00:35:20,115 --> 00:35:21,584
Three, two,

841
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:24,124
one. Go.

842
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:26,325
(Kim Young Woong, Kim Hye Hyun)

843
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:34,294
Oh, nice.

844
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:36,305
Young Woong is doing great.

845
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,445
(Oh Hyeok Heon, Park Jin Ho, Lee Jeong Hoon, Kim Young Woong)

846
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,974
Young Woong, nice.

847
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:49,984
His movements are neat. Isn't Young Woong really good?

848
00:35:56,055 --> 00:35:57,784
(Getting chills)

849
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:58,825
Nice.

850
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:14,175
Bravo.

851
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:23,745
(First, Kim Hye Hyun, Second, Kim Tae Gang, Second, Lee Jin Woo)

852
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:35,594
Tae Gang doesn't look young at all on the stage.

853
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:36,695
His expression looks relaxed.

854
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,535
Look at Hye Hyun. He's so stable.

855
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:41,834
Everything about his movements is neat.

856
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:44,535
Nice.

857
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:54,345
(These three dancers stand out.)

858
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,244
Tae Gang, Hye Hyun, and Young Woong.

859
00:36:57,245 --> 00:36:58,544
Those three are so good.

860
00:37:01,754 --> 00:37:05,055
(Contemporary Dance Group 2's first evaluation has ended.)

861
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:07,124
These three were so good.

862
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:10,164
Tae Gang stands out a lot more than I thought.

863
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:11,893
Tae Gang is the youngest,

864
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:14,234
but he looks the most relaxed.

865
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:16,233
He's been relaxed since this morning.

866
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,064
He has no nerves, no anxiety.

867
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:21,205
- This... - Then just move up Tae Gang.

868
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,603
That's fine, right? These two were quite similar.

869
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:24,674
They were quite similar.

870
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,945
I actually preferred Young Woong.

871
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:30,644
Contemporary Dance Group Two's Class Movement will start.

872
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:33,683
I will announce the dancer to be promoted...

873
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,484
from the Second Class.

874
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,984
It's Kim Tae Gang.

875
00:37:39,354 --> 00:37:41,825
(Kim Tae Gang is promoted to the First Class.)

876
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:43,825
I pinched my butt because I thought it was a dream.

877
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,635
Tae Gang is promoted to the First Class?

878
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,864
It was Hye Hyun's choreography,

879
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:50,704
but when we saw Tae Gang dance,

880
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:53,575
it was as if it was his choreography.

881
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:57,273
He had that energy and expression.

882
00:37:57,274 --> 00:38:00,674
So we wanted to see him again in the First Class.

883
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:03,414
It was unexpected. It gave me some confidence.

884
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,314
With the promotion of Kim Tae Gang who was in the Second Class,

885
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,524
the dancer who will be demoted from the First Class...

886
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:11,983
is Kim Hye Hyun.

887
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:13,124
(Kim Hye Hyun is demoted to the Second Class.)

888
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:15,864
- Hye Hyun looks a bit flustered. - Yes.

889
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:19,094
Second Class Kim Tae Gang and First Class Kim Hye Hyun.

890
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:22,095
please move positions.

891
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,504
(First Class to Second Class, Kim Hye Hyun)

892
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:26,635
I got a bit flustered...

893
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,104
and impatient.

894
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:31,144
"I'll be doomed if I don't show myself this time."

895
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:35,174
We'll have another Class Movement Evaluation for Group Two.

896
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:37,614
Prove that you deserve...

897
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,714
the current class you're in.

898
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:42,555
(Exhaling)

899
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:43,725
They didn't call my name.

900
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:47,095
"This isn't enough. I should put myself out there."

901
00:38:48,095 --> 00:38:49,664
(Contemporary Dance Group 2's second evaluation starts.)

902
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:51,964
(Kim Tae Gang makes a timing mistake.)

903
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:56,265
I only focused on myself. "I can do this."

904
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:57,804
(Park Jin Ho gives off a different vibe than the 1st evaluation.)

905
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:58,934
Oh, yes, Jin Ho.

906
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:01,333
I wasn't worried about making mistakes.

907
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:03,075
I just focused on dancing comfortably.

908
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:08,075
- Young Woong is really good. - Yes.

909
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,714
I should jump higher.

910
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:13,814
He's so cool.

911
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,354
I think Hye Hyun is better than Tae Gang.

912
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:18,654
- But... - They're clearly...

913
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:19,955
in First and Second each.

914
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:23,264
- But I like Jin Ho too. - Then these four...

915
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:25,865
Why don't we see Jin Ho and them dance again?

916
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:28,495
Park Jin Ho.

917
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:30,564
Kim Tae Gang.

918
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:32,064
Lee Jin Woo.

919
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,934
Oh Hyeok Heon. We want to see you dance too.

920
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:38,144
I think they're deciding who should be in Second and Under.

921
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:39,873
We're sure about them.

922
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:42,543
We're choosing one Second Class out of those four.

923
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:43,584
- Right? - Yes.

924
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:46,784
I thought I only had one chance,

925
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,015
so I should grab the chance.

926
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:50,455
I could dance according to my style,

927
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,995
but I might've followed Hye Hyun's style too much.

928
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:59,794
"I should go crazy and show them. Let's dance according to my style."

929
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:01,464
I totally lost it then.

930
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:05,004
Jin Ho is warming up real good.

931
00:40:05,464 --> 00:40:08,374
I know how Jin Ho dances when he is desperate.

932
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:09,874
I know how his eyes look.

933
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:12,774
But he had those eyes on this stage.

934
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,444
"He is serious. He is desperate."

935
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:16,615
I got a bit nervous.

936
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:21,284
(Park Jin Ho gets very serious with desperation.)

937
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,983
I hope Jin Ho gets promoted.

938
00:40:22,984 --> 00:40:24,225
(Can he grab the chance to be promoted?)

939
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,555
I hope they do well.

940
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:27,695
(The 3rd evaluation starts with just the selected 4.)

941
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:35,095
Gosh, it's Jin Ho.

942
00:40:36,464 --> 00:40:38,564
His name tag fell.

943
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:42,405
The sticker got stuck on my foot. "This is bad."

944
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:44,445
Oh, dear. He stepped on the name tag.

945
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:45,804
Just dance.

946
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:48,344
"The name tag can't stop me."

947
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,044
"Move aside. I'll show you."

948
00:40:50,945 --> 00:40:52,345
He's amazing.

949
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:53,914
The second dancer will be promoted to the First Class.

950
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:57,124
Jin Ho is going all out.

951
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:00,694
- Jin Ho is good. - Nice, Jin Ho.

952
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:01,695
- Goodness. - Nice.

953
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:03,495
I should give it my all.

954
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:06,434
(His feet touched his head.)

955
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,095
(That's impossible.)

956
00:41:08,394 --> 00:41:10,564
Goodness. Who is he?

957
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:13,075
I love it.

958
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:19,774
Goodness, so beautiful.

959
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:24,914
- Why is Jin Ho so good? - Look at Jin Ho.

960
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:27,455
- I think he'll beat him. - Exactly. He...

961
00:41:31,484 --> 00:41:33,195
(Park Jin Ho is stable until the end.)

962
00:41:33,555 --> 00:41:35,494
I think he went harder than taking part in a competition.

963
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:38,264
- Jin Ho is amazing. - He's insane.

964
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:39,294
Bravo.

965
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:41,495
The second from the left is crazy.

966
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:44,535
- Exactly. The 2nd dancer is crazy. - The 2nd dancer is really sexy.

967
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,175
Jin Ho went all out.

968
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:49,305
It feels like he finally showed himself.

969
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:51,175
Yes, you're right.

970
00:41:51,504 --> 00:41:53,773
I could clearly see Jin Ho trying to do this...

971
00:41:53,774 --> 00:41:56,785
while using his whole body.

972
00:41:56,885 --> 00:41:58,245
I felt bad for him too.

973
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:00,155
I choked up.

974
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,824
My in-ear came loose.

975
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:05,324
It became totally ragged.

976
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,495
I really gave it my all until it became like that.

977
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,695
Park Jin Ho.

978
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,524
You can't do this.

979
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:14,534
I was so shocked.

980
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:19,503
To me, you were in the First Class just now.

981
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:20,704
(He feels grateful and relieved.)

982
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,574
(Thank you.)

983
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:25,445
- He danced as if he was crazy. - He did.

984
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,515
When he must've been tired.

985
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:30,414
I think something ignited in him at the last moment.

986
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:33,183
- It was Jin Ho. Come on. - That timing, yes.

987
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:37,655
This one performance just now must've meant a lot to Jin Ho.

988
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:40,155
I think that's why they can't choose.

989
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:41,854
Jin Ho did so well just now.

990
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:44,623
I will reveal the dancers' final classes...

991
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:46,434
of Contemporary Dance Group Two.

992
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,265
Firstly, Under Class.

993
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:51,834
The dancers in the Under Class are...

994
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,204
Oh Hyeok Heon,

995
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,205
(Under Class of Group 2, Oh Hyeok Heon)

996
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,544
Lee Jin Woo,

997
00:42:57,245 --> 00:42:59,475
and Lee Jeong Hoon.

998
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:02,675
Kim Tae Gang...

999
00:43:03,845 --> 00:43:05,445
It'll hurt my pride if I join the Under Class.

1000
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:08,284
Kim Tae Gang is demoted...

1001
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,655
from the First Class to Under Class.

1002
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:14,524
He dropped straight from First all the way to Under.

1003
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:15,894
This is so cruel.

1004
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,664
- Yes. - What a cruel class battle.

1005
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:21,463
"Under Class" means I'm a dancer that backs others up.

1006
00:43:21,464 --> 00:43:23,334
It definitely hurt my pride.

1007
00:43:23,865 --> 00:43:27,774
Out of Kim Young Woong, Kim Hye Hyun, and Park Jin Ho,

1008
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:30,475
only one person will join the First Class.

1009
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,874
I will announce the first Second Class dancer.

1010
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:39,615
Hye Hyun was my rival, but I thought Jin Ho was dangerous too.

1011
00:43:39,714 --> 00:43:41,555
I was worried about them both.

1012
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:43,484
I was very nervous.

1013
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,225
"What if I don't join the First Class again?"

1014
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,155
"I showed them my best performance,"

1015
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:51,524
"so I could be promoted to the First Class again."

1016
00:43:52,024 --> 00:43:53,464
The Second Class dancer is...

1017
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,464
Kim Hye Hyun.

1018
00:43:58,865 --> 00:43:59,934
He got his choreography stolen.

1019
00:44:00,035 --> 00:44:01,604
- Poor Hye Hyun. - Only two...

1020
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,845
I had to take a step back,

1021
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:07,274
but I intend to go back to being in the First Class.

1022
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:10,043
Only two dancers are left.

1023
00:44:10,044 --> 00:44:14,385
Kim Young Woong and Park Jin Ho. Out of the two,

1024
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:16,524
who will join the First Class?

1025
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,195
I think Park Jin Ho will join the First Class.

1026
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:21,894
He dominated it.

1027
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:24,865
The 1st Class dancer of Group 2...

1028
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:27,535
I was very desperate.

1029
00:44:27,695 --> 00:44:29,834
"I might join the First Class at this rate."

1030
00:44:30,604 --> 00:44:31,604
I was confident.

1031
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:33,334
My position won't change.

1032
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:36,274
(Who out of the two will be in the First Class?)

1033
00:44:37,004 --> 00:44:39,745
It is Kim Young Woong.

1034
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:42,913
Kim Young Woong in the First Class...

1035
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:45,444
became the lead role of Contemporary Dance's Dance Film.

1036
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:46,583
Congratulations.

1037
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,285
(Kim Young Woong, the lead role of Contemporary Dance's Dance Film)

1038
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:49,954
I am Kim Young Woong.

1039
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:51,354
I am in the First Class.

1040
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,754
I feel proud of myself.

1041
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:57,595
I showed them Kim Young Woong's dance,

1042
00:44:57,765 --> 00:44:58,794
so I'm happy.

1043
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:00,934
But there's a lot more left to show about my dance.

1044
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:05,433
Park Jin Ho joined the Second Class.

1045
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:06,574
Good job.

1046
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:07,773
(Dancer Park Jin Ho is in the 2nd Class from Group 2.)

1047
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:09,945
It was very disappointing.

1048
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:12,844
But Young Woong put up good and stable performances...

1049
00:45:12,845 --> 00:45:16,044
in both Rounds 1 and 2.

1050
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:17,983
In the next mission,

1051
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:19,955
I should go all out from the beginning.

1052
00:45:20,414 --> 00:45:23,253
Since he experienced that momentary spark,

1053
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,183
Jin Ho will get better and better.

1054
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:26,724
He'll improve so much.

1055
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,324
He got fired up.

1056
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,063
I saw him ignite.

1057
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:32,293
Dancers improve on the stage,

1058
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:34,334
- not in practice rooms. - Exactly.

1059
00:45:35,535 --> 00:45:37,334
(The final classes of contemporary dancers)

1060
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:39,933
Mnet's Stage Fighter,

1061
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:42,374
Korean Dance's Class Battle,

1062
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:45,305
Dance Combination Audition will start.

1063
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:49,785
Korean Dance's Class Battle Group One.

1064
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:53,354
Under Class Kim Min Seok,

1065
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,714
Lee Young Woo.

1066
00:45:56,285 --> 00:45:59,225
Second Class Han Sang Ik.

1067
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,524
Choi Ji Won.

1068
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:03,995
Park Jun Woo.

1069
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,434
Sung Hun Mo.

1070
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:10,635
Finally, the 1st Class dancers of Group 1 will enter.

1071
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:12,334
The grim reapers enter.

1072
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:15,535
First Class Choi Ho Jong.

1073
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,603
GOAT. Ho Jong the Great.

1074
00:46:18,604 --> 00:46:19,675
He is so cool.

1075
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:23,084
First Class Kim Si Won.

1076
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:24,514
Si Won looks cool.

1077
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,043
His hair itself...

1078
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,484
already looks like that of a master Korean dancer.

1079
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:31,824
These are the 8 dancers of Group 1...

1080
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:32,885
of Korean Dance's Class Battle.

1081
00:46:34,155 --> 00:46:36,124
- This will be fun. - This looks fun.

1082
00:46:36,225 --> 00:46:38,094
It looks really cool to see the two standing in the center.

1083
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,095
- Yes. - Right?

1084
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,233
Goodness.

1085
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:41,635
Don't they look like a tiger and a lion?

1086
00:46:41,734 --> 00:46:43,534
- Exactly. - Exactly. They're like beasts.

1087
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:44,734
This is a big match.

1088
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,264
(When the groups were revealed)

1089
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:48,504
(Kim Si Won and Choi Ho Jong are against each other in Group 1.)

1090
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,635
(Surprised)

1091
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:52,744
(They close their eyes tight.)

1092
00:46:52,745 --> 00:46:54,543
(This is crazy.)

1093
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:57,813
(Everyone except the two is excited in the locker room.)

1094
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,945
"This is..."

1095
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:00,655
"the fight between Ho Jong and I."

1096
00:47:00,814 --> 00:47:02,853
"Whether I steal Ho Jong's choreography..."

1097
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,583
"or he secures his choreography."

1098
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:06,055
I thought it was a fight about that.

1099
00:47:06,225 --> 00:47:07,253
This is bad.

1100
00:47:07,254 --> 00:47:08,254
(Laughing)

1101
00:47:09,225 --> 00:47:10,365
But it's fun.

1102
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,164
I wanted to be in a battle with him later.

1103
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:15,564
But we got to meet a bit early.

1104
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:19,163
Ho Jong. On what count do you take the first step?

1105
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:21,804
Can you show me this part, please?

1106
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,874
Come together and...

1107
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:24,504
Ho Jong, this...

1108
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:26,205
Ho Jong, this...

1109
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,714
Ho Jong, after this...

1110
00:47:29,115 --> 00:47:32,614
Interpreting someone else's choreography in my style...

1111
00:47:32,615 --> 00:47:33,813
is my strong suit,

1112
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:37,154
so if I show them my style of dance against Ho Jong,

1113
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,225
I might have the chance to win.

1114
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,094
Even if Si Won interpreted my dance...

1115
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:42,495
into his unique style,

1116
00:47:42,524 --> 00:47:44,124
I was confident.

1117
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,564
Even considering that.

1118
00:47:45,794 --> 00:47:47,064
Drop here.

1119
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:48,834
Yes, nice.

1120
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:50,833
I'll continue with the next part.

1121
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,404
- Okay. - Okay.

1122
00:47:52,405 --> 00:47:53,405
I felt disturbed.

1123
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:55,833
Si Won on my right and Ho Jong on my left.

1124
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:58,374
The world is against me.

1125
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:01,575
(Focused)

1126
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:03,484
When I monitored the rehearsal,

1127
00:48:03,845 --> 00:48:05,414
I got angry at myself.

1128
00:48:05,584 --> 00:48:08,483
There were Ho Jong and Si Won in front of me...

1129
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,324
who are great dancers.

1130
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:11,425
It looked like I danced poorly.

1131
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,124
It didn't just look like it. I danced poorly.

1132
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:15,624
"I shouldn't dance like this later."

1133
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,394
The protagonist always shows improvement.

1134
00:48:19,425 --> 00:48:20,865
If I beat...

1135
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:23,334
Ho Jong and Si Won here,

1136
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:26,305
I can boast about it for the next 20 years.

1137
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:28,734
You don't know until you try.

1138
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:30,575
"Let's show them, Si Won."

1139
00:48:30,604 --> 00:48:32,905
"Ho Jong or whoever it is, I can beat them all."

1140
00:48:33,874 --> 00:48:36,584
I choreographed it. It's my child that I gave birth to.

1141
00:48:36,644 --> 00:48:38,084
I'm going to join the First Class.

1142
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:41,813
Until we find the right class for the dancers,

1143
00:48:41,814 --> 00:48:44,484
Class Movement Evaluations will continue for Class Battle.

1144
00:48:44,725 --> 00:48:47,324
Korean Dance's Class Battle...

1145
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,424
starts now.

1146
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,463
I think it'll be a battle of the three.

1147
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:52,324
- This will be interesting. - I know, right?

1148
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:53,995
- It will be fun to watch. - This is crazy.

1149
00:48:54,434 --> 00:48:55,695
They must be nervous.

1150
00:48:56,035 --> 00:48:57,504
First position.

1151
00:48:59,734 --> 00:49:00,774
Light.

1152
00:49:01,035 --> 00:49:04,004
Music, start.

1153
00:49:04,845 --> 00:49:08,515
Three, two, one. Go.

1154
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,015
(Lee Young Woo, Choi Ji Won, Sung Hun Mo, Kim Si Won)

1155
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,684
Very nice.

1156
00:49:16,555 --> 00:49:17,623
Si Won is really good.

1157
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,623
He interpreted the choreography into his own style really well.

1158
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,724
(The choreographer)

1159
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:22,555
Kim Si Won's dance is sharp.

1160
00:49:22,854 --> 00:49:23,894
So good.

1161
00:49:24,325 --> 00:49:25,495
It's interesting.

1162
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:29,764
Lee Young Woo stands out too.

1163
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:31,535
Young Woo is pretty good.

1164
00:49:31,964 --> 00:49:33,734
He's too good to be in the Under Class.

1165
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:41,515
(Choi Ho Jong, Park Jun Woo, Han Sang Ik, Kim Min Seok)

1166
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:50,884
The choreographer sure is on another level.

1167
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:52,955
Jun Woo's dance is very neat.

1168
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:54,124
(Very focused)

1169
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:58,425
- Nice! - His dance is very detailed.

1170
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:00,894
Doesn't Jun Woo stand out so much?

1171
00:50:01,095 --> 00:50:02,865
- He stands out the most. - Yes.

1172
00:50:03,095 --> 00:50:05,035
- Ho Jong... - He has no presence.

1173
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,874
Sang Ik's movements are heavy.

1174
00:50:13,205 --> 00:50:15,774
He can't do these movements properly.

1175
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:23,214
(Korean Dance Group 1's first evaluation has ended.)

1176
00:50:23,385 --> 00:50:24,524
Exciting first round.

1177
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:26,353
(The dancers interpreted the choreography...)

1178
00:50:26,354 --> 00:50:27,695
(in their own unique ways.)

1179
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:29,324
They're all so good.

1180
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:30,424
- They're good. - Good job.

1181
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:31,595
They're good.

1182
00:50:32,164 --> 00:50:33,764
Can I promote Jun Woo?

1183
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:36,805
It'll be nice to swap them and compare.

1184
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:38,933
The promotion and demotion evaluation process...

1185
00:50:38,934 --> 00:50:41,305
of Korean Dance Group One will begin.

1186
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:44,874
I will announce the dancer to be promoted from Second Class.

1187
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,014
Park Jun Woo.

1188
00:50:47,015 --> 00:50:50,344
(Park Jun Woo is promoted to the First Class.)

1189
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:51,784
I had a burst of dopamine.

1190
00:50:51,785 --> 00:50:53,515
Yes, he did so well this round.

1191
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:56,515
The dancer that got promoted to First has a good sense of space.

1192
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:59,624
With Second Class Park Jun Woo's promotion,

1193
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:02,455
the dancer that will be demoted from the First Class...

1194
00:51:02,595 --> 00:51:04,495
Nobody expected this.

1195
00:51:05,825 --> 00:51:07,535
It is Choi Ho Jong.

1196
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:10,164
(Everyone is surprised.)

1197
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,563
(Shocked)

1198
00:51:11,564 --> 00:51:12,634
Oh, dear.

1199
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:16,374
(Choi Ho Jong is demoted to the Second Class.)

1200
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:17,705
It was interesting.

1201
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:21,144
I was a bit flustered.

1202
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,914
This is shocking.

1203
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:25,114
Second Class Park Jun Woo...

1204
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,884
and First Class Choi Ho Jong, change your positions...

1205
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,813
- and move to your new class. - This is unexpected.

1206
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:31,424
I didn't see this coming.

1207
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:34,195
"Is this a dream or reality?"

1208
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:37,195
It was a big honor for me.

1209
00:51:37,564 --> 00:51:38,695
He got a big one.

1210
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,964
Ho Jong must feel bitter.

1211
00:51:41,294 --> 00:51:43,504
It felt like my senses became sharper.

1212
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,004
This is fun.

1213
00:51:45,664 --> 00:51:47,833
Second Class Han Sang Ik...

1214
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:50,674
and Under Class Kim Min Seok, change your positions...

1215
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:52,575
and move to your new class.

1216
00:51:54,874 --> 00:51:56,844
Second Class Sung Hun Mo...

1217
00:51:56,845 --> 00:52:01,484
and Under Class Lee Young Woo, please move to your class positions.

1218
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:03,924
We will continue the Class Movement Evaluation...

1219
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:06,354
for Korean Dance Group One.

1220
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:07,694
Their class could change again, right?

1221
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:09,124
- That's right. - After this...

1222
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:11,694
No one knows until the end.

1223
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,434
I had to prove that I didn't get promoted by mistake.

1224
00:52:15,995 --> 00:52:17,734
I felt a lot of pressure.

1225
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:20,175
I must go back up.

1226
00:52:20,834 --> 00:52:23,603
If I triumph over Ho Jong and Jun Woo and win,

1227
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:25,374
it will be very interesting.

1228
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:28,314
Let's take our first positions, please.

1229
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:30,484
Music, start.

1230
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:32,543
(Unpredictable)

1231
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:35,483
(How will Korean Dance Group 1's 2nd performance turn out?)

1232
00:52:35,484 --> 00:52:36,954
Ho Jong looks extremely fierce.

1233
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:38,584
Instead of being nervous, his heart must be fluttering.

1234
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:44,064
He's dancing with intensity.

1235
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:45,794
My gosh.

1236
00:52:46,325 --> 00:52:48,294
- He looks hip. - It looks amazing.

1237
00:52:48,794 --> 00:52:51,535
Now that I'm in the front, my dancing should stand out.

1238
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:54,535
It's clean.

1239
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:58,674
Jun Woo stands out so much. He moves well.

1240
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,805
He's good.

1241
00:52:59,975 --> 00:53:01,214
He seems to stand out the most.

1242
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:03,484
I should make it look stronger.

1243
00:53:05,214 --> 00:53:06,245
Interesting.

1244
00:53:06,414 --> 00:53:09,184
Dancer Kim Si Won knows his strengths clearly.

1245
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:11,184
Si Won is really good.

1246
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:14,495
They move with a different groove.

1247
00:53:15,524 --> 00:53:16,695
Ho Jong is starting.

1248
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,495
That's it.

1249
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:22,635
Nice. He's got it.

1250
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:25,035
He's got it.

1251
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:27,433
Exactly. You have to show the facial expression.

1252
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:28,434
I love you.

1253
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,504
- He's definitely Ho Jong the Great. - How is he so sexy?

1254
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:32,905
They're enjoying it.

1255
00:53:33,714 --> 00:53:35,975
They each have personality in their movements.

1256
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:41,684
He's so sexy.

1257
00:53:42,115 --> 00:53:43,885
- His facial expression is amazing. - I agree.

1258
00:53:44,084 --> 00:53:45,624
It was like a drama.

1259
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:47,925
- That was amazing. - He's really good.

1260
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:50,024
He deserves to be promoted.

1261
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:53,024
He was insanely good. He'll get the First Class.

1262
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:55,365
The one in blue stood out so much.

1263
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,064
He's extremely charismatic.

1264
00:53:57,464 --> 00:53:58,834
Si Won is such a good dancer.

1265
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:02,774
Ho Jong, do you know what I find strange?

1266
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,475
Why didn't you show us from the beginning?

1267
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:07,745
(Smiling)

1268
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:12,884
As expected from the choreographer,

1269
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:15,114
you showed the character...

1270
00:54:15,115 --> 00:54:17,584
and drama perfectly in your movements.

1271
00:54:18,084 --> 00:54:21,955
Jun Woo, your facial expressions and emotions seemed less...

1272
00:54:22,354 --> 00:54:25,425
than others when you were dancing in the center.

1273
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:27,934
Si Won,

1274
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:32,564
I thought that you were lacking something extra.

1275
00:54:32,865 --> 00:54:34,405
You did a good job.

1276
00:54:35,035 --> 00:54:38,905
I will announce the dancer to be promoted from the Second Class.

1277
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:40,615
It must be Ho Jong.

1278
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:42,475
He's taking back his position.

1279
00:54:42,675 --> 00:54:44,683
(As everyone predicts, will Ho Jong go back to the First Class?)

1280
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:46,913
I'm sorry for keep moving you.

1281
00:54:46,914 --> 00:54:48,413
It's Dancer Choi Ho Jong.

1282
00:54:48,414 --> 00:54:51,454
(Dancer Choi Ho Jong moves from the 2nd to 1st Class.)

1283
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,484
I knew it. This is what makes it fun.

1284
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,393
Is he getting demoted again?

1285
00:54:55,394 --> 00:54:58,994
Due to Dancer Choi Ho Jong's promotion,

1286
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,294
the dancer to be demoted from the First Class is...

1287
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:02,794
Could it be Jun Woo?

1288
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:04,365
It'll be either Jun Woo or...

1289
00:55:05,004 --> 00:55:07,104
I could get demoted again.

1290
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:09,905
I didn't feel particularly worried.

1291
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,575
The dancer to be demoted is...

1292
00:55:13,405 --> 00:55:16,175
I wouldn't be able to decide.

1293
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:22,785
It's Dancer Kim Si Won.

1294
00:55:23,214 --> 00:55:25,325
Now, I'm at risk.

1295
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:27,655
I survived.

1296
00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:29,495
He kept his position in the First Class.

1297
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:33,094
Choi Ho Jong from Second and Kim Si Won from First,

1298
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:35,894
- please switch places. - That's unfortunate.

1299
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:39,635
Si Won should also join the Second Class at least once.

1300
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:42,635
I didn't feel good about it.

1301
00:55:43,205 --> 00:55:44,705
Si Won must feel disappointed.

1302
00:55:45,504 --> 00:55:47,075
I could be in the First Class.

1303
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:49,044
Will I be the first in history?

1304
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:51,084
Will I become the talk of the town?

1305
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,245
Everyone, this is your last chance.

1306
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:55,854
Please show us everything that you've got.

1307
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:57,155
Break a leg.

1308
00:55:57,156 --> 00:55:59,354
- You can do it. - Good luck.

1309
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:02,024
(The last performance to determine the First Class dancer)

1310
00:56:02,695 --> 00:56:05,725
I should show myself as much as possible.

1311
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:10,135
I'll show you from the Second Class.

1312
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:11,765
I'll show you what I am.

1313
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:16,334
I thought that I had to be in the First Class no matter what.

1314
00:56:17,104 --> 00:56:18,175
First position.

1315
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:22,075
Music.

1316
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:23,845
Start.

1317
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:25,714
- Three, two, - Okay.

1318
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:27,814
one. Go.

1319
00:56:32,955 --> 00:56:34,095
Look at him smiling.

1320
00:56:36,155 --> 00:56:37,824
- Okay. - Choi Ho Jong is having a blast.

1321
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:39,925
(Choreographer Choi Ho Jong dominates the stage.)

1322
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:42,464
Ho Jong is...

1323
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,834
He's insane!

1324
00:56:46,805 --> 00:56:49,134
Ho Jong definitely changed...

1325
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:50,175
after being in the Second Class.

1326
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:53,075
I'll show you what talent is.

1327
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:55,175
His facial expression changed.

1328
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,515
(Kim Si Won is performing with richer skills.)

1329
00:56:58,644 --> 00:56:59,644
Nice.

1330
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:02,253
- Si Won suddenly became amazing. - Right? Hasn't he changed?

1331
00:57:02,254 --> 00:57:03,455
What is wrong with him?

1332
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:06,554
He's starting to use new skills.

1333
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:07,695
- He's trying. - Yes.

1334
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,124
We can tell that Jun Woo is younger.

1335
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,364
Si Won has more years of experience.

1336
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:16,134
Si Won gobbled him up.

1337
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:17,305
Oh, no.

1338
00:57:19,265 --> 00:57:20,475
- Gosh. - Bravo.

1339
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:21,975
That was much better.

1340
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:24,144
Bravo.

1341
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:25,644
That was really amazing.

1342
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:30,544
(The dancers did their best in their places.)

1343
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,655
My goodness. I might fall in love with him.

1344
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,794
Seriously. I can't deny his skills.

1345
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:44,524
You did a wonderful job.

1346
00:57:44,624 --> 00:57:47,035
We will announce the final classes.

1347
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:49,264
Under Class dancers are...

1348
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:50,265
Choi Ji Won,

1349
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:51,934
Sung Hun Mo,

1350
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:53,405
Lee Young Woo,

1351
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:54,905
Han Sang Ik,

1352
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:57,405
and Kim Min Seok.

1353
00:57:57,705 --> 00:58:00,515
Kim Si Won, Choi Ho Jong, and Park Jun Woo.

1354
00:58:00,745 --> 00:58:03,984
Among the 3 of you, the one in the 2nd Class is...

1355
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:06,143
Park Jun Woo.

1356
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:08,183
(Dancer Park Jun Woo is in the 2nd Class from Group 1.)

1357
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,285
Dancer Park Jun Woo.

1358
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:11,054
Good job.

1359
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:12,483
- Good job, Jun Woo. - You worked hard.

1360
00:58:12,484 --> 00:58:14,155
(Good job.)

1361
00:58:14,495 --> 00:58:15,825
I lost again, but I fought well.

1362
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:18,424
However, defeating Ho Jong once...

1363
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:19,925
made me feel confident.

1364
00:58:20,695 --> 00:58:21,765
I'm satisfied.

1365
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:25,564
Between Kim Si Won and Choi Ho Jong,

1366
00:58:26,064 --> 00:58:29,504
the First Class dancer from Group One is...

1367
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:31,345
Who will be in the First Class?

1368
00:58:31,745 --> 00:58:34,945
Whatever the result may be, I'm ready to accept it.

1369
00:58:35,475 --> 00:58:37,184
I want to stay in the First Class.

1370
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:40,314
It's Dancer Choi Ho Jong.

1371
00:58:41,015 --> 00:58:42,083
Congratulations.

1372
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,714
(Dancer Choi Ho Jong is in the 1st Class from Group 1.)

1373
00:58:44,484 --> 00:58:45,523
Good job, everyone.

1374
00:58:45,524 --> 00:58:46,684
(As expected)

1375
00:58:47,595 --> 00:58:49,754
That's right. This is more natural.

1376
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,865
You became the lead role of Korean Dance's Dance Film.

1377
00:58:53,995 --> 00:58:55,034
Congratulations.

1378
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:56,333
(This is the best reaction he has.)

1379
00:58:56,334 --> 00:58:57,404
I feel so happy.

1380
00:58:57,405 --> 00:59:00,575
The leading role that I earned today is...

1381
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:03,704
like a reward or proof...

1382
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:06,744
of the hard work I put in until now.

1383
00:59:06,745 --> 00:59:08,675
I feel very grateful at this moment.

1384
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:11,914
Dancer Kim Si Won is in the Second Class.

1385
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:13,385
Great work.

1386
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:16,055
(Disappointed)

1387
00:59:16,254 --> 00:59:17,584
I don't like placing second.

1388
00:59:17,925 --> 00:59:19,183
(Sad)

1389
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,924
He definitely didn't show it in the beginning.

1390
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,294
Ho Jong didn't dance with energy.

1391
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:26,024
He changed all of a sudden.

1392
00:59:26,365 --> 00:59:27,434
He's special.

1393
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:30,294
Korean Dance Class Battle, Group Two.

1394
00:59:30,805 --> 00:59:33,504
Choreographed Combination Audition will start.

1395
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:38,575
The one in purple in the Second Class looks like an idol singer.

1396
00:59:39,044 --> 00:59:40,274
He's very handsome.

1397
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:42,214
(Did he burst out laughing?)

1398
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:45,813
There's something... He has the quality of a star.

1399
00:59:45,814 --> 00:59:46,814
Yes.

1400
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,254
(The stage is filled with tension.)

1401
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:50,055
(Watching intently)

1402
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:52,984
The First Class dancers look weak.

1403
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:55,394
I feel bad for the youngest dancers.

1404
00:59:55,595 --> 00:59:56,794
They look so nervous.

1405
00:59:57,825 --> 01:00:00,063
Dancers in the Second and Under Classes have a chance...

1406
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:01,234
in Group Two.

1407
01:00:03,794 --> 01:00:06,265
I'll dominate this round.

1408
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:08,834
(When the groups were revealed)

1409
01:00:09,475 --> 01:00:11,144
- Gosh. - Nice.

1410
01:00:11,405 --> 01:00:12,745
I'm jealous of Group Two.

1411
01:00:13,004 --> 01:00:15,044
Group Two is extremely lucky.

1412
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,384
The choreographer isn't in it.

1413
01:00:17,385 --> 01:00:19,015
There are no strong dancers either.

1414
01:00:19,544 --> 01:00:21,253
- The youngest... - It's them.

1415
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:22,254
(In Group 2, the youngest are in the 1st Class.)

1416
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:23,484
Winning the First Class might be easy.

1417
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:25,024
I thought that I could make it.

1418
01:00:25,785 --> 01:00:26,984
There aren't good dancers in the group.

1419
01:00:27,595 --> 01:00:29,055
(While learning the choreography)

1420
01:00:30,354 --> 01:00:32,163
(Dancers in Group 2 find Ho Jong's choreography too hard.)

1421
01:00:32,164 --> 01:00:33,164
It's confusing.

1422
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:36,064
(Kim Jong Cheol is learning the choreography quickly.)

1423
01:00:36,464 --> 01:00:37,664
Jong Cheol is good.

1424
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,404
Jong Cheol caught my attention.

1425
01:00:40,405 --> 01:00:41,774
His moves look sexy.

1426
01:00:41,874 --> 01:00:43,234
- He's good. - He's extremely good.

1427
01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:44,945
He might take away my place.

1428
01:00:45,104 --> 01:00:48,475
I was scared that I wouldn't be able to keep it.

1429
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,274
I felt convinced.

1430
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:52,445
What? I might be able to make it.

1431
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:55,914
He didn't push himself too hard.

1432
01:00:56,314 --> 01:01:00,425
Sang Gil's dancing seemed unique and had its own color.

1433
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:04,265
Among everyone in the studio,

1434
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:07,595
I don't think anyone danced it more interestingly than me.

1435
01:01:07,995 --> 01:01:11,504
I thought that Sang Gil might be able to move up.

1436
01:01:12,164 --> 01:01:13,905
He's too good to be in the Under Class.

1437
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:18,044
I started in the Under Class, and it hurt my sense of pride.

1438
01:01:18,144 --> 01:01:22,444
(Korean Dance Group 2 is checking their rehearsal.)

1439
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,675
Us in the back look weak.

1440
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:25,115
You can't see us because we're behind others.

1441
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:26,784
Exactly.

1442
01:01:26,785 --> 01:01:28,484
I realized it as soon as I saw the placement.

1443
01:01:28,914 --> 01:01:31,454
Due to the other dancers in the front,

1444
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:32,825
I might dance in the shadow.

1445
01:01:33,754 --> 01:01:35,524
I have to move up no matter what.

1446
01:01:36,124 --> 01:01:40,164
I'm in the lowest class possible.

1447
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,094
I must join the First Class.

1448
01:01:42,095 --> 01:01:43,095
(Gulping)

1449
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,404
Group Two dancers,

1450
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:48,504
please do your best and join the class of your choice.

1451
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,705
I should join the First Class.

1452
01:01:51,805 --> 01:01:54,413
What I do best is...

1453
01:01:54,414 --> 01:01:56,745
enjoying the dance and performing onstage.

1454
01:01:56,845 --> 01:01:57,845
I already feel...

1455
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,184
anxiety from this group.

1456
01:02:00,615 --> 01:02:03,154
Korean Dance Class Battle will start...

1457
01:02:03,155 --> 01:02:04,484
for Group Two.

1458
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:05,955
First position.

1459
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:10,155
Light.

1460
01:02:11,095 --> 01:02:12,964
Music, start.

1461
01:02:13,725 --> 01:02:14,733
Let's get it.

1462
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,595
Gosh, this will be fun.

1463
01:02:17,664 --> 01:02:19,603
Five, four,

1464
01:02:19,604 --> 01:02:21,634
- three, two, - Let's go.

1465
01:02:21,635 --> 01:02:23,705
- one. Go. - Let's go.

1466
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,075
(Kim Min Suk, Choi Jong In Kim In Su, Kim Sang Gil)

1467
01:02:30,845 --> 01:02:33,144
Sang Gil changed the emphasis.

1468
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,684
That's crazy.

1469
01:02:40,184 --> 01:02:42,124
Kim Sang Gil is much better than the First Class dancer.

1470
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:49,734
He's very charming.

1471
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:55,234
(Shin Doung Woo, Kang Seong Bae Kim Jong Cheol, Cho Tae Yoon)

1472
01:02:59,845 --> 01:03:00,874
He's good.

1473
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:06,115
All right. Tae Yoon is good.

1474
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:07,785
First Dancer in black is good.

1475
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:09,984
First Dancer in black is good.

1476
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,484
Nice.

1477
01:03:18,124 --> 01:03:21,195
- He looks very sexy. - He's bewitching.

1478
01:03:23,495 --> 01:03:24,535
They're really good.

1479
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,205
(Korean Dance Group 2's 1st performance is over.)

1480
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:29,805
- It gave me goosebumps. - Gosh, they're good.

1481
01:03:30,004 --> 01:03:31,074
His lingering movement.

1482
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:32,075
(His lingering movement was great.)

1483
01:03:32,076 --> 01:03:33,905
Jong Cheol is definitely good at making sexy movements.

1484
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:36,514
- Tae Yoon is good. - Yes, he did a good job.

1485
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:38,845
Everyone did well. No one was bad.

1486
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:40,814
Wasn't Min Suk less competitive?

1487
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:43,015
- It looked very weak. - Exactly.

1488
01:03:43,655 --> 01:03:45,424
- He should get promoted. - You think so?

1489
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,694
- He has to get promoted. - I love him.

1490
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:48,853
He's so sexy.

1491
01:03:48,854 --> 01:03:50,055
I loved it.

1492
01:03:50,195 --> 01:03:51,664
Dancer Kim Sang Gil and...

1493
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:52,925
He can stay.

1494
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:54,995
Or should we switch these two?

1495
01:03:55,995 --> 01:03:58,604
- It sounds good. - Yes, like this.

1496
01:03:59,834 --> 01:04:01,974
The promotion and demotion evaluation process...

1497
01:04:01,975 --> 01:04:03,575
of Korean Dance Group Two will begin.

1498
01:04:03,834 --> 01:04:06,305
How will they move the dancers in this group?

1499
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:09,115
The dancer demoted in the Second Class is...

1500
01:04:09,544 --> 01:04:11,114
Dancer Choi Jong In.

1501
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:12,314
(Dancer Choi Jong In is demoted to the Under Class.)

1502
01:04:12,414 --> 01:04:15,114
I wasn't sure if your dancing fit...

1503
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:16,514
Choi Ho Jong's choreography.

1504
01:04:16,515 --> 01:04:19,155
I need to see how you dance a little more.

1505
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,655
The dancer promoted from the Under Class is...

1506
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,894
Dancer Kim Sang Gil.

1507
01:04:24,524 --> 01:04:26,324
I felt that...

1508
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:28,894
Dancer Kim Sang Gil enjoyed dancing a lot.

1509
01:04:28,964 --> 01:04:31,003
He tried hard to show himself.

1510
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:33,434
I found it very meaningful.

1511
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:34,733
You were amazing.

1512
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:36,773
Second Class Dancer Choi Jong In...

1513
01:04:36,774 --> 01:04:39,305
and Under Class Dancer Kim Sang Gil,

1514
01:04:39,544 --> 01:04:41,414
please move positions.

1515
01:04:42,814 --> 01:04:44,784
This is good. I just need to move up slowly.

1516
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:47,385
I should be more energetic and nail the next performance.

1517
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,885
I will announce the dancer to be promoted from the Second Class.

1518
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:54,293
It's Dancer Kim Jong Cheol.

1519
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:56,254
(Kim Jong Cheol is promoted to the First Class.)

1520
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,765
Jong Cheol did well.

1521
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,765
The dancer demoted from the First Class is...

1522
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,095
Kim Min Suk.

1523
01:05:03,265 --> 01:05:06,964
(Kim Jong Cheol and Kim Min Suk switch places.)

1524
01:05:11,644 --> 01:05:13,504
It's only beginning now. Don't let it go.

1525
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:16,143
We will continue...

1526
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:18,245
the Class Movement Evaluation for Korean Dance Group Two.

1527
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:21,114
Prove to us again...

1528
01:05:21,115 --> 01:05:24,015
that you're in the class that's appropriate for you.

1529
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:27,555
The First Class dancer is me. This is where I'll show them.

1530
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:31,195
I have to go up to the First Class no matter what.

1531
01:05:31,524 --> 01:05:32,664
First position.

1532
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,265
Music.

1533
01:05:34,995 --> 01:05:35,995
Start.

1534
01:05:36,894 --> 01:05:39,305
Finally, I'm in a place where they can see me.

1535
01:05:39,964 --> 01:05:43,334
Let's show them more of my personality in my dance.

1536
01:05:43,604 --> 01:05:45,245
(Korean Dance Group 2's 2nd performance starts.)

1537
01:05:49,814 --> 01:05:50,845
He's good.

1538
01:05:52,314 --> 01:05:53,414
His lines are beautiful.

1539
01:05:54,655 --> 01:05:55,914
The one in purple is really good.

1540
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:00,924
- Kim Sang Gil is good. - Yes, he's good.

1541
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:02,555
He's better now that he's promoted.

1542
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,564
He turned it into his dance. Look at that.

1543
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:08,434
(Kim Sang Gil shows off his own style.)

1544
01:06:08,695 --> 01:06:10,064
The one who was in the Under Class is good.

1545
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:12,834
I love that guy in white.

1546
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:15,873
- Nice. Yes, that guy. - He was...

1547
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:16,874
- amazing. - He was in the Under Class.

1548
01:06:26,084 --> 01:06:28,654
- Amazing. - His lines are clean.

1549
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:29,684
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

1550
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:33,925
- The one in white is good. - He got promoted for a reason.

1551
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:36,123
I didn't know Kim Sang Gil danced that well.

1552
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:37,664
Isn't he good?

1553
01:06:37,765 --> 01:06:39,524
I was very impressed by Sang Gil.

1554
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:41,365
That was really good.

1555
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:43,994
- Can he be in the First Class? - I agree.

1556
01:06:43,995 --> 01:06:45,433
- We both thought so. - Me too.

1557
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,464
He's in the Second Class, so we will...

1558
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:49,504
(Staring)

1559
01:06:50,475 --> 01:06:51,544
Let's move up.

1560
01:06:52,104 --> 01:06:54,575
Here's why I like him. It's because...

1561
01:06:54,814 --> 01:06:56,674
he's trying to prove himself.

1562
01:06:56,675 --> 01:06:59,245
I can feel that he's trying to move up the rank.

1563
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:02,683
Let's switch Kim Sang Gil and Cho Tae Yoon.

1564
01:07:02,684 --> 01:07:04,583
Okay, that sounds good.

1565
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,023
After that, we should watch these two.

1566
01:07:06,024 --> 01:07:07,925
- Let's watch him and Jong Cheol. - I agree.

1567
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:12,495
Let's go.

1568
01:07:13,964 --> 01:07:14,964
Just one more step.

1569
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,104
I will announce...

1570
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:21,475
the dancer to be promoted from the Second Class...

1571
01:07:22,234 --> 01:07:23,405
from Korean Dance Group Two.

1572
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:26,144
(Gulping)

1573
01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:29,614
It's Dancer Kim Sang Gil.

1574
01:07:29,615 --> 01:07:33,115
(Kim Sang Gil is promoted to the First Class.)

1575
01:07:33,314 --> 01:07:36,055
As Kim Sang Gil got promoted from the Second Class,

1576
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:37,754
which dancer...

1577
01:07:37,955 --> 01:07:40,325
will be demoted from the First Class?

1578
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,725
It's Dancer Cho Tae Yoon.

1579
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:46,624
Second Class Kim Sang Gil...

1580
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:49,464
and First Class Cho Tae Yoon.

1581
01:07:49,894 --> 01:07:51,305
Please move positions.

1582
01:07:54,705 --> 01:07:57,575
- Did he move up from Under Class? - From Under to First Class.

1583
01:07:57,705 --> 01:07:59,975
Gosh, he moved up two classes.

1584
01:08:00,175 --> 01:08:02,615
- Dancer Kim Sang Gil. - Yes?

1585
01:08:03,075 --> 01:08:05,814
Could you please look at where you were standing?

1586
01:08:07,854 --> 01:08:09,515
(The Under Class position at the rear of the stage)

1587
01:08:09,584 --> 01:08:10,785
It felt very emotional.

1588
01:08:12,124 --> 01:08:14,425
I fell asleep while listening to the song.

1589
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:16,124
I also listened to it in my shower.

1590
01:08:16,424 --> 01:08:18,195
Those moments flashed before my eyes.

1591
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:22,165
It felt like I was writing an epic.

1592
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:24,905
How far did you get?

1593
01:08:26,934 --> 01:08:29,075
(Pleased)

1594
01:08:30,035 --> 01:08:32,405
- I moved up a little. - How do you feel?

1595
01:08:34,745 --> 01:08:36,813
I'm not satisfied yet.

1596
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:39,514
- Because it isn't confirmed? - Right.

1597
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:41,314
Are you confident?

1598
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:44,625
Yes, I am.

1599
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:46,184
- I look forward to it. - Okay.

1600
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:48,424
You can do it.

1601
01:08:50,195 --> 01:08:52,894
If he makes it to the First Class, it'll be dramatic.

1602
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:55,434
You have one last chance.

1603
01:08:55,535 --> 01:08:58,064
You'll have to prove yourself now.

1604
01:08:59,564 --> 01:09:02,035
Please prove yourselves once again.

1605
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:04,304
This position has always been mine.

1606
01:09:04,545 --> 01:09:06,774
I always belonged here.

1607
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:09,514
Now, I must show them my everything.

1608
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:12,313
Gosh, I'm at risk.

1609
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,384
I felt like I was getting behind.

1610
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:18,125
Will Sang Gil beat me as well?

1611
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:20,955
Will he be able to stay in the First Class?

1612
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:22,995
Let's go.

1613
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,155
First position.

1614
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:26,365
Music, start.

1615
01:09:27,495 --> 01:09:30,495
Kim Sang Gil also changed the first position.

1616
01:09:31,165 --> 01:09:32,965
He's the only one starting differently.

1617
01:09:33,835 --> 01:09:36,174
Let's make the performance fun without leaving regrets.

1618
01:09:37,035 --> 01:09:38,144
I'll gobble them up.

1619
01:09:38,644 --> 01:09:39,774
(Look how relaxed he is.)

1620
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:42,245
(The last evaluation for Korean Dance Group 3)

1621
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:43,643
(The Under Class rebellion)

1622
01:09:43,644 --> 01:09:44,844
(How will Kim Sang Gil perform?)

1623
01:09:45,245 --> 01:09:46,285
First position.

1624
01:09:46,745 --> 01:09:48,514
Music, start.

1625
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,655
Kim Sang Gil also changed the first position.

1626
01:09:53,384 --> 01:09:55,054
He's the only one starting differently.

1627
01:09:55,955 --> 01:09:58,394
Let's make the performance fun without leaving regrets.

1628
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,264
I'll gobble them up.

1629
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:02,264
(Look how relaxed he is.)

1630
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:04,535
(The last evaluation for Korean Dance Group 3 starts.)

1631
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,405
- He's good. - He changed the emphasis.

1632
01:10:13,405 --> 01:10:14,445
He's good.

1633
01:10:14,474 --> 01:10:15,514
(They're getting absorbed in it.)

1634
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,115
- He's good. - It's like a concert.

1635
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:19,344
I can only see him.

1636
01:10:20,915 --> 01:10:21,984
Hey, go.

1637
01:10:23,215 --> 01:10:24,255
He looks amazing.

1638
01:10:25,825 --> 01:10:26,825
Hey, go.

1639
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,154
He nailed it.

1640
01:10:30,155 --> 01:10:31,224
(Shuddering)

1641
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:33,524
I can see why he's in the First Class.

1642
01:10:33,894 --> 01:10:36,035
- This is fun. - He deserves to be in First Class.

1643
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:40,603
(Exclaiming)

1644
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:41,774
(That was incredible.)

1645
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:44,774
(Kim Sang Gil's fancy finale pose)

1646
01:10:46,274 --> 01:10:47,344
(Blowing)

1647
01:10:47,405 --> 01:10:50,075
- That was insane. - He's really good.

1648
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:52,513
It gave me goosebumps.

1649
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,614
Why was he ever in the Under Class?

1650
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:56,955
- That was great showmanship. - He can't do that, can he?

1651
01:10:57,825 --> 01:10:58,884
He changed the choreography.

1652
01:11:00,354 --> 01:11:02,625
I didn't follow the choreography at all.

1653
01:11:03,495 --> 01:11:04,794
(From the starting pose to movement details)

1654
01:11:04,795 --> 01:11:06,464
The audience would have fun only when I'm having fun.

1655
01:11:06,465 --> 01:11:08,234
The judges would also have fun.

1656
01:11:08,295 --> 01:11:11,464
Even if I dance differently from others,

1657
01:11:11,465 --> 01:11:13,965
I wanted to show what I wanted.

1658
01:11:14,474 --> 01:11:16,103
Is it okay to change the choreography?

1659
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:17,704
I think he just enjoyed himself.

1660
01:11:17,705 --> 01:11:21,143
He did, but it was outside the bounds.

1661
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:22,774
- He should take responsibility. - Right.

1662
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:26,184
He's holding a double-edged sword. What will the judges think?

1663
01:11:26,644 --> 01:11:30,214
I will reveal the dancers' final classes of Group Two.

1664
01:11:30,215 --> 01:11:31,223
(Korean Dance Group 2's final classes are revealed.)

1665
01:11:31,224 --> 01:11:32,654
Dancers in the Under Class are...

1666
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:36,294
Shin Doung Woo, Kang Seong Bae, Kim In Su,

1667
01:11:36,295 --> 01:11:40,423
Choi Jong In, and Kim Min Suk. Five people in total.

1668
01:11:40,424 --> 01:11:41,665
(Shin Doung Woo, Kang Seong Bae, Kim In Su, Choi Jon In, Kim Min Suk)

1669
01:11:41,695 --> 01:11:44,633
Kim Sang Gil, Cho Tae Yoon, and Kim Jong Cheol.

1670
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,564
Among the 3 of you, the dancer in the 2nd Class is...

1671
01:11:48,234 --> 01:11:50,434
Cho Tae Yoon.

1672
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:55,173
Cho Tae Yoon has been demoted from the First Class...

1673
01:11:55,174 --> 01:11:56,914
to the Second Class.

1674
01:11:56,915 --> 01:11:57,915
(Demoted from 1st to 2nd Class)

1675
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:00,814
Only two dancers remain.
[Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin]

1676
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:04,285
Dancers Kim Sang Gil and Kim Jong Cheol.

1677
01:12:04,785 --> 01:12:07,785
The 1st Class dancer from Group 2 is...

1678
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:10,023
It's impossible not to want it.

1679
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:13,064
I hope that I'll be at the top.

1680
01:12:13,524 --> 01:12:16,633
Sang Gil was competing against me,

1681
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:18,134
so I felt anxious.

1682
01:12:18,804 --> 01:12:20,764
Who will it be? Jong Cheol or Sang Gil?

1683
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:23,633
(Which one will be the final First Class dancer?)

1684
01:12:23,634 --> 01:12:25,803
It's Kim Jong Cheol.

1685
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:27,774
(Dancer Kim Jong Cheol is in the 1st Class from Group 2.)

1686
01:12:30,314 --> 01:12:32,014
(Relieved)

1687
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:33,715
Good job!

1688
01:12:34,314 --> 01:12:36,414
Anyone can change the choreography...

1689
01:12:36,415 --> 01:12:37,483
to adjust it to their liking.

1690
01:12:37,484 --> 01:12:40,353
But I believe that you should respect the basics.

1691
01:12:40,354 --> 01:12:42,393
You should express your personality...

1692
01:12:42,394 --> 01:12:44,824
while following the original choreography.

1693
01:12:44,825 --> 01:12:47,165
I think we should point that out.

1694
01:12:47,424 --> 01:12:49,335
He was being too greedy.

1695
01:12:49,835 --> 01:12:51,464
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol will be...

1696
01:12:51,465 --> 01:12:55,004
the lead dancer in Korean Dance Film.

1697
01:12:55,005 --> 01:12:57,074
(Kim Jong Cheol became the lead dancer in Korean Dance Film.)

1698
01:12:57,075 --> 01:12:59,673
I see the star quality in you.

1699
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:03,614
I would just like to see and feel that you feel...

1700
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:05,285
that you have the star quality as well.

1701
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,383
So I need to feel your confidence.

1702
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,554
Dancer Kim Sang Gil is in the Second Class.

1703
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:11,585
You were amazing.

1704
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,424
He still got promoted from the Under Class.

1705
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,564
(The dancers receive armbands according to their class.)

1706
01:13:19,365 --> 01:13:21,964
I got the lead role.

1707
01:13:21,965 --> 01:13:25,205
It made me feel so good.

1708
01:13:25,465 --> 01:13:28,375
Why did you do that, Sang Gil?

1709
01:13:29,934 --> 01:13:31,134
Why did I do that?

1710
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:33,705
I feel so disappointed.

1711
01:13:34,045 --> 01:13:35,375
Under Class Sang Gil is gone.

1712
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,074
Now, I'm in Second Class.

1713
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:38,745
See you again when I'm in First Class.

1714
01:13:40,945 --> 01:13:43,483
Who will be the one and only dancer...

1715
01:13:43,484 --> 01:13:46,285
that makes it to the First Class by proving himself?

1716
01:13:46,424 --> 01:13:48,995
Korean Dance Group Three will start.

1717
01:13:49,995 --> 01:13:52,224
Gosh, I know him.

1718
01:13:52,524 --> 01:13:56,634
For competitions, he learned choreography from Choi Ho Jung.

1719
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,504
- I think so too. - He probably knows...

1720
01:13:59,505 --> 01:14:01,064
Choi Ho Jung's style inside and out.

1721
01:14:01,434 --> 01:14:04,374
From high school to my senior year in college,

1722
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,674
he's been my teacher in competitions.

1723
01:14:07,274 --> 01:14:09,544
It's Ho Jong's choreography.

1724
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:12,813
My dancing style is the most similar to his,

1725
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:13,844
so I feel confident.

1726
01:14:14,814 --> 01:14:17,314
I was keeping Kyu Nyeon in check.

1727
01:14:17,415 --> 01:14:19,724
I must do better than him and win.

1728
01:14:20,054 --> 01:14:21,854
I practiced much more than usual.

1729
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:25,724
(Kim Hyo Joon practices hard until the end backstage.)

1730
01:14:27,524 --> 01:14:30,134
(Looking around)

1731
01:14:30,394 --> 01:14:31,964
My sleeve got torn.

1732
01:14:31,965 --> 01:14:33,905
I tried too hard to defeat you.

1733
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,705
I wasn't worried about you at all.

1734
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:39,344
- That's why you'll lose today. - Let's see.

1735
01:14:40,674 --> 01:14:43,343
I found it strange that neither Kyu Nyeon nor Hyo Joon...

1736
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:45,085
was keeping me in check.

1737
01:14:45,415 --> 01:14:48,415
I'm also in this group.

1738
01:14:48,715 --> 01:14:50,384
It hurt my sense of pride so much.

1739
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:53,784
My priority was making up for the first audition...

1740
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:56,155
where I performed poorly.

1741
01:14:56,755 --> 01:14:59,223
(During the Korean Dance Physical and Technique Audition)

1742
01:14:59,224 --> 01:15:00,264
Goodness.

1743
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:05,234
(Ki Moo Gan joined the Second Class for making mistakes.)

1744
01:15:05,965 --> 01:15:08,035
I should show...

1745
01:15:08,205 --> 01:15:11,335
what others expect of me.

1746
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:16,014
I must move up to First Class.

1747
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:21,084
It would be very interesting if he did well.

1748
01:15:21,085 --> 01:15:23,785
It's hard to predict what Moo Gan will show when he's determined.

1749
01:15:24,155 --> 01:15:25,754
That's why I can't wait to see him.

1750
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:26,825
First position.

1751
01:15:27,755 --> 01:15:29,995
Music, start.

1752
01:15:30,394 --> 01:15:34,023
Three, two, one. Go.

1753
01:15:34,024 --> 01:15:35,834
(Korean Dance Group 3 Class Battle starts.)

1754
01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:39,133
(First: Kim Hyo Joon, Second: Park Cheol Woo, Ki Moo Gan)

1755
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,134
(Under: Kim Min Su)

1756
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,375
Nice.

1757
01:15:48,075 --> 01:15:49,144
Hyo Joon is good.

1758
01:15:55,655 --> 01:15:57,314
(That's it.)

1759
01:15:58,424 --> 01:15:59,585
Gosh, Moo Gan.

1760
01:15:59,924 --> 01:16:01,495
Isn't he great?

1761
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,554
Didn't he get better?

1762
01:16:03,854 --> 01:16:04,893
His dance has a decadent charm.

1763
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,064
(Full of decadent charms)

1764
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:10,934
Moo Gan was good.

1765
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:17,633
(Under: Jang Sung Bum, Second: Baek Sang Ha, Bang Seong Hyun)

1766
01:16:17,634 --> 01:16:18,705
(First: Kim Kyu Nyeon)

1767
01:16:20,474 --> 01:16:22,115
The one in white is good.

1768
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:27,644
That looks amazing.

1769
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:35,325
He dances so tastefully.

1770
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:36,755
(His teacher feels proud of him.)

1771
01:16:37,695 --> 01:16:38,764
He's not bad.

1772
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:43,394
Kyu Nyeon's dance looks too light.

1773
01:16:44,335 --> 01:16:46,603
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

1774
01:16:46,604 --> 01:16:48,204
(Perfect ending)

1775
01:16:48,205 --> 01:16:49,774
The last pose is nice.

1776
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:52,504
I can't tell who will win.

1777
01:16:52,505 --> 01:16:53,544
(Korean Dance Group 3's 1st performance is over.)

1778
01:16:53,545 --> 01:16:54,804
I saw some potential.

1779
01:16:57,144 --> 01:17:00,084
- Moo Gan did better than I thought. - Really?

1780
01:17:00,085 --> 01:17:02,114
(Calm)

1781
01:17:02,115 --> 01:17:04,014
- His dancing was weak. - I agree.

1782
01:17:04,085 --> 01:17:06,883
Compared to him, Moo Gan danced better.

1783
01:17:06,884 --> 01:17:09,553
- He didn't catch my attention. - Mine either.

1784
01:17:09,554 --> 01:17:13,063
During the second half,

1785
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:14,393
he was a little...

1786
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:15,894
He should be demoted.

1787
01:17:16,234 --> 01:17:17,734
Korean Dance Group Three.

1788
01:17:17,934 --> 01:17:20,905
Promotion and demotion evaluation process will begin.

1789
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:23,205
Won't it be Moo Gan?

1790
01:17:23,674 --> 01:17:25,803
The dancer promoted in the Second Class.

1791
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:27,144
(Which Second Class dancer will get promoted?)

1792
01:17:27,474 --> 01:17:29,143
It's Dancer Ki Moo Gan.

1793
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,944
(He made it.)

1794
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:32,014
That's insane.

1795
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:36,214
Due to Ki Moo Gan's promotion from the Second Class,

1796
01:17:36,215 --> 01:17:37,813
which dancer from the First Class...

1797
01:17:37,814 --> 01:17:40,054
will be demoted?

1798
01:17:40,554 --> 01:17:41,594
Who will it be?

1799
01:17:42,755 --> 01:17:44,455
How did I do? Did I do well?

1800
01:17:45,825 --> 01:17:46,865
Something felt off.

1801
01:17:48,234 --> 01:17:50,495
The dancer demoted in the First Class is...

1802
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:53,665
Kim Kyu Nyeon.

1803
01:17:55,734 --> 01:17:56,905
Goodness.

1804
01:17:57,474 --> 01:17:58,905
He can be promoted again.

1805
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:04,214
Second Class Ki Moo Gan and First Class Kim Kyu Nyeon,

1806
01:18:04,215 --> 01:18:05,644
please move positions.

1807
01:18:08,715 --> 01:18:11,184
Ki Moo Gan, how do you feel about your position now?

1808
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:14,354
It feels like I've found my place.

1809
01:18:15,394 --> 01:18:17,494
(Controlling himself)

1810
01:18:17,495 --> 01:18:19,524
(Everyone is shocked.)

1811
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:23,294
It feels like you've found your place?

1812
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:25,633
- Yes. - Then will you do much better...

1813
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,204
from now on?

1814
01:18:27,205 --> 01:18:29,304
I will have to do better.

1815
01:18:29,674 --> 01:18:31,745
Yes, we look forward to it.

1816
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:35,313
As expected, he's very unusual.

1817
01:18:35,314 --> 01:18:37,715
I got used to it now.

1818
01:18:38,344 --> 01:18:40,984
Korean Dance Group Three's Class Movement Evaluations...

1819
01:18:41,415 --> 01:18:43,983
will continue without further change.

1820
01:18:43,984 --> 01:18:45,023
(Expecting a lot of fun)

1821
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:46,053
"Without further change?"

1822
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,455
We'll take a look one more time.

1823
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:50,394
I felt very relieved.

1824
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:51,625
It was a bummer.

1825
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:54,933
Let's take our first position.

1826
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:57,535
I had to move back up.

1827
01:18:58,365 --> 01:19:00,064
"Let's make up for it today."

1828
01:19:00,465 --> 01:19:01,705
That's all I thought about.

1829
01:19:02,974 --> 01:19:05,375
Music, start.

1830
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:09,814
Three, two, one. Go.

1831
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:19,625
He's good.

1832
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:21,955
He's smiling.

1833
01:19:22,495 --> 01:19:23,825
I just got goosebumps.

1834
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:32,835
Nice dancer.

1835
01:19:34,264 --> 01:19:37,274
- Kyu Nyeon changed. - He did.

1836
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:38,644
Go, Kyu Nyeon.

1837
01:19:42,814 --> 01:19:44,144
Hyo Joon's lines are upright.

1838
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,483
- He's calm. - He's good.

1839
01:19:47,484 --> 01:19:48,484
(He loves it.)

1840
01:19:50,554 --> 01:19:51,554
(What was that facial expression?)

1841
01:19:54,024 --> 01:19:55,024
Cheol Woo did a good job.

1842
01:19:55,655 --> 01:19:56,655
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

1843
01:19:56,656 --> 01:19:57,995
The last pose is amazing.

1844
01:19:58,524 --> 01:19:59,964
(Korean Dance Group 3's 2nd performance is over.)

1845
01:19:59,965 --> 01:20:01,093
Moo Gan nailed it.

1846
01:20:01,094 --> 01:20:03,064
Kyu Nyeon danced with determination.

1847
01:20:03,995 --> 01:20:05,234
This is difficult.

1848
01:20:05,905 --> 01:20:07,803
Didn't he stand out as well?

1849
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:09,505
- Cheol Woo? - He has good energy.

1850
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:14,705
(Park Cheol Woo showed explosive energy.)

1851
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,144
They must have practiced a lot.

1852
01:20:17,615 --> 01:20:19,144
It's so hard to decide for this group.

1853
01:20:19,585 --> 01:20:21,245
(Closing his eyes tightly)

1854
01:20:21,585 --> 01:20:23,813
- Matthew keeps talking about him. - Yes.

1855
01:20:23,814 --> 01:20:26,053
- Kim Hyo Joon? - He's very trustworthy.

1856
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,085
Yes.

1857
01:20:27,224 --> 01:20:28,284
His lines are clean, but...

1858
01:20:28,285 --> 01:20:30,324
- His dancing is generic. - It doesn't change much.

1859
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:35,094
(Kim Hyo Joon showed the standard choreography in every round.)

1860
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:36,634
It's neck-and-neck.

1861
01:20:36,995 --> 01:20:38,264
Shall we take another look?

1862
01:20:38,535 --> 01:20:40,365
- Let's just watch the four. - That sounds good.

1863
01:20:40,905 --> 01:20:42,034
(Her judge mode is on.)

1864
01:20:42,035 --> 01:20:44,973
We'd like to take another look.

1865
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,005
(Surprised)

1866
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:49,674
- We'll watch only these four. - Gosh.

1867
01:20:49,974 --> 01:20:52,014
Ki Moo Gan, Kim Hyo Joon,

1868
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:57,085
Park Cheol Woo, and Kim Kyu Nyeon will dance again.

1869
01:20:57,655 --> 01:20:59,755
Am I not showing them enough right now?

1870
01:21:00,724 --> 01:21:02,394
I had gotten my hopes up, but...

1871
01:21:02,854 --> 01:21:04,594
This is where the final decision will be made.

1872
01:21:04,924 --> 01:21:07,023
I could even aim for First Class if I'm lucky.

1873
01:21:07,024 --> 01:21:10,035
The rest of you, Jang Sung Bum, Baek Sang Ha,

1874
01:21:10,535 --> 01:21:13,934
Bang Seong Hyun, and Kim Min Su are Under Class.

1875
01:21:15,234 --> 01:21:17,374
Hey, then one of these guys is an Under Class.

1876
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,544
(1 of these 4 will become an Under Class.)

1877
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:21,843
Kim Hyo Joon didn't falter at all.

1878
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:26,183
It's great that you've maintained the same level until now,

1879
01:21:26,184 --> 01:21:28,144
but you don't have that big punch.

1880
01:21:28,344 --> 01:21:30,915
I wish you could have some spice to your dance.

1881
01:21:31,155 --> 01:21:33,383
Yes, please.

1882
01:21:33,384 --> 01:21:36,495
- Please. - Among these four unique dancers,

1883
01:21:36,854 --> 01:21:38,564
we'd like to see one big charming punch from you.

1884
01:21:39,665 --> 01:21:41,523
I could lose my First Class.

1885
01:21:41,524 --> 01:21:42,734
What do I do?

1886
01:21:44,064 --> 01:21:45,964
If I slip up, I could go to Under Class.

1887
01:21:45,965 --> 01:21:47,205
It's time I show them.

1888
01:21:47,564 --> 01:21:49,375
Let's hang in there just once more until the end.

1889
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,905
I have to go up to First Class, no matter what.

1890
01:21:52,144 --> 01:21:53,174
Music,

1891
01:21:54,144 --> 01:21:55,144
start.

1892
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:57,844
Three, two, one.

1893
01:21:58,445 --> 01:21:59,445
Go.

1894
01:21:59,446 --> 01:22:02,155
(Korean Dance Class Battle)

1895
01:22:07,184 --> 01:22:08,384
(This is it.)

1896
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,325
I love Moo Gan's gestures.

1897
01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:21,734
(Giggling)

1898
01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:24,634
That's awesome. You saw how much he controlled the dynamics, right?

1899
01:22:33,545 --> 01:22:34,615
Nice and neat.

1900
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:39,155
I like Park Cheol Woo's facial expressions.

1901
01:22:43,524 --> 01:22:46,964
(Korean Dance Group 3's final evaluation performance ends.)

1902
01:22:46,965 --> 01:22:48,194
(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

1903
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:49,233
They're all so good.

1904
01:22:49,234 --> 01:22:52,103
(The final 4 performed in their own style.)

1905
01:22:52,104 --> 01:22:53,205
That was entertaining.

1906
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:54,434
That's awesome.

1907
01:22:55,274 --> 01:22:58,545
He changed his direction to moving slightly differently to the beat.

1908
01:22:58,674 --> 01:22:59,705
He elongated the beat.

1909
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,574
(Kim Hyo Joon drew people's attention...)

1910
01:23:01,575 --> 01:23:02,774
(by controlling the dynamics perfectly.)

1911
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:05,585
That had a good effect.

1912
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,684
Hyo Joon wasn't that bad.

1913
01:23:08,955 --> 01:23:11,114
I think Ki Moo Gan was...

1914
01:23:11,115 --> 01:23:13,785
He has great talent and all that.

1915
01:23:13,854 --> 01:23:16,324
And in Hyo Joon's case, he doesn't falter.

1916
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:19,864
I think he could be a stable lead in a performance.

1917
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:21,795
- He is very stable. - He is.

1918
01:23:21,894 --> 01:23:23,233
And Kim Kyu Nyeon...

1919
01:23:23,234 --> 01:23:25,405
isn't someone who should have gone down to Second Class.

1920
01:23:25,535 --> 01:23:27,234
- That's why I'm like... - It's confusing.

1921
01:23:28,934 --> 01:23:30,035
They're so serious.

1922
01:23:30,835 --> 01:23:32,745
I don't know who will become First Class in this group.

1923
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:35,715
We will now reveal the final classes.

1924
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:39,884
Firstly, among Ki Moo Gan, Park Cheol Woo

1925
01:23:39,984 --> 01:23:42,683
Kim Kyu Nyeon, and Kim Hyo Joon,

1926
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,014
who will become the Under Class dancer?

1927
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:49,295
It's Dancer Park Cheol Woo. Good job.

1928
01:23:50,094 --> 01:23:51,194
(Disappointed)

1929
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:52,195
(You worked so hard.)

1930
01:23:52,196 --> 01:23:53,365
(You did well.)

1931
01:23:53,965 --> 01:23:57,094
Next, among the three dancers, Ki Moo Gan, Kim Hyo Joon,

1932
01:23:57,264 --> 01:24:00,264
and Kim Kyu Nyeon, 1 will become 1st Class,

1933
01:24:00,564 --> 01:24:02,405
and 2 will become 2nd Class.

1934
01:24:03,134 --> 01:24:05,075
I'm confident I can become 1st out of the 3.

1935
01:24:05,304 --> 01:24:07,774
I can't become Second.

1936
01:24:08,474 --> 01:24:10,344
Please.

1937
01:24:10,715 --> 01:24:14,844
We'll reveal the dancer who has been confirmed as Second Class.

1938
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:17,014
Hyo Joon?

1939
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:18,625
I don't know.

1940
01:24:18,825 --> 01:24:20,523
(Who will be 2nd Class among these 3?)

1941
01:24:20,524 --> 01:24:22,024
(Group 3's results are hard to predict.)

1942
01:24:22,655 --> 01:24:24,325
It's Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon.

1943
01:24:24,594 --> 01:24:29,633
(Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon is confirmed as 2nd Class from Group 3.)

1944
01:24:29,634 --> 01:24:32,364
(The Korean dancers applaud Kim Kyu Nyeon who did his best.)

1945
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:33,763
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon has been...

1946
01:24:33,764 --> 01:24:36,834
demoted from 1st to 2nd Class.

1947
01:24:36,835 --> 01:24:38,945
I thought, "I'm still lacking in many ways."

1948
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:40,205
Still...

1949
01:24:40,974 --> 01:24:42,115
I lost but did my best.

1950
01:24:42,814 --> 01:24:47,745
The remaining two. Between Ki Moo Gan and Kim Hyo Joon...

1951
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:51,254
(There can only be 1 who gets 1st Class.)

1952
01:24:51,255 --> 01:24:54,155
The 1st Class dancer from Korean Dance Group 3 is...

1953
01:24:54,955 --> 01:24:56,625
I think Moo Gan will be First.

1954
01:24:57,825 --> 01:25:00,094
I think Hyo Joon could be First.

1955
01:25:00,264 --> 01:25:02,865
Which dancer will become First Class?

1956
01:25:05,405 --> 01:25:06,604
I'm looking forward to becoming First Class.

1957
01:25:08,005 --> 01:25:10,574
(All-rounder Kim Hyo Joon showed stable talent...)

1958
01:25:10,575 --> 01:25:13,474
(and excellent expression.)

1959
01:25:14,745 --> 01:25:16,274
Let's get back to becoming First Class.

1960
01:25:17,314 --> 01:25:23,455
(Ki Moo Gan drew people's attention with his unique charm and aura.)

1961
01:25:25,184 --> 01:25:26,824
The First Class dancer is...

1962
01:25:26,825 --> 01:25:28,424
(Who will take the top spot in the fierce Class Battle?)

1963
01:25:29,054 --> 01:25:30,155
Who will it be?

1964
01:25:31,695 --> 01:25:33,093
It's Dancer Ki Moo Gan.

1965
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:36,994
(Dancer Ki Moo Gan is confirmed as Group 3's 1st Class.)

1966
01:25:36,995 --> 01:25:37,995
Oh, my!

1967
01:25:38,535 --> 01:25:40,904
(A round of applause)

1968
01:25:40,905 --> 01:25:43,905
Indeed, Moo Gan was a strong contender.

1969
01:25:44,734 --> 01:25:46,545
(Everyone applauds the dancers who showed an impressive competition.)

1970
01:25:47,545 --> 01:25:48,915
(Choking up)

1971
01:25:49,174 --> 01:25:52,814
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon has been demoted to Second Class.

1972
01:25:53,884 --> 01:25:55,714
I felt a mix of emotions,

1973
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:56,955
but I thought I should do better next time.

1974
01:25:57,854 --> 01:26:01,024
I'm relieved because I think I did well by getting back to First Class.

1975
01:26:01,384 --> 01:26:03,223
No matter what I end up doing,

1976
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,223
I have to do well now.

1977
01:26:05,224 --> 01:26:07,893
Because now, I have to make people believe this.

1978
01:26:07,894 --> 01:26:09,764
I'll get my head on straight.

1979
01:26:11,394 --> 01:26:12,965
(Korean Dance Final Classes)

1980
01:26:14,205 --> 01:26:16,074
(Taking place at a huge palace)

1981
01:26:16,075 --> 01:26:17,875
(It's the shoot of the Korean Dance Film.)

1982
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:19,174
(It's raining so much.)

1983
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:20,444
(They face obstacles from the beginning.)

1984
01:26:20,445 --> 01:26:21,643
(Running away)

1985
01:26:21,644 --> 01:26:22,644
(The scene of the shoot seems to be a ritual for rain.)

1986
01:26:23,415 --> 01:26:24,914
(And the main lead role even makes a mistake.)

1987
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:25,983
(Goodness)

1988
01:26:25,984 --> 01:26:27,044
(Doubting his eyes)

1989
01:26:27,045 --> 01:26:28,284
(The Dance Film for Korean dance is in crisis.)

1990
01:26:28,285 --> 01:26:30,155
(How will it turn out?)

1991
01:26:30,884 --> 01:26:33,383
(Stage Fighter)

1992
01:26:33,384 --> 01:26:35,593
(The next day, STF Dance Studio)

1993
01:26:35,594 --> 01:26:37,393
(The ballerinos' classes have been changed after the Class Battle.)

1994
01:26:37,394 --> 01:26:39,023
(Jung Sung Wook was promoted from 2nd to 1st.)

1995
01:26:39,024 --> 01:26:40,923
(Shin Min Kwon and Kim Yu Chan were demoted from 1st to 2nd.)

1996
01:26:40,924 --> 01:26:42,534
(Kim Tae Seok was demoted from First to Under.)

1997
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:45,064
How do you feel? Tell us what it feels like to be a First.

1998
01:26:45,804 --> 01:26:47,335
I feel shy.

1999
01:26:48,535 --> 01:26:50,374
Honestly, it felt good.

2000
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:52,875
I think it shined more.

2001
01:26:53,104 --> 01:26:55,745
There's really no safety net for when you come down.

2002
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:58,115
I feel totally awful.

2003
01:26:58,915 --> 01:27:00,414
- Yu Chan, - Yes?

2004
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:02,384
- how do you feel? - I just let him have my spot once.

2005
01:27:03,155 --> 01:27:04,383
You let him have your spot?

2006
01:27:04,384 --> 01:27:05,415
(Feeling uncomfortable)

2007
01:27:05,655 --> 01:27:08,085
I took the First Class in the end. It's mine.

2008
01:27:08,795 --> 01:27:10,654
(The practice room is silent except for the sound of breathing.)

2009
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:12,494
(Dancers Kim Jong Cheol and Ki Moo Gan were promoted to First Class.)

2010
01:27:12,495 --> 01:27:15,195
(Dancer Choi Ho Jong kept his First Class position.)

2011
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,234
Aren't we being too quiet?

2012
01:27:17,995 --> 01:27:20,934
Actually, the atmosphere felt very heavy.

2013
01:27:21,134 --> 01:27:22,674
I felt rather anxious.

2014
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:26,745
The concept of classes felt painful to me.

2015
01:27:27,945 --> 01:27:29,473
(Contemporary dance had the most changes in First Class.)

2016
01:27:29,474 --> 01:27:32,143
(Dancers Jung Hye Seong and Kim Hyun Ho were promoted to First.)

2017
01:27:32,144 --> 01:27:33,714
(Dancers Yang Seong Yun, Go Dong Hoon, and Jang June Hyuk...)

2018
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:34,744
(were demoted from First to Under Class.)

2019
01:27:34,745 --> 01:27:37,853
Just wait and see what happens if the 1st and 2nd Classes do badly.

2020
01:27:37,854 --> 01:27:39,155
I'll come at you with my fangs.

2021
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,224
My life is at the bottom anyway.

2022
01:27:41,955 --> 01:27:43,524
I can just start over now.

2023
01:27:44,424 --> 01:27:46,564
I should become the First of the Firsts now.

2024
01:27:50,035 --> 01:27:51,063
What's this?

2025
01:27:51,064 --> 01:27:52,763
(What is it, all of a sudden?)

2026
01:27:52,764 --> 01:27:55,734
Hello, I'm Kang Daniel, the MC of Stage Fighter.

2027
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:57,103
Through the Class Battle,

2028
01:27:57,104 --> 01:27:59,245
your classes have been decided.

2029
01:27:59,705 --> 01:28:03,714
However, even if you have the same roles in the same performance,

2030
01:28:03,715 --> 01:28:06,884
not everyone can have the same screen time or level of importance.

2031
01:28:07,085 --> 01:28:08,445
Oh, my gosh.

2032
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:11,085
There isn't a single moment of rest.

2033
01:28:11,715 --> 01:28:14,223
Some lead roles become main lead roles,

2034
01:28:14,224 --> 01:28:16,495
the position where they can get the most attention.

2035
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,825
And some lead roles will become...

2036
01:28:19,024 --> 01:28:20,825
sub lead roles who support the main lead roles.

2037
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,965
They're dividing the Firsts again.

2038
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:24,734
They're dividing us again.

2039
01:28:24,835 --> 01:28:26,905
Darn it. What do we do?

2040
01:28:27,064 --> 01:28:30,504
I thought that it would obviously be hard for three lead roles...

2041
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:32,745
to have the same level of importance.

2042
01:28:33,205 --> 01:28:34,974
And there are main supporting roles...

2043
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:37,945
and sub supporting roles to support them.

2044
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:39,644
This is a war.

2045
01:28:40,115 --> 01:28:42,614
I fought hard to get this Second Class position.

2046
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:45,255
It's another competition. An endless competition.

2047
01:28:45,585 --> 01:28:49,554
Now, we'll reveal the casting board for the Korean Dance Film.

2048
01:28:50,255 --> 01:28:51,324
(The King's Wish: Reign of Peace)

2049
01:28:51,325 --> 01:28:52,393
(In a world without worries, the king calls the spirits...)

2050
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:53,464
(of past kings for a peaceful nation.)

2051
01:28:53,465 --> 01:28:54,495
(A reverent rite is held along with a performance.)

2052
01:28:55,024 --> 01:28:56,134
The choreographer...

2053
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:58,035
Choi Ho Jong.

2054
01:28:58,465 --> 01:29:01,965
(Lead roles, Supporting roles, Ensemble)

2055
01:29:02,434 --> 01:29:03,535
There's a King?

2056
01:29:04,234 --> 01:29:05,335
You should become the King.

2057
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:06,674
I'd love to get that role.

2058
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,575
It's either me or him. Ho Jong.

2059
01:29:08,915 --> 01:29:11,844
As long as I don't make mistakes, I'm confident I can get it.

2060
01:29:12,045 --> 01:29:13,444
Hey, for the supporting roles,

2061
01:29:13,445 --> 01:29:15,445
there are only two main supporting roles. Everyone else is a sub.

2062
01:29:15,655 --> 01:29:16,655
- Really? - Yes.

2063
01:29:16,656 --> 01:29:18,853
So we have to get the main roles. Even more so for supporting roles.

2064
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,524
I thought I must get the main supporting role, no matter what.

2065
01:29:21,684 --> 01:29:24,723
The 3 lead dancers will choose the 2 supporting dancers they want.

2066
01:29:24,724 --> 01:29:26,365
You will audition together.

2067
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:29,094
A supporting dancer may be chosen multiple times by lead dancers.

2068
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:31,695
You have as many chances to audition as you were chosen.

2069
01:29:32,264 --> 01:29:34,465
The lead dancers can choose the supporting dancers.

2070
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:37,004
So, we have to be chosen by the lead dancers?

2071
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,304
- Then, we get to audition? - Right.

2072
01:29:40,144 --> 01:29:41,204
(The lead dancers choose...)

2073
01:29:41,205 --> 01:29:42,773
(two supporting dancers to audition with.)

2074
01:29:42,774 --> 01:29:46,313
(The people who will be auditioning with me are...)

2075
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:48,843
(The supporting roles)

2076
01:29:48,844 --> 01:29:50,915
(I will audition with this dancer.)

2077
01:29:51,155 --> 01:29:52,854
(It hurt my pride.)

2078
01:29:53,524 --> 01:29:56,455
If I'm a supporting dancer and get zero votes, I might go crazy.

2079
01:29:56,755 --> 01:29:59,495
It will be very important to be chosen by someone.

2080
01:29:59,965 --> 01:30:04,134
Still, wouldn't at least one person choose me?

2081
01:30:04,634 --> 01:30:07,804
Here is how the audition will go for the main lead roles.

2082
01:30:08,665 --> 01:30:11,434
(I will have 3 loyal vassals.)

2083
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:13,673
(The lead dancer decides on the formation of the ensemble.)

2084
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:14,744
(There is no audition for the ensemble.)

2085
01:30:14,745 --> 01:30:16,075
(Please do your best to practice for the main lead role's audition.)

2086
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:17,414
That breaks my heart.

2087
01:30:17,415 --> 01:30:20,444
I felt that not even having a chance to audition...

2088
01:30:20,445 --> 01:30:22,383
was the role of the ensemble.

2089
01:30:22,384 --> 01:30:24,014
The different treatment for each class?

2090
01:30:24,215 --> 01:30:25,554
That's so harsh.

2091
01:30:26,024 --> 01:30:29,593
(The Under Class doesn't even get a chance to audition.)

2092
01:30:29,594 --> 01:30:30,894
I didn't become a First.

2093
01:30:31,255 --> 01:30:32,764
I should get the best part here at least.

2094
01:30:33,064 --> 01:30:35,965
I just thought that I should do my best.

2095
01:30:36,894 --> 01:30:40,234
(The First Class is fighting over the main lead role.)

2096
01:30:40,564 --> 01:30:42,473
(The 2nd Class needs to be chosen by the 1st Class...)

2097
01:30:42,474 --> 01:30:43,734
(to get the main supporting role.)

2098
01:30:43,974 --> 01:30:46,744
(How will the Casting Audition go for the Korean Dance Film?)

2099
01:30:46,745 --> 01:30:48,173
(Korean Dance Film 1st Class, lead role practice room)

2100
01:30:48,174 --> 01:30:49,473
(Lead role practice room)

2101
01:30:49,474 --> 01:30:50,714
(The 3 main lead role candidates gather together...)

2102
01:30:50,715 --> 01:30:51,774
(after the Casting Audition's reveal.)

2103
01:30:52,174 --> 01:30:55,785
The only person who's on my radar is Ho Jong.

2104
01:30:55,984 --> 01:30:58,115
It's either me or him for the main lead role.

2105
01:30:58,155 --> 01:30:59,224
I'm hoping it will be me.

2106
01:31:00,884 --> 01:31:03,494
(Choi Ho Jong begins forming the ensemble's movement first.)

2107
01:31:03,495 --> 01:31:05,924
I will have three loyal vassals.

2108
01:31:06,165 --> 01:31:07,724
Simple is best.

2109
01:31:08,524 --> 01:31:11,995
I'm confident about coming up with movements for a choreography.

2110
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,575
(Meanwhile, Kim Jong Cheol keeps contemplating it.)

2111
01:31:17,234 --> 01:31:18,674
Gosh, how should I do this?

2112
01:31:19,905 --> 01:31:20,974
Like this?

2113
01:31:21,905 --> 01:31:23,813
The mission where we had to change the movements...

2114
01:31:23,814 --> 01:31:25,744
in the scene with 15 ensemble members...

2115
01:31:25,745 --> 01:31:27,945
made me feel really pressured.

2116
01:31:28,684 --> 01:31:31,484
I think you should do better in forming the ensemble's choreography.

2117
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:35,354
Moo Gan and Ho Jong have experience in choreographing.

2118
01:31:35,655 --> 01:31:38,594
So, I think you should think about that more.

2119
01:31:39,224 --> 01:31:41,924
I've never handled this many people before,

2120
01:31:42,165 --> 01:31:45,434
and I don't have experience in choreographing.

2121
01:31:45,695 --> 01:31:48,334
All I could think was, "What will I do?"

2122
01:31:48,335 --> 01:31:50,905
(Kim Jong Cheol)

2123
01:31:51,575 --> 01:31:52,705
All right, guys.

2124
01:31:52,945 --> 01:31:54,844
This, and here.

2125
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:57,474
Come back, and go down like this.

2126
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,813
How far does the right hand go up?

2127
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:02,784
- Let's go as high as the temple. - The temple.

2128
01:32:02,785 --> 01:32:04,115
Go to the temple.

2129
01:32:05,215 --> 01:32:06,483
(The first main lead role candidate, Choi Ho Jong, appears.)

2130
01:32:06,484 --> 01:32:08,125
- Hey. - Hey.

2131
01:32:08,724 --> 01:32:09,854
Come on.

2132
01:32:10,655 --> 01:32:11,724
The lead role.

2133
01:32:12,424 --> 01:32:13,824
(Nervous)

2134
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:15,865
I just want to make things simple.

2135
01:32:16,434 --> 01:32:18,465
At first, I want to start in a V formation.

2136
01:32:18,934 --> 01:32:21,803
And there is one formation change.

2137
01:32:21,804 --> 01:32:23,634
So, you will stand in two parallel lines like this.

2138
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:25,874
The three of you here...

2139
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:28,274
are the tallest, I believe. So, I took you out.

2140
01:32:28,774 --> 01:32:31,014
- How tall are you? - I'm 194cm.

2141
01:32:31,715 --> 01:32:33,084
(In disbelief)

2142
01:32:33,085 --> 01:32:35,483
I will go back and forth,

2143
01:32:35,484 --> 01:32:37,354
and we'll keep this formation.

2144
01:32:37,455 --> 01:32:40,424
I will make contact with each of you.

2145
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:42,655
This formation will let me enjoy the entire space.

2146
01:32:43,795 --> 01:32:46,125
That's it for formation changes. It's so easy, right?

2147
01:32:46,724 --> 01:32:48,724
(They totally understand.)

2148
01:32:48,924 --> 01:32:50,365
- That's good. - Nice.

2149
01:32:51,134 --> 01:32:52,263
It was very effective.

2150
01:32:52,264 --> 01:32:53,804
The formation was exactly for the King.

2151
01:32:53,905 --> 01:32:56,734
It's simple, but the formation was symbolic

2152
01:32:56,934 --> 01:32:58,834
You can use both hands too.

2153
01:32:58,835 --> 01:33:02,144
I thought he had lots of experience in teaching.

2154
01:33:02,274 --> 01:33:03,644
Don't loosen up too much.

2155
01:33:03,774 --> 01:33:05,215
I think it would be great if we were in sync.

2156
01:33:05,344 --> 01:33:06,415
Please have a seat.

2157
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:09,684
I think he's a choreographer who's calm and considerate.

2158
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,715
That's so nicely in sync.

2159
01:33:12,255 --> 01:33:13,853
(Perfectly in sync)

2160
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:15,754
(Nice!)

2161
01:33:15,755 --> 01:33:16,795
That's it!

2162
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,954
- Good work, everyone. - Good work!

2163
01:33:18,955 --> 01:33:20,494
(Main lead candidate Choi Ho Jong is done teaching his formation.)

2164
01:33:20,495 --> 01:33:21,594
That was impressive.

2165
01:33:21,965 --> 01:33:23,764
Since this is a group dance,

2166
01:33:23,865 --> 01:33:26,165
it would be best to refrain from being too unique.

2167
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,274
I'm afraid of the next people. How will they do things?

2168
01:33:30,535 --> 01:33:32,434
(The second main lead role candidate, Ki Moo Gan, appears.)

2169
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:34,144
(Gulping)

2170
01:33:35,045 --> 01:33:36,474
That formation looks complicated.

2171
01:33:36,875 --> 01:33:38,615
Did Ho Jong have a lot of stuff for his formation?

2172
01:33:39,245 --> 01:33:41,115
- It was pretty simple, right? - Yes.

2173
01:33:41,945 --> 01:33:42,984
(Grinning)

2174
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:44,455
First of all,

2175
01:33:44,814 --> 01:33:47,585
I'll be in the middle, and you'll be along the same line...

2176
01:33:48,184 --> 01:33:49,554
as me.

2177
01:33:49,755 --> 01:33:50,755
It's a charging formation.

2178
01:33:51,424 --> 01:33:54,295
There will only be one formation change.

2179
01:33:54,924 --> 01:33:56,233
They'll come out a little bit here.

2180
01:33:56,234 --> 01:33:58,093
(The formation will change so that the hidden dancers move a little.)

2181
01:33:58,094 --> 01:33:59,134
To become like this.

2182
01:33:59,665 --> 01:34:01,264
- It's not that complicated, right? - Is that it?

2183
01:34:01,804 --> 01:34:02,875
Yes.

2184
01:34:03,474 --> 01:34:04,504
A round of applause for now.

2185
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:06,473
(The ensemble is satisfied with the simple formation.)

2186
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,314
It would allow everyone to be seen as much as possible.

2187
01:34:09,674 --> 01:34:11,513
I liked it because the formation spread out...

2188
01:34:11,514 --> 01:34:14,085
so no one would feel disappointed.

2189
01:34:14,484 --> 01:34:15,514
It will let everyone be seen.

2190
01:34:16,354 --> 01:34:17,455
We're all the lead roles.

2191
01:34:17,814 --> 01:34:18,814
This would look really cool.

2192
01:34:20,884 --> 01:34:22,023
(His gaze suddenly changes.)

2193
01:34:22,024 --> 01:34:25,054
(Ki Moo Gan checks the dance after putting people in place.)

2194
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,165
(Tilting his head)

2195
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,465
- Don't go out too much. - Oh, okay.

2196
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:31,334
Think of it as your chest...

2197
01:34:31,335 --> 01:34:32,364
- overlapping with his. - Oh, just the chest.

2198
01:34:32,365 --> 01:34:34,234
- I think that's the gap I want. - Okay.

2199
01:34:34,505 --> 01:34:35,704
- You're on the same line. - Oh, okay.

2200
01:34:35,705 --> 01:34:36,705
In a triangle, like this.

2201
01:34:36,706 --> 01:34:39,804
I think Moo Gan is the type who makes his demands clearly.

2202
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,545
We could feel the details coming together ourselves.

2203
01:34:43,715 --> 01:34:45,774
- You must do well on the outside. - Yes, okay.

2204
01:34:46,215 --> 01:34:47,884
- You must do well here. - Okay.

2205
01:34:48,644 --> 01:34:51,755
Moo Gan seems to fit the role of the King.

2206
01:34:51,854 --> 01:34:53,884
He seems like either Yeonsangun or Gwanghaegun.

2207
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:56,154
I think everyone tried a little harder...

2208
01:34:56,155 --> 01:34:57,955
to make Moo Gan stand out.

2209
01:35:01,024 --> 01:35:02,933
(The second candidate, Ki Moo Gan, is done teaching his formation.)

2210
01:35:02,934 --> 01:35:03,995
You can do it.

2211
01:35:04,835 --> 01:35:07,133
Both Ho Jong and Moo Gan...

2212
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:10,434
handled the King's character well with their own unique points.

2213
01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:14,804
- Hello. - Here's our youngest lead dancer.

2214
01:35:15,545 --> 01:35:16,575
Why does he have two boards?

2215
01:35:16,774 --> 01:35:18,314
I feel like this will be the toughest.

2216
01:35:18,545 --> 01:35:19,615
The youngest lead dancer has some spirit.

2217
01:35:20,184 --> 01:35:22,983
We'll start with this formation here...

2218
01:35:22,984 --> 01:35:26,354
and do the chorus in straight lines like this.

2219
01:35:28,054 --> 01:35:29,724
I think I'll have to see the size.

2220
01:35:30,195 --> 01:35:31,894
Why doesn't it feel like a circle?

2221
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:34,465
- How about we do 1.5 spaces here? - Or...

2222
01:35:34,724 --> 01:35:36,894
- Should we move apart? - In a round shape...

2223
01:35:37,434 --> 01:35:40,064
You can get into a straight line here.

2224
01:35:40,264 --> 01:35:42,773
- So we kick and go in? - It's like...

2225
01:35:42,774 --> 01:35:45,334
I think it'll work if you bow as much as you can...

2226
01:35:45,335 --> 01:35:47,045
and twist like this.

2227
01:35:47,344 --> 01:35:48,505
(They try it as he explained.)

2228
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:50,415
Oh, but that's tough.

2229
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:53,945
He should've made his directions clear since we were changing big.

2230
01:35:54,045 --> 01:35:56,084
"We're going this way, but how do we get there?"

2231
01:35:56,085 --> 01:35:59,585
"I'm not sure about the movement." Since that thought kept coming up,

2232
01:35:59,684 --> 01:36:02,224
I felt like he hadn't prepared that much.

2233
01:36:02,655 --> 01:36:04,223
One more time. I'm really sorry.

2234
01:36:04,224 --> 01:36:06,263
Due to my inexperience,

2235
01:36:06,264 --> 01:36:08,763
I feel like the teaching didn't go well.

2236
01:36:08,764 --> 01:36:10,365
I was really worried.

2237
01:36:12,394 --> 01:36:16,405
(Will Kim Jong Cheol's group performance be okay?)

2238
01:36:16,535 --> 01:36:18,374
(Korean Dance Film 2nd Class, Supporting role practice room)

2239
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:20,104
(Meanwhile, the 6 main supporting role candidates practice the dance.)

2240
01:36:20,344 --> 01:36:21,405
Is it winding?

2241
01:36:21,844 --> 01:36:23,344
Darn it. This is confusing.

2242
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:24,915
So it went like this?

2243
01:36:25,745 --> 01:36:28,585
It was actually very tough. It was really hard, but...

2244
01:36:29,455 --> 01:36:31,513
(They must memorize both the right and left choreographies.)

2245
01:36:31,514 --> 01:36:33,884
We have to memorize both sides. That's hard.

2246
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:35,285
It's tough.

2247
01:36:35,884 --> 01:36:38,893
- I'm in big trouble. - This isn't easy.

2248
01:36:38,894 --> 01:36:40,365
(Most are struggling to learn the choreography.)

2249
01:36:41,924 --> 01:36:45,394
(But Park Jun Woo continues with the dance without hesitation.)

2250
01:36:45,734 --> 01:36:47,704
There weren't many hard moves.

2251
01:36:47,705 --> 01:36:49,633
It'll just be a matter of memorizing.

2252
01:36:49,634 --> 01:36:51,705
It'll just be a battle of focus.

2253
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:55,343
Jun Woo, is this arm movement right? This hand is here, right? Or this?

2254
01:36:55,344 --> 01:36:56,844
- I think it's like this. - Okay.

2255
01:36:56,945 --> 01:36:59,513
Jun Woo learned the order...

2256
01:36:59,514 --> 01:37:01,545
pretty quickly and executed it.

2257
01:37:01,745 --> 01:37:03,115
Oh, I should learn this.

2258
01:37:03,755 --> 01:37:04,915
- Keep practicing with me. - Okay.

2259
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:07,654
- One, two, three... - Seven, eight.

2260
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:08,955
(The dance practice centers around Park Jun Woo.)

2261
01:37:09,255 --> 01:37:11,455
Seriously, why did they make it so complicated?

2262
01:37:11,924 --> 01:37:12,995
Go up.

2263
01:37:13,365 --> 01:37:14,424
What was after that?

2264
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:15,763
As I watched people during practice,

2265
01:37:15,764 --> 01:37:18,295
I became really wary of Jun Woo.

2266
01:37:19,094 --> 01:37:21,633
I thought I had a chance...

2267
01:37:21,634 --> 01:37:22,974
to become the main supporting role.

2268
01:37:23,405 --> 01:37:25,574
Well, I didn't become a First.

2269
01:37:25,575 --> 01:37:27,144
I should get the best part here, at least.

2270
01:37:29,174 --> 01:37:30,745
(The first candidate, Jong Cheol, came to pick supporting dancers.)

2271
01:37:30,974 --> 01:37:33,415
- The First is here! - He's here already? Hang on.

2272
01:37:34,085 --> 01:37:35,945
You're all sweating so much.

2273
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,284
(Sweating profusely)

2274
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:40,784
I must be chosen by the lead dancers...

2275
01:37:40,785 --> 01:37:42,524
to have a shot at being the main supporting dancer.

2276
01:37:42,795 --> 01:37:43,854
I was so nervous.

2277
01:37:44,354 --> 01:37:47,195
I'll watch you in pairs.

2278
01:37:50,835 --> 01:37:52,165
The first pair is...

2279
01:37:52,535 --> 01:37:54,365
Hyo Joon and Jun Woo.

2280
01:37:54,865 --> 01:37:57,104
The second is Sang Gil and Kyu Nyeon.

2281
01:37:57,274 --> 01:37:59,104
And Si Won and Tae Yoon will be the last.

2282
01:38:00,075 --> 01:38:01,104
Good luck.

2283
01:38:01,945 --> 01:38:04,375
- Incredible supporting dancers. - I feel good right now.

2284
01:38:04,844 --> 01:38:06,745
Hyo Joon is a pro,

2285
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:09,344
and I thought we could have a synergistic effect.

2286
01:38:10,285 --> 01:38:12,785
(The first pair is Kim Hyo Joon and Park Jun Woo.)

2287
01:38:15,655 --> 01:38:17,853
(Jun Woo's foot bumped into Hyo Joon's hand.)

2288
01:38:17,854 --> 01:38:19,625
(Startled)

2289
01:38:21,165 --> 01:38:22,864
That really put me off,

2290
01:38:22,865 --> 01:38:24,995
and I think I finished the rest of the dance in a daze.

2291
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:28,634
(I see.)

2292
01:38:30,274 --> 01:38:31,335
Are you okay?

2293
01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:34,575
(Kim Jong Cheol has an unsure look on his face.)

2294
01:38:35,104 --> 01:38:36,673
(Feeling disappointed)

2295
01:38:36,674 --> 01:38:37,715
It's okay.

2296
01:38:38,274 --> 01:38:39,483
(The next pair is Kim Kyu Nyeon and Kim Sang Gil.)

2297
01:38:39,484 --> 01:38:40,745
- Feel the vibe. - Okay.

2298
01:38:46,484 --> 01:38:47,924
(Staring)

2299
01:38:51,054 --> 01:38:52,865
(Perfectly in sync)

2300
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:54,465
(Impressed)

2301
01:38:56,695 --> 01:38:58,764
You were so perfectly in sync.

2302
01:38:59,195 --> 01:39:00,205
It was an honor.

2303
01:39:03,234 --> 01:39:05,634
(Forcing a smile)

2304
01:39:05,934 --> 01:39:07,804
(Kim Jong Cheol contemplates for quite a while.)

2305
01:39:08,144 --> 01:39:09,404
You can keep switching pairs and making us dance.

2306
01:39:09,405 --> 01:39:10,445
(Keep pairing us up differently.)

2307
01:39:10,974 --> 01:39:14,183
For now, I'd like to see Hyo Joon and Kyu Nyeon.

2308
01:39:14,184 --> 01:39:16,715
I want to see you two as a pair.

2309
01:39:16,814 --> 01:39:17,884
- Good luck for now. - Good luck.

2310
01:39:19,085 --> 01:39:20,125
- Let's do well together. - Yes.

2311
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:24,524
(Kim Hyo Joon and Kim Kyu Nyeon dance as a pair next.)

2312
01:39:25,724 --> 01:39:27,195
(Kim Hyo Joon avoids his foot and just lies down.)

2313
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:33,205
(Impressed)

2314
01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:38,705
- That was good. - They did so well just now.

2315
01:39:39,205 --> 01:39:40,545
They were so synchronized.

2316
01:39:41,674 --> 01:39:46,684
The two Seconds who will be auditioning with me are...

2317
01:39:47,745 --> 01:39:49,444
(Who will it be?)

2318
01:39:49,445 --> 01:39:52,085
I'll audition with Hyo Joon and Kyu Nyeon.

2319
01:39:52,514 --> 01:39:53,585
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2320
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:55,785
Let's practice a lot together.

2321
01:39:56,594 --> 01:39:58,495
We've got this. I'll show you.

2322
01:39:58,854 --> 01:39:59,924
(Nodding)

2323
01:40:00,264 --> 01:40:01,325
Let's practice.

2324
01:40:01,424 --> 01:40:04,134
I'll do everything I can.

2325
01:40:04,434 --> 01:40:07,304
I made a mistake, so I felt really disappointed.

2326
01:40:07,434 --> 01:40:10,134
I should get the part next time, no matter what.

2327
01:40:11,575 --> 01:40:13,274
(The second main lead role candidate Choi Ho Jong)

2328
01:40:13,545 --> 01:40:15,604
- We meet again. - This is insane.

2329
01:40:16,615 --> 01:40:17,814
Rather than synchronicity,

2330
01:40:18,174 --> 01:40:20,484
I'll look for uniqueness.

2331
01:40:21,045 --> 01:40:22,045
Let's show him.

2332
01:40:22,615 --> 01:40:25,785
I was waiting for Ho Jong's turn, and I was confident.

2333
01:40:26,554 --> 01:40:28,584
A pair with Sang Gil and Kyu Nyeon.

2334
01:40:28,585 --> 01:40:31,424
And Jun Woo and Si Won. I'll see these two pairs for now.

2335
01:40:32,524 --> 01:40:34,495
(First, it's Park Jun Woo and Kim Si Won.)

2336
01:40:43,274 --> 01:40:44,834
(Next, it's Kim Sang Gil and Kim Kyu Nyeon.)

2337
01:40:44,835 --> 01:40:46,304
- Let's do it together. - Okay.

2338
01:40:46,604 --> 01:40:47,604
Let's start.

2339
01:40:53,285 --> 01:40:54,343
(Glancing)

2340
01:40:54,344 --> 01:40:55,945
(A bright smile?)

2341
01:40:56,245 --> 01:40:58,715
They were unstable.

2342
01:41:00,024 --> 01:41:01,354
(Kim Sang Gil and Kim Kyu Nyeon's pair choreography ends.)

2343
01:41:03,094 --> 01:41:04,125
Good job.

2344
01:41:04,195 --> 01:41:05,255
Sang Gil's pretty good.

2345
01:41:06,465 --> 01:41:09,365
Those who will join the audition with me are...

2346
01:41:09,894 --> 01:41:12,133
Kim Sang Gil and Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2347
01:41:12,134 --> 01:41:13,535
(Choosing Kim Sang Gil and Kim Kyu Nyeon)

2348
01:41:14,865 --> 01:41:17,004
Should I say I felt rather restless?

2349
01:41:17,005 --> 01:41:19,005
What if I don't get chosen?

2350
01:41:19,174 --> 01:41:20,274
That was so much fun.

2351
01:41:21,304 --> 01:41:23,114
It was fun? I felt like dying.

2352
01:41:23,115 --> 01:41:25,014
Because you were chosen many times.

2353
01:41:25,974 --> 01:41:27,245
It's hard to do it even once.

2354
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:31,314
It hurt my pride since then.

2355
01:41:31,755 --> 01:41:33,155
I'll have to do my best.

2356
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:35,354
(The last lead role candidate, Ki Moo Gan, appears.)

2357
01:41:35,355 --> 01:41:37,594
- Hello. - Hello.

2358
01:41:37,825 --> 01:41:38,894
How is it?

2359
01:41:39,195 --> 01:41:40,223
It's tiring.

2360
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:41,264
(Tense)

2361
01:41:41,825 --> 01:41:44,835
Si Won and Hyo Joon should pair up.

2362
01:41:45,264 --> 01:41:47,704
Let me try between you two.

2363
01:41:47,705 --> 01:41:49,205
- Okay. - I haven't tried it yet, so...

2364
01:41:50,405 --> 01:41:53,405
(Ki Moo Gan practices with Kim Si Won and Kim Hyo Joon.)

2365
01:41:54,674 --> 01:41:55,674
Here.

2366
01:42:02,085 --> 01:42:03,354
(Turning)

2367
01:42:04,215 --> 01:42:06,585
(Did he like it?)

2368
01:42:07,585 --> 01:42:09,024
I think it's okay.

2369
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:13,524
I think we should go this way.

2370
01:42:14,165 --> 01:42:16,394
(Glancing)

2371
01:42:17,134 --> 01:42:18,134
It's a relief.

2372
01:42:18,335 --> 01:42:19,563
What do you mean?

2373
01:42:19,564 --> 01:42:21,434
It's not easy to do both.

2374
01:42:21,564 --> 01:42:23,133
Did you get selected once?

2375
01:42:23,134 --> 01:42:24,834
- Twice. Yes. - Twice?

2376
01:42:24,835 --> 01:42:26,843
- Is Kyu Nyeon good? - He's good.

2377
01:42:26,844 --> 01:42:28,643
It hurt my pride so much.

2378
01:42:28,644 --> 01:42:29,915
I couldn't hide it.

2379
01:42:30,174 --> 01:42:31,313
He'd select you.

2380
01:42:31,314 --> 01:42:32,474
He has faith in you.

2381
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,984
Wait.

2382
01:42:36,585 --> 01:42:39,553
Let me try it with Jun Woo and Kyu Nyeon.

2383
01:42:39,554 --> 01:42:40,854
This is my last chance.

2384
01:42:40,955 --> 01:42:42,424
I must do my best.

2385
01:42:45,394 --> 01:42:46,625
(Ki Moo Gan practices with Park Jun Woo and Kim Kyu Nyeon.)

2386
01:42:54,934 --> 01:42:56,574
- That combination isn't so bad. - No.

2387
01:42:56,575 --> 01:42:57,835
It's a good combination.

2388
01:42:58,174 --> 01:42:59,875
- Jun Woo is stable. - Yes.

2389
01:43:00,974 --> 01:43:03,274
I've thought about it a lot.

2390
01:43:03,674 --> 01:43:04,674
I choose...

2391
01:43:05,844 --> 01:43:07,944
Kim Si Won as Chief State Councilor...

2392
01:43:07,945 --> 01:43:10,183
and Kim Hyo Joon as Left State Councilor.

2393
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:11,714
(Bummed out)

2394
01:43:11,715 --> 01:43:13,384
I'll be the kingmaker.

2395
01:43:15,524 --> 01:43:18,124
Honestly, I was upset.

2396
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:19,224
It was a shame.

2397
01:43:19,894 --> 01:43:21,694
Well done. You did great.

2398
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:23,365
- How can I get zero votes? - It's cruel.

2399
01:43:24,035 --> 01:43:27,165
You'll be dehydrated. You're sweating so much.

2400
01:43:27,865 --> 01:43:28,865
I know.

2401
01:43:29,665 --> 01:43:30,835
We should try it together.

2402
01:43:31,035 --> 01:43:32,205
- Do you want to? - Yes.

2403
01:43:32,804 --> 01:43:34,375
Wait. Okay.

2404
01:43:37,974 --> 01:43:39,115
Sure. Let's do it.

2405
01:43:39,245 --> 01:43:41,714
I'll redeem myself in the audition later.

2406
01:43:41,715 --> 01:43:43,455
I was waiting for the moment.

2407
01:43:44,785 --> 01:43:45,785
Let's do it.

2408
01:43:46,085 --> 01:43:47,683
(Park Jun Woo practices with his all.)

2409
01:43:47,684 --> 01:43:49,994
It's not that I might have a chance.

2410
01:43:49,995 --> 01:43:52,325
I must do it.

2411
01:43:54,295 --> 01:43:55,665
I will slam into everyone.

2412
01:43:56,125 --> 01:43:57,195
I'll beat them all.

2413
01:43:57,835 --> 01:44:00,005
(How will Park Jun Woo do in the audition?)

2414
01:44:02,434 --> 01:44:04,633
(Kim Jae Seung and Jung Bo Kyung are here for the lead role audition.)

2415
01:44:04,634 --> 01:44:06,304
(Welcome.)

2416
01:44:07,445 --> 01:44:09,974
I was more nervous than usual.

2417
01:44:10,115 --> 01:44:13,945
I'm a Korean Dance Film Choreographer Kim Jae Seung.

2418
01:44:14,384 --> 01:44:15,843
(A Korean dance coach and a Dance Film choreographer,)

2419
01:44:15,844 --> 01:44:16,884
(Kim Jae Seung)

2420
01:44:17,085 --> 01:44:18,384
The lead role, King,

2421
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:20,255
is the one who governs the country.

2422
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:23,594
He's powerful and charismatic.

2423
01:44:23,795 --> 01:44:26,695
The King. I can play that.

2424
01:44:27,295 --> 01:44:28,694
I feel confident.

2425
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,634
Of course, I want to play the King.

2426
01:44:30,995 --> 01:44:33,094
Chief State Councilor and Left State Councilor...

2427
01:44:33,335 --> 01:44:36,835
are intelligent, powerful, and energetic.

2428
01:44:37,375 --> 01:44:40,474
Although I didn't make it in First, I have to pull it off here.

2429
01:44:40,844 --> 01:44:42,705
I've been demoted already.

2430
01:44:42,804 --> 01:44:44,014
But being demoted to the supporting role?

2431
01:44:44,115 --> 01:44:45,215
I can never imagine that.

2432
01:44:45,644 --> 01:44:48,844
Now, we will begin the Casting Audition.

2433
01:44:49,014 --> 01:44:50,715
(Korean Dance Main Supporting Role Casting Audition)

2434
01:44:51,054 --> 01:44:54,084
The supporting role candidates who danced with Choi Ho Jong.

2435
01:44:54,085 --> 01:44:55,983
Please come forward.

2436
01:44:55,984 --> 01:44:57,794
(Ho Jong, the lead role, Kyu Nyeon and Sang Gil in supporting roles)

2437
01:44:57,795 --> 01:44:58,795
First position.

2438
01:45:00,325 --> 01:45:02,394
Music, start.

2439
01:45:02,724 --> 01:45:07,035
(The Main Supporting Role Casting Audition finally begins.)

2440
01:45:16,814 --> 01:45:17,844
(Focused)

2441
01:45:20,785 --> 01:45:22,014
They're very calm.

2442
01:45:26,684 --> 01:45:28,285
Their teamwork wasn't so bad.

2443
01:45:31,354 --> 01:45:32,394
(Scanning quickly)

2444
01:45:39,634 --> 01:45:41,433
(Kim Kyu Nyeon and Kim Sang Gil's pair choreography ends.)

2445
01:45:41,434 --> 01:45:44,733
(Applauding)

2446
01:45:44,734 --> 01:45:46,705
- They were calm. - They were very calm.

2447
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:49,245
But the judges wouldn't like that.

2448
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:50,945
They said they wanted to see energy.

2449
01:45:51,415 --> 01:45:52,814
Was I too loose?

2450
01:45:53,075 --> 01:45:55,115
Still, I did a good job.

2451
01:45:55,215 --> 01:45:57,914
- Kim Sang Gil has a limit. - He has a limit.

2452
01:45:57,915 --> 01:46:00,785
Kyu Nyeon is too weak.

2453
01:46:02,785 --> 01:46:04,624
It was comfortable to watch,

2454
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:07,964
but what we needed was tension from tight choreography.

2455
01:46:07,965 --> 01:46:09,794
It was a bummer.

2456
01:46:09,795 --> 01:46:10,795
(Kyu Nyeon and Sang Gil received a disappointing comment.)

2457
01:46:11,165 --> 01:46:12,564
I feel confident.

2458
01:46:12,695 --> 01:46:14,864
I thought I should show my energy...

2459
01:46:14,865 --> 01:46:16,904
and get more chances.

2460
01:46:16,905 --> 01:46:19,233
Because I got selected twice...

2461
01:46:19,234 --> 01:46:20,404
I decided to take this chance to prove myself.

2462
01:46:20,405 --> 01:46:21,444
(Kim Jong Cheol in the lead role,)

2463
01:46:21,445 --> 01:46:22,673
(and Kim Kyu Nyeon and Kim Hyo Joon in supporting roles)

2464
01:46:22,674 --> 01:46:24,245
One. Go.

2465
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:33,085
Nice energy.

2466
01:46:33,086 --> 01:46:34,155
(Exclaiming)

2467
01:46:37,195 --> 01:46:38,224
(They're good.)

2468
01:46:44,995 --> 01:46:46,035
I have to say they are good.

2469
01:46:46,594 --> 01:46:47,604
(That's right!)

2470
01:46:53,234 --> 01:46:55,374
(Kim Kyu Nyeon and Kim Hyo Joon's pair choreography ends.)

2471
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,574
(Good job!)

2472
01:46:57,575 --> 01:46:59,045
They showed what the judges wanted.

2473
01:46:59,844 --> 01:47:02,744
Kim Hyo Joon was very close to it.

2474
01:47:02,745 --> 01:47:04,654
- Yes. He's always accurate. - So...

2475
01:47:04,655 --> 01:47:06,353
I'm doing great.

2476
01:47:06,354 --> 01:47:07,924
I think I have a chance.

2477
01:47:08,524 --> 01:47:11,393
We should use a lot of space...

2478
01:47:11,394 --> 01:47:12,655
as if we're close.

2479
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:14,594
(Ki Moo Gan in the lead role,)

2480
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:16,164
(and Kim Si Won and Kim Hyo Joon in supporting roles)

2481
01:47:16,165 --> 01:47:17,234
Charisma.

2482
01:47:17,394 --> 01:47:19,134
I can see that he's manly.

2483
01:47:19,394 --> 01:47:21,535
- I can't wait. - This will be fun to watch.

2484
01:47:29,705 --> 01:47:30,774
(Amazed)

2485
01:47:33,785 --> 01:47:34,814
I'm getting the chills.

2486
01:47:40,184 --> 01:47:41,524
Okay. Nice.

2487
01:47:41,825 --> 01:47:42,825
(They're cool.)

2488
01:47:43,924 --> 01:47:45,523
(Kim Si Won and Kim Hyo Joon overwhelms the audience...)

2489
01:47:45,524 --> 01:47:46,554
(with perfect teamwork.)

2490
01:47:49,965 --> 01:47:51,433
(Kim Si Won and Kim Hyo Joon's pair choreography ends.)

2491
01:47:51,434 --> 01:47:53,335
(Applauding)

2492
01:47:53,535 --> 01:47:54,535
(Proud)

2493
01:47:54,536 --> 01:47:55,604
That was really cool.

2494
01:47:56,035 --> 01:47:58,534
Since I'll be playing a supporting role,

2495
01:47:58,535 --> 01:48:00,544
I focused on my role.

2496
01:48:00,545 --> 01:48:04,444
I thought it should be someone held in check yet obedient.

2497
01:48:04,445 --> 01:48:08,513
I danced as if I was glaring at the King when I was behind him,

2498
01:48:08,514 --> 01:48:12,014
but tried to look down when I was in front of him.

2499
01:48:12,184 --> 01:48:13,353
(Exclaiming)

2500
01:48:13,354 --> 01:48:15,654
You're right about your analysis.

2501
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:19,524
Your presentation was the best.

2502
01:48:19,924 --> 01:48:20,995
Oh, nice.

2503
01:48:21,264 --> 01:48:23,465
I might get the main supporting role.

2504
01:48:24,465 --> 01:48:25,934
There are dancers we haven't seen yet.

2505
01:48:26,134 --> 01:48:29,064
Let's see Park Jun Woo and Cho Tae Yoon.

2506
01:48:29,335 --> 01:48:31,773
Kim Sang Gil and Cho Tae Yoon.

2507
01:48:31,774 --> 01:48:34,144
Park Jun Woo with Kim Kyu Nyeon.

2508
01:48:34,974 --> 01:48:35,974
(Choi Ho Jong in the lead role,)

2509
01:48:35,975 --> 01:48:37,274
(and Cho Tae Yoon and Kim Sang Gil in supporting roles)

2510
01:48:38,774 --> 01:48:40,184
He's not energetic at all.

2511
01:48:43,215 --> 01:48:45,584
(After bumping into Choi Ho Jong, Cho Tae Yoon had a sloppy finish.)

2512
01:48:45,585 --> 01:48:47,654
After you bumped into Choi Ho Jong,

2513
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:49,383
you lost the rhythm.

2514
01:48:49,384 --> 01:48:52,024
You should've hidden it as a dancer.

2515
01:48:52,724 --> 01:48:53,724
We're ready.

2516
01:48:53,725 --> 01:48:54,894
(Park Jun Woo is waiting for his audition.)

2517
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:57,795
To be honest, I was embarrassed the whole time I was there.

2518
01:48:59,094 --> 01:49:00,864
It hurt my pride so much.

2519
01:49:00,865 --> 01:49:01,905
(Park Jun Woo only watched others' auditions.)

2520
01:49:03,005 --> 01:49:06,375
Still, I might get a chance for an additional audition.

2521
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,844
(Park Jun Woo kept practicing in the back for his chance.)

2522
01:49:11,215 --> 01:49:13,013
I must seize my last chance.

2523
01:49:13,014 --> 01:49:14,944
All I have to do is focus on my job.

2524
01:49:14,945 --> 01:49:16,084
I will slam into everyone.

2525
01:49:16,085 --> 01:49:18,715
Two, one. Go.

2526
01:49:19,484 --> 01:49:20,625
(Park Jun Woo and Kim Kyu Nyeon in supporting roles)

2527
01:49:25,594 --> 01:49:26,655
(Exclaiming)

2528
01:49:29,524 --> 01:49:30,535
Nice.

2529
01:49:32,394 --> 01:49:33,965
They have perfect teamwork.

2530
01:49:34,365 --> 01:49:35,405
(Glaring)

2531
01:49:37,134 --> 01:49:38,205
(Perfect teamwork)

2532
01:49:48,984 --> 01:49:50,414
(The three put on crazy teamwork as if they were a team.)

2533
01:49:50,415 --> 01:49:51,853
(They nailed it.)

2534
01:49:51,854 --> 01:49:54,353
Oh, this is...

2535
01:49:54,354 --> 01:49:56,255
Jun Woo was amazing.

2536
01:49:56,524 --> 01:49:59,195
He suddenly became a rival.

2537
01:50:00,295 --> 01:50:01,394
I redeemed myself.

2538
01:50:02,024 --> 01:50:04,034
They gave me my last chance,

2539
01:50:04,035 --> 01:50:05,165
and I seized it.

2540
01:50:05,535 --> 01:50:06,965
Park Jun Woo.

2541
01:50:07,905 --> 01:50:09,604
Jun Woo did what Jun Woo was good at.

2542
01:50:09,905 --> 01:50:13,004
You showed that you'd eat them up.

2543
01:50:13,005 --> 01:50:14,774
I loved that tension.

2544
01:50:15,505 --> 01:50:18,914
Why do you think...

2545
01:50:18,915 --> 01:50:20,644
you were not chosen?

2546
01:50:21,844 --> 01:50:25,455
I think I had ups and downs.

2547
01:50:25,684 --> 01:50:28,523
Can you do it in a different position?

2548
01:50:28,524 --> 01:50:29,625
I will try.

2549
01:50:29,825 --> 01:50:31,554
(Passionate)

2550
01:50:31,854 --> 01:50:33,723
(That's cool.)

2551
01:50:33,724 --> 01:50:37,034
Lastly, I want to see you dancing...

2552
01:50:37,035 --> 01:50:38,534
with Kim Si Won and Choi Ho Jong.

2553
01:50:38,535 --> 01:50:39,933
(Park Jun Woo is given a second chance.)

2554
01:50:39,934 --> 01:50:41,104
We need to check this.

2555
01:50:41,705 --> 01:50:44,173
I knew that once I proved myself,

2556
01:50:44,174 --> 01:50:46,973
they would want to see more.

2557
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:49,745
Since then, I've become confident.

2558
01:50:50,174 --> 01:50:54,085
Three, two, one. Go.

2559
01:51:07,495 --> 01:51:08,495
(Falling in love)

2560
01:51:13,165 --> 01:51:14,365
Oh, I like that too.

2561
01:51:18,104 --> 01:51:19,104
He's so good at dancing.

2562
01:51:24,545 --> 01:51:26,574
(The Casting Audition becomes ripe.)

2563
01:51:26,575 --> 01:51:27,745
- He was good. - Yes.

2564
01:51:27,844 --> 01:51:28,844
Nice.

2565
01:51:29,285 --> 01:51:31,314
I think I was on a roll.

2566
01:51:31,814 --> 01:51:34,024
Kim Si Won, where do you prefer?

2567
01:51:34,484 --> 01:51:37,394
I prefer the Chief State Councilor.

2568
01:51:37,695 --> 01:51:40,564
Park Jun Woo, where do you prefer?

2569
01:51:40,924 --> 01:51:42,724
I also prefer the Chief State Councilor.

2570
01:51:43,264 --> 01:51:45,035
Then you two can't dance together.

2571
01:51:45,335 --> 01:51:48,665
If you have to make a concession, will you?

2572
01:51:49,604 --> 01:51:51,804
Yes. After trying just now,

2573
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:54,344
I feel confident to pull off both.

2574
01:51:54,405 --> 01:51:55,445
He's ambitious.

2575
01:51:56,674 --> 01:51:59,215
The dancers who are cast for the main supporting roles are...

2576
01:51:59,875 --> 01:52:02,013
I knew I had what it took to be the one.

2577
01:52:02,014 --> 01:52:03,755
It could be me.

2578
01:52:04,085 --> 01:52:06,585
I might have a chance.

2579
01:52:07,625 --> 01:52:10,085
The dancers who are cast for the main supporting roles are...

2580
01:52:10,825 --> 01:52:14,024
Kim Si Won and Park Jun Woo.

2581
01:52:14,125 --> 01:52:15,125
Congratulations.

2582
01:52:15,126 --> 01:52:16,664
(Congratulating)

2583
01:52:16,665 --> 01:52:18,464
(Park Jun Woo won the supporting role in the end.)

2584
01:52:18,465 --> 01:52:19,465
It was thrilling.

2585
01:52:19,594 --> 01:52:22,604
I went to both paradise and the inferno today.

2586
01:52:22,865 --> 01:52:26,433
I won the main role among many candidates.

2587
01:52:26,434 --> 01:52:29,274
I should dance with responsibility.

2588
01:52:29,474 --> 01:52:30,774
You're doing great, Si Won.

2589
01:52:31,045 --> 01:52:32,644
I'll pull off the supporting role well...

2590
01:52:32,745 --> 01:52:35,785
and get my class back.

2591

(Korean Dance Supporting Role Casting Audition Result)

2592
01:52:37,684 --> 01:52:38,983
(Kim Si Won and Park Jun Woo as main supporting roles)

2593
01:52:38,984 --> 01:52:40,523
(Korean Dance Main Lead Role Casting Audition)

2594
01:52:40,524 --> 01:52:44,094
The lead role candidate, Kim Jong Cheol, please come forward.

2595
01:52:45,455 --> 01:52:46,553
Good luck.

2596
01:52:46,554 --> 01:52:47,825
(Will Kim Jong Cheol be able to pull off?)

2597
01:52:48,165 --> 01:52:49,365
First position.

2598
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:51,394
Music, start.

2599
01:52:52,434 --> 01:52:54,705
Three, two, one.

2600
01:52:55,505 --> 01:52:56,505
Go.

2601
01:53:03,474 --> 01:53:04,513
He must be under pressure.

2602
01:53:04,514 --> 01:53:05,514
(Will Kim Jong Cheol be able to get the lead role?)

2603
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:08,183
(Also getting nervous)

2604
01:53:08,184 --> 01:53:12,154
(Kim Jong Cheol comes forward as if a path opened.)

2605
01:53:12,155 --> 01:53:13,553
Nice.

2606
01:53:13,554 --> 01:53:14,724
I like how they open up.

2607
01:53:15,825 --> 01:53:16,884
So sexy.

2608
01:53:23,894 --> 01:53:25,535
Jong Cheol isn't visible.

2609
01:53:25,564 --> 01:53:26,564
(Focused)

2610
01:53:28,905 --> 01:53:31,035
(Kim Jong Cheol's audition ends.)

2611
01:53:31,674 --> 01:53:32,734
The ending fairy.

2612
01:53:32,835 --> 01:53:34,375
He was good.

2613
01:53:34,644 --> 01:53:35,774
That was refreshing.

2614
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:38,343
(What did the coaches think?)

2615
01:53:38,344 --> 01:53:39,615
Kim Jong Cheol.

2616
01:53:39,915 --> 01:53:42,784
The disappointing part about your performance was...

2617
01:53:42,785 --> 01:53:44,584
(The comment begins with criticism.)

2618
01:53:44,585 --> 01:53:47,424
You used an asymmetrical formation that spread open.

2619
01:53:47,724 --> 01:53:51,295
To me, Baek Sang Ha stood out more.

2620
01:53:51,955 --> 01:53:53,724
It felt like you lost your position of King...

2621
01:53:54,064 --> 01:53:56,195
to Baek Sang Ha.

2622
01:53:56,665 --> 01:53:58,835
You used the asymmetrical formation.

2623
01:53:59,094 --> 01:54:02,434
If it were a concert, it would've been a very charming formation,

2624
01:54:02,564 --> 01:54:07,445
but it was somewhat ambiguous for the Dance Film.

2625
01:54:07,945 --> 01:54:09,973
- Thank you for your work. - Thank you.

2626
01:54:09,974 --> 01:54:11,945
(Kim Jong Cheol's audition ended with harsh criticism.)

2627
01:54:12,545 --> 01:54:15,085
(The next main lead role candidate is Ki Moo Gan.)

2628
01:54:15,514 --> 01:54:17,684
(Ki Moo Gan begins with a surrounded formation.)

2629
01:54:17,955 --> 01:54:20,384

2630
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:21,625
(Thinking)

2631
01:54:25,894 --> 01:54:26,894
(Appearing)

2632
01:54:26,894 --> 01:54:27,894
(That's right!)

2633
01:54:30,394 --> 01:54:31,433
(Eyes opening)

2634
01:54:31,434 --> 01:54:33,035
(What was that just now?)

2635
01:54:37,875 --> 01:54:38,875
(His lips are getting dry.)

2636
01:54:40,575 --> 01:54:41,575
(Nodding)

2637
01:54:41,745 --> 01:54:43,174
He has nice gestures.

2638
01:54:43,604 --> 01:54:44,615
(Focused)

2639
01:54:46,774 --> 01:54:48,313
(A neat ending)

2640
01:54:48,314 --> 01:54:50,554
(Ki Moo Gan's Casting Audition ends.)

2641
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:53,483
(Automatic applause)

2642
01:54:53,484 --> 01:54:54,655
He looked like a real king.

2643
01:54:55,125 --> 01:54:56,654
He had the best acting.

2644
01:54:56,655 --> 01:54:58,053
- He was good. - Yes, in terms of acting.

2645
01:54:58,054 --> 01:55:00,024
- I knew he'd be good here. - He's good at the real thing.

2646
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,124
When I first saw your formation,

2647
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:03,694
I thought you wouldn't be visible,

2648
01:55:03,695 --> 01:55:05,894
surrounded by the ensemble.

2649
01:55:06,035 --> 01:55:07,534
But when the ensemble spread...

2650
01:55:07,535 --> 01:55:10,673
and began dancing, you dashed out.

2651
01:55:10,674 --> 01:55:12,634
Your eye-catching character.

2652
01:55:12,774 --> 01:55:14,044
That also played an integral role.

2653
01:55:14,045 --> 01:55:15,045
Thank you.

2654
01:55:16,174 --> 01:55:17,643
(The last main lead role candidate is Choi Ho Jong.)

2655
01:55:17,644 --> 01:55:20,273
I'm worried about the ensemble.

2656
01:55:20,274 --> 01:55:22,115
They'll get confused after every choreography.

2657
01:55:22,344 --> 01:55:25,655
It requires everyone's attention.

2658
01:55:26,014 --> 01:55:27,424
Isn't it too tight?

2659
01:55:27,724 --> 01:55:30,383
Can you check your marks again?

2660
01:55:30,384 --> 01:55:32,054
Stand in line. The square.

2661
01:55:32,655 --> 01:55:34,224
Line. Square.

2662
01:55:34,495 --> 01:55:37,024
If there's any problem, don't hesitate to tell me.

2663
01:55:37,934 --> 01:55:40,335
Three, two, one.

2664
01:55:41,005 --> 01:55:42,005
Go.

2665
01:55:45,774 --> 01:55:46,774
(Grinning)

2666
01:55:50,974 --> 01:55:51,974
(Intrigued)

2667
01:55:55,884 --> 01:55:56,884
(Exclaiming)

2668
01:55:57,384 --> 01:55:58,884
(Choi Ho Jong shows unique steps as usual.)

2669
01:55:59,684 --> 01:56:00,684
Nice.

2670
01:56:01,554 --> 01:56:02,554
Nice.

2671
01:56:07,224 --> 01:56:08,923
It's like the king's path.

2672
01:56:08,924 --> 01:56:09,924
Nice.

2673
01:56:10,195 --> 01:56:11,234
I'm getting the chills.

2674
01:56:15,405 --> 01:56:16,405
(Focused)

2675
01:56:17,035 --> 01:56:18,234
I see.

2676
01:56:21,505 --> 01:56:23,544
(Ho Jong's Casting Audition ends.)

2677
01:56:23,545 --> 01:56:24,575
That gave me the chills.

2678
01:56:25,445 --> 01:56:28,284
I like how he narrowed the space.

2679
01:56:28,285 --> 01:56:30,215
- It felt like the king's path. - Yes.

2680
01:56:30,484 --> 01:56:31,955
Here comes His Majesty the King.

2681
01:56:32,615 --> 01:56:35,324
I appreciate the ensemble's effort.

2682
01:56:35,325 --> 01:56:36,454
Even though you only had little time,

2683
01:56:36,455 --> 01:56:39,455
you danced like a team. I appreciated it.

2684
01:56:40,024 --> 01:56:43,295
What was on your mind when you came up with that choreography?

2685
01:56:43,424 --> 01:56:46,634
I thought the King should stand out.

2686
01:56:46,835 --> 01:56:48,933
I came up with the formation inspired by...

2687
01:56:48,934 --> 01:56:52,204
the rituals and One Dance.

2688
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:53,273
He's smart.

2689
01:56:53,274 --> 01:56:55,504
He mentioned One Dance since it was about a king.

2690
01:56:55,505 --> 01:56:58,044
Still, it wasn't impressive enough.

2691
01:56:58,045 --> 01:56:59,374
(Coach Kim Jae Seung seems to find Choi Ho Jong's performance a shame.)

2692
01:56:59,375 --> 01:57:01,143
Choi Ho Jong.

2693
01:57:01,144 --> 01:57:05,383
As if the One Dance choreography had gone inside my head,

2694
01:57:05,384 --> 01:57:07,154
it was just perfect.

2695
01:57:07,155 --> 01:57:09,585
But what we needed was tension.

2696
01:57:09,825 --> 01:57:13,053
Your idea of the King and my idea of the King...

2697
01:57:13,054 --> 01:57:14,894
were different.

2698
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:16,763
I believe the King...

2699
01:57:16,764 --> 01:57:19,835
sometimes has to hold a sword.

2700
01:57:20,094 --> 01:57:21,964
You should express...

2701
01:57:21,965 --> 01:57:24,973
the King's charisma more.

2702
01:57:24,974 --> 01:57:26,504
- Okay. - If you can.

2703
01:57:26,505 --> 01:57:27,545
- Okay. - Okay.

2704
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:31,013
For the King role...

2705
01:57:31,014 --> 01:57:32,974
- It should be Moo Gan. - It should be Ki Moo Gan.

2706
01:57:33,245 --> 01:57:36,183
But in terms of choreography, Choi Ho Jong is more appropriate.

2707
01:57:36,184 --> 01:57:38,553
The fact that he adopted the One Dance...

2708
01:57:38,554 --> 01:57:41,383
But his character analysis was...

2709
01:57:41,384 --> 01:57:43,023
Will it be choreography...

2710
01:57:43,024 --> 01:57:45,494
or expression of character?

2711
01:57:45,495 --> 01:57:48,563
I will now announce the dancer...

2712
01:57:48,564 --> 01:57:50,564
who's cast for the main lead role.

2713
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:54,005
It's the role I'm used to playing.

2714
01:57:54,335 --> 01:57:56,535
I thought I'd pull it off well if I got it.

2715
01:57:56,764 --> 01:58:00,603
(The perfect idea for the theme and the unique formation stood out.)

2716
01:58:00,604 --> 01:58:02,875
(Choi Ho Jong's choreography skills)

2717
01:58:03,575 --> 01:58:07,745
I should make them understand why I'm First.

2718
01:58:08,045 --> 01:58:11,215
(He seized attention with his unique charisma)

2719
01:58:12,014 --> 01:58:16,354
(Ki Moo Gan's expression level)

2720
01:58:16,684 --> 01:58:19,723
I will now announce the dancer...

2721
01:58:19,724 --> 01:58:21,593
who's cast for the main lead role.

2722
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:22,825
(Who will take the lead role of Korean Dance Film?)

2723
01:58:23,024 --> 01:58:24,434
For the main lead role,

2724
01:58:25,634 --> 01:58:29,934
Ki Moo Gan is cast.

2725
01:58:30,104 --> 01:58:31,134
Congratulations.

2726
01:58:32,005 --> 01:58:33,005
(Approving)

2727
01:58:33,006 --> 01:58:36,173
(Unfortunately, Choi Ho Jong missed the main lead role.)

2728
01:58:36,174 --> 01:58:37,575
Moo Gan is just...

2729
01:58:38,075 --> 01:58:39,144
He's perfect.

2730
01:58:40,445 --> 01:58:41,915
I feel a sense of responsibility...

2731
01:58:42,184 --> 01:58:45,814
to end it with a good result.

2732
01:58:46,455 --> 01:58:49,154
I know it's hard to believe, but I'm very happy.

2733
01:58:49,155 --> 01:58:50,284
(Very happy)

2734
01:58:50,285 --> 01:58:52,054
Let me give Choi Ho Jong a word of advice.

2735
01:58:52,295 --> 01:58:54,594
We expect more from you.

2736
01:58:54,795 --> 01:58:58,865
We were expecting you to meet our expectations.

2737
01:58:59,195 --> 01:59:01,165
But this is our conclusion after contemplation.

2738
01:59:01,465 --> 01:59:02,534
Thank you.

2739
01:59:02,535 --> 01:59:04,234
I want to thank all three of you.

2740
01:59:05,174 --> 01:59:06,535
- Well done. - Congratulations.

2741
01:59:06,734 --> 01:59:07,744
Thanks.

2742
01:59:07,745 --> 01:59:09,804
I felt a lot of pressure.

2743
01:59:10,104 --> 01:59:12,914
I played the lead role in the National Dance Company of Korea.

2744
01:59:12,915 --> 01:59:14,214
"The leader of Korean dance."

2745
01:59:14,215 --> 01:59:18,314
Because I'm blinded by those bywords,

2746
01:59:18,615 --> 01:59:22,125
I can feel that people are expecting something from me.

2747
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:23,884
That's kind of tough.

2748
01:59:24,524 --> 01:59:26,093
In future missions,

2749
01:59:26,094 --> 01:59:28,625
I want to prove myself.

2750
01:59:29,825 --> 01:59:31,063
(Korean Dance Main Lead Role Casting Audition Result)

2751
01:59:31,064 --> 01:59:32,233
(Ki Moo Gan as the lead role)

2752
01:59:32,234 --> 01:59:35,504
(The day of the Korean Dance Film shoot)

2753
01:59:35,505 --> 01:59:37,204
(The ensemble green room)

2754
01:59:37,205 --> 01:59:39,273
(The ensemble green room seems too crowded.)

2755
01:59:39,274 --> 01:59:40,274
(Packed)

2756
01:59:40,275 --> 01:59:43,773
There were only about ten chairs in the ensemble green room...

2757
01:59:43,774 --> 01:59:46,045
and a couple of mats.

2758
01:59:46,474 --> 01:59:49,684
The lead roles are given a personal couch.

2759
01:59:50,344 --> 01:59:51,983
(The lead role green room)

2760
01:59:51,984 --> 01:59:54,754
(The three lead roles are resting in a spacious green room.)

2761
01:59:54,755 --> 01:59:56,354
(This is refreshing.)

2762
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:59,023
I know people in the other room will be upset,

2763
01:59:59,024 --> 02:00:00,094
but I loved it.

2764
02:00:00,865 --> 02:00:02,494
This is what it means to be in the ensemble.

2765
02:00:02,495 --> 02:00:04,234
This is how the Under Class is treated.

2766
02:00:04,865 --> 02:00:05,934
I was sad.

2767
02:00:06,234 --> 02:00:09,405
I can't wait to move up and receive a nice treatment.

2768
02:00:09,965 --> 02:00:12,904
(The lead role dancers are here to get changed.)

2769
02:00:12,905 --> 02:00:14,103
Isn't that Ki Moo Gan?

2770
02:00:14,104 --> 02:00:15,344
You need to wear the king's clothes.

2771
02:00:17,075 --> 02:00:19,673
(Ki Moo Gan changes into the king's clothes.)

2772
02:00:19,674 --> 02:00:22,284
(Flashy)

2773
02:00:22,285 --> 02:00:24,384
And the other lead roles, the ancestor's clothes.

2774
02:00:25,155 --> 02:00:27,214
(Is this the ancestors' vibe?)

2775
02:00:27,215 --> 02:00:29,285
If I don't do it right,

2776
02:00:29,585 --> 02:00:31,955
I might look like a beggar.

2777
02:00:32,224 --> 02:00:34,564
Can you help Ki Moo Gan get changed?

2778
02:00:34,764 --> 02:00:35,764
Okay.

2779
02:00:36,195 --> 02:00:37,933
(The production crew...)

2780
02:00:37,934 --> 02:00:40,495
(only gives the lead roles intense care.)

2781
02:00:40,905 --> 02:00:42,133
(Glancing)

2782
02:00:42,134 --> 02:00:43,505
You're a real king.

2783
02:00:44,304 --> 02:00:45,304
(Jealous)

2784
02:00:45,305 --> 02:00:48,174
We play lead roles too, but it's the supporting role.

2785
02:00:48,604 --> 02:00:50,304
We received different treatment from the main role.

2786
02:00:56,314 --> 02:00:59,085
Now, it's time to show who I am, so I'm excited.

2787
02:01:00,014 --> 02:01:01,624
- Try it. - Try it like this.

2788
02:01:01,625 --> 02:01:03,755
- He has been a bit dark all along. - Really?

2789
02:01:03,984 --> 02:01:05,655
Oh, there's a coffee truck.

2790
02:01:06,354 --> 02:01:07,593
(He found something more interesting.)

2791
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:10,295
"We are expecting to see Dancer Ki Moo Gan's great performance."

2792
02:01:10,724 --> 02:01:12,134
Goodness.

2793
02:01:12,564 --> 02:01:14,465
That truck has come only for you.

2794
02:01:15,335 --> 02:01:18,574
(Everyone is quite excited.)

2795
02:01:18,575 --> 02:01:19,575
What's all this for?

2796
02:01:19,674 --> 02:01:20,705
That's awesome!

2797
02:01:21,045 --> 02:01:22,874
In the dance scene,

2798
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:26,445
that kind of truck rarely comes when we perform.

2799
02:01:27,014 --> 02:01:28,115
To be honest, I was envious.

2800
02:01:28,915 --> 02:01:31,155
That's why I should be in the higher class.

2801
02:01:31,314 --> 02:01:33,854
- Thanks for the coffee. - Thank you.

2802
02:01:34,984 --> 02:01:37,594
I was quite surprised but felt so good.

2803
02:01:38,024 --> 02:01:39,853
I thought I should keep my position, no matter what.

2804
02:01:39,854 --> 02:01:41,325
(Truly happy)

2805
02:01:41,524 --> 02:01:43,763
Seven, eight, nine, and one.

2806
02:01:43,764 --> 02:01:46,134
- Two - Three, four.

2807
02:01:46,695 --> 02:01:48,234
- What's that? - What?

2808
02:01:49,604 --> 02:01:52,474
Hello. I'm the MC of Stage Fighter, Kang Daniel.

2809
02:01:52,705 --> 02:01:54,875
- He appeared again. - It's making me nervous.

2810
02:01:55,375 --> 02:01:58,415
In this program, your position is never secure.

2811
02:01:58,674 --> 02:01:59,744
- What? - Oh, my!

2812
02:01:59,745 --> 02:02:00,884
(They will change again?)

2813
02:02:01,184 --> 02:02:02,584
Through the Dance Film Mission,

2814
02:02:02,585 --> 02:02:04,415
your abilities will be evaluated,

2815
02:02:04,615 --> 02:02:06,813
and the Class Movement Ceremony will be held.

2816
02:02:06,814 --> 02:02:08,084
(Do you even know how hard it was to get here?)

2817
02:02:08,085 --> 02:02:10,085
(Seriously?)

2818
02:02:10,354 --> 02:02:11,755
(Then, I will have a chance too.)

2819
02:02:12,054 --> 02:02:14,924
The Korean Dance Film for the ceremony will be...

2820
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:17,764
evaluated by other classes.

2821
02:02:18,234 --> 02:02:19,564
"Evaluated by other classes?"

2822
02:02:20,695 --> 02:02:22,634
Other classes will judge us.

2823
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:23,904
(Really?)

2824
02:02:23,905 --> 02:02:25,474
Things are becoming cruel.

2825
02:02:26,705 --> 02:02:28,004
A dancer in First...

2826
02:02:28,005 --> 02:02:30,343
will judge Second and Under Classes.

2827
02:02:30,344 --> 02:02:32,044
(The voting method of other classes)

2828
02:02:32,045 --> 02:02:33,344
(Dancers in 1st will judge dancers in 2nd and Under Classes.)

2829
02:02:33,545 --> 02:02:34,545
A candidate for promotion...

2830
02:02:36,285 --> 02:02:37,484
A dancer in Second...

2831
02:02:37,814 --> 02:02:40,214
will judge First and Under Classes.

2832
02:02:40,215 --> 02:02:41,483
(Dancers in 2nd will judge dancers in 1st and Under Classes.)

2833
02:02:41,484 --> 02:02:44,454
Is this the way to choose candidates for promotion and demotion?

2834
02:02:44,455 --> 02:02:45,954
Today, we have 6 dancers from 2nd.

2835
02:02:45,955 --> 02:02:47,894
So 2 of them will be promoted, and 2 demoted.

2836
02:02:49,165 --> 02:02:50,563
A dancer in Under...

2837
02:02:50,564 --> 02:02:53,634
will judge 1st and 2nd Classes.

2838
02:02:54,335 --> 02:02:56,705
- We also have a chance to judge. - Gosh.

2839
02:02:56,804 --> 02:02:58,174
- They should gain our favor. - Indeed.

2840
02:02:59,774 --> 02:03:01,374
The two promotion and demotion candidates...

2841
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:02,974
will be selected by popular vote.

2842
02:03:03,245 --> 02:03:05,344
- What? - Oh, my!

2843
02:03:05,615 --> 02:03:08,215
If a dancer overlaps, there will be a minimum of two candidates.

2844
02:03:08,715 --> 02:03:10,044
If not,

2845
02:03:10,045 --> 02:03:12,983
a maximum of 4 candidates are selected by the 2 classes.

2846
02:03:12,984 --> 02:03:15,455
(The 4 selected by 2 classes will be the candidates.)

2847
02:03:16,184 --> 02:03:17,455
I got goosebumps.

2848
02:03:17,924 --> 02:03:20,393
- Gosh. - I saw it coming.

2849
02:03:20,394 --> 02:03:21,893
(It's not a still frame.)

2850
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:23,695
Candidates for promotion and demotion will be decided...

2851
02:03:23,894 --> 02:03:27,465
after Masters and Coaches' final judgment.

2852
02:03:27,764 --> 02:03:30,434
As of now, make your assessments.

2853
02:03:30,764 --> 02:03:31,834
From now on?

2854
02:03:31,835 --> 02:03:33,103
(Young Woo is confused.)

2855
02:03:33,104 --> 02:03:35,044
We only have one path. The promotion.

2856
02:03:35,045 --> 02:03:37,044
- We have no going down. - That's right.

2857
02:03:37,045 --> 02:03:39,944
- If things go bad, we just go home. - That's the only way.

2858
02:03:39,945 --> 02:03:43,115
We should decide who would be the right fit.

2859
02:03:43,384 --> 02:03:44,784
I should give my best.

2860
02:03:44,785 --> 02:03:46,683
(For dancers in First, only demotions are possible.)

2861
02:03:46,684 --> 02:03:47,755
(His time is still stopped.)

2862
02:03:48,155 --> 02:03:50,054
They'll start practicing hard.

2863
02:03:50,785 --> 02:03:53,954
As of now, we should all stay tense.

2864
02:03:53,955 --> 02:03:56,424
This is a great opportunity for me.

2865
02:03:56,665 --> 02:03:57,734
I will step on them and go up.

2866
02:03:58,295 --> 02:04:01,864
"If I were there, I could've done better."

2867
02:04:01,865 --> 02:04:05,535
I will make sure they won't dare have such thoughts.

2868
02:04:05,875 --> 02:04:09,473
I've always undergone discrimination and have been pressured.

2869
02:04:09,474 --> 02:04:11,844
(Under Class was full of sorrow every time.)

2870
02:04:12,045 --> 02:04:14,244
(We're so envious of them.)

2871
02:04:14,245 --> 02:04:17,013
Now is the time to gain confidence.

2872
02:04:17,014 --> 02:04:19,054
We will judge you.

2873
02:04:19,215 --> 02:04:20,614
You're all dead now.

2874
02:04:20,615 --> 02:04:21,755
(Writing on the death note)

2875
02:04:22,224 --> 02:04:24,024
There was a reason Moo Gan treated us to coffee today.

2876
02:04:24,955 --> 02:04:26,424
He saw the bigger picture.

2877
02:04:26,594 --> 02:04:27,824
(Did you all enjoy coffee?)

2878
02:04:27,825 --> 02:04:29,695
(Grinning)

2879
02:04:30,125 --> 02:04:33,734
(Korean Dance Film shooting has begun.)

2880
02:04:33,934 --> 02:04:35,603
(Yongin Dae Jang Geum Park)

2881
02:04:35,604 --> 02:04:36,604
It's amazing.

2882
02:04:36,605 --> 02:04:38,034
(It is as big as a palace.)

2883
02:04:38,035 --> 02:04:39,134
It's like a palace!

2884
02:04:39,674 --> 02:04:42,473
Three, two, one. Music, start.

2885
02:04:42,474 --> 02:04:43,575
(The first shoot starts with the lead dancer, the King.)

2886
02:04:43,875 --> 02:04:45,545
(Determined)

2887
02:04:47,415 --> 02:04:48,484
That's cool.

2888
02:04:49,384 --> 02:04:51,784
(As the King spreads his arms,)

2889
02:04:51,785 --> 02:04:54,884
(rain clouds form.)

2890
02:04:55,325 --> 02:04:58,454
(It's beginning to sprinkle.)

2891
02:04:58,455 --> 02:04:59,924
Oh, my goodness.

2892
02:05:00,224 --> 02:05:01,325
It's raining so heavily.

2893
02:05:01,695 --> 02:05:04,223
(Can we still shoot in this weather?)

2894
02:05:04,224 --> 02:05:06,365
Dancers, please come over to the eaves.

2895
02:05:06,564 --> 02:05:07,564
It started raining as soon as we started.

2896
02:05:07,565 --> 02:05:08,764
(Laughing)

2897
02:05:09,134 --> 02:05:11,473
- It was a ritual for rain. - It was so quick.

2898
02:05:11,474 --> 02:05:15,005
(Their ritual is a great success.)

2899
02:05:15,505 --> 02:05:16,603
(They keep watching the monitor despite the rain.)

2900
02:05:16,604 --> 02:05:18,574
(Focused)

2901
02:05:18,575 --> 02:05:21,214
(He looks at it as if he'd penetrate it with his eyes.)

2902
02:05:21,215 --> 02:05:23,144
The weather was bad,

2903
02:05:23,415 --> 02:05:26,183
and I felt that many were wary due to what was coming.

2904
02:05:26,184 --> 02:05:28,353
I saw some of them were not eager...

2905
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:29,484
to perform passionately.

2906
02:05:30,825 --> 02:05:33,923
As we were standing in one line,

2907
02:05:33,924 --> 02:05:37,094
it was easy to catch one slight mistake.

2908
02:05:37,295 --> 02:05:40,633
Si Won was standing at the very front,

2909
02:05:40,634 --> 02:05:43,063
but he kept missing the beat.

2910
02:05:43,064 --> 02:05:46,134
(The wave)

2911
02:05:48,245 --> 02:05:49,843
(Why can't we move as a team?)

2912
02:05:49,844 --> 02:05:53,514
(First and Second Classes shoot together.)

2913
02:05:53,844 --> 02:05:54,844
They're starting!

2914
02:05:54,845 --> 02:05:57,344
Watch carefully and find out who should be eliminated.

2915
02:05:59,484 --> 02:06:02,654
(Ki Moo Gan starts with a light hand movement.)

2916
02:06:02,655 --> 02:06:04,954
(Charismatic)

2917
02:06:04,955 --> 02:06:06,593
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2918
02:06:06,594 --> 02:06:07,594
His expression is amazing!

2919
02:06:07,595 --> 02:06:09,465
What's that pouting?

2920
02:06:09,564 --> 02:06:11,094
Is that movement really cool?

2921
02:06:12,234 --> 02:06:13,393
His facial expression is insane.

2922
02:06:13,394 --> 02:06:14,564
- Look at his facial expression. - Amazing.

2923
02:06:14,764 --> 02:06:16,705
His facial expression is absolutely amazing.

2924
02:06:17,405 --> 02:06:20,604
Ho Jong is really visible, isn't he?

2925
02:06:21,274 --> 02:06:23,104
He has his own charms.

2926
02:06:23,844 --> 02:06:25,715
That movement from Ho Jong was stunning.

2927
02:06:26,615 --> 02:06:27,945
(Wary)

2928
02:06:28,984 --> 02:06:31,154
(Jong Cheol seems a bit strained between them.)

2929
02:06:31,155 --> 02:06:32,715
What is Jong Cheol doing?

2930
02:06:32,955 --> 02:06:34,755
- He's quite... - He seems very unstable.

2931
02:06:34,854 --> 02:06:36,284
- Who made a mistake? - Jong Cheol.

2932
02:06:36,285 --> 02:06:37,354
Oh, my.

2933
02:06:37,854 --> 02:06:40,393
- He appears to be very tired. - He's not visible at all.

2934
02:06:40,394 --> 02:06:42,724
(The pressure of the two experts made him exhausted.)

2935
02:06:43,195 --> 02:06:45,733
Tae Yoon and Sang Gil behind them are just...

2936
02:06:45,734 --> 02:06:47,393
I can't see them at all.

2937
02:06:47,394 --> 02:06:48,603
(Supporting dancers are also quite invisible at the back.)

2938
02:06:48,604 --> 02:06:50,405
To be honest, as I saw Sang Gil,

2939
02:06:50,965 --> 02:06:52,004
I couldn't see any of his strengths.

2940
02:06:52,005 --> 02:06:55,005
- I clearly see it now. - We see who will be eliminated.

2941
02:06:55,705 --> 02:06:57,944
It was all fine before.

2942
02:06:57,945 --> 02:06:59,374
But after hearing the news about the vote,

2943
02:06:59,375 --> 02:07:01,344
I can't help but find their flaws and compare them with others.

2944
02:07:01,785 --> 02:07:04,615
(As the sun sets, the shooting nears its end.)

2945
02:07:05,184 --> 02:07:07,114
(The ensemble shooting of Under Class)

2946
02:07:07,115 --> 02:07:09,625
- They don't mix well. - We can see from a distance.

2947
02:07:10,085 --> 02:07:11,954
He said, "Let's go" to me, but...

2948
02:07:11,955 --> 02:07:13,994
- He said, "Let's go" to us. - He's like a fox.

2949
02:07:13,995 --> 02:07:16,965
Jong In said, "That's not how you dance ensemble."

2950
02:07:18,465 --> 02:07:20,165
(Let's see how you do.)

2951
02:07:20,365 --> 02:07:22,365
Let's try the count one more time.

2952
02:07:22,835 --> 02:07:25,535
(The ensemble is all about the fighting spirit.)

2953
02:07:25,804 --> 02:07:26,804
Now!

2954
02:07:27,005 --> 02:07:29,103
- We can start now. - We'll begin with the music.

2955
02:07:29,104 --> 02:07:30,173
(Jong In, the ensemble leader, burns with passion.)

2956
02:07:30,174 --> 02:07:32,045
After this, you guys should move right away.

2957
02:07:32,545 --> 02:07:35,344
In the ensemble,

2958
02:07:35,814 --> 02:07:36,983
Jong In is our pillar.

2959
02:07:36,984 --> 02:07:40,184
He has a great spirit and accommodates us.

2960
02:07:40,484 --> 02:07:43,724
Would this perfect teamwork be possible without him?

2961
02:07:44,024 --> 02:07:45,154
Let's focus a little more.

2962
02:07:45,155 --> 02:07:47,424
We're almost there!

2963
02:07:48,995 --> 02:07:50,125
(The sharp ensemble is ready to be perform.)

2964
02:07:57,434 --> 02:07:58,535
They're good.

2965
02:07:59,035 --> 02:08:01,603
(Fully focused)

2966
02:08:01,604 --> 02:08:04,745
(In the perfect ensemble, Baek Sang Ha's performance is quite striking.)

2967
02:08:07,445 --> 02:08:08,545
(That's it!)

2968
02:08:08,984 --> 02:08:10,013
(We acknowledge that.)

2969
02:08:10,014 --> 02:08:12,353
- Two, three. It's the end. - That was amazing.

2970
02:08:12,354 --> 02:08:14,214
- Baek Sang Ha. - Sang Ha.

2971
02:08:14,215 --> 02:08:15,223
Sang Ha was...

2972
02:08:15,224 --> 02:08:17,924
Sang Ha was quite overwhelming.

2973
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:20,224
He crushed the stage alone.

2974
02:08:20,825 --> 02:08:26,393
(The 24 Korean dancers' Dance Film...)

2975
02:08:26,394 --> 02:08:30,564
(will be revealed shortly.)

2976
02:08:31,474 --> 02:08:32,905
Let's talk about the other classes frankly.

2977
02:08:33,005 --> 02:08:35,774
- Say whatever you want. - We're on Mnet.

2978
02:08:44,814 --> 02:08:45,854
What should I do?

2979
02:08:46,184 --> 02:08:48,924
They must be ready to bite all of us.

2980
02:08:49,554 --> 02:08:51,224
What do you think about the lead dancer?

2981
02:08:51,424 --> 02:08:53,094
The theme was "Reign of Peace."

2982
02:08:53,195 --> 02:08:56,093
But I felt like he was more of a tyrant.

2983
02:08:56,094 --> 02:08:57,394
Yes. I felt the image of a tyrant.

2984
02:08:57,825 --> 02:08:59,864
Speaking of Moo Gan,

2985
02:08:59,865 --> 02:09:02,634
I'm not sure he'd be the right fit...

2986
02:09:03,335 --> 02:09:06,035
as the lead role in other genres.

2987
02:09:06,234 --> 02:09:08,904
The aura from his face was so powerful,

2988
02:09:08,905 --> 02:09:10,844
so when he performed Ho Jong's choreography,

2989
02:09:11,245 --> 02:09:13,474
it was a bit disappointing.

2990
02:09:14,174 --> 02:09:17,285
His performance couldn't express the character.

2991
02:09:18,785 --> 02:09:21,384
Tae Yoon and Sang Gil should go down.

2992
02:09:21,585 --> 02:09:24,955
This is not a place to expect applause...

2993
02:09:25,155 --> 02:09:27,695
after performing the backhand swan.

2994
02:09:34,035 --> 02:09:36,205
Their dance was not mature enough.

2995
02:09:36,734 --> 02:09:38,034
Tae Yoon and Sang Gil behind them are just...

2996
02:09:38,035 --> 02:09:39,134
I can't see them at all.

2997
02:09:39,905 --> 02:09:42,804
Sang Gil was not powerful enough.

2998
02:09:43,045 --> 02:09:44,844
When practicing,

2999
02:09:44,945 --> 02:09:48,183
Jun Woo kept his position, at least.

3000
02:09:48,184 --> 02:09:50,414
Si Won was criticized a lot...

3001
02:09:50,415 --> 02:09:53,115
due to his mistake of going into the center...

3002
02:09:53,255 --> 02:09:55,523
almost every day.

3003
02:09:55,524 --> 02:09:57,423
That was a bit disappointing.

3004
02:09:57,424 --> 02:09:59,394
"One, two, and..." He never did this...

3005
02:09:59,894 --> 02:10:00,994
at the right time.

3006
02:10:00,995 --> 02:10:03,365
He was the only one who moved slowly until the end.

3007
02:10:03,564 --> 02:10:04,934
He did that until the end.

3008
02:10:05,535 --> 02:10:08,803
Si Won was at the very front,

3009
02:10:08,804 --> 02:10:11,035
but he kept missing the beat.

3010
02:10:11,405 --> 02:10:13,504
If he were performing alone, that doesn't matter.

3011
02:10:13,505 --> 02:10:15,575
But this was an ensemble, so it wasn't so good.

3012
02:10:16,104 --> 02:10:17,574
I have...

3013
02:10:17,575 --> 02:10:19,915
a high expectation from Jong Cheol.

3014
02:10:20,014 --> 02:10:22,085
He couldn't show what his role was.

3015
02:10:22,415 --> 02:10:24,755
Personally, I couldn't see any from him.

3016
02:10:26,554 --> 02:10:27,854
(Jong Cheol made many mistakes during the Dance Film shoot.)

3017
02:10:28,085 --> 02:10:29,785
He seems very unstable.

3018
02:10:30,024 --> 02:10:32,324
I think...

3019
02:10:32,325 --> 02:10:34,393
that he showed his great abilities...

3020
02:10:34,394 --> 02:10:37,564
through his steady practice.

3021
02:10:38,264 --> 02:10:40,234
To me,

3022
02:10:40,934 --> 02:10:44,505
It didn't feel like he tried.

3023
02:10:46,505 --> 02:10:48,574
When it comes to Under Class, I can easily see...

3024
02:10:48,575 --> 02:10:50,945
Anyone could tell who was the worst.

3025
02:10:51,415 --> 02:10:53,014
- Sang Ha? - Yes, Sang Ha.

3026
02:10:53,314 --> 02:10:54,544
In today's shoot,

3027
02:10:54,545 --> 02:10:57,285
Sang Ha was dominant.

3028
02:10:57,814 --> 02:10:59,053
Actually, Jong In doesn't deserve...

3029
02:10:59,054 --> 02:11:02,124
- to be in the Under Class. - Right.

3030
02:11:02,125 --> 02:11:04,483
The first impression I got from Jong In...

3031
02:11:04,484 --> 02:11:07,755
during the Physical and Technique Audition was that he seemed cheap.

3032
02:11:08,625 --> 02:11:09,665
I'm really sorry.

3033
02:11:09,825 --> 02:11:12,433
But as I kept watching him, I could see he wanted to dance.

3034
02:11:12,434 --> 02:11:13,995
And he was good.

3035
02:11:14,094 --> 02:11:16,103
I want to see him in the upper class...

3036
02:11:16,104 --> 02:11:18,905
and enjoy it as much as he wants. I'm curious.

3037
02:11:19,234 --> 02:11:22,473
During the practice,

3038
02:11:22,474 --> 02:11:24,915
- he led them in a way. - I know.

3039
02:11:25,274 --> 02:11:26,944
Let's count together.

3040
02:11:26,945 --> 02:11:30,844
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

3041
02:11:31,115 --> 02:11:33,884
One, two, and do it right away on three.

3042
02:11:34,825 --> 02:11:37,353
The quality of the group dance was good this time.

3043
02:11:37,354 --> 02:11:40,754
I think it would've been impossible without Jong In.

3044
02:11:40,755 --> 02:11:41,894
He's a good dancer himself too.

3045
02:11:41,965 --> 02:11:44,594
I wrote, "The core of the ensemble."

3046
02:11:45,995 --> 02:11:48,204
It's really hard to pick the First Class.

3047
02:11:48,205 --> 02:11:50,704
During practice,

3048
02:11:50,705 --> 02:11:53,504
I think Ho Jong led them,

3049
02:11:53,505 --> 02:11:54,633
not Moo Gan.

3050
02:11:54,634 --> 02:11:58,544
From what I saw during practice too,

3051
02:11:58,545 --> 02:12:00,415
Ho Jong was almost a perfect dancer.

3052
02:12:00,814 --> 02:12:02,584
Even when I saw him from time to time,

3053
02:12:02,585 --> 02:12:04,313
it felt like his presence filled the entire space.

3054
02:12:04,314 --> 02:12:06,614
Whenever the camera panned to him, it raised the quality.

3055
02:12:06,615 --> 02:12:08,084
Right.

3056
02:12:08,085 --> 02:12:09,085
His hand moves.

3057
02:12:09,086 --> 02:12:10,553
It's still in my head.

3058
02:12:10,554 --> 02:12:12,394
When the camera zoomed in on his hands.

3059
02:12:18,535 --> 02:12:19,563
(Korean Dance)

3060
02:12:19,564 --> 02:12:21,364
(Ballet)

3061
02:12:21,365 --> 02:12:22,434
(Contemporary Dance)

3062
02:12:23,005 --> 02:12:25,434
(3 genres and 3 classes will come together.)

3063
02:12:25,974 --> 02:12:27,004
What's this?

3064
02:12:27,005 --> 02:12:28,035
(What is this grandeur and reverent place?)

3065
02:12:28,075 --> 02:12:30,273
- It's interesting. - It's for the class evaluation.

3066
02:12:30,274 --> 02:12:31,274
(The contemporary dancers enter in neat suits.)

3067
02:12:31,615 --> 02:12:32,945
The scale is so big.

3068
02:12:33,745 --> 02:12:35,285
(Confident)

3069
02:12:35,984 --> 02:12:37,045
Amazing.

3070
02:12:37,384 --> 02:12:38,414
It's crazy.

3071
02:12:38,415 --> 02:12:39,484
(What is this place for?)

3072
02:12:41,585 --> 02:12:42,585
Look at the chairs.

3073
02:12:42,924 --> 02:12:44,353
- What's this? - This is ridiculous.

3074
02:12:44,354 --> 02:12:45,393
People in the Under Class...

3075
02:12:45,394 --> 02:12:46,424
- should sit on the ground. - I know.

3076
02:12:46,455 --> 02:12:47,494
I'm upset.

3077
02:12:47,495 --> 02:12:48,524
The chairs are different.

3078
02:12:48,764 --> 02:12:50,264
They got sofas for the First Class.

3079
02:12:50,495 --> 02:12:52,563
They should've given us cushions, at least.

3080
02:12:52,564 --> 02:12:54,295
We're in the Under Class. What can we expect?

3081
02:12:55,705 --> 02:12:56,705
(At that moment, the 3 people in 1st Class make a casual entrance.)

3082
02:12:56,706 --> 02:12:57,864
The VIP seats.

3083
02:12:57,865 --> 02:12:59,034
These seats are for the kings.

3084
02:12:59,035 --> 02:13:00,134
The First Class.

3085
02:13:00,934 --> 02:13:02,005
This is awesome.

3086
02:13:03,075 --> 02:13:05,313
They treat the First Class differently.

3087
02:13:05,314 --> 02:13:06,545
I'm very satisfied.

3088
02:13:08,144 --> 02:13:09,683
It's a gift for the First Class...

3089
02:13:09,684 --> 02:13:13,683
and motivation for the Second and Under Classes.

3090
02:13:13,684 --> 02:13:14,755
I envied them.

3091
02:13:15,024 --> 02:13:16,984
The 1st Class we were in at 1st wasn't a true 1st Class.

3092
02:13:17,424 --> 02:13:18,524
- Right? - Yes.

3093
02:13:19,024 --> 02:13:20,894
I really want to sit there.

3094
02:13:21,195 --> 02:13:22,394
It's a society based on class.

3095
02:13:23,064 --> 02:13:24,795
(The ballet dancers appear later.)

3096
02:13:25,335 --> 02:13:26,564
(The princes march with an upright posture.)

3097
02:13:29,804 --> 02:13:30,904
Hello.

3098
02:13:30,905 --> 02:13:31,905
(Half clapping, half scanning)

3099
02:13:32,705 --> 02:13:34,005
The ballet dancers are in the center.

3100
02:13:34,205 --> 02:13:36,005
The seats for the First Class are amazing.

3101
02:13:37,774 --> 02:13:40,375
I think he's really good-looking. Was it Kang Gyeong Ho?

3102
02:13:40,615 --> 02:13:41,915
This seat puts me under pressure.

3103
02:13:43,215 --> 02:13:44,245
- They're different. - Yes.

3104
02:13:44,585 --> 02:13:46,155
They do all look like ballet dancers.

3105
02:13:46,585 --> 02:13:47,615
The princes.

3106
02:13:48,054 --> 02:13:49,255
Real princes.

3107
02:13:49,825 --> 02:13:52,795
We're like beasts, while they're...

3108
02:13:53,424 --> 02:13:54,694
They look like...

3109
02:13:54,695 --> 02:13:56,125
- over-sheltered flowers. - Yes.

3110
02:13:56,295 --> 02:13:58,094
- But it's the beasts that survive. - Right.

3111
02:13:58,264 --> 02:14:00,934
You can just pull out the flowers in the greenhouse.

3112
02:14:01,535 --> 02:14:03,233
- We're born different. - Yes. We're born different.

3113
02:14:03,234 --> 02:14:04,304
Nothing can be done.

3114
02:14:04,835 --> 02:14:06,534
We're born to be royal.

3115
02:14:06,535 --> 02:14:07,575
Right.

3116
02:14:07,734 --> 02:14:08,875
Do you like it there, Sung Wook?

3117
02:14:09,575 --> 02:14:11,673
- It's so uncomfortable. - Do you like it?

3118
02:14:11,674 --> 02:14:12,714
(No words are needed.)

3119
02:14:12,715 --> 02:14:13,715
That seat.

3120
02:14:14,984 --> 02:14:17,014
- What is it like to be there? - You're annoying.

3121
02:14:17,745 --> 02:14:21,415
I was so jealous and annoyed.

3122
02:14:22,125 --> 02:14:23,585
I wanted to pull the chair back.

3123
02:14:23,924 --> 02:14:26,524
Here come the scholars.

3124
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:29,865
(The scholars are entering.)

3125
02:14:31,224 --> 02:14:32,335
Everyone has great proportions.

3126
02:14:33,695 --> 02:14:34,835
They're all good-looking.

3127
02:14:37,005 --> 02:14:38,604
They give off different vibes.

3128
02:14:40,205 --> 02:14:41,335
- They're scary. - They're scary.

3129
02:14:42,304 --> 02:14:45,415
(The Korean dancers in the First Class take their seats.)

3130
02:14:45,715 --> 02:14:48,144
The Korean dancers look unique.

3131
02:14:48,585 --> 02:14:51,545
The Korean dancers are definitely charismatic.

3132
02:14:52,484 --> 02:14:53,585
They're scary.

3133
02:14:54,415 --> 02:14:56,455
The long hair makes them look charismatic.

3134
02:14:58,024 --> 02:14:59,024
He has come.

3135
02:14:59,125 --> 02:15:00,155
He came out.

3136
02:15:00,325 --> 02:15:01,524
(Turning his head)

3137
02:15:01,795 --> 02:15:02,965
(Ta-da)

3138
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:05,994
(The MC has come.)

3139
02:15:05,995 --> 02:15:07,165
He has very long legs.

3140
02:15:07,535 --> 02:15:09,233
The class battle of dancers...

3141
02:15:09,234 --> 02:15:11,464
where they fight with their bodies. Stage Fighter.

3142
02:15:11,465 --> 02:15:13,104
Hello, I'm MC Kang Daniel.

3143
02:15:13,205 --> 02:15:14,804
(Everyone is cheering.)

3144
02:15:15,405 --> 02:15:17,005
(Welcoming applause)

3145
02:15:17,304 --> 02:15:20,274
Stage Fighter has a strict class system.

3146
02:15:20,445 --> 02:15:22,114
You have played your assigned roles...

3147
02:15:22,115 --> 02:15:24,514
and finished the genre-specific Dance Films.

3148
02:15:25,115 --> 02:15:27,483
Dancer Go Dong Hoon, you were in the ensemble.

3149
02:15:27,484 --> 02:15:29,183
Were you jealous...

3150
02:15:29,184 --> 02:15:31,354
of the lead and supporting dancers?

3151
02:15:31,724 --> 02:15:34,125
I'm sharpening my knife for the next time.

3152
02:15:34,495 --> 02:15:37,195
What if you become an ensemble again in the next mission?

3153
02:15:38,064 --> 02:15:40,594
I can assure you that I'll never become an ensemble.

3154
02:15:41,165 --> 02:15:43,665
- That's good. - It hurt my pride a lot.

3155
02:15:44,365 --> 02:15:46,234
I thought I should shut up and go up.

3156
02:15:46,505 --> 02:15:48,273
Dancer Kim Tae Seok.

3157
02:15:48,274 --> 02:15:51,773
You were demoted from the First Class to the Under Class.

3158
02:15:51,774 --> 02:15:55,014
What did you think, looking at the lead and supporting dancers?

3159
02:15:55,445 --> 02:15:57,115
Their seats are mine now.

3160
02:15:57,984 --> 02:15:59,615
(Surprised)

3161
02:16:00,285 --> 02:16:02,755
They won't have a chance from now on.

3162
02:16:02,984 --> 02:16:04,054
- That was good. - Bravo.

3163
02:16:04,484 --> 02:16:07,795
People can have different opinions.

3164
02:16:08,295 --> 02:16:09,594
I respect that, but nothing more.

3165
02:16:10,195 --> 02:16:12,264
I want to be promoted to the First Class, no matter what.

3166
02:16:12,965 --> 02:16:14,964
From now on, we will begin the class evaluation...

3167
02:16:14,965 --> 02:16:16,633
through the Dance Film.

3168
02:16:16,634 --> 02:16:18,034
We've conducted a vote to select candidates...

3169
02:16:18,035 --> 02:16:20,574
for promotion and demotion...

3170
02:16:20,575 --> 02:16:22,344
from classes other than your own.

3171
02:16:22,604 --> 02:16:24,103
Which one among us will go up?

3172
02:16:24,104 --> 02:16:25,244
"I think we need to communicate."

3173
02:16:25,245 --> 02:16:27,115
I think my comment was too harsh.

3174
02:16:27,215 --> 02:16:29,415
Think that their comments will be harsh as well.

3175
02:16:29,545 --> 02:16:30,615
It's a survival.

3176
02:16:30,884 --> 02:16:32,715
The ones that stood out to me the most are...

3177
02:16:35,354 --> 02:16:36,624
They stood out to me.

3178
02:16:36,625 --> 02:16:37,985
Even during practice,

3179
02:16:38,055 --> 02:16:39,093
- I wondered... - His moves suited it.

3180
02:16:39,094 --> 02:16:40,295
why he was in the Under Class.

3181
02:16:40,455 --> 02:16:43,664
You've selected the final candidates for promotion and demotion.

3182
02:16:43,965 --> 02:16:46,064
Among these candidates,

3183
02:16:46,065 --> 02:16:49,134
the Master, the Coaches, and the Rehearsal Director...

3184
02:16:49,135 --> 02:16:51,934
will decide on the dancers to be promoted or demoted.

3185
02:16:52,174 --> 02:16:55,403
I'm interested to see what the finished product will look like.

3186
02:16:55,404 --> 02:16:57,144
Shall we check the candidates...

3187
02:16:57,145 --> 02:16:58,913
chosen by the dancers?

3188
02:16:58,914 --> 02:17:02,144
I guess they picked him as he took the lead many times.

3189
02:17:02,145 --> 02:17:04,315
- And I think it would be... - But...

3190
02:17:04,545 --> 02:17:06,684
- He'll have to go. - two candidates for demotion...

3191
02:17:07,684 --> 02:17:09,254
(The evaluation was conducted carefully after a lengthy meeting.)

3192
02:17:09,455 --> 02:17:10,485
What do I do?

3193
02:17:11,285 --> 02:17:13,823
He's going to go down from the top. It's a cool-headed...

3194
02:17:13,824 --> 02:17:16,064
Who are the candidates for promotion and demotion...

3195
02:17:16,065 --> 02:17:18,395
picked by the dancers in the same genre?

3196
02:17:19,164 --> 02:17:20,895
We have nowhere to go down.

3197
02:17:21,035 --> 02:17:22,735
I think it's possible this time.

3198
02:17:23,465 --> 02:17:26,674
I don't want to think that I will be demoted.

3199
02:17:27,774 --> 02:17:30,545
I should keep my position. Who else can be in the First Class?

3200
02:17:31,045 --> 02:17:33,273
Some of the dancers in the Second Class...

3201
02:17:33,274 --> 02:17:36,214
should be demoted.

3202
02:17:36,215 --> 02:17:37,985
The change should be made quickly.

3203
02:17:38,654 --> 02:17:40,353
We will begin the class evaluation...

3204
02:17:40,354 --> 02:17:41,954
through the genre-specific Dance Film.

3205
02:17:41,955 --> 02:17:43,184
The first class evaluation...

3206
02:17:44,285 --> 02:17:45,455
is Korean dance.

3207
02:17:46,055 --> 02:17:47,594
(The first Dance Film class evaluation is Korean dance.)

3208
02:17:48,594 --> 02:17:50,094
- Come on. - Let's go!

3209
02:17:50,795 --> 02:17:51,894
(The lead dancer is calm.)

3210
02:17:51,895 --> 02:17:53,993
The class evaluation will be conducted...

3211
02:17:53,994 --> 02:17:55,564
through the Korean Dance Film,

3212
02:17:55,565 --> 02:17:57,334
"The King's Wish: Reign of Peace."

3213
02:17:57,904 --> 02:17:59,773
(The Korean Dance Film is revealed.)

3214
02:17:59,774 --> 02:18:01,135
I'm nervous.

3215
02:18:01,375 --> 02:18:02,604
It's a battle.

3216
02:18:03,375 --> 02:18:05,614
I'm excited about Korean Dance the most.

3217
02:18:05,615 --> 02:18:06,615
Me too.

3218
02:18:06,815 --> 02:18:07,815
I think it'll come out well.

3219
02:18:08,045 --> 02:18:09,045
It's already cool.

3220
02:18:09,485 --> 02:18:12,753
- "Reign of Peace." - The scale must be big.

3221
02:18:12,754 --> 02:18:14,854
It has a huge scale.

3222
02:18:15,014 --> 02:18:16,654
I'm so excited.

3223
02:18:17,354 --> 02:18:19,295
My heart has never beaten so fast since I came here.

(Korean Dance Film)

3225
02:18:21,594 --> 02:18:22,895
I hope it turned out well.

3226
02:18:23,094 --> 02:18:24,324
I think it will show a palace.

3227
02:18:24,824 --> 02:18:26,663
It'll be epic from the beginning.

(Lead dancers, Supporting dancers, Ensemble)

3229
02:18:28,805 --> 02:18:30,965
- The scale is different. - Oh, my gosh.

3230
02:18:31,404 --> 02:18:32,475
It's crazy. What's this?

3231
02:18:34,104 --> 02:18:35,174
I'm excited.

I hope it turned out well.

3235
02:18:39,475 --> 02:18:40,615
I think it will show a palace.

3236
02:18:41,344 --> 02:18:42,984

The Chief State Councilor.

3243
02:18:59,764 --> 02:19:00,895
It looks like a period drama.

3244
02:19:04,365 --> 02:19:05,374
He's the King.

3245
02:19:05,375 --> 02:19:06,375
Oh, my. Moo Gan.

3246
02:19:06,635 --> 02:19:07,805

(The King's figure)

3251
02:19:20,584 --> 02:19:22,253
It's a period drama itself.

3252
02:19:22,254 --> 02:19:23,485
He's so charismatic.

3253
02:19:28,524 --> 02:19:29,664
Choi Ho Jong.

3254
02:19:30,295 --> 02:19:31,994
The way he expressed that with his fingertips is crazy.

3256

It's his solo dance. The main one.

(Play the instruments)

3276
02:20:28,354 --> 02:20:29,885
They shouldn't have filmed the video there. It's too good.

Look at the transition.

- What? - The atmosphere is crazy.

3286
02:20:50,744 --> 02:20:52,014
The quality is amazing.

- The line is beautiful. - Jun Woo was nice.

3289
02:21:01,115 --> 02:21:04,584
Dancer Park Jun Woo... I don't know what to do.

3290
02:21:04,785 --> 02:21:05,924
He stands out so much.

The Chief State Councilor and the Left State Councilor catch eyes.

3293
02:21:17,434 --> 02:21:18,434
Yes.

I like it.

3297
02:21:34,914 --> 02:21:36,554

It's so exciting.

3304
02:21:48,635 --> 02:21:49,635
Oh, my.

3305
02:21:50,604 --> 02:21:52,433
- Ho Jong and Jong Cheol. - And Jong Cheol.

3306
02:21:52,434 --> 02:21:53,774
They stole the spotlight.

3307
02:21:55,504 --> 02:21:57,174
There you go.

3308
02:21:58,705 --> 02:21:59,913
(Show us the group dance!)

3309
02:21:59,914 --> 02:22:00,914
Let's go!

3310
02:22:01,715 --> 02:22:02,814
It's cool.

3311
02:22:02,815 --> 02:22:03,815
It's so cool.

3312
02:22:05,785 --> 02:22:07,154
The outdoor shoot wasn't easy, but it's worth it.

3313
02:22:07,385 --> 02:22:08,824
It's so cool.

3314
02:22:09,324 --> 02:22:10,924
- They're in sync. - It's incredible.

3316
02:22:13,695 --> 02:22:14,725
(Impressed)

3317
02:22:16,264 --> 02:22:17,464
They're doing the jaban.

3318
02:22:17,465 --> 02:22:19,164
- Look at the quality. - I got goosebumps.

3319
02:22:19,334 --> 02:22:20,864
Jun Woo looks so cool.

3320
02:22:20,865 --> 02:22:21,895
This is awesome.

3321
02:22:24,135 --> 02:22:25,135
(Come on!)

3322
02:22:26,205 --> 02:22:27,205
The dancers are upstairs too.

3323
02:22:27,604 --> 02:22:29,004
This scene is so cool.

3324

(You can watch the dancers' full performances on The CHOOM.)

3328
02:22:40,955 --> 02:22:43,924
(You can listen to the music in the Dance Film on various platforms.)

3329
02:22:44,985 --> 02:22:47,354
(This is Korean dance!)

3330
02:22:47,625 --> 02:22:48,754
It came out well.

3331
02:22:48,994 --> 02:22:50,565
- This is Korean dance. - You got this.

3332
02:22:50,725 --> 02:22:52,735
- What's with the standing ovation? - It's so cool.

3333
02:22:53,264 --> 02:22:54,295
Bravo!

3334
02:22:55,094 --> 02:22:56,264
(It's the best!)

3335
02:22:56,635 --> 02:22:57,664
It was cool.

3336
02:22:57,904 --> 02:22:59,503
The group dance was crazy.

3337
02:22:59,504 --> 02:23:00,975
First off, the group dance was nice.

3338
02:23:01,334 --> 02:23:03,375
The group dance was insane.

3339
02:23:03,504 --> 02:23:05,304
- Why are you so handsome? - Me?

3340
02:23:05,305 --> 02:23:06,815
- Your face came out. - I looked like this.

3341
02:23:06,945 --> 02:23:08,045
(He's ecstatic.)

3342
02:23:08,344 --> 02:23:11,314
The ensemble owned the moment.

3343
02:23:11,315 --> 02:23:14,054
Sang Ha was overwhelmingly superior to the others...

3344
02:23:14,055 --> 02:23:16,924
that I didn't even wonder about the 2nd or the 1st Classes.

3345
02:23:17,184 --> 02:23:18,184
It was insane.

3346
02:23:18,485 --> 02:23:20,625
The ensemble couldn't have done better.

3347
02:23:20,994 --> 02:23:24,464
Everyone did a great job.

3348
02:23:24,465 --> 02:23:27,093
If I make a mistake, it looks like everyone makes a mistake.

3349
02:23:27,094 --> 02:23:29,434
So I thought I should pour everything into it.

3350
02:23:29,635 --> 02:23:30,735
It came out well.

3351
02:23:31,035 --> 02:23:32,574
But they didn't show us.

3352
02:23:32,904 --> 02:23:34,204
They didn't show us.

3353
02:23:34,205 --> 02:23:35,674
The trio dance could've been a little better.

3354
02:23:35,904 --> 02:23:37,475
Sang Ha was the main character.

3355
02:23:38,475 --> 02:23:40,174
I couldn't see the lead dancer.

3356
02:23:41,475 --> 02:23:42,784
I'm the main lead dancer.

3357
02:23:42,785 --> 02:23:45,013
But the group dance scene was the best.

3358
02:23:45,014 --> 02:23:46,385
I'm a little worried.

3359
02:23:46,584 --> 02:23:49,583
I thought the ensemble was amazing.

3360
02:23:49,584 --> 02:23:50,885
Some of them will be promoted from the Under Class.

3361
02:23:51,555 --> 02:23:53,593
From now on, we will reveal the final number and names...

3362
02:23:53,594 --> 02:23:55,295
of the candidates for promotion and demotion in each class,

3363
02:23:55,795 --> 02:23:58,864
chosen by the Korean dancers themselves...

3364
02:23:58,865 --> 02:24:01,264
in the other classes.

3365
02:24:01,465 --> 02:24:03,503
Korean dance, the First Class.

3366
02:24:03,504 --> 02:24:05,604
I'll announce the candidates for demotion.

3367
02:24:06,074 --> 02:24:07,635
- I can't make any predictions. - Here it comes.

3368
02:24:08,305 --> 02:24:10,503
I don't know which ones in the First Class are candidates for demotion.

3369
02:24:10,504 --> 02:24:11,504
Right?

3370
02:24:11,975 --> 02:24:13,045
How should I put it?

3371
02:24:13,244 --> 02:24:15,374
I was...

3372
02:24:15,375 --> 02:24:17,183
quite indifferent.

3373
02:24:17,184 --> 02:24:20,315
The number of final candidates for demotion in the First Class...

3374
02:24:20,985 --> 02:24:22,384
chosen by people in the other classes is two in total.

3375
02:24:22,385 --> 02:24:23,524
(Exclaiming)

3376
02:24:23,824 --> 02:24:24,854
(Sulking)

3377
02:24:25,455 --> 02:24:26,725
Only one of them survived?

3378
02:24:26,994 --> 02:24:29,865
The 1st candidate for demotion in the 1st Class is...

3379
02:24:30,094 --> 02:24:31,194
Jong Cheol?

3380
02:24:31,195 --> 02:24:32,465
(Gasping)

3381
02:24:33,164 --> 02:24:34,594
(Jong Cheol?)

3382
02:24:34,895 --> 02:24:36,965
I have no expectations.

3383
02:24:37,135 --> 02:24:39,735
I was ready to accept the result.

3384
02:24:40,205 --> 02:24:42,204
The video was so cool.

3385
02:24:42,205 --> 02:24:43,944
But why do I feel like I'll be demoted?

3386
02:24:43,945 --> 02:24:47,975
I hoped they would compete against each other without an issue.

3387
02:24:48,315 --> 02:24:49,715
Because it wasn't my business.

3388
02:24:49,844 --> 02:24:51,385
The candidate for demotion in the First Class...

3389
02:24:52,584 --> 02:24:54,315
is Dancer Ki Moo Gan.

3390
02:24:54,785 --> 02:24:56,225
(He tries to stay calm.)

3391
02:24:56,584 --> 02:24:58,084
(Surprised)

3392
02:24:58,385 --> 02:25:00,055
(Surprised)

3393
02:25:00,395 --> 02:25:02,195
(The unexpected result surprised the dancers.)

3394
02:25:02,695 --> 02:25:04,725
He's the first one to be revealed.

3395
02:25:05,764 --> 02:25:08,164
I've had a bad feeling since the morning.

3396
02:25:09,235 --> 02:25:11,904
I had a bad dream.

3397
02:25:12,574 --> 02:25:14,433
The dancer who picked Dancer Ki Moo Gan as a candidate is...

3398
02:25:14,434 --> 02:25:16,705
Please don't say my name.

3399
02:25:17,445 --> 02:25:18,705
- This is bad. - Please.

3400
02:25:18,875 --> 02:25:19,914
I have a bad feeling.

3401
02:25:20,914 --> 02:25:22,314
- Who would it be? - Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon...

3402
02:25:22,315 --> 02:25:25,145
- in the Second Class... - Hey.

3403
02:25:25,385 --> 02:25:27,884
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon in Second Class...

3404
02:25:27,885 --> 02:25:31,485
wrote that the Main Lead Dancer Ki Moo Gan in First Class...

3405
02:25:31,754 --> 02:25:33,494
suited the role,

3406
02:25:34,924 --> 02:25:36,163
(Interested)

3407
02:25:36,164 --> 02:25:37,725
but his dancing skills were lacking.

3408
02:25:38,524 --> 02:25:39,535
(Glancing)

3409
02:25:39,865 --> 02:25:41,365
Goodness.

3410
02:25:41,834 --> 02:25:43,003
(I saw him writing it!)

3411
02:25:43,004 --> 02:25:44,135
He talked about his dance?

3412
02:25:45,205 --> 02:25:46,475
- This is bad. - Dance?

3413
02:25:47,604 --> 02:25:49,173
(Kim Kyu Nyeon isn't here.)

3414
02:25:49,174 --> 02:25:51,074
This is what Dancer Choi Ji Won in Under Class wrote.

3415
02:25:51,445 --> 02:25:53,045
- It's you. - Why did he mention my name?

3416
02:25:53,074 --> 02:25:55,885
"Is he the King that suits the Reign of Peace?"

3417
02:25:56,115 --> 02:25:57,744
He read exactly what was written.

3418
02:25:58,744 --> 02:26:00,013
He was really good,

3419
02:26:00,014 --> 02:26:02,784
but he felt like a tyrant, rather than a king.

3420
02:26:02,785 --> 02:26:04,254
A tyrant?

3421
02:26:04,754 --> 02:26:05,993
(He was like a tyrant.)

3422
02:26:05,994 --> 02:26:07,554
"I liked his expressions and moves,"

3423
02:26:07,555 --> 02:26:09,465
"but Dancer Choi Ho Jong caught my attention more."

3424
02:26:09,895 --> 02:26:11,195
That's his comment.

3425
02:26:12,195 --> 02:26:14,534
- I can tell Moo Gan is mad. - Dancers in the other classes...

3426
02:26:14,535 --> 02:26:15,763
(Aura of anger)

3427
02:26:15,764 --> 02:26:17,465
I'll keep that in mind.

3428
02:26:18,565 --> 02:26:20,535
(I'm scared.)

3429
02:26:21,535 --> 02:26:23,244
I think we made a mistake.

3430
02:26:24,045 --> 02:26:26,013
I'm so scared.

3431
02:26:26,014 --> 02:26:27,173
I can't breathe.

3432
02:26:27,174 --> 02:26:29,314
"Everyone was talking about Ki Moo Gan,"

3433
02:26:29,315 --> 02:26:31,044
"but he's not special." I'm afraid they might say that.

3434
02:26:31,045 --> 02:26:32,385
I'm embarrassed.

3435
02:26:32,584 --> 02:26:34,913
Listening to their honest opinions,

3436
02:26:34,914 --> 02:26:36,725
I thought, "I'm sure I'm still better than you."

3437
02:26:37,354 --> 02:26:42,024
(Next Week, the Class Movement Ceremony for Korean dance begins.)

3438
02:26:42,494 --> 02:26:44,464
(Another candidate in the Korean dance First Class...)

3439
02:26:44,465 --> 02:26:45,624
(for demotion is revealed.)

3440
02:26:45,625 --> 02:26:47,564
(Dancer)

3441
02:26:47,565 --> 02:26:49,234
(What? What happened?)

3442
02:26:49,235 --> 02:26:50,464
(Everyone is frozen.)

3443
02:26:50,465 --> 02:26:51,734
(Jaw-dropping)

3444
02:26:51,735 --> 02:26:53,573
(It's cruel.)

3445
02:26:53,574 --> 02:26:55,234
(Is this a dream?)

3446
02:26:55,235 --> 02:26:57,903
(This is the comment on Dancer Choi Ho Jong in the First Class...)

3447
02:26:57,904 --> 02:26:59,774
(made by Dancer Kim In Su in the Under Class.)

3448
02:27:00,945 --> 02:27:03,444
(I do think Ki Moo Gan...)

3449
02:27:03,445 --> 02:27:04,913
(executed his role well.)

3450
02:27:04,914 --> 02:27:06,513
(It's vicious.)

3451
02:27:06,514 --> 02:27:07,715
(It's cruel.)

3452
02:27:08,115 --> 02:27:09,454
(I was really surprised.)

3453
02:27:09,455 --> 02:27:12,125
(Does it mean it was relatively worse?)

3454
02:27:12,955 --> 02:27:15,294
(Choi Ho Jong and Ki Moo Gan, please check your classes...)

3455
02:27:15,295 --> 02:27:17,064
(in the Class Confirmation Zone.)

3456
02:27:17,065 --> 02:27:18,394
(I didn't expect it.)

3457
02:27:18,395 --> 02:27:19,395
(It got me surprised.)

3458
02:27:19,396 --> 02:27:22,934
(The two dancers became speechless after checking their classes.)

3459
02:27:23,434 --> 02:27:27,305
(Please go to the Class Locker Room.)

3460
02:27:27,535 --> 02:27:29,034
(First, Second, Under)

3461
02:27:29,035 --> 02:27:31,174
(The locker rooms are divided according to the classes.)

3462
02:27:33,414 --> 02:27:35,784
(All the blood rushed to my head.)

3463
02:27:35,785 --> 02:27:38,314
(My hands were numb...)

3464
02:27:38,315 --> 02:27:39,914
(and shaking.)

3465
02:27:40,315 --> 02:27:46,195
(My heart is beating so fast.)

3466
02:27:46,761 --> 02:27:50,859
(What will happen to the Korean dancers in the First Class?)
