1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,820
(Stage Fighter)

2
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:19,263
(Last week after the Class
Movement Ceremony)

3
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:20,384
(The results are out today.)

4
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:22,403
(The eight main lead
roles and directors...)

5
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:24,204
(were chosen by the public.)

6
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,474
(Stage Choice by Public
Mission will finally start.)

7
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:29,943
(He killed it already.)

8
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:36,743
(Eight intense and splendid performances)

9
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:39,914
(Cheering)

10
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,914
(Endless admiration)

11
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,453
(The scene you can't take your eyes off)

12
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:44,753
Oh, my gosh.

13
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:46,653
(Hye Hyun might get 1st place.)

14
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,692
(Moo Gan's choreography is amazing.)

15
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:50,222
(We might lose.)

16
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:52,294
(Don't say such things out loud.)

17
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:54,862
(I can't guess the result.)

18
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:57,062
(What is the result of
Stage Choice by Public?)

19
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:58,103
(Revealing the finalists)

20
00:00:58,104 --> 00:00:59,303
(The finalists are revealed.)

21
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,532
(All Under Classes are eliminated.)

22
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,642
(After another Class Movement
Ceremony and elimination, )

23
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,442
(who will become the finalists?)

24
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:06,543
(Sighing)

25
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:08,373
(The eliminated dancer...)

26
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:10,383
(is...)

27
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:11,384
(He's eliminated?)

28
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:12,384
(Eliminated?)

29
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:13,613
(It's unbelievable.)

30
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:16,052
(I'll cry if you cry.)

31
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,853
(The result that shocked
and made everyone cry...)

32
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:20,222
(will be revealed soon.)

33
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:22,052
(I'm sorry.)

34
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:25,964
(The performances the dancers
completed with all their efforts)

35
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:29,302
(It's finally time to
reveal it to the public.)

36
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:32,403
(The audience enters.)

37
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,873
(The audience makes
this mission more special.)

38
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:38,642
(The audience is here to cheer
the dancer they are rooting for.)

39
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:39,673
Start.

40
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,583
(Stage Fighter)

41
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:48,853
(The MC appears.)

42
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,223
(Oh, my gosh.)

43
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:51,224
(It's Kang Daniel!)

44
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,052
The merciless class battle of dancers...

45
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:54,753
where they fight with their bodies.

46
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:56,724
Stage Fighter. Hi, I'm MC Kang Daniel.

47
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,423
(It's nice to see you!)

48
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:01,493
It's really starting.

49
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,004
- What now? - Let's do our best.

50
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,362
I'm getting excited.

51
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:05,403
(He's nervous.)

52
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:06,634
I'm shaking.

53
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:07,933
This mission...

54
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,943
(My chief's first choice, Kang Gyeong Ho)

55
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,172
(Stage Choice by Public Mission)

56
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,583
It's Stage Choice by Public
Mission with the audience.

57
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:19,753
This is our first-ever mission to invite...

58
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,613
the audience to Stage Fighter.

59
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,622
For today's stage,

60
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:26,694
guests with special connections
with Stage Fighter are here with us.

61
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,493
Firstly, actress Oh Na Ra
sitting with the audience.

62
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:32,063
(Feeling shy)

63
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,593
Hi.

64
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:35,333
Is it Oh Na Ra?

65
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,004
(Surprised)

66
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,273
She graduated from Anyang Arts High School.

67
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:43,974
I once delivered a mission to
the dancers through a video.

68
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:48,043
(To the dancers, )

69
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:53,883
(actress Oh Na Ra delivered the
K-Contents Mission through a video.)

70
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:58,623
I heard the rumor that the dancers
were very happy to watch the video.

71
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,152
It made me happy too.

72
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:02,923
So I'm here to check if the rumor is true.

73
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,323
(Very excited)

74
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:06,263
(Being serious and taking a video of it)

75
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:07,962
She's a real beauty.

76
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:10,164
- I'm going to ask for an autograph.
- Me too.

77
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:13,432
Please relax. Do your best...

78
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:17,104
and show off your skills
to your heart's content.

79
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:24,414
All right. I'll make her my
fan with my dance today.

80
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:26,112
(He's got the spirit.)

81
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:29,323
We have other special
guests with us here today.

82
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,823
It's the family of the dancers...

83
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:35,324
performing today's mission.

84
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:36,784
It's a pleasure to meet you.

85
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:38,493
(Welcome.)

86
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:40,164
(Sung Hun Mo's mother)

87
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:42,110
(Kim Hyun Ho's sister-in-law,
Kim Hyun Ho's brother)

88
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,203
That's my older brother.

89
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:44,403
(His brother is here.)

90
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:47,203
- My brother and sister-in-law.
- You two look alike.

91
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,234
- Really? - Yes.

92
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:51,443
He has my name written on it.

93
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:52,444
(Smiling)

94
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:55,784
Let's dash.

95
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:57,842
The main lead roles of this mission...

96
00:03:57,843 --> 00:03:59,653
were cast through the public's voting.

97
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:02,983
Those main lead roles
will perform today's mission.

98
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,283
For this mission, the dancers chose...

99
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:07,152
one of the concept keywords,

100
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,722
including addiction, dash,
salvation, and nightmare.

101
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:12,733
They revealed their
choreography, which was used...

102
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:15,194
as a casting audition based
on the public's evaluation.

103
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:17,434
Stage Choice by Public Mission.

104
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:20,304
Here are the main lead
roles cast by the public.

105
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:22,873
(The 8 Directors of Stage Choice by Public)

106
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:25,473
Kang Gyeong Ho, Ki Moo Gan, Kim Kyu Nyeon,

107
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:28,514
Kim Yu Chan, Kim Hyun Ho, Kim Hye Hyun,

108
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,014
Jung Sung Wook, and Choi Ho Jong.

109
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:34,054
These dancers had the
power to direct the performance.

110
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:36,323
The performance was
completed by one main lead role...

111
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:38,153
and four ensemble dancers.

112
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:43,193
We will now proceed
with the team selection.

113
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,763
The ensemble dancers
will choose the work...

114
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:48,434
and the main lead role
they want to work with.

115
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,564
Goodness.

116
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:51,233
They get to make the choice.

117
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:54,533
(The ensemble dancers have
the right to choose their team.)

118
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:56,174
I'm sticking to my first choice.

119
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,973
(Ho Jong's treasure box)

120
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:00,314
(The ensemble dancers complete the lineup.)

121
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,143
(The order of choosing the
lineup is by the dancer's rank.)

122
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:05,653
(All dancers have selected their team.)

123
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,053
(The main lead roles check their teammates)

124
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:09,054
Si Won went to Gyeong Ho's team.

125
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,783
Ho Jong's team filled up the quickest.

126
00:05:11,054 --> 00:05:12,624
Ho Jong's team is strong.

127
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,194
Sung Wook's team is ballet itself.

128
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:17,893
(The main lead role's
expressions are hard to read.)

129
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,223
(How did their work turn out?)

130
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:21,663
The eight main lead roles...

131
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:23,962
worked as directors and completed...

132
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:25,704
today's mission performance.

133
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:28,902
It's exciting to see how the
main lead roles slash directors...

134
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:31,473
expressed their concepts
within the performances.

135
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:34,273
Lining up the dancers like that looks cool.

136
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:36,514
It's like the former presidents.

137
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:40,482
- Human cat snack Ki Moo Gan! - Ki Moo Gan!

138
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:43,054
Human addiction Ki Moo Gan!

139
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:44,184
What about us?

140
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:46,454
Kyu Nyeon is the best.

141
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:48,494
(Easily satisfied)

142
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:52,223
To evaluate today's Stage
Choice by Public Mission,

143
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:54,592
the master, coaches,

144
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:56,333
and rehearsal director are with us.

145
00:05:56,934 --> 00:05:58,833
(For a professional
and detailed evaluation)

146
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:02,543
I will reveal how Stage Choice
by Public Mission is evaluated.

147
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,342
Through the Online Public Evaluation,

148
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:07,142
the team and each dancer are evaluated.

149
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:09,342
The master, coaches,
and rehearsal director...

150
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:11,283
will evaluate the role of each dancer.

151
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:13,629
The Team Evaluation is
conducted on the Mnet Plus app.

152
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,953
The Seat Class of the performance
the public wants to see...

153
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:16,954
is voted by ticketing.

154
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:19,924
The Seat Class is
divided into four classes,

155
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:22,994
VIP, R, S, and A.

156
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,764
Points are differentially weighted
based on their Seat Class.

157
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,732
The eight performances
will be scored differentially,

158
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,333
with the first place
receiving the most points.

159
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:35,133
Individual Evaluation
is the sum of the likes...

160
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:38,043
and views of the solo video on THE CHOOM.

161
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,613
The result will be converted,
and points will be awarded...

162
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:42,143
differentially from 1st to 40th place.

163
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:45,782
Lastly, Stage Fighter's master,
coaches, and rehearsal director...

164
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,783
will proceed with the Role Evaluation.

165
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:51,153
One of the eight directors will
be selected as the Best Director...

166
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:52,953
and will gain benefit points.

167
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,693
One ensemble dancer from each team...

168
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,894
will also be selected as the
best ensemble performer...

169
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,564
and will gain benefit points.

170
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,364
I realized last time that
benefit points are crucial.

171
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:05,504
Master Kim Joo Won. Explain
the evaluation criteria to us.

172
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,032
Out of the eight main lead roles,

173
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,304
we must select only one...

174
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:11,973
Best Director.

175
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:14,814
Salvation, nightmare, addiction,

176
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,444
and dash. How the dancer...

177
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:19,212
expressed his concept...

178
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,353
is the biggest criterion.

179
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,623
It's like I've become
addicted to this performance.

180
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:26,152
I feel as if I've been salvaged.

181
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,393
The directing came through.

182
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:31,663
In a way, how the concept is
emphasized in the performance...

183
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:33,764
is the most critical.

184
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:35,864
As for the Best Dancer,

185
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,704
how well he devoted himself
to the choreography and role...

186
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,873
given by the director...

187
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,543
and how catchy he
was will be the criterion.

188
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:47,674
I was amazed. It was like a
war-boy was actually here.

189
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:51,114
I was shocked. Your energy was immense.

190
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,513
You're a dancer who does his share...

191
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,653
perfectly wherever you are.

192
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:59,323
The sum of the team,
individual, and role benefits...

193
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,324
is the dancer's total score.

194
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:04,292
This result will decide...

195
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:05,833
the Stage Fighter's...

196
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,233
Third Class Movement
Ceremony and finalists.

197
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,903
Who will survive the Third
Class Movement Ceremony...

198
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,074
and become the finalist?

199
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:16,204
The result will be revealed
through today's performance.

200
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:18,044
I must survive.

201
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,544
My goal is to advance to the final.

202
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:23,383
We will begin the Stage
Choice by Public Mission.

203
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,924
Is it starting right away?

204
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:33,693
I'm dying to perform. I'll
beat everyone with my moves.

205
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,870
- I want to get on stage.
- My body is itching to dance.

206
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,164
I'm scared.

207
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:41,794
Here's the synopsis and casting
board of the first performance.

208
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,933
But before the mission performance,

209
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:46,574
I will introduce Stage Fighter's
coach evaluating the dancers.

210
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:49,203
(Contemporary Dance Coach Seong Chang Yong)

211
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:52,002
Stage Fighter's contemporary
dance coach, Seong Chang Yong.

212
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:53,963
(STF's Contemporary Dance
Coach Seong Chang Yong)

213
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:55,983
Ballet coach, Ryu Hoi Woong.

214
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:59,654
(Welcome.)

215
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:01,653
Stage Choice by Public Mission.

216
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:04,284
Here's the synopsis and casting
board of the first performance.

217
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:08,092
("Your Heart's Savior"
directed by Kim Yu Chan)

218
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:09,893
In "Your Heart's Savior,"

219
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:12,963
directed by main lead role Kim Yu Chan,

220
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,394
ensemble dancers Ha Won Jun, Shin Min Kwon,

221
00:09:15,564 --> 00:09:19,164
Sung Hun Mo, and Kang Yun Gu were cast.

222
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:21,602
I wonder how different it'll
be from Gyeong Ho's team.

223
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,743
It's really different.

224
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:27,113
Kim Yu Chan's "Your Heart's Savior..."

225
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,242
has the message...

226
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,783
of promising to be his
savior's forever last leaf.

227
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:32,784
Last leaf.

228
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,613
"Your Heart's Savior"
directed by Kim Yu Chan...

229
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:37,454
starts now.

230
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:41,093
(Extremely excited)

231
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:44,493
It was the toughest time
of 2024's second half.

232
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:47,993
Yu Chan is the strictest out
of all the instructors I've met.

233
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,133
First off, thank you for choosing me.

234
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,404
Here's the overall formation.

235
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:55,804
(Ta-da)

236
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:58,403
I've got them all down
aside from some parts.

237
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:00,244
If we can make a
diagonal line, we'll do that.

238
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,982
There will be a choreography
as we cross each other.

239
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:06,583
I'll step back. Everyone will
dance to my choreography.

240
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:08,914
We'll gather like a branch.

241
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:10,924
As expected from Yu Chan.

242
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:12,723
I liked it.

243
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:16,064
By the way, I'm a perfectionist.

244
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:17,623
Dance properly.

245
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:22,294
As my teammates, I don't
want them to do a sloppy job.

246
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:24,474
If something doesn't
work, we'll try until it works.

247
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,774
I'm slightly doomed.

248
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:30,074
But it can't be helped. I chose
this team. I must follow him.

249
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:34,174
All of you have confidence
in your beautiful figure.

250
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:36,743
I want us to look pretty.

251
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,213
Come down from this.

252
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:41,414
Twist, down.

253
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:43,283
Land.

254
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:44,924
Don't flip your head.

255
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:46,453
(Kim Yu Chan changes the details.)

256
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:47,593
I want us to look like this.

257
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:49,770
If something doesn't
work, we'll try until it works.

258
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:53,593
(Repeating until they can do it)

259
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,433
Use your toes.

260
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,103
Yu Chan is a plan-oriented person.

261
00:10:57,534 --> 00:11:00,774
His directing is very meticulous.

262
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:04,074
(Let's take a short break.)

263
00:11:04,274 --> 00:11:06,644
Let's try again. We're running out of time.

264
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:07,743
(Surprised)

265
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:11,914
One, and two, and three, and four.

266
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:15,054
Five, six, and seven, eight.

267
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:17,554
Nice. Good job.

268
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,053
(We're done, right?)

269
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,753
Let's try with my choreography.

270
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:22,223
(Denying reality)

271
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:23,723
My practice never ends.

272
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,524
If only we could practice for six hours.

273
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:26,894
(I'm going nuts.)

274
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:29,133
Yu Chan sent me a text message yesterday.

275
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:31,633
"I'm determined."

276
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:33,674
One... Again.

277
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,873
- Again. - From the beginning?

278
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,144
It was really exhausting.

279
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:41,113
But I don't regret it. We're doing well.

280
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,382
Yu Chan is confident.

281
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,284
That gave me trust.

282
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,594
- One, two, three. Salvation! - Salvation!

283
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:50,382
People might think we're not...

284
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,893
the strongest team out of the bunch.

285
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:56,862
But we'll imprint that...

286
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:59,194
we're extremely strong together.

287
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:02,463
It'll be a memorable performance.

288
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,273
- Kim Yu Chan is cool! - Good luck!

289
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,373
Prince Shin Min Kwon!

290
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:11,773
(I remember your sacrifice, the
only light and savior in the dark.)

291
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,390
(I will now become your forever last leaf.)

292
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:14,472
(Excited)

293
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:15,473
Goodness.

294
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,083
Cool.

295
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:22,383
The sea? Is he expressing the sea?

296
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,184
It's like he's in the sea.

297
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:27,154
How elegant.

298
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,123
- Goodness. - They look like angels.

299
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:36,404
Nice.

300
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,304
I got goosebumps.

301
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:45,904
Nice, Yu Chan.

302
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,284
Stunning.

303
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:57,454
Beautiful.

304
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:03,924
He's like a young boy.

305
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,194
(Beautiful.)

306
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,064
It's like I'm watching baby angels.

307
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,304
(Stunned)

308
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:15,972
The quality of the moves is insane.

309
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,774
Yu Chan has such beautiful lines.

310
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:32,284
(I'm drawn into it.)

311
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:36,763
Gorgeous.

312
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:39,424
(An elegant turn)

313
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:42,092
(I'm falling in love.)

314
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,434
(Admiring)

315
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,404
That was so neat.

316
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:47,674
Yu Chan is so good.

317
00:13:49,304 --> 00:13:50,444
It's so beautiful.

318
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,653
(That was something.)

319
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:00,783
How far is his leg going up?

320
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:02,252
You don't pull that off only with effort.

321
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:03,253
You need to be gifted.

322
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,633
I didn't know a person
could be that flexible.

323
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:20,872
(The group dance follows.)

324
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:21,934
Won Jun!

325
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:23,473
Nice.

326
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,012
Hun Mo.

327
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,890
- That was nice.
- It looks like Greek mythology.

328
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:31,383
(All I see is Min Kwon.)

329
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:33,684
Nice jump.

330
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:35,513
Who was that? Min Kwon?

331
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,694
Stunning.

332
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:44,664
(So beautiful.)

333
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,394
It's so holy.

334
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,444
It's so lovely.

335
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:07,454
Yu Chan is in the zone.

336
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:11,154
Nice.

337
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,093
Yu Chan shows his emotions so well.

338
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:15,554
I love how he perfectly
brings out the beauty.

339
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:35,944
Okay.

340
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:38,184
(Applauding out of conviction)

341
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,784
I love this part.

342
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,082
(Pure perfection)

343
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,353
(Admiring)

344
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:50,794
Yu Chan is beautiful.

345
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:05,972
(You can listen to the performance
music on various platforms.)

346
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:07,774
(Everyone cheers.)

347
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:14,284
(Stunned)

348
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:19,654
- I'm shocked! That was beautiful. - Yes!

349
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:21,424
(Still feeling it)

350
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:24,223
I wish I could be their savior.

351
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:27,493
He just wiped his tears.

352
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:28,663
He really did.

353
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:31,433
(Yu Chan's older brother)

354
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:32,564
It was certainly touching.

355
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:36,403
That was "Your Heart's
Savior" directed by Kim Yu Chan.

356
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,243
All dancers, thank you for the performance.

357
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:41,973
I believe everyone liked it.

358
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:46,854
It's just that I'm so moved.

359
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:49,013
I held my tears back, actually.

360
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:53,222
(Relating to her)

361
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,792
I believe that everyone in the audience...

362
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,694
felt the same thing that I felt.

363
00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,993
Goodness. That's such a high praise.

364
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,903
I would like to just tell Yu Chan...

365
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:06,973
how spectacular that was.

366
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:08,732
It left me breathless.

367
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,572
It was visually beautiful.

368
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:12,844
It was clean. It was well rehearsed.

369
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:14,773
However,

370
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:18,043
all I could see was Yu Chan.

371
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:21,454
I personally thought that was unfortunate.

372
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,923
Just that part.

373
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:25,753
But I thoroughly enjoyed it.

374
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:27,023
Great work.

375
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:34,562
Of course, I'm not 100
percent satisfied with it,

376
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:37,134
but I could feel that our team...

377
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,073
and the audience were
communing with each other.

378
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,773
So, I'm glad about that.

379
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,874
Honestly, I could only see Yu Chan.

380
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:46,272
But here's the thing.

381
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,343
It's directed according
to his preference, right?

382
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,843
I believe it shows his
competence to use the ensemble...

383
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:54,413
solely as group dancers.

384
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:55,414
(Agreeing)

385
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:59,893
(Online Public Evaluation will
determine the final contestants, )

386
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:04,323
(conducted over 36 hours.)

387
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,733
(Did "Your Heart's Savior"
secure the most seats?)

388
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,333
(It's finally the day of
the class evaluation...)

389
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,704
(of Stage Choice by Public.)

390
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:15,232
We will now begin the class evaluation...

391
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,844
for Stage Choice by Public.

392
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:18,002
(Exclaiming)

393
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,103
(The time has come.)

394
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:21,712
We will announce the
result of the team voting first.

395
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,443
- Please. - The Online Public Evaluation...

396
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:24,684
for the team voting was done...

397
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:28,384
by ticketing votes through
Seat Class Evaluation.

398
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,522
After watching the full
videos of each piece,

399
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:33,522
the people have chosen
a seat among four seats,

400
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:35,322
the VIP seats that gives
you the highest points,

401
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,093
R seats, S seats, and A seats.

402
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:39,763
They have voted by ticketing.

403
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,663
We counted the number of
seats and points after voting...

404
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,032
and determined the
rankings from 1st to 8th place.

405
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,873
The dancers in first place
with the highest score...

406
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:49,772
will be given 1,000 points each.

407
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:51,403
From second place onward,
points will be awarded...

408
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:52,620
with a difference of 30 points each.

409
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,343
Which dancers of which
piece will have proved...

410
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,543
their ticket-selling power
and scored the highest?

411
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:03,052
Now, the main lead role
and director, Kim Yu Chan...

412
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:04,154
(Me first?)

413
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:05,323
Why?

414
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,292
The result of the Seat Class Evaluation...

415
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,963
for "Your Heart's Savior"
will be revealed now.

416
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:11,893
It was voted by the public,

417
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:14,894
so I was worried about
our team's low popularity.

418
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:16,393
Steal the tickets.

419
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:17,933
(Laughing)

420
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,533
The dancers with a habit of stealing.

421
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:23,644
The VIP seats for "Your
Heart's Savior" are...

422
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:25,073
- What would it be? - Sold out.

423
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,373
("Your Heart's Savior" has
sold all 3,000 VIP seats.)

424
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,073
You have sold all 3,000 VIP seats.

425
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:31,844
I think every teams
easily sells the VIP seats.

426
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:34,884
I will now announce the number of R seats.

427
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:36,553
They probably also sold out R seats.

428
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,023
It must be sold out.

429
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,753
Will they have sold out all of them?

430
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:43,693
(That's impressive.)

431
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:44,694
(There you go!)

432
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:47,493
Again, you have sold all R seats.

433
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,394
They're indeed runners-up.

434
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,963
I was relieved.

435
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,164
Next, I will announce the S seats.

436
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:55,733
Will they have sold
all the R seats as well?

437
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,373
The sales of these seats matter.

438
00:19:58,374 --> 00:19:59,643
- S seats? - Yes, the 5,000 seats.

439
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:00,920
- That's true.
- Did they sell out all the seats?

440
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:02,013
Even the S seats?

441
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:04,084
Please.

442
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,513
About 3,700.

443
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:09,813
Wait. It drops substantially.

444
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:16,193
You have sold 1,326 S seats.

445
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:19,563
You have sold a total of 236 A seats.

446
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:22,263
They didn't sell as many
S seats as we expected.

447
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,454
I thought they'd sell out the S seats.

448
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:25,934
It was a bit disappointing.

449
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:29,073
I will now announce the Best Dancer.

450
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,843
- Let's go. - Let's go, Won Jun.

451
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,144
This is terrifying.

452
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:35,343
A total of four people,
the master, coaches,

453
00:20:35,344 --> 00:20:37,413
and the rehearsal director
watched the performance...

454
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:38,883
and submitted their scores.

455
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:41,404
The Best Dancer has been decided
based on their average points.

456
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:44,052
The dancer who scored high
for playing his part properly...

457
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:45,683
will be selected as the Best Dancer...

458
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:48,522
and be awarded 3,000 benefit poitns.

459
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:50,492
I can't wait to find out
their individual points.

460
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:51,793
That must be huge.

461
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:53,793
I can't predict the winner here.

462
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:55,463
I wonder who won.

463
00:20:56,434 --> 00:21:00,773
First, here are the points of
Kang Yun Gu and Sung Hun Mo.

464
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:02,733
I was slightly worried.

465
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,734
They pointed out some
of his mistakes, right?

466
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:08,644
(They pointed out his
lack of facial expressions.)

467
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:10,114
Let's find out.

468
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:13,454
They're 83.25.

469
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:15,253
I thought it was fortunate.

470
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:18,923
Next, here are the
scores of Shin Min Kwon...

471
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,194
and Ha Won Jun.

472
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:21,930
Who do you think will
win the benefit points?

473
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:23,423
- Min Kwon? - Won Jun?

474
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:24,424
Won Jun.

475
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:25,694
He had a solo part, after all.

476
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,634
(He showed his potential
with his extraordinary flexibility.)

477
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:33,003
- But Min Kwon also stood out. - He did.

478
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:38,273
(Min Kwon caught their attention
with his sentiments and energy.)

479
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:41,174
I'd like to highly praise Min Kwon.

480
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:45,283
You've shown your energy,

481
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:48,483
the extension of movements,
and expressions so well.

482
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:50,184
I'm guessing it's Min Kwon.

483
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:51,723
Min Kwon.

484
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:53,222
You might even place first.

485
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:54,954
- Who? Me? I hope so. - Yes.

486
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:57,823
I will first reveal Won Jun's score.

487
00:21:58,394 --> 00:21:59,924
(Scoffing)

488
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:01,134
Why?

489
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:04,404
Why am I first?

490
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:06,334
(Surprised)

491
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:08,104
(Amazed)

492
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:09,303
That's high.

493
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:11,943
Your average score is 86.25.

494
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,850
(Won Jun's individual
points: 92, 93, 80, and 80)

495
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,013
That's really high.

496
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:17,344
That's a high score.

497
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:19,783
Will Won Jun get a benefit?

498
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,084
I want it.

499
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:25,022
Next, I will announce...

500
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:26,283
Min Kwon's score.

501
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:27,654
One of Yu Chan's treasures?

502
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:28,823
(Laughing)

503
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:29,993
I bet he got a high score.

504
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:32,363
Min Kwon did pretty well too.

505
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,063
Min Kwon's score is...

506
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,163
I need the benefit to be
able to compete with them.

507
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:37,963
I should get the benefit.

508
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:40,273
- Here is his score. - Let's see.

509
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:41,802
(Shin Min Kwon: 87.5)

510
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:42,803
What?

511
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:44,802
(Min Kwon's individual
points: 90, 90, 85, and 85)

512
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:46,443
(He's sad, but he congratulates Min Kwon.)

513
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:49,674
Min Kwon's average score is 87.5.

514
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:53,883
The Best Dancer of "Your Heart's Savior..."

515
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:55,513
is Shin Min Kwon.

516
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,653
I didn't think I could move up...

517
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,783
without the benefit,

518
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,153
then I was chosen as the Best Dancer,

519
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,563
so I couldn't be happier.

520
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,894
I thought I'd get the benefit.

521
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,233
(It's too bad.)

522
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:11,302
Here are the synopsis and casting board...

523
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:12,934
for Stage Choice by Public.

524
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:14,433
("Addicted Me" directed by Kim Kyu Nyeon)

525
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,173
"Addicted Me..."

526
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:17,874
directed by Kim Kyu Nyeon is...

527
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:20,643
a piece that portrays the moment
when pain and pleasure intertwine...

528
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:23,413
as one becomes deeply
captivated by the other.

529
00:23:23,414 --> 00:23:25,343
It means he's addicted
and drawn to her, right?

530
00:23:25,344 --> 00:23:27,713
He can't help himself
and is captivated by her.

531
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:30,052
In "Addicted Me" are...

532
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:32,684
Park Jun Woo, Jang Sung Bum,

533
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:36,623
Choi Kyu Tae, and Jeon
Tae Hu as the ensemble.

534
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,140
Three Korean dancers and one ballerino.

535
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,333
This is a very interesting group of people.

536
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,292
Their dancing is all very different.

537
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:44,164
I'm interested to see what Kyu Nyeon did.

538
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,634
Let's talk first.

539
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:49,634
My first research was...

540
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:53,104
a pervert. Love with perverse tendencies.

541
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,443
I was thinking of madness and obsession.

542
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:57,943
The synopsis itself is a bit perverted,

543
00:23:57,944 --> 00:23:59,383
so I've been telling the members that.

544
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,752
Whether that vibe is there or
not makes such a huge difference,

545
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,723
so I've been emphasizing that.

546
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:06,953
He had thoroughly designed...

547
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:09,653
the synopsis, composition, and characters.

548
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:13,634
I think we were off to a smooth start.

549
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:17,363
Considering the theme that
you gave us, I'd like to use...

550
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:21,104
the type of exposure that
dancers didn't usually use.

551
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,743
I could feel Kyu Nyeon's passion,

552
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:26,472
so I told him my opinion
on the outfits on the spot.

553
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:28,113
I even looked up the designs and sent him.

554
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:29,613
He sends me about 200 references...

555
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,282
for our outfits, hair, and makeup.

556
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,213
Finding those references
for me is incredibly helpful.

557
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,153
After that part,

558
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:38,154
you go, "One, two, three, four,"

559
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:41,093
"five, six, seven, eight."

560
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:42,094
(Slow)

561
00:24:42,095 --> 00:24:44,993
Tae Hu is the youngest
dancer on the show...

562
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:47,263
and is inexperienced.

563
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:49,834
So, that was a concern for me.

564
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:52,532
The beat goes... I think
we should rotate it fast.

565
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,633
Three and four.

566
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:56,003
Like, "Three."

567
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:59,104
Jun Woo is practicing with the
mindset of a sub-choreographer,

568
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:00,414
so I'm reassured.

569
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:03,843
Tae Hu does pretty well
when he's told what to do.

570
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:05,884
I think he's a fast learner.

571
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:08,864
- We sit like this from here, right?
- You need to stay still.

572
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:11,522
Maybe Tae Hu could move like this.

573
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:12,753
It's not heavy at all.

574
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:13,954
(Okay.)

575
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:15,529
- I could bear Tae Hu's weight. - Come on.

576
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,322
I got into a frog position, and
Tae Hu stood on top of me.

577
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:20,163
Then, he acted like he was strangling...

578
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:21,393
and smelling me.

579
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,364
I asked him to do it, and he pulled it off.

580
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:26,163
I was surprised that
he could actually do it.

581
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:27,404
(Laughing)

582
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,502
You look so perverted.

583
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:31,143
- It suits you. - Seriously.

584
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:32,772
We're definitely drawing
dark circles under your eyes.

585
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,644
- Make it even larger. - Under your eyes.

586
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:37,542
The revolt of the Under Class.
The underdogs are coming.

587
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:38,843
Or "Lee Jang Ho's Baseball Team."

588
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:41,613
I wanted to do a
performance with such vibes.

589
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:42,753
I'll show you.

590
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:44,153
(Let's check out the performance...)

591
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:45,634
(of the spiteful Team "Addicted Me.")

592
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:48,253
Go, Jun Woo!

593
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:50,423
(Kyu Nyeon's family)

594
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,423
(Sung Bum's family)

595
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:54,333
(What will the combination...)

596
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,594
(of Korean dance and ballet look like?)

597
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:58,262
Let's watch it.

598
00:25:58,263 --> 00:25:59,433
(Focused)

599
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,732
(Synopsis: As I become
deeply captivated by you, )

600
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,373
(I lose control over my emotions.
My love grows more (intense, )

601
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:04,042
(falling into the illusion that
everything revolves around you.)

602
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:05,502
(Even as I try to escape, I
find myself already ensnared, )

603
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:06,572
(gradually becoming obsessed with you.)

604
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:07,713
(Intrigued and excited)

605
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:09,273
What?

606
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:11,513
Tae Hu!

607
00:26:15,813 --> 00:26:16,854
(Drawn into it)

608
00:26:22,924 --> 00:26:24,723
- Look at Tae Hu! - He's looking good!

609
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,523
- Check out Tae Hu. - Nice, Tae Hu.

610
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:28,593
(Surprised)

611
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:30,154
Tae Hu is showing off his belly button.

612
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,003
Kyu Nyeon has such good energy.

613
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:39,973
He's even acting.

614
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,114
- Who's that? Jun Woo? - It's Jun Woo.

615
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:43,713
Jun Woo! There you go.

616
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:49,584
(Perfect harmony)

617
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:52,854
Tae Hu!

618
00:26:58,664 --> 00:26:59,763
Kyu Nyeon!

619
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:01,533
He's good at that stuff.

620
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:04,203
Kyu Nyeon looks great.

621
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:06,164
He's great at segmentation and flow.

622
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:08,634
I love that part by Kyu Nyeon.

623
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,073
He's incredibly good
at controlling intensity.

624
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,174
He looks powerful today.

625
00:27:23,114 --> 00:27:24,654
(Making eye contact)

626
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:29,694
The song is intense,

627
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:31,455
but only Kyu Nyeon
fills it with his energy.

628
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:34,063
It's certainly got Kyu Nyeon's style.

629
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:35,364
Nice.

630
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:36,763
(Satisfied)

631
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,573
Sexy.

632
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,273
It's sexy.

633
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,303
Kyu Nyeon has great facial expressions.

634
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:47,144
This team is also energetic.

635
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:49,844
(Surprised)

636
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,752
Jun Woo sets it up so well in the front.

637
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:00,753
I know, right?

638
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:07,963
Show us.

639
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:10,164
(Exclaiming)

640
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:13,033
- Great teamwork.
- He composed the dance so well.

641
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,334
Kyu Nyeon certainly stands out.

642
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:22,573
They have great synergy.

643
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:35,223
(That's so cool!)

644
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:38,313
- He's like an idol singer. - Exactly.

645
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,634
Kyu Nyeon dances to live up to his name.

646
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:46,904
He looks talented.

647
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:48,634
That's good.

648
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:52,944
(Lee Young Woo)

649
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:54,312
(Skillful)

650
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:55,373
(Cheering)

651
00:28:55,374 --> 00:28:56,742
(Admiring and applauding)

652
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:58,143
(Amazed)

653
00:28:58,144 --> 00:28:59,343
Kyu Tae killed that one.

654
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:00,914
How are they all so skillful?

655
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:03,184
How does a ballerino use such a technique?

656
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,523
It's impressive.

657
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:08,194
This team surely has indispensable members.

658
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:19,503
Great facial expressions.

659
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:24,003
How are the teams all so good?

660
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:28,743
Energy.

661
00:29:37,184 --> 00:29:38,253
I like this one.

662
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,462
(You can listen to "Addiction"
by Xdinary Heroes, )

663
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:52,933
(the performance music of
"Addicted Me" on various platforms.)

664
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:57,404
(Cheering enthusiastically)

665
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:59,043
That was very energetic.

666
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:01,242
A lot of people will copy this.

667
00:30:01,243 --> 00:30:03,072
(Kyu Nyeon in the ending pose)

668
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:04,283
They did so well.

669
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:07,114
Kyu Nyeon is good on stage.

670
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:10,752
That was "Addicted Me"
directed by Kim Kyu Nyeon.

671
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:12,384
Let's hear from the judges.

672
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:16,292
Watching Kyu Nyeon's directing,

673
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:19,522
I was satisfied with how you
made great use of the stage...

674
00:30:19,523 --> 00:30:23,263
by using various stage movements.

675
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:26,462
I noticed several challenges
that were creative...

676
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:29,033
and went beyond the genres.

677
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:30,903
I feel like the judges...

678
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:34,042
acknowledged the signs of my deliberation,

679
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:35,174
so I was exhilarated.

680
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:38,413
However, although there
are three Korean dancers...

681
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:41,953
and two ballerinos on this team.

682
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:46,184
You could have done
better in terms of mixing...

683
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,393
the language of Korean dance and ballet...

684
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:52,763
into this performance.

685
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:55,664
It would have been
better with some highlights.

686
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:04,802
We will now reveal the result
of the Seat Class Evaluation...

687
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:06,343
of "Addicted Me..."

688
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:08,813
by Kim Kyu Nyeon, the
director and main lead role.

689
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:11,344
The amount of VIP seats...

690
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:12,884
Sold out?

691
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:14,660
- They're all probably sold out.
- "Addicted Me."

692
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:17,012
(3,000 VIP seats)

693
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:18,123
(They sold out 3,000 VIP seats.)

694
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:19,124
(Relieved)

695
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,793
- Awesome. - You have sold all of them.

696
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:24,022
Next, we will reveal the result...

697
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:26,594
of the 4,000 R seats.

698
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:28,292
These must be sold out too.

699
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:30,574
The seats must be sold out
down to R seats for all teams.

700
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:32,503
I was anxious.

701
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:36,033
We were numbers 38, 39, and 40, after all.

702
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:39,543
I am concerned about
our ticket-selling power.

703
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,614
I'd be glad if they were sold out.

704
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:44,543
Here's the voting result of R seats.

705
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:47,453
(Team "Addicted Me"
failed to sell out R setas...)

706
00:31:47,454 --> 00:31:48,913
(and secured 3,719 seats.)

707
00:31:48,914 --> 00:31:50,924
(Bitter)

708
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:53,423
(Sighing)

709
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:54,930
I can't believe they weren't sold out.

710
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,553
We failed to sell all the R seats.

711
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:57,894
It was such a bummer.

712
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:00,322
(The voting results of
S seats and A seats...)

713
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:01,433
(for "Addicted Me" are revealed.)

714
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:03,262
You naturally do worse in lower seats...

715
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:05,962
if you fail to sell all the R seats.

716
00:32:05,963 --> 00:32:08,032
"Addicted Me" has...

717
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:11,473
sold a total of 7,262 seats.

718
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:13,542
("Addicted Me" is in 2nd place
by a difference of 1,300 seats...)

719
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:15,542
(after "Your Heart's Savior,"
the current front runner.)

720
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:17,282
- Good work. - "Addicted Me."

721
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:20,384
The result wasn't that
satisfying, so I was upset.

722
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:23,454
But I tried to tell myself, "As
long as we performed well,"

723
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:26,753
and felt thankful for the members.

724
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:29,923
Next, I will announce...

725
00:32:29,924 --> 00:32:32,094
the Best Dancer of "Addicted Me."

726
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:33,822
"Addicted Me."

727
00:32:33,823 --> 00:32:35,163
(The Best Dancer benefit is...)

728
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:37,903
(awarded to only 1 member
of the 4 group dancers.)

729
00:32:37,904 --> 00:32:38,934
I wonder who won.

730
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:42,934
First, I will announce Jun Woo's score.

731
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:44,973
I bet he got a high score.

732
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:48,173
(He showed his new side
with intense expressions, )

733
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,944
(unlike his previous dancing.)

734
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:54,883
(Sighing)

735
00:32:54,884 --> 00:32:56,884
I was extremely nervous.

736
00:32:57,783 --> 00:33:01,323
Jun Woo's average score is 81.5.

737
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:03,094
I'm not sure yet.

738
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:06,323
I will now announce Sung Bum's score.

739
00:33:07,124 --> 00:33:08,333
(Sung Bum's individual
points: 85, 75, 60, and 80)

740
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,894
It's 75.

741
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:11,803
You need to stand out, for sure.

742
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:15,434
I will now announce
Kyu Tae's average score.

743
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:18,404
(Choi Kyu Tae's final score: 80.25)

744
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:20,564
(Kyu Tae's individual
points: 89, 87, 60, and 85)

745
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:23,013
- It's high.
- He's only behind by one point.

746
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:25,644
I was so startled. I
thought, "Thank goodness."

747
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:28,483
- My goodness. - I was very disappointed.

748
00:33:28,954 --> 00:33:31,323
The last dancer, Jeon Tae Hu's score...

749
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:33,722
will determine the Best Dancer...

750
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:35,293
of "Addicted Me."

751
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:36,694
Will it be Tae Hu?

752
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:38,463
Tae Hu did pretty well.

753
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:45,733
(With his spirited energy,
Tae Hu received good reviews.)

754
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,580
The revolt of the youngest member?

755
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:50,374
(Park Jun Woo versus Jeon
Tae Hu Who will take the benefit?)

756
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:52,874
(Jeon Tae Hu's final score: 78.75)

757
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:55,419
(The dancer of "Addicted Me"
who won the benefit, Park Jun Woo)

758
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:57,984
(Tae Hu's individual
points: 85, 80, 60, and 90)

759
00:33:58,443 --> 00:33:59,814
There wasn't a twist.

760
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:01,414
You did well.

761
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:05,053
Thus, the Best Dancer
of "Addicted Me" is...

762
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:06,484
Park Jun Woo.

763
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:09,723
Park Jun Woo will receive
the benefit points of 300.

764
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:10,823
Congratulations.

765
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,263
It's a big benefit, to be honest.

766
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:14,493
I'm relieved.

767
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:16,064
(Benefit score: 300)

768
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,262
I'll now reveal the synopsis
and casting board...

769
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:21,033
for the next performance
of Stage Choice by Public.

770
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:25,903
- I'm excited about this team.
- It's the same song as Kyu Nyeon's.

771
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:28,113
It's our rival team.

772
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:31,383
- We have to watch this.
- We have to watch this.

773
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:33,443
"Breaking, addiction?"

774
00:34:33,714 --> 00:34:34,984
Okay.

775
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:36,684
It's nice, right?

776
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:39,553
I like the vibe. There's
comma after "Breaking."

777
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:42,124
- "Wanting to give love..."
- "My heart flutters."

778
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:43,524
We need to get into the emotions.

779
00:34:43,794 --> 00:34:44,794
Yes.

780
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:47,064
- Let's break. - Let's break.

781
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:49,293
- One, two, three, let's go.
- One, two, three, let's go.

782
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:50,464
(Let's break the stage.)

783
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:52,523
(Team Breaking,
Addiction enters the stage.)

784
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:54,080
(Lee Jin Woo, the man with a good vibe)

785
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,172
(Kim Do Hyun)

786
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:56,874
(Ki Moo Gan over my husband)

787
00:34:57,604 --> 00:34:59,902
They didn't put much
effort into the costumes.

788
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:01,473
Will they focus on the dance alone?

789
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:04,783
Will we truly see Moo Gan's style?

790
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:08,414
Let's look forward to Moo
Gan's thoughts and vibe.

791
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:11,984
(What kind of a performance
will Director Ki Moo Gan show?)

792
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,422
(Director Ki Moo Gan's Team
"Addiction" has a meeting.)

793
00:35:13,423 --> 00:35:15,922
- The theme is human addiction. - Yes.

794
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:17,693
It's about a person who's crazy about love.

795
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:21,794
There's a poem my friend
wrote. It's titled "Waves."

796
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:25,633
This person wants to receive love
and give love, but it's impossible.

797
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:27,803
All of those emotions crash like waves.

798
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:30,973
I want to show that through dance.

799
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:32,843
It's like a person...

800
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:36,513
who has been holed up
somewhere for a long time.

801
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:38,782
- Like a socially withdrawn person?
- That's the vibe.

802
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,313
You'd know if you had...

803
00:35:41,314 --> 00:35:42,613
a painful breakup.

804
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:44,823
I've had many experiences.

805
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:48,222
- You can't do anything.
- It makes you go insane.

806
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:50,863
After the breakup, you can't
meet up with your friends.

807
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:53,592
- I've had that experience. - How annoying.

808
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:55,163
- He's getting emotional. - What?

809
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:57,164
What's going on? Why is everyone so sad?

810
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,663
We should have a drink first.

811
00:35:58,664 --> 00:35:59,664
(The breakup isn't over yet.)

812
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:01,185
I feel like I'm getting wrecked again.

813
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:04,644
As you live, you
experience that kind of pain...

814
00:36:04,943 --> 00:36:06,473
regarding love.

815
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:10,214
That's why everyone is absorbed.

816
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:12,883
We should change it up.

817
00:36:13,314 --> 00:36:16,454
We should look like...

818
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:19,423
- Moo Gan's egos. - Yes.

819
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:22,553
We represent Moo Gan's egos.

820
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:25,794
We show the addiction he
experienced when he was in love.

821
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:28,664
We're the alter egos that
represent such emotions...

822
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:30,633
and situations of an addict.

823
00:36:30,903 --> 00:36:34,164
It's a story about Moo Gan's egos.

824
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:36,733
(A.K.A. Moo Gan's "Inside Out")

825
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:38,472
(It's funny.)

826
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:41,243
- Now... - You guys are crazy addicts.

827
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:44,883
I think the five of us are doing...

828
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:48,084
the best we can do.
I like it. I like it a lot.

829
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:51,954
(Practice goes smoothly.)

830
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:54,393
(They look uncomfortable.)

831
00:36:54,394 --> 00:36:56,922
To be honest, there was one section...

832
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,663
that made me anxious.

833
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:00,793
(After Ki Moo Gan's team came to be)

834
00:37:00,794 --> 00:37:02,532
This part is the hardest.

835
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,333
- I feel like I should do this.
- That's right.

836
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:07,302
- Seriously.
- I feel like I should do this.

837
00:37:07,303 --> 00:37:08,303
(Clapping together)

838
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,434
- Seriously.
- "Addiction..." What should we do?

839
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:13,874
I was worried about that
part. Other members also said,

840
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:17,513
"Isn't clapping the best for this part?"

841
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,414
(Team Ki Moo Gan is deep in thought.)

842
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:22,354
Moo Gan,

843
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:26,223
why don't we have each dancer
show his color during that part?

844
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:27,893
(Do Hyun gives an idea for a solo section.)

845
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:28,954
If we do that...

846
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:31,894
I thought, "This is a
team of talented dancers."

847
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:36,033
Like a relay of specialties, we
can show what we're good at.

848
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:38,604
It'll be a good opportunity.

849
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:42,204
I don't want to stand out too much.

850
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:43,403
That's my thought.

851
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:45,803
I want us to look good together.

852
00:37:46,504 --> 00:37:48,012
He gave a lot of parts...

853
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:50,274
to the ensemble.

854
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:53,684
We practice with spirits and
consideration for each other.

855
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:55,653
I think we'll place first.

856
00:37:57,314 --> 00:37:58,354
That's good.

857
00:37:58,783 --> 00:38:00,783
None of the dancers lazed around.

858
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:03,553
Everyone worked hard, so I'm very thankful.

859
00:38:03,894 --> 00:38:04,964
We won't get eliminated.

860
00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:07,083
They're people who
shouldn't get eliminated.

861
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:09,333
- Let's go! - Let's go!

862
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,654
(How will be the performance
of Team Breaking, Addiction?)

863
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:15,504
(Synopsis: The waves scatter
the name and memories of love.)

864
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:17,942
(Wanting to give and receive
love and being unable to love...)

865
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:19,544
They're moving slowly first.

866
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:22,443
It draws us in already.

867
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:25,443
The silhouette creates an incredible vibe.

868
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:32,423
There must be people who
are covering their mouths.

869
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:33,954
(Covering their mouths)

870
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:35,330
(Their expectations are at their max.)

871
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,493
(It's electrifying.)

872
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,103
(Everyone marvels at the opening
of Team Breaking, Addiction.)

873
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:48,274
- My goodness. - My goodness, what's that?

874
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:49,533
That's insane.

875
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,073
- It's like an idol performance. - Yes.

876
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:04,084
(Impressed)

877
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:05,754
Jin Woo is so handsome.

878
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:11,124
Jin Woo is so handsome.

879
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:14,762
They must be his inner faces.

880
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:15,894
I love the composition.

881
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:18,104
The facial expressions are so nice.

882
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:22,204
They seem to be moving
separately, but there's harmony.

883
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:27,704
- Is that Tae Seok?
- Here's the middle-aged ballerino.

884
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:31,043
That's good. Yes.

885
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:32,113
Nice partnering.

886
00:39:38,783 --> 00:39:40,624
- What's that in the middle? - Tae Seok.

887
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:42,153
He's turning in the back.

888
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:47,493
- Here comes the contact. - It's so cool.

889
00:39:53,263 --> 00:39:55,133
- All right. - That was it.

890
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:05,143
(Moved)

891
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:06,144
(I got goosebumps.)

892
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:19,422
That's it, Moo Gan.

893
00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:20,943
Moo Gan's sense of presence is insane.

894
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:25,204
(I'm addicted too.)

895
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:38,513
Everyone is good.

896
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:41,084
Amazing!

897
00:40:50,454 --> 00:40:51,464
He laughed.

898
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:53,024
He did this.

899
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:05,544
It's a solo part.

900
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:07,243
Oh, Tae Seok.

901
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:11,943
- Jin Woo is insane.
- Each dancer stands out.

902
00:41:13,414 --> 00:41:15,913
- Who is that? - Who is that?

903
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:17,254
Let's go, June Hyuk.

904
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:21,723
- Yes. - Let's go.

905
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:23,453
(That was insane.)

906
00:41:23,454 --> 00:41:24,993
(Laughing)

907
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:27,223
- He ate up the stage. - He's so powerful.

908
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:28,394
June Hyuk is insane too.

909
00:41:30,234 --> 00:41:31,234
Yes.

910
00:41:52,024 --> 00:41:53,359
(His facial expression is incredible.)

911
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:54,493
That was a scene-stealer.

912
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:04,093
These dancers are going for it.

913
00:42:13,274 --> 00:42:14,342
Bravo.

914
00:42:14,343 --> 00:42:16,863
(You can listen to the performance
music on various platforms.)

915
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:20,184
They're performing until the very end.

916
00:42:23,283 --> 00:42:24,684
That's Ki Moo Gan.

917
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:26,984
That's Ki Moo Gan.

918
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:28,992
Ki Moo Gan is a dancer...

919
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:31,092
who does his own thing,

920
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:33,123
- his charms stand out. - Yes.

921
00:42:33,124 --> 00:42:35,193
They were like five Moo Gans.

922
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:37,664
- Why was it so short?
- It seemed short, right?

923
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:41,803
I could tell that Moo Gan
was considerate of the dancers.

924
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:44,524
Because of that, the performance
was perfect in every way.

925
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:46,604
Moo Gan choreographed the dance so well.

926
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:48,173
We might lose.

927
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:50,573
Don't say such a thing out loud.

928
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:53,343
That was "Breaking, Addiction"
directed by Ki Moo Gan.

929
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:57,084
Let's hear the reviews. Master
Kim Joo Won, how was it?

930
00:42:58,283 --> 00:43:00,584
Today, Ki Moo Gan lived up to his name.

931
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:02,493
(Satisfied)

932
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:07,064
Yes.

933
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:10,733
He showed more than his
dance and free-spiritedness.

934
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:12,503
With the four dancers,

935
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:15,402
he created a choreography
in which everyone showed...

936
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:18,942
similar yet distinct charms
in a very comfortable way.

937
00:43:18,943 --> 00:43:22,012
I was also impressed by the
way he put careful thought...

938
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:23,672
into the movements...

939
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:26,842
of his fingertips to deliver...

940
00:43:26,843 --> 00:43:29,184
the desired emotions.

941
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:31,012
I could tell that he was
an artistic choreographer...

942
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:33,354
who had a talent for directing.

943
00:43:34,553 --> 00:43:35,823
I was very happy.

944
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:40,024
I don't know what I would've
done without my teammates.

945
00:43:40,294 --> 00:43:43,293
They said that they enjoyed my performance,

946
00:43:43,294 --> 00:43:44,464
so I was twice as happy.

947
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:46,564
Kim Do Hyun.

948
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:48,104
(I'm here.)

949
00:43:49,704 --> 00:43:53,072
From your facial expressions and such,

950
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:57,543
I could tell that you absorbed
Ki Moo Gan's directions...

951
00:43:57,544 --> 00:44:00,083
and acted out the character
well in your own way.

952
00:44:00,084 --> 00:44:02,453
You were scrambling in the Under Class,

953
00:44:02,454 --> 00:44:03,584
but you did so well.

954
00:44:03,854 --> 00:44:07,053
Now, it's time to move up.

955
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:10,722
That was how well you did.
Although you had hurt your hand...

956
00:44:10,723 --> 00:44:12,193
I had no idea.

957
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:15,362
Unbothered by the injury,

958
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:18,703
you pulled off the
techniques incredibly well.

959
00:44:18,704 --> 00:44:20,334
I was so touched.

960
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:26,004
(Emotional)

961
00:44:29,073 --> 00:44:30,714
(Don't cry.)

962
00:44:31,214 --> 00:44:33,144
(He calms down.)

963
00:44:33,314 --> 00:44:36,913
Moo Gan had a lot of expectations for me,

964
00:44:36,914 --> 00:44:38,383
but I couldn't meet them completely.

965
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,722
But everyone in the team...

966
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:43,322
made up for what I lacked...

967
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:45,283
and gave a good
performance. I'm thankful for it.

968
00:44:45,794 --> 00:44:47,894
(You worked hard.)

969
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:51,032
Through "Breaking,
Addiction," that was directed...

970
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,733
by the main lead, Ki Moo Gan,

971
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,902
will Ki Moo Gan be able to become...

972
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:56,133
the Best Director?

973
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:59,743
And among the four group
dancers, who will be the Best Dancer?

974
00:45:02,144 --> 00:45:03,773
It's time to announce the results...

975
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:06,343
of the Seat Class Evaluation
for Stage Choice by Public.

976
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:09,684
The main lead and director, Ki Moo Gan's...

977
00:45:09,854 --> 00:45:12,253
Seat Class Evaluation results...

978
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:15,254
for "Breaking, Addiction" will be revealed.

979
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:18,193
The main lead and director, Ki Moo Gan's...

980
00:45:18,294 --> 00:45:20,092
"Breaking, Addiction..."

981
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,963
get more than 8,562 seats...

982
00:45:21,964 --> 00:45:24,664
of Kim Yu Chan's team?

983
00:45:25,004 --> 00:45:28,504
The VIP seats will be revealed first.

984
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:30,573
Did they sell out?

985
00:45:31,234 --> 00:45:32,343
That's my guess.

986
00:45:32,544 --> 00:45:35,943
Here's the result for the VIP
seats of "Breaking, Addiction."

987
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,243
You have sold all 3,000 VIP seats.

988
00:45:38,343 --> 00:45:41,583
("Breaking, Addiction" has
sold all 3,000 VIP seats.)

989
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:42,983
(Very happy)

990
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:44,153
(Yes!)

991
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,683
In just 17 minutes after airing,

992
00:45:47,684 --> 00:45:50,323
all VIP seats were sold out.

993
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:51,593
Seventeen minutes?

994
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:54,263
Seventeen minutes?

995
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:58,503
- That's Moo Gan's magic.
- Next, I'll reveal the result...

996
00:45:58,504 --> 00:46:01,133
for the 4,000 R seats.

997
00:46:01,573 --> 00:46:02,933
("Breaking, Addiction"
has sold all 4,000 R seats.)

998
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:04,773
(The R seats sold out.)

999
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:07,073
The R seats sold out as well.

1000
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,472
Both the VIP and R seats sold out.

1001
00:46:10,473 --> 00:46:13,214
Did the S seats sell out as well?

1002
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:16,282
If the audience members'
reactions are real,

1003
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:17,454
we might have a chance.

1004
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:18,722
("Your Heart's Savior"
failed to sell out the S seats.)

1005
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:19,854
I'm nervous.

1006
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:21,652
I hope we sold out the S seats.

1007
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,754
I bet they sold out the S seats.

1008
00:46:23,954 --> 00:46:27,064
I don't think they sold out the S seats.

1009
00:46:27,964 --> 00:46:28,964
(S seats sold out.)

1010
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:30,532
Of course, they sold out.

1011
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:33,234
(Thank you.)

1012
00:46:33,403 --> 00:46:35,733
- All right. - S seats sold out as well.

1013
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:37,903
For Dancer Ki Moo
Gan's "Breaking Addiction,"

1014
00:46:38,243 --> 00:46:40,402
VIP, R, and S seats...

1015
00:46:40,403 --> 00:46:41,774
sold out.

1016
00:46:41,874 --> 00:46:43,672
Last comes the result...

1017
00:46:43,673 --> 00:46:45,913
for A seats with no number restriction.

1018
00:46:45,914 --> 00:46:47,143
("Breaking, Addiction"
has sold 1,273 A seats.)

1019
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:48,152
(Impressive)

1020
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:50,283
A total of 1,274 A seats were sold.

1021
00:46:50,484 --> 00:46:53,052
In the Seat Class Evaluation,
"Breaking, Addiction" sold...

1022
00:46:53,053 --> 00:46:56,693
a total of 13,273 seats.

1023
00:46:56,794 --> 00:46:58,523
(Proud)

1024
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,564
How cool.

1025
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:02,133
- Moo Gan, you're the best. - Moo Gan.

1026
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:03,564
Bravo, Moo Gan.

1027
00:47:03,693 --> 00:47:05,563
Currently, Ki Moo Gan's team...

1028
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:07,933
has sold more seats
than Kim Yu Chan's team...

1029
00:47:07,934 --> 00:47:10,774
and placed first.

1030
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:15,443
Will Ki Moo Gan's team
continue to stay on the top?

1031
00:47:15,714 --> 00:47:18,914
Soon, we'll reveal the rankings
of all eight choreographies.

1032
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:23,553
I'll now announce the Best
Dancer of "Breaking, Addiction."

1033
00:47:24,113 --> 00:47:26,382
This is the beginning. The Best Dancer.

1034
00:47:26,383 --> 00:47:29,153
It could be any member of the team.

1035
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,453
I hope everyone gets a high score...

1036
00:47:31,454 --> 00:47:33,134
even if he doesn't become the Best Dancer.

1037
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,893
In "Breaking, Addiction."

1038
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,734
which dancer will receive the benefit?

1039
00:47:39,664 --> 00:47:41,303
It's hard to tell with this team.

1040
00:47:41,673 --> 00:47:43,334
I have no idea.

1041
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,873
I will first reveal...

1042
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:48,213
Jang June Hyuk's score.

1043
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:49,414
Why am I the first one?

1044
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:57,854
(Jang June Hyuk's facial expressions
and relaxed vibe stood out.)

1045
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,953
Everyone did well in his own way.

1046
00:48:00,954 --> 00:48:02,393
I think everyone will get over 90.

1047
00:48:02,394 --> 00:48:03,394
Seriously.

1048
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:05,893
(Jang June Hyuk's final score: 89.5)

1049
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:09,363
Jang June Hyuk's score is 89.5.

1050
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:12,803
Now, I'll reveal Kim Tae Seok's score.

1051
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:15,402
What's Kim Tae Seok's score?

1052
00:48:15,403 --> 00:48:17,374
(Did Kim Tae Seok also get a high score?)

1053
00:48:18,073 --> 00:48:20,242
(Kim Tae Seok's final score: 86.25)

1054
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:22,874
- Our scores are high. - It's 86.25.

1055
00:48:23,473 --> 00:48:25,583
Next comes...

1056
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:28,714
- Kim Do Hyun's score. - I'm nervous.

1057
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:30,984
Do Hyun is a strong candidate.

1058
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:39,763
(Despite his injury, Kim Do Hyun
showed the perfect techniques.)

1059
00:48:41,124 --> 00:48:43,533
I need the benefit to survive.

1060
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:47,103
I was still in danger since I
didn't know Do Hyun's score.

1061
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:49,333
But I thought that I needed the benefit...

1062
00:48:49,334 --> 00:48:51,473
in order to survive.

1063
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:54,342
Did they look kindly upon me?

1064
00:48:54,343 --> 00:48:56,512
(Kim Do Hyun's final score)

1065
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:57,913
(Kim Do Hyun's final score: 88.5)

1066
00:48:57,914 --> 00:48:59,319
(Do Hyun's individual
points: 89, 93, 80, and 92)

1067
00:48:59,343 --> 00:49:03,684
Kim Do Hyun's score is 88.5.

1068
00:49:03,714 --> 00:49:05,024
It's pretty impressive.

1069
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:09,254
Will the last dancer, Lee Jin
Woo, receive the highest score...

1070
00:49:09,553 --> 00:49:11,664
and become the Best Dancer?

1071
00:49:11,964 --> 00:49:14,723
Jin Woo was Moo Gan's favorite dancer.

1072
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:19,803
(What's the score of Lee Jin
Woo, Ki Moo Gan's favorite dancer?)

1073
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:22,433
(Lee Jin Woo's final score: 88)

1074
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:26,173
- Lee Jin Woo's score is 88. - It's 88.

1075
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:29,173
I was quite disappointed. I did very well.

1076
00:49:29,943 --> 00:49:31,112
I was very happy.

1077
00:49:31,113 --> 00:49:33,314
My understanding is that I got lucky.

1078
00:49:33,743 --> 00:49:36,883
Thus, the Best Dancer of
"Breaking, Addiction" is...

1079
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:39,223
- Jang June Hyuk. - Thank you.

1080
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:41,584
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1081
00:49:42,624 --> 00:49:43,723
(Proud)

1082
00:49:44,093 --> 00:49:47,362
Jang June Hyuk will receive
the benefit points of 300.

1083
00:49:47,363 --> 00:49:48,363
Congratulations.

1084
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:50,733
I'll now reveal the synopsis
and casting board...

1085
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:53,834
for the next performance
of Stage Choice by Public.

1086
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:55,532
("Dash of Death")

1087
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:58,053
(Synopsis: War Boys of "Mad
Max" were the motive of the dance.)

1088
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,242
The main lead, Kim Hyun Ho, directed...

1089
00:50:01,243 --> 00:50:02,942
"Dash of Death."

1090
00:50:02,943 --> 00:50:04,172
Ryu Tae Young,

1091
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:05,183
Baek Sang Ha,

1092
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:06,543
Kim Min Suk,

1093
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:08,914
and Kim Seung Wook make up the ensemble.

1094
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:10,854
They match the synopsis so well.

1095
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:13,423
Did you the movie, "Mad Max?"

1096
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:15,693
Yes, I've seen it. So it's...

1097
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:18,492
I heard that they practiced a lot.

1098
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:19,663
They practiced from 10am to 7pm.

1099
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:20,923
(These people are scary!)

1100
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:23,793
Let's focus on the word, "Dash."

1101
00:50:23,794 --> 00:50:26,003
When I listened to the music,

1102
00:50:26,004 --> 00:50:28,163
what passed through my mind...

1103
00:50:28,164 --> 00:50:31,874
were the War Boys of "Mad Max."

1104
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:35,172
The way War Boys charge
forward even if they must sacrifice...

1105
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:37,672
their lives...

1106
00:50:37,673 --> 00:50:39,013
felt like a dash.

1107
00:50:39,214 --> 00:50:40,782
It suits the theme, "Dash."

1108
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:42,783
We'll be able to give a fun performance.

1109
00:50:43,684 --> 00:50:47,354
Can everyone prepare a
piece of paper and a pen?

1110
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:48,754
(A piece of paper and a pen?)

1111
00:50:48,823 --> 00:50:50,353
(I thought we were going to practice.)

1112
00:50:50,354 --> 00:50:53,664
Let me tell you why I
told you to bring them.

1113
00:50:53,923 --> 00:50:57,394
Even War Boys must be different.

1114
00:50:57,434 --> 00:51:00,862
We shouldn't decide on 1
character with 1 emotion.

1115
00:51:00,863 --> 00:51:04,103
For example, Min Seok is a
lithe man who gets scared easily.

1116
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:06,503
But if he becomes
determined, he charges forward.

1117
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:09,513
It'll be nice to develop
the characters like that.

1118
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:13,644
Let's use this time to study each other.

1119
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:16,684
For this choreography,
there isn't a group dance.

1120
00:51:16,714 --> 00:51:18,283
Everyone is the main lead.

1121
00:51:18,383 --> 00:51:21,753
Everyone is a War Boy
with various characters.

1122
00:51:21,754 --> 00:51:23,253
When they move toward death,

1123
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:25,993
all of them become the main leads.

1124
00:51:26,064 --> 00:51:27,663
Shall we talk about it?

1125
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:29,632
I'll begin with Sang Ha.

1126
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,733
I think he's the most
energetic one among us.

1127
00:51:31,734 --> 00:51:33,964
He'll be the lead.

1128
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:35,834
I had that thought too.

1129
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:37,503
I wrote one word.

1130
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:38,572
"Spearhead."

1131
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:39,902
(It suits him perfectly.)

1132
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,012
(The spearhead's energy)

1133
00:51:42,013 --> 00:51:43,144
Min Suk.

1134
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:45,442
He's afraid of moving forward...

1135
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:47,382
because he's the closest to being a boy.

1136
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:50,382
Despite being afraid, he throws
his body because he must.

1137
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:52,453
You're like the hidden expert.

1138
00:51:52,454 --> 00:51:55,153
Behind the spearhead
are the strongest warriors.

1139
00:51:55,653 --> 00:51:56,753
The ace.

1140
00:51:56,754 --> 00:51:58,124
(Seung Wook is the ace.)

1141
00:51:58,223 --> 00:51:59,262
Tae Young.

1142
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:00,862
His looks...

1143
00:52:00,863 --> 00:52:03,632
and movements show agility and elegance.

1144
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:05,964
So he's the clever character.

1145
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:07,434
(Seung Wook had the
same opinion as Sang Ha.)

1146
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:08,572
(The clever one of the mission)

1147
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:09,973
We have the same opinions.

1148
00:52:10,303 --> 00:52:13,843
Please get into your
character when you move.

1149
00:52:13,903 --> 00:52:15,472
Since we were in the Under Class,

1150
00:52:15,473 --> 00:52:18,443
we didn't have a role.

1151
00:52:18,743 --> 00:52:21,083
When he gave each one of us a character,

1152
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:23,854
we became determined to work harder.

1153
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:27,984
(After the character analysis,
they practice for "Dash of Death.")

1154
00:52:28,024 --> 00:52:29,922
(Rolling...)

1155
00:52:29,923 --> 00:52:31,692
(and jumping)

1156
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,669
(The intense choreography
is like physical training.)

1157
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,063
This is five, six.

1158
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:36,824
- This is insane.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

1159
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:39,802
(They groan every time
they carry out a move.)

1160
00:52:39,803 --> 00:52:40,964
Nice.

1161
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:42,773
(They groan endlessly
in the practice room.)

1162
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:45,343
It's very intense. I don't
know if this is doable.

1163
00:52:45,803 --> 00:52:47,242
During my time as a dancer,

1164
00:52:47,243 --> 00:52:50,173
I've never had such a
difficult choreography.

1165
00:52:50,343 --> 00:52:53,113
Our choreography involves
rolling and jumping repeatedly.

1166
00:52:53,383 --> 00:52:56,683
There are many moves that
make us thrash on the floor.

1167
00:52:56,684 --> 00:52:58,113
It hurts.

1168
00:52:58,723 --> 00:53:00,722
Since there's no break,

1169
00:53:00,723 --> 00:53:03,652
we have to keep dashing toward death.

1170
00:53:03,653 --> 00:53:05,069
(The intense choreography
makes them dash nonstop.)

1171
00:53:05,093 --> 00:53:06,422
The choreography is too intense.

1172
00:53:06,423 --> 00:53:08,023
Yes. I stuffed it with techniques.

1173
00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:09,210
Will we be able to pull it off?

1174
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:12,133
It'll be hard. But it'll be fun to
succeed in this choreography.

1175
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,302
I can say with confidence that we
worked harder than any other team.

1176
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:17,672
We've been practicing
until late at night for days.

1177
00:53:17,673 --> 00:53:20,704
We've been practicing passionately.

1178
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:24,144
Since we practiced for a long time,
it's impossible not to be the best.

1179
00:53:24,843 --> 00:53:26,813
We became part of the choreography.

1180
00:53:26,814 --> 00:53:30,253
"Even if I break and
die, I must keep fighting."

1181
00:53:30,254 --> 00:53:31,660
(What will "Dash of Death" look like?)

1182
00:53:31,684 --> 00:53:33,460
(How will the five dancers'
"Dash of Death" turn out?)

1183
00:53:33,484 --> 00:53:34,624
(Strong appearance)

1184
00:53:35,323 --> 00:53:36,593
They look like War Boys.

1185
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:37,693
It looks totally raw.

1186
00:53:37,693 --> 00:53:38,693
(Exclaiming)

1187
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:40,964
- It suits them well.
- Their appearance is shocking.

1188
00:53:41,323 --> 00:53:42,434
First position.

1189
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:46,464
- You're amazing.
- The baldhead is handsome.

1190
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:48,254
- Let's go, Ryu Tae Young! - Let's go.

1191
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:50,234
Music, start.

1192
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:51,942
("Dash of Death" Synopsis)

1193
00:53:51,943 --> 00:53:54,742
(When the War Boys start
moving to face their death, )

1194
00:53:54,743 --> 00:53:56,543
(they become true lead dancers.)

1195
00:53:56,544 --> 00:53:58,782
(As if they're testing their convictions, )

1196
00:53:58,783 --> 00:54:00,013
(they start dashing.)

1197
00:54:01,714 --> 00:54:03,383
They look scary.

1198
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:04,724
They really look like War Boys.

1199
00:54:07,254 --> 00:54:08,524
Gosh, look at Tae Young's hair.

1200
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:20,664
(Baek Sang Ha)

1201
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:22,505
- Sang Ha is really...
- He's a scene-stealer.

1202
00:54:26,903 --> 00:54:27,903
(What's that?)

1203
00:54:28,073 --> 00:54:29,814
(Getting goosebumps)

1204
00:54:30,073 --> 00:54:31,073
(In awe)

1205
00:54:35,113 --> 00:54:36,414
Hyun Ho is in good condition.

1206
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:43,893
They're exactly like War Boys.

1207
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,524
Dancers born in 1995 are rolling.

1208
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:48,693
(Matthew is impressed.)

1209
00:54:51,434 --> 00:54:52,964
Seung Wook is on a roll.

1210
00:54:53,863 --> 00:54:54,863
(The jump makes her jaw drop.)

1211
00:54:54,864 --> 00:54:55,874
Gosh, Seung Wook.

1212
00:54:56,504 --> 00:54:57,504
He practically flew.

1213
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:09,513
I love this choreography.

1214
00:55:14,954 --> 00:55:15,993
Perfect.

1215
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:18,723
I love it.

1216
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,422
(Dashing instinct)

1217
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:22,563
(This is so exciting.)

1218
00:55:22,564 --> 00:55:23,664
I love this part.

1219
00:55:29,004 --> 00:55:30,303
(Let's go, Tiger.)

1220
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:36,013
I love Seung Wook.

1221
00:55:37,113 --> 00:55:38,173
(Screaming)

1222
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:39,483
(Getting overheated)

1223
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:40,683
(He loves it.)

1224
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:41,684
Nice.

1225
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:42,782
(Hyun Ho, nice.)

1226
00:55:42,783 --> 00:55:43,883
He's totally determined.

1227
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:45,383
They're so good.

1228
00:55:59,434 --> 00:56:00,434
(Oh, my.)

1229
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:04,334
Beautiful.

1230
00:56:04,604 --> 00:56:06,274
There's definitely a story.

1231
00:56:06,774 --> 00:56:07,874
Here comes Seung Wook.

1232
00:56:08,343 --> 00:56:10,442
(Everyone's attention is on him.)

1233
00:56:10,443 --> 00:56:11,443
(Impressed)

1234
00:56:11,444 --> 00:56:12,644
Seung Wook is insane.

1235
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:17,184
Impressive.

1236
00:56:25,664 --> 00:56:27,223
(Everyone, scream.)

1237
00:56:27,723 --> 00:56:29,464
(Everyone agrees and thinks, "This is it.")

1238
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,204
(They're also going wild.)

1239
00:56:39,173 --> 00:56:40,472
How many times did he spin?

1240
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:41,802
That's out of this world.

1241
00:56:41,803 --> 00:56:43,083
- He had an awakening. - I know.

1242
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:47,243
That's so cool.

1243
00:56:52,883 --> 00:56:53,883
(Totally immersed)

1244
00:57:00,064 --> 00:57:01,064
The ball is rolling.

1245
00:57:01,464 --> 00:57:03,762
- That's such a great idea.
- Oh, my goodness.

1246
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:04,893
What's that?

1247
00:57:04,894 --> 00:57:07,233
I love that movement.

1248
00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:08,734
How did he come up with that idea?

1249
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:10,103
It looks like a vine.

1250
00:57:10,104 --> 00:57:12,473
It's probably depicting War
Boys rolling in the desert.

1251
00:57:15,004 --> 00:57:16,913
(What's going on?)

1252
00:57:16,914 --> 00:57:18,073
(Full of anticipation)

1253
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:27,283
It's choreographed so well.

1254
00:57:27,584 --> 00:57:29,254
Visually, it's really stunning.

1255
00:57:33,923 --> 00:57:36,262
(Dashing towards my heart)

1256
00:57:36,263 --> 00:57:37,992
(Yes, this is it.)

1257
00:57:37,993 --> 00:57:39,234
They're insane.

1258
00:58:13,903 --> 00:58:15,163
(You can listen to "Ready,
Set, Go" by HOMIES, )

1259
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:16,949
(the performance music of "Dash
of Death" on various platforms.)

1260
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:21,073
(The audience praises Team
"Dash of Death" endlessly.)

1261
00:58:21,473 --> 00:58:22,673
(Standing ovation)

1262
00:58:23,173 --> 00:58:25,173
- Bravo. - They were on their way to death.

1263
00:58:25,644 --> 00:58:26,782
That was unbelievable.

1264
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:28,890
The choreography for each
of five dancers was different.

1265
00:58:28,914 --> 00:58:31,814
They were out to break
and destroy everything.

1266
00:58:32,084 --> 00:58:33,483
(After dancing passionately, )

1267
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:35,223
(the dancers can't get back up easily.)

1268
00:58:35,723 --> 00:58:39,593
(They have a hard time getting up.)

1269
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:42,762
(Dancer Ryu Tae Young
have a difficult time getting up.)

1270
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:43,894
They look exhausted.

1271
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:46,733
(The dancers poured so
much of their energy into it...)

1272
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:48,632
(that they can't get up easily.)

1273
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:49,802
(Sigh of relief)

1274
00:58:49,803 --> 00:58:51,274
I think that it's a hard one.

1275
00:58:51,774 --> 00:58:53,572
Dancers of "Dash of Death..."

1276
00:58:53,573 --> 00:58:56,443
directed by Kim Hyun
Ho, you worked very hard.

1277
00:58:58,843 --> 00:59:01,612
(Good work.)

1278
00:59:01,613 --> 00:59:03,613
(Kim Hyun Ho)

1279
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:08,083
(The dancers' passionate
performance makes...)

1280
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:09,692
(Kim Hyun Ho's family tear up.)

1281
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:10,894
Oh, no. She's crying.

1282
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:12,723
It looks like Hyun Ho's sister.

1283
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:15,124
Why doesn't my older sister cry for me?

1284
00:59:15,664 --> 00:59:18,433
I must say, Kim Hyun Ho,

1285
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:21,132
your choreography was
amazing. It was dynamic,

1286
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:23,132
exciting, and athletic.

1287
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:26,373
"Mad Max," no. It was Hyun Ho Max.

1288
00:59:26,374 --> 00:59:28,243
(Not "Mad Max" but Hyun Ho Max)

1289
00:59:28,843 --> 00:59:29,843
(Laughing)

1290
00:59:30,214 --> 00:59:32,044
- Gosh, "Hyun Ho Max." - Yes.

1291
00:59:33,113 --> 00:59:35,684
The composition and creative
ideas in your choreography.

1292
00:59:36,254 --> 00:59:40,484
I couldn't stop admiring while
watching your performance.

1293
00:59:41,184 --> 00:59:43,423
When I watched the four
dancers perform together,

1294
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:47,963
each of your character was clear.

1295
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:49,532
It was another part...

1296
00:59:49,533 --> 00:59:53,064
of Kim Hyun Ho's directing that stood out.

1297
00:59:53,234 --> 00:59:54,533
(Bowing)

1298
00:59:56,604 --> 00:59:58,203
(I'm proud of you, Tiger.)

1299
00:59:58,204 --> 01:00:00,103
I could really tell...

1300
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:03,213
how hard all of you practiced.

1301
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:05,613
Your hard work showed,
and I really enjoyed it.

1302
01:00:05,684 --> 01:00:08,543
(Their hard work showed
in their performance.)

1303
01:00:08,544 --> 01:00:10,083
For "Dash of Death,"

1304
01:00:10,084 --> 01:00:13,153
will Kim Hyun Ho be
selected as the Best Director?

1305
01:00:13,553 --> 01:00:16,723
Among four group dancers,
who will be the Best Dancer?

1306
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,823
I'm not going home.

1307
01:00:19,923 --> 01:00:23,133
Let's win benefit points
and get the most advantage.

1308
01:00:23,434 --> 01:00:26,333
We must win in order to survive.

1309
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:27,434
I feel confident.

1310
01:00:28,664 --> 01:00:29,802
I will announce...

1311
01:00:29,803 --> 01:00:32,774
the result of Seat Class
Evaluation for Kim Hyun Ho.

1312
01:00:33,044 --> 01:00:35,742
Let's go, Tiger Hyun.

1313
01:00:35,743 --> 01:00:37,073
(Go, Tiger.)

1314
01:00:37,274 --> 01:00:40,184
Both VIP and R seats have been sold out.

1315
01:00:40,883 --> 01:00:42,012
(VIP and R seats for Team
"Dash of Death" are sold out.)

1316
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,484
I'll announce the result of S seat voting.

1317
01:00:44,984 --> 01:00:49,923
Will they exceed the result
of Ki Moo Gan's team?

1318
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:51,822
I bet all seats got sold
out for Hyun Ho's team.

1319
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:53,322
His choreography was good.

1320
01:00:53,323 --> 01:00:55,123
I don't think his S seats got sold out.

1321
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:56,734
- Are you wary of him? - A little bit.

1322
01:00:57,294 --> 01:00:59,164
I bet a minimum of
4,000 seats were sold out.

1323
01:00:59,803 --> 01:01:00,834
What's the result?

1324
01:01:01,263 --> 01:01:03,803
- I hope that S seats are sold out.
- Here's the result.

1325
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:06,004
(625 S seats)

1326
01:01:06,504 --> 01:01:07,743
(What?)

1327
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:09,413
(A little disappointed)

1328
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:10,913
(Disappointed)

1329
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:12,173
It's much less than I thought.

1330
01:01:12,314 --> 01:01:14,383
- Hyun Ho's work was great.
- It was really good.

1331
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:15,754
That's surprising.

1332
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:18,413
They sold a total of 625 S seats...

1333
01:01:18,414 --> 01:01:21,382
and 238 A seats.

1334
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:25,193
I was confident about the
quality of my choreography,

1335
01:01:25,254 --> 01:01:28,263
but the audience voting was included.

1336
01:01:28,524 --> 01:01:30,434
That part was disappointing.

1337
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:32,532
Based on Kim Hyun Ho's Team's result,

1338
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:35,303
Ki Moo Gan's team stays in first place.

1339
01:01:35,704 --> 01:01:37,132
(It's disappointing, but he accepts it.)

1340
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:38,133
(Disappointed)

1341
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:40,143
Next, I'll announce...

1342
01:01:40,144 --> 01:01:43,073
the Best Dancer of "Dash of Death."

1343
01:01:43,274 --> 01:01:44,573
This is the highlight.

1344
01:01:45,013 --> 01:01:47,544
All the dancers on that
team were neck and neck.

1345
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:49,683
In "Dash of Death,"

1346
01:01:49,684 --> 01:01:52,453
which dancer will win benefit points?

1347
01:01:52,454 --> 01:01:53,853
It could be Sang Ha.

1348
01:01:53,854 --> 01:01:56,953
Sang Ha had a lot of
solo parts in the middle.

1349
01:01:56,954 --> 01:01:57,954
Right.

1350
01:01:58,454 --> 01:02:01,563
(Baek Sang Ha's strong
energy caught people's attention.)

1351
01:02:01,564 --> 01:02:03,262
Your dancing and energy were unbelievable.

1352
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,834
You deserve a lot of praise,
and I enjoyed watching you.

1353
01:02:06,263 --> 01:02:07,762
Seung Wook definitely...

1354
01:02:07,763 --> 01:02:10,073
His character was strong, and it stood out.

1355
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:13,573
(Kim Seung Wook's presence
and powerful energy stood out.)

1356
01:02:13,843 --> 01:02:15,644
(Seung Wook is on a roll.)

1357
01:02:16,173 --> 01:02:17,273
I was shocked.

1358
01:02:17,274 --> 01:02:19,414
You really looked like a War Boy.

1359
01:02:21,013 --> 01:02:23,754
I'll start with Ryu Tae Young's score.

1360
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:25,282
Let's go, Tae Young.

1361
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,422
- I bet he got a high score. - Ryu Terrius.

1362
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:27,624
Ryu Terrius.

1363
01:02:28,223 --> 01:02:29,254
What's the result?

1364
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:32,192
(Ryu Tae Young's final score: 89.75)

1365
01:02:32,193 --> 01:02:33,193
What?

1366
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:36,032
(Surprised)

1367
01:02:36,033 --> 01:02:38,333
(Giving him credit)

1368
01:02:38,334 --> 01:02:39,334
That's high.

1369
01:02:39,604 --> 01:02:41,533
Won't I get the benefit?

1370
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:44,573
"Dash" received a lot of great response.

1371
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:48,342
Next, I'll announce Baek Sang Ha's score.

1372
01:02:48,343 --> 01:02:50,713
- I won't exceed his score.
- Baek Sang Ha's score is...

1373
01:02:50,714 --> 01:02:52,544
Sang Ha will get a high score, too.

1374
01:02:52,684 --> 01:02:55,683
Will it be higher or
lower than 89.75 points?

1375
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:57,052
(Higher or lower than Tae Young's score?)

1376
01:02:57,053 --> 01:02:59,053
- Will he get 90? - Will it be in the 90s?

1377
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,853
Baek Sang Ha's score is...

1378
01:03:00,854 --> 01:03:02,052
(Average Score for Baek Sang Ha)

1379
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:03,053
(88.5 points)

1380
01:03:03,054 --> 01:03:04,523
(Baek Sang Ha's final score: 88.5 points)

1381
01:03:04,524 --> 01:03:06,293
(Disappointed)

1382
01:03:06,294 --> 01:03:08,493
His score is 88.5 points.

1383
01:03:08,964 --> 01:03:10,363
I was a little disappointed.

1384
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:12,263
That was so close.

1385
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:14,862
Next, I'll announce...

1386
01:03:14,863 --> 01:03:16,704
Kim Min Suk's score.

1387
01:03:16,903 --> 01:03:19,242
(Kim Min Suk's average score: 87.25 points)

1388
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:22,513
Kim Min Suk's score is 87.25 points.

1389
01:03:23,274 --> 01:03:26,883
With 89.75 points Ryu
Tae Young is in 1st place.

1390
01:03:26,984 --> 01:03:29,613
Will Kim Seung Wook's score exceed...

1391
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:32,153
Ryu Tae Young's score?

1392
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:35,024
Will he be selected the Best Dancer?

1393
01:03:35,454 --> 01:03:37,193
It's impossible to predict.

1394
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:39,173
Will it be long hair or the baldhead?

1395
01:03:42,763 --> 01:03:45,294
Last but not least, I'll announce...

1396
01:03:45,763 --> 01:03:47,123
Kim Seung Wook's score right away.

1397
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:49,834
- Won't his score be 90?
- I know. It's possible.

1398
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:52,473
I wanted to win the benefit.

1399
01:03:52,673 --> 01:03:55,704
- His score is... - I was hoping for it.

1400
01:03:55,803 --> 01:03:58,273
I think Seung Wook's
score will be slightly less.

1401
01:03:58,274 --> 01:04:00,313
(Kim Min Suk 87.25, Ryu Tae
Young 89.75, Baek Sang Ha 88.5)

1402
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,154
(Kim Seung Wook's
average score: 91.25 points)

1403
01:04:02,854 --> 01:04:03,983
(Everyone gets up.)

1404
01:04:03,984 --> 01:04:05,853
His score is 91.25 points.

1405
01:04:05,854 --> 01:04:07,222
(Dancer Kim Seung
Wook wins benefit points.)

1406
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:10,322
Kim Seung Wook is given 300
benefit points. Congratulations.

1407
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:12,193
His score exceeded 90.

1408
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:15,493
I was shocked. It was my
first time winning the benefit.

1409
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:17,862
Will I be able to survive like a cockroach?

1410
01:04:17,863 --> 01:04:19,934
I'm hoping for it.

1411
01:04:20,363 --> 01:04:23,334
Stage Choice by Public mission.
Here's the next performance.

1412
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:25,604
(Awakening Inside Nightmare)

1413
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:28,343
(Screaming)

1414
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:31,572
Directed by Main Lead Jung Sung Wook,

1415
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:33,044
"Awakening Inside the Nightmare."

1416
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:36,113
For the ensemble, Yang
Seong Yun, Moon Jun On,

1417
01:04:36,454 --> 01:04:38,512
An Si On,

1418
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:40,923
Park Min Woo have been cast.

1419
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:43,124
It's a ballerino's party.

1420
01:04:43,624 --> 01:04:46,294
In "Awakening Inside the Nightmare"
directed by Jung Sung Wook,

1421
01:04:46,593 --> 01:04:49,263
he tries to escape from the
nightmare with a bad ending.

1422
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:52,294
However, his final
moment inevitably arrives.

1423
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:55,403
"Awakening Inside the
Nightmare" will start now.

1424
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:01,704
(There's only silence
inside the team's studio.)

1425
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:03,672
(Sighing)

1426
01:05:03,673 --> 01:05:05,573
I'm in huge trouble.

1427
01:05:06,584 --> 01:05:07,644
If you join my team...

1428
01:05:08,314 --> 01:05:10,484
I'm not good at choreographing.

1429
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:12,584
If you join my team,

1430
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:15,783
your opinions will be accepted.
Those who want to be recognized.

1431
01:05:15,823 --> 01:05:17,053
I already have an idea.

1432
01:05:17,323 --> 01:05:19,963
I was hoping for Yang Seong Yun...

1433
01:05:19,964 --> 01:05:21,223
and Yun Hyeok Jung to join me.

1434
01:05:21,323 --> 01:05:24,234
They seem to like
contemporary dance style...

1435
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:26,234
that's closest to the classical.

1436
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:28,434
I don't want ballet dancers to join me.

1437
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:32,673
I'll join to the team that needs me.

1438
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:34,980
(Yang Seong Yun responds to
Jung Sung Wook's desperate plea.)

1439
01:05:35,004 --> 01:05:36,143
I'll join Sung Wook.

1440
01:05:36,144 --> 01:05:37,544
(Another ballet dancer)

1441
01:05:37,644 --> 01:05:38,673
I have no choice.

1442
01:05:38,943 --> 01:05:42,653
(Unlike what Sung Wook
hoped, ballet dancers join him.)

1443
01:05:42,954 --> 01:05:44,782
Three dancers...

1444
01:05:44,783 --> 01:05:47,984
who aren't suitable for what
I had imagined joined me.

1445
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:50,254
I need to come up with a new idea.

1446
01:05:54,064 --> 01:05:56,394
So this part...

1447
01:05:58,033 --> 01:05:59,033
(Staring)

1448
01:05:59,034 --> 01:06:01,734
(The team with the same keyword
is practicing on the other side.)

1449
01:06:02,104 --> 01:06:04,903
We don't dance in segments like them,

1450
01:06:05,104 --> 01:06:06,173
so let's ignore that.

1451
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:07,943
I'm at a total loss.

1452
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:11,473
Ho Jong is someone who
choreographs all day long,

1453
01:06:11,743 --> 01:06:15,443
but I'm not experienced with
choreography. I feel at a loss.

1454
01:06:16,084 --> 01:06:18,313
They have a dancing
style that they're good at.

1455
01:06:18,314 --> 01:06:21,754
We also have a clear identity.

1456
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:24,093
Let's do our best not to damage...

1457
01:06:24,954 --> 01:06:26,064
our ballet identity.

1458
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:28,323
I want my choreography...

1459
01:06:28,423 --> 01:06:30,934
to be a mix of contemporary
dance and ballet.

1460
01:06:31,394 --> 01:06:33,004
We have our honorary ballet dancer...

1461
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:35,164
- Ballerino Yun. - with us.

1462
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:37,004
If you can,

1463
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:40,644
could you change your
technique closer to ballet?

1464
01:06:41,044 --> 01:06:42,343
I'll do what I can.

1465
01:06:42,714 --> 01:06:43,714
I like ballet.

1466
01:06:43,715 --> 01:06:46,184
There are moments when
I feel a rush of adrenaline.

1467
01:06:46,283 --> 01:06:48,083
I'm trying my best to
contribute to the team.

1468
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:51,314
(Lifting technique)

1469
01:06:52,084 --> 01:06:53,084
Good.

1470
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:58,493
("Awakening Inside the Nightmare"
works hard to show various moves.)

1471
01:06:58,693 --> 01:07:00,564
He's doing a good job
while being strategic.

1472
01:07:00,923 --> 01:07:03,363
Something that only ballet dancers can do.

1473
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:06,164
A clean ensemble that's only possible...

1474
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:07,863
with a group of ballet dancers.

1475
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:11,303
Such things are shown in his choreography.

1476
01:07:12,004 --> 01:07:14,104
The performance has to stand out.

1477
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:17,243
If I compete with
directing and composition,

1478
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:18,343
I might have a chance.

1479
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:21,442
When it comes to completion,

1480
01:07:21,443 --> 01:07:23,584
we made it 100 percent.

1481
01:07:23,854 --> 01:07:26,012
(How will "Awakening
Inside the Nightmare...")

1482
01:07:26,013 --> 01:07:27,723
(with the ballet identity turn out?)

1483
01:07:29,923 --> 01:07:32,323
(The extraordinary pose from
the start makes people scream.)

1484
01:07:32,993 --> 01:07:34,024
Lifting?

1485
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:37,593
- That must be a bed.
- He's going to sleep now.

1486
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:39,334
It's Sleeping Sung Wook.

1487
01:07:40,104 --> 01:07:41,104
First position.

1488
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:44,573
Lights, music, start.

1489
01:07:45,004 --> 01:07:48,103
(Nightmares always have a bad ending.)

1490
01:07:48,104 --> 01:07:51,874
(I struggle to escape,
but I can't escape death.)

1491
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:56,454
(Show us.)

1492
01:08:05,594 --> 01:08:06,724
(Automatic clapping)

1493
01:08:07,023 --> 01:08:08,094
Nice.

1494
01:08:08,193 --> 01:08:09,313
- Gosh. - That's very clean.

1495
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,033
(Throbbing)

1496
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:22,004
Nice.

1497
01:08:22,844 --> 01:08:24,073
(Prince Sung Wook)

1498
01:08:30,414 --> 01:08:32,954
(The standard ballet)

1499
01:08:36,954 --> 01:08:38,554
(The honorary ballet dancer appears.)

1500
01:08:39,224 --> 01:08:41,023
Gosh, Karina.

1501
01:08:42,424 --> 01:08:43,433
My gosh.

1502
01:08:47,664 --> 01:08:49,233
(This is nice.)

1503
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:51,903
(Satisfied)

1504
01:08:58,514 --> 01:08:59,514
Nice.

1505
01:09:01,844 --> 01:09:02,884
Goodness.

1506
01:09:06,254 --> 01:09:08,283
(There they go.)

1507
01:09:09,794 --> 01:09:11,523
That's insane. They look amazing too.

1508
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:22,264
(Her jaw drops.)

1509
01:09:27,174 --> 01:09:28,204
(This is it.)

1510
01:09:46,764 --> 01:09:49,464
(They're getting immersed in it.)

1511
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:50,863
(In awe)

1512
01:09:51,033 --> 01:09:52,033
Look at his acting.

1513
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:01,504
(I love it.)

1514
01:10:11,683 --> 01:10:13,353
Goodness.

1515
01:10:13,853 --> 01:10:16,954
(Going wild)

1516
01:10:17,353 --> 01:10:19,224
- Gosh. - He's good.

1517
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:22,493
Goodness.

1518
01:10:26,563 --> 01:10:27,603
Nice.

1519
01:10:28,964 --> 01:10:30,004
Balance.

1520
01:10:30,204 --> 01:10:31,504
Good attitude.

1521
01:10:32,403 --> 01:10:33,403
Nice.

1522
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:43,584
- His choreography looks good.
- I love the composition.

1523
01:10:53,294 --> 01:10:54,294
(Moon Jun On)

1524
01:10:54,393 --> 01:10:57,834
(Bombardment of ballet moves)

1525
01:10:57,964 --> 01:10:59,033
(Satisfied)

1526
01:10:59,264 --> 01:11:00,304
(Yang Seong Yun)

1527
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:07,044
(The group's tour en l'air)

1528
01:11:07,073 --> 01:11:08,143
(Exclaiming)

1529
01:11:12,214 --> 01:11:13,544
(Even pirouettes)

1530
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:15,143
(Automatic nodding)

1531
01:11:15,584 --> 01:11:16,953
Nice.

1532
01:11:16,954 --> 01:11:17,954
(This is it.)

1533
01:11:18,254 --> 01:11:20,483
- Oh, my. - Gosh, that looked neat.

1534
01:11:43,974 --> 01:11:45,674
(A fantastic ending)

1535
01:11:46,014 --> 01:11:49,543
(You can listen to the performance
music on various platforms.)

1536
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:52,104
("Awakening Inside the Nightmare"
showed the essence of ballet.)

1537
01:11:52,283 --> 01:11:54,723
(Applauding)

1538
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:55,754
(Moved)

1539
01:11:56,283 --> 01:11:57,323
They did a good job.

1540
01:11:59,353 --> 01:12:01,323
(Good work.)

1541
01:12:01,563 --> 01:12:03,834
- They were amazing.
- They must have practiced a lot.

1542
01:12:04,134 --> 01:12:06,164
Sung Wook made a wise decision...

1543
01:12:06,464 --> 01:12:08,033
to compete with ballet moves.

1544
01:12:08,733 --> 01:12:10,403
Directed by Jung Sung Wook,

1545
01:12:10,603 --> 01:12:12,432
it was "Awakening Inside the Nightmare."

1546
01:12:12,433 --> 01:12:14,173
Good work, dancers.

1547
01:12:14,174 --> 01:12:16,612
I'd like to say good
work to this entire team.

1548
01:12:16,613 --> 01:12:19,943
I really saw your
commitment to your characters.

1549
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,242
And the portrayal of
those characters was...

1550
01:12:22,243 --> 01:12:25,013
really impressive to me
from everyone on the floor.

1551
01:12:25,014 --> 01:12:27,084
Really well done to all of you.

1552
01:12:27,483 --> 01:12:29,523
What I admired the most was...

1553
01:12:29,624 --> 01:12:31,794
from the start to the end,

1554
01:12:31,954 --> 01:12:34,924
Sung Wook's facial expression
and energy that led the drama.

1555
01:12:35,023 --> 01:12:38,294
His various acting skills really stood out.

1556
01:12:38,393 --> 01:12:41,833
With your perfect directing,
all dancers stood out.

1557
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:44,772
Your individual part was done perfectly.

1558
01:12:44,773 --> 01:12:46,443
I appreciated it in many ways.

1559
01:12:46,743 --> 01:12:49,713
I was very worried if I
was being a good director.

1560
01:12:49,714 --> 01:12:53,214
Their positive evaluation
made me very happy.

1561
01:12:53,514 --> 01:12:55,343
With "Awakening Inside the Nightmare,"

1562
01:12:55,344 --> 01:12:58,283
will Jung Sung Wook be
selected as the Best Director?

1563
01:12:58,554 --> 01:13:01,924
Among four group dancers,
who will be the Best Dancer?

1564
01:13:02,884 --> 01:13:06,294
I'll announce the result
of Seat Class Evaluation...

1565
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:08,693
for Jung Sung Wook's
"Awakening Inside the Nightmare."

1566
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:11,192
Will it exceed...

1567
01:13:11,193 --> 01:13:14,304
the current winner Ki
Moo Gan's 13,273 seats?

1568
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:15,803
I can't watch this.

1569
01:13:15,804 --> 01:13:16,933
Let's go, Sung Wook.

1570
01:13:17,134 --> 01:13:18,233
I feel nervous.

1571
01:13:18,334 --> 01:13:21,304
The result of VIP seat voting for
"Awakening Inside the Nightmare."

1572
01:13:21,844 --> 01:13:23,073
It might get sold out.

1573
01:13:23,374 --> 01:13:24,374
(3,000 VIP seats)

1574
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,543
They're sold out.

1575
01:13:25,544 --> 01:13:27,089
(VIP seats for "Awakening
Inside the Nightmare" are sold out.)

1576
01:13:27,113 --> 01:13:29,514
All 3,000 seats are sold out.

1577
01:13:29,783 --> 01:13:30,958
That was easy.

1578
01:13:31,313 --> 01:13:33,883
Next, I'll announce the voting result...

1579
01:13:33,884 --> 01:13:36,954
of R seats that have
a limit of 4,000 seats.

1580
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:38,753
Honestly, these should be sold out too.

1581
01:13:38,754 --> 01:13:40,664
Up to R seats should be sold out.

1582
01:13:41,094 --> 01:13:42,764
Let them be sold out up to R seats.

1583
01:13:43,094 --> 01:13:45,063
The voting result for R seats.

1584
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:47,863
(3,873 R seats)

1585
01:13:48,504 --> 01:13:49,932
(Seriously?)

1586
01:13:49,933 --> 01:13:51,033
That was close.

1587
01:13:51,174 --> 01:13:53,642
("Awakening Inside the Nightmare"
team failed to sell all R seats.)

1588
01:13:53,643 --> 01:13:54,874
That was so close.

1589
01:13:54,974 --> 01:13:56,243
It didn't happen?

1590
01:13:56,374 --> 01:13:58,443
This must be quite difficult.

1591
01:13:58,773 --> 01:14:00,612
(319 S seats, 242 A seats)

1592
01:14:00,613 --> 01:14:02,642
The voting result for
"Awakening Inside the Nightmare."

1593
01:14:02,643 --> 01:14:05,754
A total of 7,434 seats have been sold.

1594
01:14:05,954 --> 01:14:07,124
Good job.

1595
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:08,852
("Awakening Inside the
Nightmare" team placed 4th.)

1596
01:14:08,853 --> 01:14:10,124
It was a bummer.

1597
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:11,793
I need to work harder,

1598
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:13,363
but how?

1599
01:14:14,964 --> 01:14:16,932
Next, I'll announce...

1600
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:19,033
the Best Dancer in "Awakening
Inside the Nightmare."

1601
01:14:19,063 --> 01:14:20,163
I can't wait to find out.

1602
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:23,473
First, I'll announce
Yang Seong Yun's score.

1603
01:14:23,474 --> 01:14:24,933
I bet it'll be Seong Yun.

1604
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:26,373
His score will be high.

1605
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:30,112
(Yang Seong Yun executed
ballet moves perfectly...)

1606
01:14:30,113 --> 01:14:33,414
(as well as his duet with Jung Sung Wook.)

1607
01:14:33,613 --> 01:14:36,813
I thought that you were a
dancer that we definitely need.

1608
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,613
Yang Seong Yun's score is...

1609
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:41,383
(Average score: 86.75 points)

1610
01:14:41,384 --> 01:14:43,294
It's 86.75 points.

1611
01:14:43,493 --> 01:14:44,724
We don't know yet.

1612
01:14:44,954 --> 01:14:47,263
Next, I'll announce Moon Jun On...

1613
01:14:47,264 --> 01:14:49,724
and An Si On's score.

1614
01:14:50,363 --> 01:14:52,432
(Moon Jun On: 80.25
points, An Si On: 75.75 points)

1615
01:14:52,433 --> 01:14:53,633
(Moon Jun On: 80.25 points)

1616
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:55,063
(An Si On: 75.75 points)

1617
01:14:55,304 --> 01:14:59,004
Last but not least, I'll
announce Park Min Woo's score.

1618
01:14:59,943 --> 01:15:00,943
I'm so nervous.

1619
01:15:01,073 --> 01:15:02,673
- Min Woo did a good job too. - I agree.

1620
01:15:02,773 --> 01:15:04,073
He stood out in the back.

1621
01:15:04,174 --> 01:15:09,313
(Park Min Woo showed
off his flexibility and talent.)

1622
01:15:09,683 --> 01:15:11,514
I worked hard. I'm anticipating it.

1623
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:16,594
I think that I stood out
the most in the ensemble.

1624
01:15:17,124 --> 01:15:18,493
Park Min Woo's score is...

1625
01:15:18,893 --> 01:15:21,023
(Park Min Woo: 84 points)

1626
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:23,794
Park Min Woo's score is 84 points.

1627
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:26,164
I was bummed out, but I have no regrets.

1628
01:15:26,464 --> 01:15:28,103
(Relieved)

1629
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:31,133
The Best Dancer in "Awakening
Inside the Nightmare" is...

1630
01:15:31,134 --> 01:15:32,803
Yang Seong Yun.

1631
01:15:32,804 --> 01:15:34,564
(Dancer Yang Seong
Yun wins benefit points.)

1632
01:15:35,103 --> 01:15:36,204
I was very happy.

1633
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,143
This could be what helps me survive.

1634
01:15:40,344 --> 01:15:41,942
Stage Choice by Public mission.

1635
01:15:41,943 --> 01:15:45,014
Here are the synopsis and casting
board for the next performance.

1636
01:15:46,724 --> 01:15:47,782
("Endless Dash Towards Freedom")

1637
01:15:47,783 --> 01:15:51,022
(The next performance is
revealed in the midst of cheers.)

1638
01:15:51,023 --> 01:15:52,224
(Hullabaloo)

1639
01:15:52,523 --> 01:15:55,562
Directed by Main Lead Kim Hye Hyun,

1640
01:15:55,563 --> 01:15:57,533
"Endless Dash Towards Freedom."

1641
01:15:57,764 --> 01:16:00,102
For the ensemble, Go
Dong Hoon, Jung Hye Seong,

1642
01:16:00,103 --> 01:16:04,004
Kim Sang Gil, Bang
Seong Hyun have been cast.

1643
01:16:04,304 --> 01:16:06,173
All the dancers are good on this team.

1644
01:16:06,174 --> 01:16:07,844
- Yes. - They will be very strong.

1645
01:16:08,004 --> 01:16:09,843
Stage Choice by Public mission.

1646
01:16:09,844 --> 01:16:12,812
Directed by Main Lead Kim Hye Hyun,

1647
01:16:12,813 --> 01:16:14,584
"Endless Dash Towards Freedom."

1648
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:16,653
It will start now.

1649
01:16:16,714 --> 01:16:20,483
(How will "Endless Dash
Towards Freedom" turn out?)

1650
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:23,523
(Full of anticipation)

1651
01:16:23,594 --> 01:16:25,623
("Endless Dash Towards
Freedom" practice room)

1652
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:27,022
The five dancers can...

1653
01:16:27,023 --> 01:16:28,093
(Mumbling)

1654
01:16:28,094 --> 01:16:29,163
We come together and...

1655
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:31,932
Dong Hoon and Sang
Gil who have a lot to say.

1656
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:33,833
The number of ideas that we had...

1657
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:35,233
was about five million.

1658
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,102
However, Hye Hyun wasn't...

1659
01:16:37,103 --> 01:16:39,473
saying much.

1660
01:16:39,474 --> 01:16:41,173
I'm quite worried.

1661
01:16:41,174 --> 01:16:43,413
When I work on it
alone, I only need a day...

1662
01:16:43,414 --> 01:16:44,942
to choreograph three minutes.

1663
01:16:44,943 --> 01:16:46,173
But there were five of us.

1664
01:16:46,174 --> 01:16:48,583
I don't have much experience as a director.

1665
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:50,352
I have so many ideas, so
it's hard to organize them.

1666
01:16:50,353 --> 01:16:51,652
Just tell us all of them.

1667
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:53,182
We need to discuss everything.

1668
01:16:53,183 --> 01:16:56,084
This is what I mentioned
before. It should be high.

1669
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:58,393
I'd like to create a busy vibe.

1670
01:16:58,523 --> 01:17:00,492
The final goal is freedom.

1671
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:03,763
I want to show an endless dash.

1672
01:17:03,764 --> 01:17:06,862
I'd like to express the speed.

1673
01:17:06,863 --> 01:17:09,134
What's an image that can symbolize it?

1674
01:17:09,264 --> 01:17:11,572
- An engine? - An engine.

1675
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:13,133
When we think of an engine,

1676
01:17:13,134 --> 01:17:16,543
we can show what happens
when the engine gets started.

1677
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:17,612
- That's a good idea. - I think...

1678
01:17:17,613 --> 01:17:20,513
that Dong Hoon has a knack for directing.

1679
01:17:20,514 --> 01:17:22,613
He can help me in areas where I lack.

1680
01:17:22,813 --> 01:17:25,213
- What do you want to do, Hye Hyun?
- This is what I want to try.

1681
01:17:25,214 --> 01:17:26,312
People are at this height,

1682
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:29,054
and I can come through and do this.

1683
01:17:29,084 --> 01:17:30,423
- That idea and... - Shall we try it?

1684
01:17:30,424 --> 01:17:32,723
- Be decisive and tell us.
- It's just an idea.

1685
01:17:32,724 --> 01:17:35,623
I don't know what I'll do in this part.

1686
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:38,664
Hye Hyun needed a lot of time...

1687
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:41,362
to organize his thoughts.

1688
01:17:41,363 --> 01:17:42,432
I know what you mean.

1689
01:17:42,433 --> 01:17:43,902
We can definitely lift you that high.

1690
01:17:43,903 --> 01:17:45,473
There's a trick to that. Come here.

1691
01:17:45,474 --> 01:17:46,903
(Dong Hoon, you're the best.)

1692
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:49,402
He helped me so much by my side,

1693
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:50,643
so I felt reassured.

1694
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:53,843
He's a dancer with a lot of charms.

1695
01:17:53,844 --> 01:17:56,112
I hope that he'll rely on
us so that we can create...

1696
01:17:56,113 --> 01:17:57,454
a dynamic choreography.

1697
01:17:58,454 --> 01:18:00,724
We have good teamwork, but I'm a bit slow.

1698
01:18:01,054 --> 01:18:02,424
We don't advance very fast.

1699
01:18:02,823 --> 01:18:05,652
- Shall we try? We need to finish. - Okay.

1700
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:08,362
(They're already marking with the music.)

1701
01:18:08,363 --> 01:18:10,032
I didn't think that they were better...

1702
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:11,953
just because they were
advancing faster than us.

1703
01:18:12,164 --> 01:18:13,862
I have to admit...

1704
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:15,032
that I was worried.

1705
01:18:15,033 --> 01:18:16,833
They were like an empty can that's noisy.

1706
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:19,003
We finished planning it out perfectly,

1707
01:18:19,004 --> 01:18:21,703
and you're falling a little behind.

1708
01:18:21,704 --> 01:18:23,914
- There's a huge gap. - Right.

1709
01:18:24,643 --> 01:18:25,873
I'm not worried.

1710
01:18:25,874 --> 01:18:29,243
People who get ahead
first fall flat on their face.

1711
01:18:29,384 --> 01:18:32,682
Technically, we'll be
much superior to them.

1712
01:18:32,683 --> 01:18:35,853
Fascinating motions that
five dancers can create.

1713
01:18:36,054 --> 01:18:38,322
That's what we were trying to make.

1714
01:18:38,323 --> 01:18:41,793
Once everything gets ready,
it will look complete the most.

1715
01:18:41,794 --> 01:18:43,963
It could be frustrating at first,

1716
01:18:43,964 --> 01:18:45,492
but it became explosive at the end.

1717
01:18:45,493 --> 01:18:46,773
Please believe me until the end.

1718
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:48,964
I definitely think that it's possible.

1719
01:18:49,304 --> 01:18:50,824
(How will their performance turn out?)

1720
01:18:55,103 --> 01:18:56,142
(Kim Hye Hyun)

1721
01:18:56,143 --> 01:18:57,772
(Kim Sang Gil, Hye Hyun, keep dashing.)

1722
01:18:57,773 --> 01:18:59,333
(Hye Seong, you're the only one I see.)

1723
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:03,483
(Kim Hye Hyun, Dong Hoon)

1724
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:04,653
"Gukbap?"

1725
01:19:05,514 --> 01:19:06,612
"Gukbap Hye Hyun."

1726
01:19:06,613 --> 01:19:08,853
- It's me who gave him the nickname.
- I know.

1727
01:19:09,584 --> 01:19:11,322
They will be amazing.

1728
01:19:11,323 --> 01:19:13,153
The dancers on this team are spectacular.

1729
01:19:13,493 --> 01:19:14,853
The audience is screaming already.

1730
01:19:15,323 --> 01:19:16,423
For Hye Hyun?

1731
01:19:16,424 --> 01:19:17,633
He's standing up there.

1732
01:19:17,634 --> 01:19:19,033
(Giggling)

1733
01:19:19,063 --> 01:19:20,863
(He can't believe what he's seeing.)

1734
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:22,804
("Endless Dash Towards Freedom" Synopsis)

1735
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:24,932
The beginning is so strong.

1736
01:19:24,933 --> 01:19:25,933
(A strong opening)

1737
01:19:29,804 --> 01:19:30,813
(Exhilarating)

1738
01:19:31,613 --> 01:19:32,613
Yes, this is it.

1739
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,142
It's impossible not to like it.

1740
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,313
This is too strong.

1741
01:19:38,914 --> 01:19:40,254
It's a circus.

1742
01:19:43,594 --> 01:19:44,794
(Everyone's eyes are on them.)

1743
01:19:47,794 --> 01:19:49,294
They look like an idol group.

1744
01:19:58,004 --> 01:19:59,134
Oh, my gosh.

1745
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:04,143
That looks amazing.

1746
01:20:09,884 --> 01:20:10,884
(Shouting)

1747
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:12,454
(Unbelievable)

1748
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:15,653
I can't believe that he did
a rise while going through.

1749
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,193
Hye Hyun is insanely good.

1750
01:20:27,334 --> 01:20:30,433
- Here it is. The legend is coming.
- Here it comes.

1751
01:20:30,603 --> 01:20:31,903
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1752
01:20:36,573 --> 01:20:38,242
(The legend is here.)

1753
01:20:38,243 --> 01:20:39,650
(It can't be more immersive than this.)

1754
01:20:39,674 --> 01:20:41,043
Oh, my gosh.

1755
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,724
- He knows how to move. - They're so good.

1756
01:20:43,283 --> 01:20:44,353
Set, go.

1757
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,993
(Dash, Hye Hyun.)

1758
01:20:52,353 --> 01:20:53,693
He dances so well.

1759
01:20:59,834 --> 01:21:00,903
(Simply in awe)

1760
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:03,303
How does he make techniques look so easy?

1761
01:21:03,304 --> 01:21:05,532
His body control is unbelievable.

1762
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:06,974
- It's amazing. - Seriously.

1763
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:19,113
His choreography looks great.

1764
01:21:19,384 --> 01:21:20,653
It looks like street dance.

1765
01:21:28,264 --> 01:21:29,594
They look fabulous.

1766
01:21:30,794 --> 01:21:32,634
(A dash of shouting)

1767
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:35,102
- That was great.
- It looked good on "set."

1768
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:36,103
It's fun to watch.

1769
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:38,224
- They're competent individually.
- It's just insane.

1770
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:46,573
They're perfectly in sync.

1771
01:21:52,014 --> 01:21:53,384
(Thrilling)

1772
01:21:54,683 --> 01:21:56,283
(Admiring)

1773
01:21:59,554 --> 01:22:00,724
This part looks so cool.

1774
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:03,394
Moving in slow motion
was a stroke of genius.

1775
01:22:05,893 --> 01:22:08,103
(Exclaiming)

1776
01:22:08,264 --> 01:22:09,863
I love this part.

1777
01:22:10,103 --> 01:22:11,334
He looks like Iron Man.

1778
01:22:11,603 --> 01:22:13,704
This is super impressive.

1779
01:22:15,974 --> 01:22:16,974
The details...

1780
01:22:18,474 --> 01:22:19,844
It's a work of art.

1781
01:22:27,683 --> 01:22:28,683
(Getting ready to shout)

1782
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:31,293
Let's go.

1783
01:22:31,294 --> 01:22:32,854
(Running recklessly instead of dashing)

1784
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:36,563
(Cheering and shouting)

1785
01:22:43,304 --> 01:22:44,304
Crazy Potato.

1786
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:46,403
It looks refreshing.

1787
01:22:49,004 --> 01:22:50,673
Go Dong Hoon.

1788
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:51,844
(Go Dong Hoon)

1789
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:54,283
Sang Gil.

1790
01:22:54,313 --> 01:22:55,913
(In awe)

1791
01:22:55,914 --> 01:22:57,454
It's a show of technique.

1792
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:03,724
(Kim Sang Gil)

1793
01:23:05,924 --> 01:23:06,993
It's pleasing to watch.

1794
01:23:08,823 --> 01:23:10,383
(Hye Seong, you're the only one I see.)

1795
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:14,284
- Impressive. - Oh, my gosh.

1796
01:23:20,674 --> 01:23:22,943
(The perfect finale)

1797
01:23:26,073 --> 01:23:27,513
(You can listen to "Ready,
Set, Go" by HOMIES...)

1798
01:23:27,514 --> 01:23:29,213
(That was impressive.)

1799
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:30,812
(World Star Jung Hye Seong)

1800
01:23:30,813 --> 01:23:32,083
(Kim Hye Hyun, Dong Hoon)

1801
01:23:32,084 --> 01:23:34,322
(That was just amazing.)

1802
01:23:34,323 --> 01:23:35,624
That was amazing.

1803
01:23:35,853 --> 01:23:37,392
(Automatic standing ovation)

1804
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:38,523
We have to get up for this.

1805
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:40,893
(Matthew is happy.)

1806
01:23:41,964 --> 01:23:43,023
They did a wonderful job.

1807
01:23:43,693 --> 01:23:45,992
- They're amazing. - I'm really shocked.

1808
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:47,233
Oh, my gosh.

1809
01:23:47,764 --> 01:23:49,533
(Screaming)

1810
01:23:50,164 --> 01:23:52,209
- The ending scene was incredible.
- He practically flew.

1811
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:54,303
- Their technique was amazing.
- It was incredible.

1812
01:23:54,304 --> 01:23:55,373
They were so good.

1813
01:23:55,374 --> 01:23:57,003
- It kept me on my toes. - I agree.

1814
01:23:57,004 --> 01:23:59,014
- Seriously. - Hye Hyun is a monster.

1815
01:23:59,273 --> 01:24:01,283
All of them will get high praise.

1816
01:24:01,813 --> 01:24:05,182
"Endless Dash Towards
Freedom" directed by Kim Hye Hyun.

1817
01:24:05,183 --> 01:24:06,954
Good work, dancers.

1818
01:24:07,153 --> 01:24:09,523
Let's hear from the judges.

1819
01:24:09,783 --> 01:24:11,294
How was the performance, Matthew?

1820
01:24:12,323 --> 01:24:14,763
I just need a second...

1821
01:24:14,764 --> 01:24:18,433
because it was so
impressive of a performance.

1822
01:24:20,193 --> 01:24:22,204
I'm a little bit speechless
for the first time.

1823
01:24:23,004 --> 01:24:24,874
He's speechless. That's amazing.

1824
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:28,803
Kim Hye Hyun, I thought
you did a really fantastic job...

1825
01:24:28,804 --> 01:24:31,113
of directing these dancers.

1826
01:24:33,143 --> 01:24:34,813
I was very shocked today.

1827
01:24:35,414 --> 01:24:38,053
Not only are you a good director,

1828
01:24:38,054 --> 01:24:41,884
but you're also talented
as a choreographer.

1829
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:45,753
When you were standing
onstage, you looked like idol singers.

1830
01:24:45,754 --> 01:24:47,863
I know that Kang Daniel is next to you.

1831
01:24:48,323 --> 01:24:49,764
(Their eyes are fixed on him.)

1832
01:24:50,023 --> 01:24:51,333
(Bowing)

1833
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:53,464
(An idol singer and
dancers bow to each other.)

1834
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:56,063
Except Dong Hoon.

1835
01:24:58,204 --> 01:25:01,072
You showed what idol
singers have these days.

1836
01:25:01,073 --> 01:25:03,812
In a choreography that everyone would love,

1837
01:25:03,813 --> 01:25:07,243
there was softness,
strength, quick, and slow.

1838
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:10,714
The choreography had everything.

1839
01:25:10,813 --> 01:25:12,213
(Thank you.)

1840
01:25:12,214 --> 01:25:14,224
(Hye Hyun is recognized.)

1841
01:25:14,783 --> 01:25:19,053
I'd like to compliment the
four dancers in the ensemble.

1842
01:25:19,054 --> 01:25:20,764
In the starting scene...

1843
01:25:22,193 --> 01:25:25,392
You looked like a sports car...

1844
01:25:25,393 --> 01:25:27,532
with Kim Hye Hyun is the driver.

1845
01:25:27,533 --> 01:25:29,964
You looked like a running
engine that just got started.

1846
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,333
They look like parts of something.

1847
01:25:32,334 --> 01:25:33,774
- Right. - They look like a machine.

1848
01:25:34,243 --> 01:25:35,643
How is this possible?

1849
01:25:35,974 --> 01:25:37,044
I was very surprised.

1850
01:25:39,643 --> 01:25:42,442
Directed by Main Lead Kim Hye Hyun...

1851
01:25:42,443 --> 01:25:44,713
"Endless Dash Towards Freedom."

1852
01:25:44,714 --> 01:25:47,783
Will Kim Hye Hyun be
selected as the Best Director?

1853
01:25:48,183 --> 01:25:51,193
Among four group dancers,
who will be the Best Dancer?

1854
01:25:52,393 --> 01:25:54,164
It'll be hard to pick the best one.

1855
01:25:54,924 --> 01:25:55,964
I know.

1856
01:25:56,094 --> 01:25:58,464
Class Movement Ceremony
will take place soon.

1857
01:25:58,563 --> 01:26:00,463
(Five dancers performed
"Endless Dash Towards Freedom.")

1858
01:26:00,464 --> 01:26:03,263
(What fate awaits them?)

1859
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:06,732
For Main Lead and
Director Kim Hye Hyun's...

1860
01:26:06,733 --> 01:26:09,142
"Endless Dash Towards Freedom,"

1861
01:26:09,143 --> 01:26:11,513
I'll announce the result
of Seat Class Evaluation.

1862
01:26:11,514 --> 01:26:12,643
(I'm so nervous.)

1863
01:26:12,943 --> 01:26:13,943
(Anticipating)

1864
01:26:13,944 --> 01:26:17,783
First, I'll announce the
voting result for VIP seats.

1865
01:26:18,054 --> 01:26:19,112
I'm so desperate.

1866
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:21,124
Why do I feel so nervous all of a sudden?

1867
01:26:21,424 --> 01:26:23,584
- It's because you did well. - Goodness.

1868
01:26:23,724 --> 01:26:24,753
Yes.

1869
01:26:24,754 --> 01:26:25,953
(3,000 VIP seats are sold out.)

1870
01:26:25,954 --> 01:26:27,123
(This is good.)

1871
01:26:27,124 --> 01:26:29,693
All 3,000 seats are sold out.

1872
01:26:30,264 --> 01:26:31,733
- Sold out. - Sold out.

1873
01:26:31,933 --> 01:26:34,263
VIP seats for the team
led by Kim Hye Hyun were...

1874
01:26:34,264 --> 01:26:36,963
sold out within 16 minutes of being on air.

1875
01:26:36,964 --> 01:26:39,133
(Sold out within 16 minutes)

1876
01:26:39,134 --> 01:26:40,903
All seats were sold out.

1877
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:43,503
- That's crazy. - Sixteen minutes?

1878
01:26:43,504 --> 01:26:44,514
(Happy)

1879
01:26:44,743 --> 01:26:47,213
Next, I'll announce the voting result...

1880
01:26:47,214 --> 01:26:49,943
for R seats that have
a limit of 4,000 seats.

1881
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:51,934
- Please help us. - What's the result?

1882
01:26:52,054 --> 01:26:53,312
I bet they're sold out.

1883
01:26:53,313 --> 01:26:54,853
Show us the result now.

1884
01:26:55,783 --> 01:26:57,123
- Gosh. - That's a relief.

1885
01:26:57,124 --> 01:26:58,124
(3,000 R seats are sold out.)

1886
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:00,023
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

1887
01:27:00,563 --> 01:27:02,822
All R seats are also sold out.

1888
01:27:02,823 --> 01:27:06,594
Are S seats with a limit
of 5,000 sold out too?

1889
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:07,963
I'm so curious, Hye Hyun.

1890
01:27:07,964 --> 01:27:09,562
It might be about 2,000 to 3,000.

1891
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:11,633
They probably won't
reach the limit by a little.

1892
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:13,233
- A little? - It could be 4,800 seats.

1893
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:14,843
Please, let them be sold out.

1894
01:27:14,844 --> 01:27:16,474
- Let's go, Hye Hyun. - Let's go.

1895
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:17,914
(Smiling)

1896
01:27:18,914 --> 01:27:20,943
Suddenly, I felt anxious.

1897
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:23,783
(5,000 S seats are sold.)

1898
01:27:24,313 --> 01:27:25,914
(Howling)

1899
01:27:26,554 --> 01:27:29,953
We got it.

1900
01:27:29,954 --> 01:27:32,723
For Kim Hye Hyun's "Endless
Dash Towards Freedom,"

1901
01:27:32,724 --> 01:27:34,293
two hours before the voting ended,

1902
01:27:34,294 --> 01:27:38,264
their VIP, R, and S seats were sold out.

1903
01:27:38,794 --> 01:27:39,993
Two hours before?

1904
01:27:40,193 --> 01:27:42,764
Finally, there will be a
star in contemporary dance.

1905
01:27:43,164 --> 01:27:46,573
The number of A seats for
Hye Hyun's team is important.

1906
01:27:47,004 --> 01:27:48,973
Lastly, I'll announce the voting result...

1907
01:27:48,974 --> 01:27:52,474
for Kim Hye Hyun's team's
A seats that have no limit.

1908
01:27:52,974 --> 01:27:55,113
Please.

1909
01:27:55,613 --> 01:27:57,143
Please let it be over 1,000 seats.

1910
01:27:57,754 --> 01:27:59,514
Our score wasn't bad.

1911
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:02,283
I wanted us to be Top Three.

1912
01:28:03,424 --> 01:28:05,424
I hope my team wins first place.

1913
01:28:06,624 --> 01:28:08,469
(477 A seats for "Endless
Dash Towards Freedom")

1914
01:28:08,493 --> 01:28:09,493
(Slightly disappointed)

1915
01:28:09,494 --> 01:28:12,062
- That's a bummer.
- They sold a total of 477 seats.

1916
01:28:12,063 --> 01:28:13,063
What a bummer.

1917
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:14,964
That's so unfortunate.

1918
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:17,973
As a result, Ki Moo Gan's
team remains first place.

1919
01:28:17,974 --> 01:28:19,703
With a difference of 796 votes,

1920
01:28:19,704 --> 01:28:22,473
Kim Hye Hyun's team places second.

1921
01:28:22,474 --> 01:28:24,772
Next, I'll announce the Best Dancer...

1922
01:28:24,773 --> 01:28:27,113
in "Endless Dash Towards Freedom."

1923
01:28:27,714 --> 01:28:29,183
- I'm so curious. - Who will it be?

1924
01:28:29,783 --> 01:28:31,513
It might be Hye Seong.

1925
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:32,754
Will it be Dong Hoon?

1926
01:28:32,914 --> 01:28:34,482
- Let's go. - You can do it.

1927
01:28:34,483 --> 01:28:35,483
He looks nervous.

1928
01:28:35,484 --> 01:28:36,883
He's nervous. He's rubbing his hands.

1929
01:28:36,884 --> 01:28:38,353
Did Hye Seong get a muscle cramp?

1930
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:43,563
First, I'll announce Jung Hye
Seong and Go Dong Hoon's scores.

1931
01:28:44,493 --> 01:28:46,393
I'm curious about Hye Seong.

1932
01:28:47,764 --> 01:28:52,204
(Dancer Hye Seong showed matchless energy.)

1933
01:28:53,634 --> 01:28:55,073
I hope mine will be over 90.

1934
01:28:55,403 --> 01:28:59,874
I contributed a lot to the team.

1935
01:29:01,313 --> 01:29:03,242
(Dancer Go Dong Hoon increased...)

1936
01:29:03,243 --> 01:29:05,714
(the quality of the team's technique.)

1937
01:29:06,853 --> 01:29:08,424
Go Dong Hoon.

1938
01:29:09,823 --> 01:29:11,892
Especially Go Dong Hoon,

1939
01:29:11,893 --> 01:29:16,063
you showed techniques that
only contemporary dancers can do.

1940
01:29:16,563 --> 01:29:18,264
I don't think I did a bad job.

1941
01:29:19,094 --> 01:29:20,433
Did Hye Seong do better?

1942
01:29:20,733 --> 01:29:22,063
I don't know. Be quiet.

1943
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:24,603
Hye Seong did better than Dong Hoon.

1944
01:29:24,804 --> 01:29:26,633
(You punks...)

1945
01:29:26,634 --> 01:29:28,103
Come out, those born in 1995.

1946
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:29,973
Dong Hoon, you looked okay.

1947
01:29:29,974 --> 01:29:30,974
Right?

1948
01:29:31,714 --> 01:29:34,613
- Dong Hoon, you need to be modest.
- But it feels...

1949
01:29:34,844 --> 01:29:36,644
(He gives affectionate
advice to his friend.)

1950
01:29:36,743 --> 01:29:38,253
(That's hilarious.)

1951
01:29:38,254 --> 01:29:40,083
There are so many hyenas here.

1952
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:41,454
(The result after being teased)

1953
01:29:42,254 --> 01:29:43,353
(Surprised)

1954
01:29:43,724 --> 01:29:46,954
(What's the shocking
result for the two dancers?)

1955
01:29:47,353 --> 01:29:49,822
(Go Dong Hoon: 89.25 points,
Jung Hye Seong: 93.5 points)

1956
01:29:49,823 --> 01:29:53,033
Go Dong Hoon's score is 89.25 points.

1957
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:56,504
Jung Hye Seong's score is 93.5 points.

1958
01:29:57,164 --> 01:29:58,533
Their scores are so high.

1959
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:00,803
How did that happen?

1960
01:30:00,804 --> 01:30:02,143
I was a little disappointed.

1961
01:30:02,544 --> 01:30:05,242
- He got the highest score.
- It's 93 points?

1962
01:30:05,243 --> 01:30:07,014
(Thank you.)

1963
01:30:07,483 --> 01:30:10,344
I have a chance of winning.

1964
01:30:11,153 --> 01:30:14,124
Next, I'll announce Kim Sang Gil's score.

1965
01:30:14,554 --> 01:30:15,554
(Kim Sang Gil: 91 points)

1966
01:30:15,555 --> 01:30:17,323
(Best Dancer Result)

1967
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:18,794
What?

1968
01:30:19,124 --> 01:30:20,764
Hey, Dong Hoon!

1969
01:30:21,323 --> 01:30:22,363
Dong Hoon.

1970
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:27,733
Lastly, Bang Seong
Hyun's score is 83.5 points.

1971
01:30:28,164 --> 01:30:30,902
As a result, the Best Dancer...

1972
01:30:30,903 --> 01:30:32,303
for "Endless Dash Towards Freedom" is...

1973
01:30:32,304 --> 01:30:33,974
Jung Hye Seong.

1974
01:30:35,573 --> 01:30:36,874
I felt recognized.

1975
01:30:37,304 --> 01:30:39,813
When I joined the ensemble,

1976
01:30:39,974 --> 01:30:42,783
people said that I stand
out, and I don't belong there.

1977
01:30:43,183 --> 01:30:46,753
Hye Seong is a dancer whom
we should watch on stage.

1978
01:30:46,754 --> 01:30:51,153
You completely abandoned
your earnest and eagerness...

1979
01:30:51,323 --> 01:30:54,863
that we see on video, and
you truly enjoyed performing.

1980
01:30:55,563 --> 01:30:58,594
It feels like I overcame a hurdle.

1981
01:30:58,764 --> 01:31:00,433
I was happy.

1982
01:31:01,464 --> 01:31:04,803
Jung Hye Seong is given 300 benefit points.

1983
01:31:04,804 --> 01:31:05,834
Congratulations.

1984
01:31:06,504 --> 01:31:08,203
Stage Choice by Public mission.

1985
01:31:08,204 --> 01:31:10,804
Here are the synopsis and casting
board for the next performance.

1986
01:31:12,344 --> 01:31:14,883
Directed by Main Lead Choi Ho Jong,

1987
01:31:14,884 --> 01:31:16,942
"Endless Nightmare."

1988
01:31:16,943 --> 01:31:19,282
For the ensemble, Kim Jong
Cheol, Kim Young Woong,

1989
01:31:19,283 --> 01:31:21,384
Kim Hyo Joon, and Yun
Hyeok Jung have been cast.

1990
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:23,384
These are all strong dancers.

1991
01:31:23,724 --> 01:31:26,022
They're the essence of the essence.

1992
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:27,023
You're right.

1993
01:31:27,893 --> 01:31:30,263
(STF Dance Company)

1994
01:31:30,264 --> 01:31:33,333
Only the best dancers joined me,

1995
01:31:33,334 --> 01:31:34,504
so I truly feel pressured.

1996
01:31:35,264 --> 01:31:37,673
Ho Jong has amazing dancers.

1997
01:31:37,674 --> 01:31:39,133
Ho Jong's team looks intense.

1998
01:31:39,134 --> 01:31:40,804
You have an incredible team.

1999
01:31:41,403 --> 01:31:43,973
The audience will expect
a lot from these dancers,

2000
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:47,514
and I have to meet that expectation.

2001
01:31:47,714 --> 01:31:52,383
This choreography involves many
facial expressions and gestures.

2002
01:31:52,384 --> 01:31:55,424
I already finished making the choreography.

2003
01:31:55,653 --> 01:31:58,793
I might ask you to move...

2004
01:31:58,794 --> 01:32:02,363
as if you're in sleep paralysis
after having a nightmare.

2005
01:32:03,424 --> 01:32:07,133
I expected Ho Jong to have
planned it out like a pervert.

2006
01:32:07,134 --> 01:32:08,763
I'm planning to use LED lights.

2007
01:32:08,764 --> 01:32:10,402
Do you have ideas for costumes?

2008
01:32:10,403 --> 01:32:12,933
I was thinking about crop tops.

2009
01:32:13,433 --> 01:32:15,272
There's something I
want to do in the intro.

2010
01:32:15,273 --> 01:32:18,943
While we're falling
down, the music will start.

2011
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:20,914
That's when the nightmare starts.

2012
01:32:21,084 --> 01:32:22,982
He prepared a lot.

2013
01:32:22,983 --> 01:32:24,283
I made a good choice.

2014
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:26,213
(Our director is the best.)

2015
01:32:26,214 --> 01:32:29,523
Our signature move
will be this hand gesture.

2016
01:32:29,924 --> 01:32:33,323
This gesture will be our signature move.

2017
01:32:33,523 --> 01:32:35,464
It's getting into us.

2018
01:32:36,863 --> 01:32:40,032
You wake up from a nightmare,
but you find yourself in another one.

2019
01:32:40,033 --> 01:32:42,102
It's hard to tell what's reality.

2020
01:32:42,103 --> 01:32:44,163
You can even lose yourself.

2021
01:32:44,164 --> 01:32:46,504
That's the vibe I wanted to create.

2022
01:32:47,004 --> 01:32:48,974
The dancers don't lack anything,

2023
01:32:49,243 --> 01:32:52,874
so their performance
shouldn't lack anything either.

2024
01:32:53,474 --> 01:32:56,443
I wanted the choreography to be powerful.

2025
01:32:56,643 --> 01:32:59,652
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

2026
01:32:59,653 --> 01:33:01,253
- One, two, three, four... - Gosh.

2027
01:33:01,254 --> 01:33:03,384
Seven, eight, one, two, three, four.

2028
01:33:03,683 --> 01:33:05,293
If you miss one, it's over.

2029
01:33:05,294 --> 01:33:07,863
- It's possible, but...
- This part is extremely fast.

2030
01:33:08,664 --> 01:33:10,424
Was this on the count of six?

2031
01:33:10,624 --> 01:33:12,863
Five, six, seven, eight.

2032
01:33:13,094 --> 01:33:14,663
We discussed among ourselves...

2033
01:33:14,664 --> 01:33:15,733
during practice.

2034
01:33:15,834 --> 01:33:18,833
Two, three. You have to jump on three.

2035
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:21,154
(The ensemble rehearses
together while asking each other.)

2036
01:33:21,474 --> 01:33:24,914
As people expect a lot
from us, we worked hard.

2037
01:33:25,143 --> 01:33:28,343
Do you put the arm in and go like this?

2038
01:33:28,344 --> 01:33:29,413
That's correct.

2039
01:33:29,414 --> 01:33:31,914
- Is this on 8? - Yes, 8.

2040
01:33:32,584 --> 01:33:35,264
It was our first day of practice,
and we just saw the choreography.

2041
01:33:35,353 --> 01:33:37,853
Everyone picked up
the choreography quickly,

2042
01:33:38,193 --> 01:33:41,063
and the quality of their dance was high.

2043
01:33:41,523 --> 01:33:42,563
I really like our team.

2044
01:33:44,664 --> 01:33:45,664
(Satisfied)

2045
01:33:45,893 --> 01:33:48,102
- Is it delicious or not? - It's delicious.

2046
01:33:48,103 --> 01:33:49,804
- It's delicious. - It's so delicious.

2047
01:33:50,063 --> 01:33:51,504
Only I need to make it delicious.

2048
01:33:52,474 --> 01:33:54,755
During practice, I thought,
"How are we so much in sync?"

2049
01:33:54,943 --> 01:33:56,844
The best dancers have gathered.

2050
01:33:56,974 --> 01:34:00,443
Our team has nothing
to fear against any team.

2051
01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:02,612
The ensemble on my team...

2052
01:34:02,613 --> 01:34:05,183
was just perfect.

2053
01:34:05,483 --> 01:34:07,454
We're probably the only one.

2054
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:12,224
I'll lead them well so that
everyone can stand out.

2055
01:34:12,724 --> 01:34:15,224
(How will their "Endless
Nightmare" turn out?)

2056
01:34:15,464 --> 01:34:18,264
- The team that's highly expected.
- Everyone expects a lot from them.

2057
01:34:18,834 --> 01:34:19,863
They must feel nervous.

2058
01:34:20,464 --> 01:34:23,062
You feel more nervous when
people have high expectations.

2059
01:34:23,063 --> 01:34:24,543
- They must feel very nervous. - Yes.

2060
01:34:24,804 --> 01:34:25,804
(Everyone's eyes are on...)

2061
01:34:25,805 --> 01:34:27,525
(the performance directed by Choi Ho Jong.)

2062
01:34:29,044 --> 01:34:31,474
(Out of the ordinary introduction)

2063
01:34:32,674 --> 01:34:33,714
(What?)

2064
01:34:33,813 --> 01:34:34,844
(Interested)

2065
01:34:35,214 --> 01:34:37,482
(What will their "Endless
Nightmare" look like?)

2066
01:34:37,483 --> 01:34:39,853
(To be continued)

2067
01:34:48,063 --> 01:34:49,164
He's hanging...

2068
01:34:49,624 --> 01:34:52,294
- like a bat. - My gosh.

2069
01:34:55,103 --> 01:34:56,103
That's crazy.

2070
01:34:56,603 --> 01:34:57,664
It gives me goosebumps.

2071
01:35:02,804 --> 01:35:03,804
They nailed it already.

2072
01:35:06,243 --> 01:35:07,443
(Kim Hyo Joon)

2073
01:35:08,084 --> 01:35:09,113
(Suddenly getting up)

2074
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,704
- Here it comes. - Here it comes.

2075
01:35:14,624 --> 01:35:15,624
(Yelling)

2076
01:35:15,954 --> 01:35:17,153
Gorgeous.

2077
01:35:20,124 --> 01:35:21,124
All right.

2078
01:35:23,363 --> 01:35:25,733
- Goodness. - Powerful.

2079
01:35:26,294 --> 01:35:27,363
It's insane.

2080
01:35:29,204 --> 01:35:30,233
They're totally in sync.

2081
01:35:30,964 --> 01:35:32,004
(Sharp and in sync)

2082
01:35:33,004 --> 01:35:34,004
(Covering her mouth)

2083
01:35:37,704 --> 01:35:38,773
They're monsterous.

2084
01:35:46,483 --> 01:35:47,554
(I love it.)

2085
01:35:51,823 --> 01:35:52,823
(Strong)

2086
01:35:53,353 --> 01:35:55,353
(They're getting goosebumps
because they like it.)

2087
01:35:56,964 --> 01:35:57,964
Oh, man.

2088
01:36:00,764 --> 01:36:01,834
The highlight.

2089
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:03,504
He looks crazy.

2090
01:36:04,004 --> 01:36:05,204
(Teleporting)

2091
01:36:05,533 --> 01:36:06,603
(It looks unbelievable.)

2092
01:36:07,844 --> 01:36:09,103
It's extremely detailed.

2093
01:36:11,374 --> 01:36:12,614
I can't take my eyes off of it.

2094
01:36:15,683 --> 01:36:16,714
He is special.

2095
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:20,014
I mean, the world needs to see him.

2096
01:36:22,783 --> 01:36:25,054
He really looks crazy.

2097
01:36:28,323 --> 01:36:29,363
He looks nice and strong.

2098
01:36:29,464 --> 01:36:30,993
He had an awakening too.

2099
01:36:32,933 --> 01:36:34,363
(Flying in the air)

2100
01:36:34,834 --> 01:36:36,334
Gosh, that was good.

2101
01:36:38,273 --> 01:36:39,504
He looks like a machine.

2102
01:36:43,804 --> 01:36:44,964
(Getting goosebumps in a row)

2103
01:36:52,613 --> 01:36:55,624
There are four amazing dancers,
but I can only see Ho Jong.

2104
01:37:01,863 --> 01:37:02,924
That looks so cool.

2105
01:37:06,334 --> 01:37:07,363
Here comes the UFC.

2106
01:37:08,334 --> 01:37:09,533
(It looks like martial arts.)

2107
01:37:10,103 --> 01:37:11,874
(That looks cool.)

2108
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:17,403
That lift gives me goosebumps.

2109
01:37:23,414 --> 01:37:24,442
(True wrinkle in the forehead)

2110
01:37:24,443 --> 01:37:25,514
They're so good.

2111
01:37:26,113 --> 01:37:27,514
They're out of their mind.

2112
01:37:32,653 --> 01:37:33,653
Nice.

2113
01:37:36,063 --> 01:37:37,224
He is coming.

2114
01:37:40,294 --> 01:37:41,333
(He can't believe it.)

2115
01:37:41,334 --> 01:37:42,403
(He's unbelievable.)

2116
01:37:45,474 --> 01:37:46,974
He doesn't feel any gravity.

2117
01:37:51,813 --> 01:37:53,044
(Simply astonished)

2118
01:37:55,183 --> 01:37:56,223
They're perfectly in sync.

2119
01:37:56,483 --> 01:37:57,483
(Perfect timing)

2120
01:37:57,983 --> 01:37:59,153
Ho Jong is a deity.

2121
01:38:03,454 --> 01:38:05,594
(Shout for Ho Jong the Great.)

2122
01:38:07,624 --> 01:38:08,693
Incredible.

2123
01:38:11,993 --> 01:38:13,033
He's really a monster.

2124
01:38:15,903 --> 01:38:16,933
Nice.

2125
01:38:21,504 --> 01:38:22,643
So incredible.

2126
01:38:23,504 --> 01:38:25,173
(A strong ending)

2127
01:38:25,174 --> 01:38:27,983
- Who was that at the end?
- Hyo Joon is a scene-stealer.

2128
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:31,983
(Kim Hyo Joon ended the
performance with fancy turns.)

2129
01:38:36,954 --> 01:38:41,054
(You can listen to "Lullaby Baby"
by Jvcki Wai on various platforms.)

2130
01:38:41,594 --> 01:38:42,793
(The performance ended, )

2131
01:38:42,794 --> 01:38:44,362
(but the audience doesn't stop cheering.)

2132
01:38:44,363 --> 01:38:45,532
(I root for Kim Hyo Joon, Kim
Jong Cheol with handsome profil)

2133
01:38:45,533 --> 01:38:46,533
(Yun Hyeok Jung)

2134
01:38:47,664 --> 01:38:48,863
(Respect)

2135
01:38:49,704 --> 01:38:50,933
My goodness.

2136
01:38:51,164 --> 01:38:54,603
I can only remember Ho
Jong. That's a little bit...

2137
01:38:55,004 --> 01:38:56,743
I mean, that had to be the strategy.

2138
01:38:57,073 --> 01:38:59,113
I mean, he hid them with masks.

2139
01:38:59,374 --> 01:39:01,283
Was that the plan? I want to ask.

2140
01:39:01,743 --> 01:39:03,143
(What was his intention?)

2141
01:39:03,243 --> 01:39:06,084
To be honest, I could only see Ho Jong.

2142
01:39:06,183 --> 01:39:09,123
The ensemble was
completely separate from him.

2143
01:39:09,124 --> 01:39:10,923
- Right. - I wonder how they'll evaluate.

2144
01:39:10,924 --> 01:39:12,322
(How will "Endless
Nightmare" be evaluated?)

2145
01:39:12,323 --> 01:39:14,594
First of all, it was surprising.

2146
01:39:15,624 --> 01:39:18,763
Starting from the first
scene, it was overwhelming.

2147
01:39:18,764 --> 01:39:21,403
The first scene was so scary...

2148
01:39:21,504 --> 01:39:24,033
that I can't forget it. However...

2149
01:39:26,334 --> 01:39:28,844
I can only remember Ho Jong.

2150
01:39:30,103 --> 01:39:33,813
You were overwhelming
when leading the choreography.

2151
01:39:33,914 --> 01:39:36,514
I'd like to know if that was your plan.

2152
01:39:36,914 --> 01:39:38,754
I expected...

2153
01:39:38,853 --> 01:39:40,713
most of the choreographers to work...

2154
01:39:40,714 --> 01:39:43,023
on making each dancer shine.

2155
01:39:43,254 --> 01:39:44,323
However,

2156
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:47,724
everyone knows very
well what these dancers...

2157
01:39:47,823 --> 01:39:49,523
are good at.

2158
01:39:49,724 --> 01:39:52,393
Through them, I wanted to
shine as a choreographer.

2159
01:39:52,794 --> 01:39:56,204
I thought that it could be an
example of good choreography.

2160
01:39:56,304 --> 01:39:58,504
That was my intention.

2161
01:39:58,834 --> 01:39:59,874
Thank you.

2162
01:40:00,134 --> 01:40:01,209
(You're great, Choi Ho Jong.)

2163
01:40:01,233 --> 01:40:04,874
For the ensemble in "Swan Lake,"

2164
01:40:04,974 --> 01:40:07,743
we say that we don't
need swans who stand out.

2165
01:40:07,844 --> 01:40:10,813
Such a choreography is considered good...

2166
01:40:10,914 --> 01:40:12,713
when individual personality is excluded.

2167
01:40:12,714 --> 01:40:14,753
These four dancers moved...

2168
01:40:14,754 --> 01:40:17,282
like one person.

2169
01:40:17,283 --> 01:40:19,724
I thought that it was excellent.

2170
01:40:20,193 --> 01:40:22,063
For me, however,

2171
01:40:22,764 --> 01:40:24,733
within an ensemble setting,

2172
01:40:25,033 --> 01:40:27,764
you can still showcase
your individuality...

2173
01:40:28,134 --> 01:40:31,164
and your own personal artistry onstage.

2174
01:40:31,933 --> 01:40:34,293
(Director Matthew was sad to
see the ensemble as one unit.)

2175
01:40:34,374 --> 01:40:36,272
Directed by Main Lead Choi Ho Jong,

2176
01:40:36,273 --> 01:40:38,812
"Endless Nightmare."

2177
01:40:38,813 --> 01:40:41,813
Will Choi Ho Jong be
selected as the Best Director?

2178
01:40:42,113 --> 01:40:44,782
Among 4 group dancers
from 1st and 2nd Class,

2179
01:40:44,783 --> 01:40:48,253
who will be the Best Dancer?

2180
01:40:48,254 --> 01:40:51,084
- Picking Best Dancer will be hard.
- I agree.

2181
01:40:52,353 --> 01:40:54,570
(What does the fate hold for
"Endless Nightmare" dancers?)

2182
01:40:54,594 --> 01:40:56,323
The main lead and the director,

2183
01:40:56,624 --> 01:40:59,033
Choi Ho Jong's "Endless Nightmare."

2184
01:40:59,193 --> 01:41:01,233
I'll announce the result...

2185
01:41:01,733 --> 01:41:03,164
of their Seat Class Evaluation.

2186
01:41:03,264 --> 01:41:05,333
- A seats will determine the result.
- That's what I want to know.

2187
01:41:05,334 --> 01:41:08,304
First, I'll announce the
voting result for VIP seats.

2188
01:41:09,304 --> 01:41:11,414
All 3,000 VIP seats are sold out.

2189
01:41:12,273 --> 01:41:13,914
(The result that everyone expected)

2190
01:41:14,143 --> 01:41:15,214
The next is important.

2191
01:41:15,584 --> 01:41:17,360
- I bet it took five minutes.
- Five minutes?

2192
01:41:17,384 --> 01:41:20,783
VIP seats were sold out within 16 minutes.

2193
01:41:21,054 --> 01:41:24,323
For Choi Ho Jong's team's
VIP seats were sold out...

2194
01:41:24,424 --> 01:41:26,693
within five minutes of being on air.

2195
01:41:27,124 --> 01:41:28,862
(Their VIP seats were
sold out within 5 minutes.)

2196
01:41:28,863 --> 01:41:31,563
- They received a lot of support.
- What did I tell you?

2197
01:41:31,764 --> 01:41:34,193
Isn't that faster than the time
it takes to wash your hands?

2198
01:41:34,493 --> 01:41:35,940
We finish brushing our
teeth in three minutes.

2199
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:37,533
Your only rival is yourself.

2200
01:41:37,804 --> 01:41:39,703
Next, I'll announce the voting result...

2201
01:41:39,704 --> 01:41:42,903
for R seats with a limit of 4,000 seats.

2202
01:41:43,004 --> 01:41:45,273
They must be sold out.
Otherwise, it'd be strange.

2203
01:41:45,974 --> 01:41:48,514
Their R seats are also sold out.

2204
01:41:49,584 --> 01:41:51,143
Their R seats got sold out...

2205
01:41:51,454 --> 01:41:53,584
within 46 minutes of being on air.

2206
01:41:53,714 --> 01:41:54,783
(Exclaiming)

2207
01:41:55,424 --> 01:41:57,554
Their S seats are also sold out.

2208
01:41:58,153 --> 01:42:01,054
As a result, Choi Ho Jong's
"Endless Nightmare..."

2209
01:42:01,294 --> 01:42:03,163
sold out VIP, R, and S seats...

2210
01:42:03,164 --> 01:42:05,692
within 13 hours after being on air.

2211
01:42:05,693 --> 01:42:06,733
Thirteen hours?

2212
01:42:07,033 --> 01:42:08,703
The ranking will be determined...

2213
01:42:08,704 --> 01:42:11,134
by the number of A seats that are sold.

2214
01:42:11,533 --> 01:42:13,233
Will Choi Ho Jong's team...

2215
01:42:13,304 --> 01:42:15,402
have earned more seats...

2216
01:42:15,403 --> 01:42:18,143
than Ki Moo Gan's team's?

2217
01:42:18,514 --> 01:42:20,914
I'm expecting him to
get around 3,000 seats.

2218
01:42:21,214 --> 01:42:23,783
I'll reveal the result for A seats.

2219
01:42:23,914 --> 01:42:25,652
(A seats with no limits, 5,225)

2220
01:42:25,653 --> 01:42:27,584
(Exclaiming)

2221
01:42:29,624 --> 01:42:34,094
- He secured a total of 5,225 seats.
- Nice.

2222
01:42:34,754 --> 01:42:37,163
"Endless Nightmare..."

2223
01:42:37,164 --> 01:42:41,533
secured 17,225 seats in total.

2224
01:42:41,634 --> 01:42:43,633
With the difference of 3,952 seats,

2225
01:42:43,634 --> 01:42:47,772
he ranked first.

2226
01:42:47,773 --> 01:42:49,003
Congratulations.

2227
01:42:49,004 --> 01:42:51,174
(Thank you.)

2228
01:42:51,643 --> 01:42:53,873
I get to work with him for the second time?

2229
01:42:53,874 --> 01:42:54,883
(Honored)

2230
01:42:54,884 --> 01:42:57,843
Next, I will announce the best dancer...

2231
01:42:57,844 --> 01:43:00,214
in Team "Endless Nightmare."

2232
01:43:00,454 --> 01:43:01,983
This is the real deal.

2233
01:43:02,624 --> 01:43:03,682
This is the real deal.

2234
01:43:03,683 --> 01:43:06,223
Who will receive the benefit...

2235
01:43:06,224 --> 01:43:08,664
in "Endless Nightmare?"

2236
01:43:08,924 --> 01:43:12,634
I will reveal Kim Jong Cheol's score first.

2237
01:43:13,033 --> 01:43:15,334
What if they all received over 90?

2238
01:43:15,634 --> 01:43:17,334
Like 95?

2239
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:19,273
Kim Jong Cheol's score is...

2240
01:43:19,674 --> 01:43:20,703
(Average score, 87.5)

2241
01:43:20,704 --> 01:43:22,643
It's 87.5.

2242
01:43:23,073 --> 01:43:24,344
(87.5?)

2243
01:43:24,844 --> 01:43:25,974
- What? - What?

2244
01:43:26,313 --> 01:43:27,313
That's lower than expected.

2245
01:43:27,314 --> 01:43:30,613
Next is Kim Young Woong's score.

2246
01:43:30,983 --> 01:43:31,983
- Ninety-one? - Ninety-two?

2247
01:43:31,983 --> 01:43:32,983
Ninety-two?

2248
01:43:32,984 --> 01:43:34,683
(Average score, 87)

2249
01:43:34,783 --> 01:43:36,583
It's 87.

2250
01:43:36,584 --> 01:43:38,193
We were so cheap with the score.

2251
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:40,753
"You're Ho Jong's team."

2252
01:43:40,754 --> 01:43:42,393
The intention is obvious.

2253
01:43:42,964 --> 01:43:45,833
I changed the dancers...

2254
01:43:45,834 --> 01:43:49,003
to dance in my style.

2255
01:43:49,004 --> 01:43:53,273
I knew it wouldn't be
something the judges prefer.

2256
01:43:53,874 --> 01:43:55,543
("Endless Nightmare" is getting
lower scores than expected.)

2257
01:43:55,544 --> 01:43:59,674
Next is Kim Hyo Joon's score.

2258
01:43:59,943 --> 01:44:01,943
Hyo Joon's score will suddenly go up.

2259
01:44:02,313 --> 01:44:04,282
That means you pulled off the ending.

2260
01:44:04,283 --> 01:44:06,783
- Yes? - Yes, you pulled off the ending.

2261
01:44:07,584 --> 01:44:09,353
(Average score, 87.5)

2262
01:44:09,483 --> 01:44:10,724
(Surprised)

2263
01:44:10,884 --> 01:44:12,453
- With the score of
87.5, - That's very low.

2264
01:44:12,454 --> 01:44:14,393
He tied with Kim Jong Cheol.

2265
01:44:14,794 --> 01:44:16,963
If Hyeok Jung's score is lower,

2266
01:44:16,964 --> 01:44:18,564
do you have to play rock-paper-scissors?

2267
01:44:19,464 --> 01:44:20,794
Rock-paper-scissors?

2268
01:44:21,664 --> 01:44:26,273
Here is Yun Hyeok Jung's score.

2269
01:44:27,273 --> 01:44:31,674
My team's score was lower than expected.

2270
01:44:32,014 --> 01:44:33,214
I was nervous.

2271
01:44:33,813 --> 01:44:35,483
(Average score, 88)

2272
01:44:35,613 --> 01:44:36,782
(Startled)

2273
01:44:36,783 --> 01:44:38,812
It's 88.

2274
01:44:38,813 --> 01:44:40,129
(Yun Hyeok Jung placed 1st by 0.5 points.)

2275
01:44:40,153 --> 01:44:42,084
All your scores are alike.

2276
01:44:42,454 --> 01:44:43,683
Congratulations.

2277
01:44:44,254 --> 01:44:46,322
By 0.5 points,

2278
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:48,693
Yun Hyeok Jung won.

2279
01:44:49,224 --> 01:44:51,732
He had the individuality...

2280
01:44:51,733 --> 01:44:54,932
and technicality.

2281
01:44:54,933 --> 01:44:58,433
I thought he was a very unique dancer.

2282
01:44:58,634 --> 01:45:02,742
I'm happy that it's me.

2283
01:45:02,743 --> 01:45:04,174
It was a shame. I was getting...

2284
01:45:04,403 --> 01:45:07,243
further away from First. It was a bummer.

2285
01:45:07,514 --> 01:45:11,482
Yun Hyeok Jung gets 300
benefit points. Congratulations.

2286
01:45:11,483 --> 01:45:13,553
Stage Choice by Public Mission.

2287
01:45:13,554 --> 01:45:15,384
Only the last performance remains.

2288
01:45:16,224 --> 01:45:19,454
I'll reveal the synopsis
and the casting board.

2289
01:45:20,224 --> 01:45:21,923
("Salvation Log")

2290
01:45:21,924 --> 01:45:22,992
(Directed by Kang Gyeong Ho)

2291
01:45:22,993 --> 01:45:25,763
"Salvation Log" directed...

2292
01:45:25,764 --> 01:45:27,232
by Kang Gyeong Ho in the lead role.

2293
01:45:27,233 --> 01:45:29,133
For the ensemble, Kim Si Won, Park Jin Ho,

2294
01:45:29,134 --> 01:45:32,804
Kim Kyung Won, and Kim Jae Jin were cast.

2295
01:45:32,933 --> 01:45:35,873
"Salvation Log" directed
by Kang Gyeong Ho...

2296
01:45:35,874 --> 01:45:38,413
contains the message of saving himself...

2297
01:45:38,414 --> 01:45:41,374
from the fears.

2298
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,613
The team name is "Salvation Log?" Not bad.

2299
01:45:44,613 --> 01:45:46,653
Will it be a salvation or no?

2300
01:45:47,683 --> 01:45:49,322
Now, "Salvation Log"...

2301
01:45:49,323 --> 01:45:52,294
directed by Kang
Gyeong Ho in the lead role.

2302
01:45:52,724 --> 01:45:54,124
Let's start.

2303
01:45:54,754 --> 01:45:57,493
(Expectant)

2304
01:45:57,993 --> 01:45:59,492
(When selecting the teams)

2305
01:45:59,493 --> 01:46:01,233
(Scanning)

2306
01:46:01,733 --> 01:46:03,509
(A combination of 3 Second
members and 1 Under member)

2307
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:06,032
I want to work with Gyeong Ho again.

2308
01:46:06,033 --> 01:46:07,073
It's a survival.

2309
01:46:07,273 --> 01:46:08,603
I've always thought about it.

2310
01:46:08,943 --> 01:46:10,804
I'll go with my first choice.

2311
01:46:10,943 --> 01:46:12,713
The public will be voting.

2312
01:46:12,714 --> 01:46:13,714
I must survive.

2313
01:46:13,715 --> 01:46:16,442
I can never ignore the ticket power.

2314
01:46:16,443 --> 01:46:18,953
Gyeong Ho's better at ballet.

2315
01:46:18,954 --> 01:46:20,483
I thought it'd be easier.

2316
01:46:20,714 --> 01:46:22,459
It's a bummer that
there's only one ballerino.

2317
01:46:22,483 --> 01:46:24,083
Still, I'm okay with it.

2318
01:46:24,084 --> 01:46:25,423
It's like Avengers.

2319
01:46:25,424 --> 01:46:28,493
I think everyone in my team is outstanding.

2320
01:46:28,724 --> 01:46:29,924
I'm looking forward to it.

2321
01:46:30,664 --> 01:46:32,892
I don't have a lot of
choreography experience.

2322
01:46:32,893 --> 01:46:34,963
I shouldn't stand out alone,

2323
01:46:34,964 --> 01:46:38,032
but we all should stand out together.

2324
01:46:38,033 --> 01:46:41,102
If you share your opinions,

2325
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:43,103
I plan to reflect them.

2326
01:46:43,443 --> 01:46:44,573
Very good.

2327
01:46:44,674 --> 01:46:47,442
If the lead role is
wandering or struggling,

2328
01:46:47,443 --> 01:46:49,483
it's a good idea to rely on his team.

2329
01:46:49,544 --> 01:46:51,213
He's the youngest, yet the boss.

2330
01:46:51,214 --> 01:46:53,213
If we help the young boss,

2331
01:46:53,214 --> 01:46:56,753
it'll increase the overall
quality of our work.

2332
01:46:56,754 --> 01:46:57,954
We were hand in glove.

2333
01:46:58,183 --> 01:47:00,954
The biggest keyword is overwhelming.

2334
01:47:01,094 --> 01:47:02,163
Overwhelming?

2335
01:47:02,164 --> 01:47:03,522
(Got it.)

2336
01:47:03,523 --> 01:47:05,093
(This is what it means to be overwhelming.)

2337
01:47:05,094 --> 01:47:06,433
Good. Not bad.

2338
01:47:06,933 --> 01:47:08,193
- Can you come down? - Yes.

2339
01:47:08,233 --> 01:47:09,993
(The lift is formed
after several attempts.)

2340
01:47:10,264 --> 01:47:11,703
You look like a tree.

2341
01:47:11,704 --> 01:47:13,403
Everyone was enthusiastic.

2342
01:47:13,603 --> 01:47:15,142
We even have a buzzword.

2343
01:47:15,143 --> 01:47:16,602
"Or."

2344
01:47:16,603 --> 01:47:18,402
Or we...

2345
01:47:18,403 --> 01:47:20,142
Or...

2346
01:47:20,143 --> 01:47:22,142
Or why don't we just take it out...

2347
01:47:22,143 --> 01:47:25,182
We shared about 400 ideas.

2348
01:47:25,183 --> 01:47:27,384
Or why don't we come out from here?

2349
01:47:27,414 --> 01:47:29,384
Good. I like it.

2350
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:32,493
I was confused.

2351
01:47:32,653 --> 01:47:34,353
And they were very helpful.

2352
01:47:34,993 --> 01:47:37,623
I want to thank my teammates.

2353
01:47:37,624 --> 01:47:40,834
Thanks to their passion, we'll
put on a good performance.

2354

as a director in "Salvation Log.")

(Directed by Kang Gyeong Ho)

2357
01:47:48,334 --> 01:47:51,673
The key is the soft increase.

2358
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:53,142
A therapeutic performance.

2359
01:47:53,143 --> 01:47:56,384
I want to put on a
performance that saves people.

2360
01:47:56,514 --> 01:47:57,844

Go, Gyeong Ho.

2366

First position.

2367
01:48:09,264 --> 01:48:12,033
Music, start.

2368
01:48:13,563 --> 01:48:14,733
Oh, what is that?

2369
01:48:15,134 --> 01:48:18,204
- What's with the effect?
- Good use of lighting.

2370
01:48:19,273 --> 01:48:20,304
They nailed it.

2371
01:48:20,903 --> 01:48:22,573
He looks like Jesus Christ.

2372
01:48:22,743 --> 01:48:23,902
(Holy Si Won)

someone put his hand out to me.)

was blocking the light from me.)

That's holy.

2378

Beautiful.

He looks like a sculpture.

everyone's attention.)

2391

Well done.

it was from another world.

2444
01:52:38,834 --> 01:52:42,134

2448
01:52:48,674 --> 01:52:52,442
instead of all four people...

2449
01:52:52,443 --> 01:52:55,742
moving in the same direction,

2450
01:52:55,743 --> 01:52:57,313

As a dancer,

2454
01:53:03,554 --> 01:53:06,553
I can say I did my part.

2455
01:53:06,554 --> 01:53:09,593
But as a director, I wasn't capable enough.

2456
01:53:09,594 --> 01:53:12,293

I will reveal the result of
the Seat Class Evaluation.

2462
01:53:26,073 --> 01:53:27,612
- Yes! - How's the Seat Class Evaluation...

2463
01:53:27,613 --> 01:53:29,714
of Kang Gyeong Ho's team?

2464
01:53:30,044 --> 01:53:33,454
I will first reveal the
result of VIP seats.

2465
01:53:33,954 --> 01:53:36,123
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2466
01:53:36,124 --> 01:53:37,282
Let's go, "Salvation Log."

2467
01:53:37,283 --> 01:53:39,193
- It's sold out. - In three minutes, right?

2468
01:53:39,893 --> 01:53:41,852
All 3,000 seats are sold out.

2469
01:53:41,853 --> 01:53:42,992
(Team "Salvation Log"
VIP seats are all sold out.)

2470
01:53:42,993 --> 01:53:44,094
I'm not surprised.

2471
01:53:44,563 --> 01:53:46,363
Did we take 7 or 8 minutes?

2472
01:53:46,464 --> 01:53:48,032
The VIP seats were sold out...

2473
01:53:48,033 --> 01:53:50,464
10 minutes after the show.

2474
01:53:50,603 --> 01:53:51,863
(That's amazing.)

2475
01:53:52,733 --> 01:53:55,543
- All R seats are sold out as well.
- Like it's obvious.

2476
01:53:55,544 --> 01:53:59,344
Are 5,000 S seats sold out too?

2477
01:53:59,674 --> 01:54:01,443
They are sold out too, right?

2478
01:54:01,544 --> 01:54:03,142
Gyeong Ho Bus doesn't set off...

2479
01:54:03,143 --> 01:54:05,384
unless the seats are full.

2480
01:54:06,414 --> 01:54:08,682
(Team "Salvation Log"
S seats are all sold out.)

2481
01:54:08,683 --> 01:54:10,124
It was expected.

2482
01:54:10,224 --> 01:54:11,852
(Shy)

2483
01:54:11,853 --> 01:54:13,192
All S seats are sold out as well.

2484
01:54:13,193 --> 01:54:15,392
The limited seats for
Team "Salvation Log"...

2485
01:54:15,393 --> 01:54:19,363
by Kang Gyeong Ho were all
sold out 22 hours after the show.

2486
01:54:20,294 --> 01:54:22,603
- Twenty-two hours.
- What matters is the A seats.

2487
01:54:22,704 --> 01:54:24,379
- Gyeong Ho, can you show us?
- Gyeong Ho, can you show us?

2488
01:54:24,403 --> 01:54:26,103
Will it be upgraded to an express bus?

2489
01:54:26,704 --> 01:54:30,773
I will now reveal the voting
results for A seats with no limit.

2490
01:54:31,544 --> 01:54:34,473
A total of 17,225 seats.

2491
01:54:34,474 --> 01:54:36,613
A total of 13,273 seats.

2492
01:54:37,183 --> 01:54:40,313
A total of 12,477 seats.

2493
01:54:41,014 --> 01:54:42,482
Because Gyeong Ho was our leader,

2494
01:54:42,483 --> 01:54:44,054
I decided to trust him.

2495
01:54:44,183 --> 01:54:45,653
Let's go for 6,000.

2496
01:54:46,023 --> 01:54:47,253
(A seats, 2,243)

2497
01:54:47,254 --> 01:54:49,562
It's still high.

2498
01:54:49,563 --> 01:54:50,623
Good job.

2499
01:54:50,624 --> 01:54:52,263
(Relieved)

2500
01:54:52,264 --> 01:54:54,163
He couldn't reach 3,000.

2501
01:54:54,164 --> 01:54:56,062
So, the total number of seats...

2502
01:54:56,063 --> 01:54:59,533
for "Salvation Log" by
Kang Gyeong Ho is 14,243.

2503
01:54:59,733 --> 01:55:02,743
"Endless Nightmare"
directed by Choi Ho Jong...

2504
01:55:02,974 --> 01:55:05,072
beat "Salvation Log" by Kang Gyeong Ho...

2505
01:55:05,073 --> 01:55:07,173
by 2,982 votes...

2506
01:55:07,174 --> 01:55:09,643
and placed first in team voting.

2507
01:55:10,584 --> 01:55:13,083
It's a 3,000 vote difference. That's a lot.

2508
01:55:13,084 --> 01:55:16,723
I will reveal the best
dancer in "Salvation Log."

2509
01:55:16,724 --> 01:55:20,823
Who will receive the
benefit in "Salvation Log?"

2510
01:55:20,924 --> 01:55:22,663
That's a lot.

2511
01:55:22,664 --> 01:55:24,093
I think it'll be Kyung Won.

2512
01:55:24,094 --> 01:55:26,964
Si Won looked like Jesus.

2513
01:55:27,464 --> 01:55:28,692
(Here it is.)

2514
01:55:28,693 --> 01:55:30,433
Jin Ho also has a chance.

2515
01:55:30,733 --> 01:55:32,103
(Scared)

2516
01:55:32,533 --> 01:55:34,504
It's a tough competition.

2517
01:55:34,674 --> 01:55:36,402
I will first reveal Kim Si Won's score.

2518
01:55:36,403 --> 01:55:37,403
(Groaning)

2519
01:55:37,404 --> 01:55:39,474
Why me first?

2520
01:55:40,014 --> 01:55:41,242
- Gosh. - Let's see...

2521
01:55:41,243 --> 01:55:42,613
how much energy he collected.

2522
01:55:42,914 --> 01:55:45,014
Si Won did have a lot of scenes.

2523
01:55:48,153 --> 01:55:51,522
(Kim Si Won participated in major scenes.)

2524
01:55:51,523 --> 01:55:52,724
Ninety?

2525
01:55:52,993 --> 01:55:55,193
I think they'll start with 90.

2526
01:55:55,523 --> 01:55:56,523
(Average score, 85.75)

2527
01:55:56,524 --> 01:55:58,323
What?

2528
01:55:58,764 --> 01:56:01,964
Kim Si Won's score is 85.75.

2529
01:56:02,533 --> 01:56:05,134
Why is it so low?

2530
01:56:05,533 --> 01:56:08,004
I thought I didn't make it. I gave up.

2531
01:56:08,573 --> 01:56:11,044
I will reveal Park Jin Ho's score.

2532
01:56:11,643 --> 01:56:14,544
After combining the
benefit and other points,

2533
01:56:14,743 --> 01:56:17,983
I'd get to maintain it or get promoted.

2534
01:56:19,483 --> 01:56:20,483
What?

2535
01:56:20,484 --> 01:56:22,213
(Park Jin Ho's personal score: 82.75)

2536
01:56:22,214 --> 01:56:24,053
It's 82.75.

2537
01:56:24,054 --> 01:56:25,653
- What? - It's Kyung Won.

2538
01:56:26,624 --> 01:56:27,822
Is Kim Kyung Won's score...

2539
01:56:27,823 --> 01:56:31,224
higher than Kim Si Won?

2540
01:56:31,624 --> 01:56:33,294
I think Kyung Won's score is higher.

2541
01:56:33,794 --> 01:56:36,933
With the benefit, I might
have a chance for First.

2542
01:56:37,964 --> 01:56:38,964
(Average score, 83)

2543
01:56:38,965 --> 01:56:40,204
- What? - What?

2544
01:56:41,233 --> 01:56:42,772
(Kim Kyung Won's personal score: 83)

2545
01:56:42,773 --> 01:56:44,804
- It's you, Si Won. - Perhaps Jae Jin...

2546
01:56:45,273 --> 01:56:47,213
- Did Jae Jin get 90? - Did Jae Jin...

2547
01:56:47,214 --> 01:56:48,894
Jae Jin, are you going to turn the tables?

2548
01:56:54,183 --> 01:56:56,254
He was free. Beautiful.

2549
01:56:56,424 --> 01:56:58,454
And he was the only one
who was performing to me.

2550
01:56:58,954 --> 01:57:03,693
Is Kim Jae Jin's score
higher than Kim Si Won?

2551
01:57:03,863 --> 01:57:05,794
Here it is.

2552
01:57:06,634 --> 01:57:08,593
(Average score, 80.75)

2553
01:57:08,594 --> 01:57:10,602
It's 80.75.

2554
01:57:10,603 --> 01:57:11,633
(Kim Jae Jin's personal score: 80.75)

2555
01:57:11,634 --> 01:57:13,303
- Good work. - I can't let Jae Jin go.

2556
01:57:13,304 --> 01:57:14,633
Thank you.

2557
01:57:14,634 --> 01:57:16,203
So, the best dancer
of "Salvation Log" is...

2558
01:57:16,204 --> 01:57:19,674
Kim Si Won with 82.75.

2559
01:57:20,514 --> 01:57:22,783
Of course, I was happy, but...

2560
01:57:23,113 --> 01:57:27,112
if my team marked a higher score,

2561
01:57:27,113 --> 01:57:29,754
I would've been happier.

2562
01:57:30,424 --> 01:57:34,424
Now, I will reveal the best director.

2563
01:57:35,323 --> 01:57:37,464
(All places will be
revealed from 1st to 8th.)

2564
01:57:37,993 --> 01:57:39,094
It's a rank?

2565
01:57:39,294 --> 01:57:41,733
It's a rank. That's crazy.

2566
01:57:41,964 --> 01:57:44,204
The master, coaches,
and the rehearsal director...

2567
01:57:44,634 --> 01:57:47,134
marked you based on your directing skills.

2568
01:57:47,273 --> 01:57:49,503
The dancer with the highest average...

2569
01:57:49,504 --> 01:57:52,813
will win 300 benefit points.

2570
01:57:53,374 --> 01:57:54,543
Please.

2571
01:57:54,544 --> 01:57:55,982
Gyeong Ho, let's go.

2572
01:57:55,983 --> 01:57:57,812
Go, Kim Hye Hyun.

2573
01:57:57,813 --> 01:57:59,753
Go, Ki Moo Gan.

2574
01:57:59,754 --> 01:58:02,523
Still, I'd be in the upper
rank. I did a good job.

2575
01:58:02,754 --> 01:58:03,884
(Expectant)

2576
01:58:04,183 --> 01:58:05,283
Confidence...

2577
01:58:06,054 --> 01:58:08,323
I was rather worried.

2578
01:58:09,023 --> 01:58:12,322
I will reveal eighth place first.

2579
01:58:12,323 --> 01:58:13,333
(Groaning)

2580
01:58:13,334 --> 01:58:14,334
Gosh.

2581
01:58:14,794 --> 01:58:16,274
Why do I have a feeling that it's me?

2582
01:58:16,634 --> 01:58:17,664
Eighth place goes to...

2583
01:58:18,733 --> 01:58:20,402
("Addicted Me" by Kim Kyu Nyeon)

2584
01:58:20,403 --> 01:58:23,603
It's Kim Kyu Nyeon who
directed "Addicted Me."

2585
01:58:24,304 --> 01:58:27,543
(The theme wasn't clear.)

2586
01:58:27,544 --> 01:58:30,282
(The unique characteristics
of Korean dance and ballet...)

2587
01:58:30,283 --> 01:58:31,283
(didn't stand out.)

2588
01:58:31,284 --> 01:58:33,914
(Kim Kyu Nyeon's team
received a regrettable comment.)

2589
01:58:34,214 --> 01:58:35,513
(Sighs)

2590
01:58:35,514 --> 01:58:37,282
To me, Kim Kyu Nyeon's choreography...

2591
01:58:37,283 --> 01:58:39,993
never deserves to place bottom.

2592
01:58:40,153 --> 01:58:42,664
It made me more upset.

2593
01:58:43,424 --> 01:58:45,464
Next is seventh place.

2594
01:58:46,794 --> 01:58:50,233
It's Jung Sung Wook who directed
"Awakening Inside the Nightmare."

2595
01:58:50,334 --> 01:58:54,072
I felt that you did a very excellent job.

2596
01:58:54,073 --> 01:58:57,442
However, I wish that you were able to...

2597
01:58:57,443 --> 01:59:02,813
take more contemporary
ideas to collaborate with.

2598
01:59:03,113 --> 01:59:04,143
Lucky seven.

2599
01:59:05,243 --> 01:59:06,812
At least, I avoided placing bottom.

2600
01:59:06,813 --> 01:59:09,454
Next is sixth place.

2601
01:59:10,224 --> 01:59:12,924
Not yet.

2602
01:59:13,294 --> 01:59:14,523
Maybe Yu Chan?

2603
01:59:14,653 --> 01:59:16,094
My heart is pounding so fast.

2604
01:59:16,264 --> 01:59:17,363
Sixth place goes to...

2605
01:59:17,964 --> 01:59:19,023
- What? - What?

2606
01:59:20,233 --> 01:59:21,533
What?

2607
01:59:21,693 --> 01:59:23,763
(Who is the unexpected 6th place?)

2608
01:59:23,764 --> 01:59:24,764
(6th place goes to Kang Gyeong Ho.)

2609
01:59:24,764 --> 01:59:25,764
- What? - Why?

2610
01:59:25,765 --> 01:59:27,204
I thought he'd make it in top four.

2611
01:59:27,804 --> 01:59:31,243
He placed second in
the online public voting,

2612
01:59:31,544 --> 01:59:33,713
but in the Role
Evaluation for best director,

2613
01:59:33,714 --> 01:59:36,113
unfortunately, you placed sixth.

2614
01:59:36,613 --> 01:59:39,353
(I thought it was beautiful.)

2615
01:59:40,884 --> 01:59:46,323
(Their flat direction and
movement were rather a shame.)

2616
01:59:46,554 --> 01:59:48,924
I wonder if it was that bad.

2617
01:59:48,954 --> 01:59:51,263
It's a shame.

2618
01:59:51,264 --> 01:59:52,264
(Regrettable)

2619
01:59:52,265 --> 01:59:54,693
I will reveal fifth place next.

2620
01:59:55,164 --> 01:59:57,163
Fifth place selected by the master,

2621
01:59:57,164 --> 01:59:59,403
coaches, and the rehearsal director is...

2622
02:00:00,403 --> 02:00:01,973
(Ki Moo Gan and Kim Yu Chan)

2623
02:00:01,974 --> 02:00:03,273
Two fourth places.

2624
02:00:03,804 --> 02:00:05,073
We have a tie.

2625
02:00:05,844 --> 02:00:07,613
(I had to held back my tears.)

2626
02:00:08,773 --> 02:00:09,782
(However)

2627
02:00:09,783 --> 02:00:12,142
(I could only see Kim Yu Chan.)

2628
02:00:12,143 --> 02:00:13,613
(That was a bummer.)

2629
02:00:14,084 --> 02:00:15,214
That's Ki Moo Gan for you.

2630
02:00:15,683 --> 02:00:19,053
You could've improved...

2631
02:00:19,054 --> 02:00:22,224
the duet and teamwork.

2632
02:00:22,294 --> 02:00:23,423
I knew it.

2633
02:00:23,424 --> 02:00:25,223
Yes, well done.

2634
02:00:25,224 --> 02:00:28,264
To face the truth, it's such a bummer.

2635
02:00:28,594 --> 02:00:29,863
Not bad, Yu Chan.

2636
02:00:30,504 --> 02:00:32,403
- Fourth place. - Not bad.

2637
02:00:32,733 --> 02:00:35,003
I was expecting 3rd or 4th place.

2638
02:00:35,004 --> 02:00:36,773
I'm happy with it.

2639
02:00:37,103 --> 02:00:40,813
We have Kim Hye Hyun, Choi
Ho Jong, and Kim Hyun Ho left.

2640
02:00:41,174 --> 02:00:45,783
Among them, only one of
them can get 300 benefit points.

2641
02:00:46,613 --> 02:00:47,982
It'll be Hyun Ho.

2642
02:00:47,983 --> 02:00:49,553
- It'll be him. - Please.

2643
02:00:49,554 --> 02:00:52,153
Because I put a lot of
effort, I feel confident.

2644
02:00:52,523 --> 02:00:55,124
- I will reveal the result.
- Hye Hyun must win.

2645
02:00:55,294 --> 02:00:58,123
I was nervous. Still, it's worth trying.

2646
02:00:58,124 --> 02:00:59,562
I think I did a good job.

2647
02:00:59,563 --> 02:01:02,533
However, it might be hard to place first.

2648
02:01:02,834 --> 02:01:03,863
Third place goes to...

2649
02:01:04,804 --> 02:01:08,033
Choi Ho Jong who directed
"Endless Nightmare."

2650
02:01:08,773 --> 02:01:09,804
It was shocking.

2651
02:01:10,243 --> 02:01:12,913
I never imagined Ho Jong...

2652
02:01:12,914 --> 02:01:14,742
to place third.

2653
02:01:14,743 --> 02:01:16,913
I was shocked.

2654
02:01:16,914 --> 02:01:18,643
I was worried about Ho Jong.

2655
02:01:19,014 --> 02:01:22,053
(It was very overwhelming from the start.)

2656
02:01:22,054 --> 02:01:23,554
(It was unforgettable.)

2657
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:26,693
(It was a bummer because
only Choi Ho Jong stood out.)

2658
02:01:27,624 --> 02:01:28,692
I have no regrets.

2659
02:01:28,693 --> 02:01:31,594
I'm okay with what I got.

2660
02:01:32,294 --> 02:01:33,732
What's happening?

2661
02:01:33,733 --> 02:01:35,164
Dash placed 1st and 2nd.

2662
02:01:35,334 --> 02:01:39,103
I only have 1st and 2nd places left.

2663
02:01:39,603 --> 02:01:41,033
Here is the result.

2664
02:01:41,504 --> 02:01:43,474
Between Kim Hye Hyun and Kim Hyun Ho,

2665
02:01:43,743 --> 02:01:45,674
who will become the best director?

2666
02:01:45,943 --> 02:01:48,143
First place. I feel confident.

2667
02:01:48,273 --> 02:01:50,113
I will be the one to take the benefit.

2668
02:01:50,783 --> 02:01:51,982
(Team "Endless Dash Towards
Freedom" directed by Kim Hye Hyun...)

2669
02:01:51,983 --> 02:01:53,152
(presented surprising
expression and flashy techniques.)

2670
02:01:53,153 --> 02:01:55,152
(You're good at directing, )

2671
02:01:55,153 --> 02:01:57,754
(and you're also a capable choreographer.)

2672
02:01:58,384 --> 02:02:00,123
(Team "Dash of Death"
directed by Kim Hyun Ho...)

2673
02:02:00,124 --> 02:02:02,022
(presented amazing synchronization.)

2674
02:02:02,023 --> 02:02:06,493
(Each character really stood out.)

2675
02:02:07,033 --> 02:02:08,963
(Between the two dancers, )

2676
02:02:08,964 --> 02:02:10,933
(who will become the best director?)

2677
02:02:11,634 --> 02:02:13,673
(Best Director 1st place: Kim Hye Hyun)

2678
02:02:13,674 --> 02:02:14,733
- Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my.

2679
02:02:15,004 --> 02:02:16,143
(Acknowledging)

2680
02:02:16,844 --> 02:02:18,943
(Disappointed, happy)

2681
02:02:19,613 --> 02:02:21,544
Kim Hye Hyun became the Best Director...

2682
02:02:21,943 --> 02:02:23,242
by taking first place.

2683
02:02:23,243 --> 02:02:24,584
- Congratulations. - Well done.

2684
02:02:24,613 --> 02:02:26,153
- It was the best. - Congratulations.

2685
02:02:26,414 --> 02:02:29,283
It's quite disappointing,
but I'm satisfied...

2686
02:02:29,554 --> 02:02:32,283
with taking second place.

2687
02:02:32,523 --> 02:02:35,794
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun who
became the Best Director...

2688
02:02:36,124 --> 02:02:38,362
will receive 300 benefit points.

2689
02:02:38,363 --> 02:02:39,733
(Role benefit: 300 points)

2690
02:02:40,164 --> 02:02:41,432
I was very happy.

2691
02:02:41,433 --> 02:02:44,804
The members of the team joined forces...

2692
02:02:45,204 --> 02:02:46,304
to finish it well.

2693
02:02:46,573 --> 02:02:50,603
I think all my teammates
are the Best Directors.

2694
02:02:51,304 --> 02:02:53,013
I'll now reveal the current rankings...

2695
02:02:53,014 --> 02:02:54,674
based on the accumulated points so far.

2696
02:02:54,914 --> 02:02:56,043
(Nervous)

2697
02:02:56,044 --> 02:02:57,524
- It's cruel. - The current rankings?

2698
02:02:58,014 --> 02:02:59,413
(Current rankings)

2699
02:02:59,414 --> 02:03:00,414
- It startled me. - What?

2700
02:03:00,554 --> 02:03:02,554
(Current rankings)

2701
02:03:02,823 --> 02:03:04,084
Why am I in first place?

2702
02:03:04,384 --> 02:03:06,493
- Oh, my.
- The benefits have a huge impact.

2703
02:03:06,993 --> 02:03:08,523
Dancer Kim Si Won is ranked second.

2704
02:03:08,893 --> 02:03:12,193
Dancer Jang June Hyuk is in the top three.

2705
02:03:12,693 --> 02:03:14,692
I think this will be my 1st
and last time to be in 1st place.

2706
02:03:14,693 --> 02:03:16,303
Hyeok Jung, it'll be my last
time to be in second place.

2707
02:03:16,304 --> 02:03:17,432
- Please take a picture of me. - Sure.

2708
02:03:17,433 --> 02:03:18,680
(He takes a picture of the honorable
moment that will never come back.)

2709
02:03:18,704 --> 02:03:19,733
(Envious)

2710
02:03:20,033 --> 02:03:22,009
I'm ranked higher than
Ho Jong for the first time.

2711
02:03:22,033 --> 02:03:23,674
The current rankings don't matter.

2712
02:03:23,943 --> 02:03:26,174
I'll move back from Second Class.

2713
02:03:26,714 --> 02:03:29,584
All the members of our team
are in 14 place except Si Won.

2714
02:03:29,683 --> 02:03:30,713
You're right.

2715
02:03:30,714 --> 02:03:33,983
Some of the dancers in
Under Class received benefits.

2716
02:03:34,084 --> 02:03:37,153
I sensed danger. I
thought I was in trouble.

2717
02:03:37,924 --> 02:03:40,564
It'll be very dangerous for me if
my video doesn't get many likes.

2718
02:03:40,794 --> 02:03:42,294
I might be eliminated.

2719
02:03:42,454 --> 02:03:45,823
I've been always walking on the thin ice.

2720
02:03:46,094 --> 02:03:47,094
I was very nervous.

2721
02:03:47,193 --> 02:03:49,862
The final Class Structure
that will be changed...

2722
02:03:49,863 --> 02:03:52,704
by the result of the Stage
Choice by Public Mission.

2723
02:03:52,974 --> 02:03:55,214
- "Class Structure?"
- Will there be fewer people again?

2724
02:03:55,603 --> 02:03:56,674
How many will be left?

2725
02:03:57,004 --> 02:03:58,004
(6 people in 1st Class,
14 people in 2nd Class)

2726
02:03:58,005 --> 02:04:00,844
- Each class will lose 1 dancer.
- Each class will lose 1 dancer.

2727
02:04:01,073 --> 02:04:02,983
There's 1 less spot available in 1st Class.

2728
02:04:03,084 --> 02:04:04,983
It might be dangerous.

2729
02:04:05,084 --> 02:04:07,513
My video didn't get many
views, which made me nervous.

2730
02:04:07,514 --> 02:04:09,354
They didn't reveal any
number for Under Class.

2731
02:04:10,023 --> 02:04:13,153
They didn't reveal any
number for Under Class.

2732
02:04:13,454 --> 02:04:14,869
Does it mean no one in
Under Class will be left?

2733
02:04:14,893 --> 02:04:16,464
Out of 40 dancers,

2734
02:04:17,094 --> 02:04:19,193
only 20 dancers will make it to the final.

2735
02:04:19,964 --> 02:04:22,933
- All of them will be eliminated.
- Unless they become Second Class.

2736
02:04:23,204 --> 02:04:25,733
My goodness. This is stressing me out.

2737
02:04:26,134 --> 02:04:27,633
"Will I be in the top 20..."

2738
02:04:27,634 --> 02:04:30,443
"and make it to the final?"
That's the first thought I had.

2739
02:04:30,544 --> 02:04:33,714
Both Tae Seok and I are ranked 21st.

2740
02:04:33,974 --> 02:04:37,714
The only way to survive
is stay in Second Class.

2741
02:04:37,914 --> 02:04:40,353
It became my biggest goal.

2742
02:04:40,653 --> 02:04:43,724
Lastly, the individual
points will be revealed.

2743
02:04:44,424 --> 02:04:46,653
Individual points were
calculated by adding up...

2744
02:04:46,954 --> 02:04:48,969
the view counts and likes
of each dancer's solo videos,

2745
02:04:48,993 --> 02:04:51,294
then applying the weighting
factor based on the class.

2746
02:04:51,823 --> 02:04:54,192
The dancer with the highest score...

2747
02:04:54,193 --> 02:04:55,964
received a perfect score of 1,000 points,

2748
02:04:56,334 --> 02:04:58,362
and each subsequent
dancer received 20 points less.

2749
02:04:58,363 --> 02:04:59,780
We received differential points again?

2750
02:04:59,804 --> 02:05:02,773
It means even if the view count
of their videos is much higher,

2751
02:05:02,974 --> 02:05:05,704
the score difference with other
dancers won't be significant.

2752
02:05:06,044 --> 02:05:08,124
Receiving 300 benefit
points makes a big difference.

2753
02:05:08,743 --> 02:05:11,414
I will now reveal the result
of the Class Movement.

2754
02:05:11,613 --> 02:05:14,914
Jang June Hyuk in Second Class,
Kim Seung Wook in Under Class,

2755
02:05:15,254 --> 02:05:18,182
Park Min Woo, Kang Yun Gu, and Sung Hun Mo.

2756
02:05:18,183 --> 02:05:20,094
Please go to the Class Announcement Zone.

2757
02:05:20,224 --> 02:05:21,294
(Right now?)

2758
02:05:21,653 --> 02:05:23,492
- What? - Oh, my.

2759
02:05:23,493 --> 02:05:24,593
- Right now? - What?

2760
02:05:24,594 --> 02:05:27,063
- Hold on. - They'll announce it here?

2761
02:05:28,264 --> 02:05:30,603
- It goes like this?
- How many people will there be?

2762
02:05:30,863 --> 02:05:32,563
- What's going on? - It's so scary.

2763
02:05:33,704 --> 02:05:36,174
What's going on? Will they
just show it on the screen?

2764
02:05:36,474 --> 02:05:38,804
(They checked the result
in a separate place before.)

2765
02:05:39,044 --> 02:05:42,844
(But the 3rd Class Movement
Ceremony will be conducted differently.)

2766
02:05:43,183 --> 02:05:45,414
I don't think I can watch
it while staying seated.

2767
02:05:46,113 --> 02:05:49,384
It was quite cruel that it
was revealed on the spot.

2768
02:05:49,853 --> 02:05:52,653
I was overwhelmed by the atmosphere.

2769
02:05:53,153 --> 02:05:54,822
I will now announce the
result of the class evaluation...

2770
02:05:54,823 --> 02:05:57,023
for the five dancers.

2771
02:05:57,264 --> 02:05:59,732
Dancer Jang June Hyuk in Second Class...

2772
02:05:59,733 --> 02:06:02,094
might be demoted to
Under Class and eliminated.

2773
02:06:02,294 --> 02:06:05,403
Kim Seung Wook, Park Min Woo,
Kang Yun Gu, and Sung Hun Mo...

2774
02:06:05,504 --> 02:06:07,834
might be promoted from
Under Class to Second Class...

2775
02:06:07,933 --> 02:06:09,474
and make it to the final.

2776
02:06:09,903 --> 02:06:12,243
First, I will announce
the eliminated dancer.

2777
02:06:12,403 --> 02:06:13,514
(Sighing)

2778
02:06:13,773 --> 02:06:17,084
The eliminated dancers whose
journey in Stage Fighter will end are...

2779
02:06:18,214 --> 02:06:19,683
(I can't watch.)

2780
02:06:19,954 --> 02:06:20,954
This is going too fast.

2781
02:06:21,683 --> 02:06:22,954
This is so cruel.

2782
02:06:23,424 --> 02:06:25,504
The eliminated dancers
whose journey will end are...

2783
02:06:25,584 --> 02:06:26,593
(Kang Yun Gu: From
Under to Under, Eliminated)

2784
02:06:26,594 --> 02:06:28,353
Dancer Kang Yun Gu.

2785
02:06:29,254 --> 02:06:30,669
(Park Min Woo: From
Under to Under, Eliminated)

2786
02:06:30,693 --> 02:06:31,794
Dancer Park Min Woo.

2787
02:06:32,764 --> 02:06:34,604
(Sung Hun Mo: From
Under to Under, Eliminated)

2788
02:06:34,834 --> 02:06:36,134
Dancer Sung Hun Mo.

2789
02:06:37,504 --> 02:06:39,874
- You worked hard. - You worked hard.

2790
02:06:40,304 --> 02:06:42,674
- It's your turn. - You worked hard.

2791
02:06:43,174 --> 02:06:45,143
Only two dancers are left now.

2792
02:06:45,443 --> 02:06:46,773
Jang June Hyuk in Second Class...

2793
02:06:47,073 --> 02:06:49,272
and Kim Seung Wook in Under Class.

2794
02:06:49,273 --> 02:06:51,544
Among the 2 dancers, only 1...

2795
02:06:51,714 --> 02:06:52,714
(Only one?)

2796
02:06:52,954 --> 02:06:54,014
What? Only one?

2797
02:06:54,254 --> 02:06:55,654
But both of them received benefits.

2798
02:06:55,983 --> 02:06:57,323
One out of two?

2799
02:06:57,983 --> 02:06:59,353
It's crazy.

2800
02:07:00,224 --> 02:07:01,294
Seung Wook will make it.

2801
02:07:01,924 --> 02:07:03,124
I'll be June Hyuk. Right?

2802
02:07:03,323 --> 02:07:06,993
Thinking about the view
count, I wasn't at ease.

2803
02:07:07,393 --> 02:07:09,834
I received the individual benefit.

2804
02:07:10,103 --> 02:07:12,233
So I'm secretly anticipating.

2805
02:07:12,634 --> 02:07:15,504
The dancer who will
make it to the final is...

2806
02:07:16,073 --> 02:07:17,073
(Jang June Hyuk: From 2nd to 2nd, Finalist)

2807
02:07:17,074 --> 02:07:18,403
Dancer Jang June Hyuk.

2808
02:07:18,743 --> 02:07:22,013
(Dancer Jang June Hyuk
has made it to the final.)

2809
02:07:22,014 --> 02:07:24,983
Dancer Jang June Hyuk
will advance to the final.

2810
02:07:25,113 --> 02:07:26,782
(Kim Seung Wook: From
Under to Under, Eliminated)

2811
02:07:26,783 --> 02:07:29,483
Dancer Kim Seung Wook...

2812
02:07:29,584 --> 02:07:31,824
has been eliminated from
Stage Fighter. You worked hard.

2813
02:07:32,624 --> 02:07:34,192
- You worked hard. - You worked hard.

2814
02:07:34,193 --> 02:07:35,393
(You worked hard, Seung Wook!)

2815
02:07:35,724 --> 02:07:36,823
You can grow hair now.

2816
02:07:37,693 --> 02:07:38,723
You did a good job.

2817
02:07:38,724 --> 02:07:41,732
(Sharing a tight hug with Hyun
Ho, the leader of "Mad Max.")

2818
02:07:41,733 --> 02:07:42,764
You worked hard.

2819
02:07:43,063 --> 02:07:45,503
I will continue to announce the
result of the Class Movement.

2820
02:07:45,704 --> 02:07:48,773
Kim Tae Seok and Jung
Sung Wook in Second Class.

2821
02:07:49,273 --> 02:07:51,203
An Si On, Moon Jun On,

2822
02:07:51,204 --> 02:07:53,874
and Kim Min Suk in Under
Class. Please come forward.

2823
02:07:54,313 --> 02:07:55,393
- You'll stay. - All right.

2824
02:07:56,214 --> 02:07:59,134
- All the ballet dancers are called.
- This is a slaughterhouse for them.

2825
02:07:59,884 --> 02:08:02,383
- There's no way you're eliminated.
- You don't know.

2826
02:08:02,384 --> 02:08:04,100
(The 3rd Class Movement
Ceremony is unpredictable.)

2827
02:08:04,124 --> 02:08:06,369
First, I will announce the
result of the Class Movement...

2828
02:08:06,393 --> 02:08:09,554
for Dancer An Si On.

2829
02:08:11,863 --> 02:08:13,093
(An Si On: From Under to Under, Eliminated)

2830
02:08:13,094 --> 02:08:16,504
Dancer An Si On in Under
Class has been eliminated...

2831
02:08:16,603 --> 02:08:19,263
with a total score of 1,060
points. You worked hard.

2832
02:08:19,264 --> 02:08:21,304
(Dancer An Si On has been eliminated.)

2833
02:08:22,433 --> 02:08:23,504
You worked hard.

2834
02:08:26,613 --> 02:08:29,243
Next, I will announce the
result of the Class Movement...

2835
02:08:29,344 --> 02:08:31,283
for Dancer Moon Jun On.

2836
02:08:32,283 --> 02:08:33,652
(Moon Jun On: From
Under to Under, Eliminated)

2837
02:08:33,653 --> 02:08:35,312
Dancer Moon Jun On in Under Class...

2838
02:08:35,313 --> 02:08:38,084
has been eliminated with a
total score of 1,100 points.

2839
02:08:38,454 --> 02:08:41,992
(Dancer Moon Jun On has been eliminated.)

2840
02:08:41,993 --> 02:08:43,023
You worked hard.

2841
02:08:44,164 --> 02:08:47,764
(From An Si On to Moon Jun On, )

2842
02:08:47,933 --> 02:08:49,492
(the dancers in "Awakening Inside
the Nightmare" were eliminated.)

2843
02:08:49,493 --> 02:08:53,134
If I had directed it better to
increase the team benefit,

2844
02:08:53,533 --> 02:08:56,602
the result might've been changed.

2845
02:08:56,603 --> 02:08:58,344
So I was very sorry to my teammates.

2846
02:08:59,004 --> 02:09:00,514
It might be dangerous for me as well.

2847
02:09:01,544 --> 02:09:03,304
I've been ranked lower
and lower these days.

2848
02:09:03,584 --> 02:09:06,584
So I thought the benefit
was very important.

2849
02:09:06,853 --> 02:09:07,914
I was nervous.

2850
02:09:08,683 --> 02:09:09,753
(Sighing)

2851
02:09:09,754 --> 02:09:10,754
Should I pack my bags?

2852
02:09:11,454 --> 02:09:12,753
I was extremely nervous.

2853
02:09:12,754 --> 02:09:13,923
(The two dancers without
benefits are also nervous.)

2854
02:09:13,924 --> 02:09:15,392
Next, I will announce the
dancer in Second Class...

2855
02:09:15,393 --> 02:09:17,823
who will make it to the final.

2856
02:09:18,363 --> 02:09:20,294
- Will there be two? - I really don't know.

2857
02:09:20,563 --> 02:09:21,692
(It's hard to predict.)

2858
02:09:21,693 --> 02:09:23,062
The dancer who will
make it to the final is...

2859
02:09:23,063 --> 02:09:24,543
(Which one will become the finalist?)

2860
02:09:24,933 --> 02:09:26,004
Dancer Jung Sung Wook.

2861
02:09:26,834 --> 02:09:30,443
(Jung Sung Wook: From 2nd to second)

2862
02:09:30,874 --> 02:09:34,213
Dancer Jung Sung Wook
has made it to the final...

2863
02:09:34,214 --> 02:09:37,844
with a total score of 1,990 points,
including 1,1170 individual points.

2864
02:09:37,943 --> 02:09:39,014
Congratulations.

2865
02:09:39,983 --> 02:09:42,383
- Only 1 of them made it? - Is it just 1?

2866
02:09:42,384 --> 02:09:43,584
(No way)

2867
02:09:44,483 --> 02:09:45,523
Let's go home.

2868
02:09:46,084 --> 02:09:48,493
One of the two dancers...

2869
02:09:49,393 --> 02:09:50,963
- will become the finalist.
- Oh, there's more.

2870
02:09:50,964 --> 02:09:53,264
(They're sighing everywhere.)

2871
02:09:53,433 --> 02:09:55,193
I don't think Tae Seok will be eliminated.

2872
02:09:55,693 --> 02:09:56,803
The dancer who will be eliminated is...

2873
02:09:56,804 --> 02:09:57,804
(Between Tae Seok and Min
Suk, which one will be eliminated?)

2874
02:09:57,805 --> 02:09:59,432
Dancer Kim Min Suk.

2875
02:09:59,433 --> 02:10:00,674
It's Min Suk.

2876
02:10:01,533 --> 02:10:02,603
You worked hard.

2877
02:10:05,273 --> 02:10:08,073
He has been eliminated
as he couldn't be promoted...

2878
02:10:08,174 --> 02:10:10,854
with a total score of 1,170 points
including the individual points.

2879
02:10:10,914 --> 02:10:12,682
Dancer Kim Tae Seok in Second Class...

2880
02:10:12,683 --> 02:10:15,652
has made it to the final...

2881
02:10:15,653 --> 02:10:17,482
with 884 individual
points. Congratulations.

2882
02:10:17,483 --> 02:10:18,924
(Kim Tae Seok: From 2nd to 2nd)

2883
02:10:19,124 --> 02:10:21,823
I kind of expected the result.

2884
02:10:21,924 --> 02:10:23,264
I wasn't entirely unprepared.

2885
02:10:23,493 --> 02:10:26,493
But on the other hand, I was
like, "So I can't do this anymore?"

2886
02:10:26,834 --> 02:10:28,334
It didn't feel real.

2887
02:10:30,033 --> 02:10:31,863
Let me continue.

2888
02:10:31,964 --> 02:10:34,533
Kim Yu Chan and Kim
Jong Cheol in First Class,

2889
02:10:34,874 --> 02:10:37,504
Kim Kyung Won and Park
Jin Ho in Second Class,

2890
02:10:37,844 --> 02:10:41,073
and Bang Seong Hyun in Under
Class, please come forward.

2891
02:10:41,374 --> 02:10:43,943
- Wait. They are... - He called them?

2892
02:10:44,643 --> 02:10:46,044
I think all of them will make it.

2893
02:10:46,344 --> 02:10:48,682
The members are really good.

2894
02:10:48,683 --> 02:10:50,653
Yes. Many of them won't be eliminated.

2895
02:10:51,023 --> 02:10:52,884
I think Yu Chan will stay in First Class.

2896
02:10:53,323 --> 02:10:56,030
Kyung Won is in second place as
he is on the same team as Gyeong Ho.

2897
02:10:56,054 --> 02:10:58,393
There's no way Jin Ho will be eliminated.

2898
02:10:58,624 --> 02:11:00,094
I can't make predictions.

2899
02:11:00,433 --> 02:11:02,464
I will announce the result
of the Class Movement.

2900
02:11:03,134 --> 02:11:06,533
Between Dancer Kim Yu Chan
and Dancer Kim Jong Cheol...

2901
02:11:06,704 --> 02:11:08,403
only one of them...

2902
02:11:08,903 --> 02:11:09,983
will stay in First Class...

2903
02:11:10,204 --> 02:11:12,674
- What? - One of them will be demoted.

2904
02:11:13,143 --> 02:11:15,173
Both of us...

2905
02:11:15,174 --> 02:11:17,283
didn't receive benefits.

2906
02:11:17,384 --> 02:11:19,084
Only 1 of us will stay in 1st Class?

2907
02:11:19,544 --> 02:11:21,914
How can I beat Yu Chan?

2908
02:11:22,384 --> 02:11:24,083
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol participated...

2909
02:11:24,084 --> 02:11:25,754
in "Endless Nightmare" as an ensemble...

2910
02:11:25,884 --> 02:11:27,653
and received 1,000 points for team benefit.

2911
02:11:28,193 --> 02:11:30,763
Dancer Kim Yu Chan stayed in First Class...

2912
02:11:30,764 --> 02:11:33,433
as he was ranked 2nd in the
2nd Class Movement Ceremony.

2913
02:11:33,764 --> 02:11:36,433
The dancer who will be
demoted to Second Class...

2914
02:11:37,063 --> 02:11:38,433
is Dancer Kim Jong Cheol.

2915
02:11:41,533 --> 02:11:44,403
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol was demoted
from First Class to Under Class...

2916
02:11:44,504 --> 02:11:47,044
with a total score of 2,230 points.

2917
02:11:47,143 --> 02:11:49,844
I'm still proud of myself for
competing against the older guys.

2918
02:11:50,143 --> 02:11:53,143
Dancer Kim Yu Chan
will stay in First Class...

2919
02:11:53,254 --> 02:11:54,714
with a total score of 2,260 points.

2920
02:11:55,183 --> 02:11:56,259
The difference is 30 points?

2921
02:11:56,283 --> 02:11:58,783
It's not a big difference.

2922
02:11:59,323 --> 02:12:00,424
It's so scary.

2923
02:12:01,954 --> 02:12:05,223
I will now announce the
result for the Class Movement...

2924
02:12:05,224 --> 02:12:07,304
for Kim Kyung Won, Park
Jin Ho, and Bang Seong Hyun.

2925
02:12:07,363 --> 02:12:10,032
I will reveal the total score Dancer
Bang Seong Hyun received...

2926
02:12:10,033 --> 02:12:11,103
in the class evaluation.

2927
02:12:11,304 --> 02:12:14,174
He might be promoted from Second Class.

2928
02:12:14,834 --> 02:12:16,433
Seong Hyun also got a lot of views.

2929
02:12:16,943 --> 02:12:19,402
(Bang Seong Hyun's
elimination is confirmed.)

2930
02:12:19,403 --> 02:12:21,112
Dancer Bang Seong Hyun in Under is...

2931
02:12:21,113 --> 02:12:22,544
eliminated now.

2932
02:12:23,143 --> 02:12:25,223
All of the dancers in Under
may be eliminated today.

2933
02:12:25,683 --> 02:12:27,754
(Sighing of Under Class dancers)

2934
02:12:27,983 --> 02:12:29,982
Now we have two remaining dancers.

2935
02:12:29,983 --> 02:12:33,053
Kim Kyung Won and Park Jin Ho in Second.

2936
02:12:33,054 --> 02:12:34,893
Their result is revealed now.

2937
02:12:35,294 --> 02:12:36,924
They have the same team benefit.

2938
02:12:37,424 --> 02:12:38,964
- Right. - They are on the same team!

2939
02:12:39,523 --> 02:12:41,493
First, I thought we both might survive,

2940
02:12:41,964 --> 02:12:44,164
as we had almost the same views.

2941
02:12:44,204 --> 02:12:46,233
The dancer, who goes to the final,

2942
02:12:46,704 --> 02:12:48,033
is only one.

2943
02:12:48,433 --> 02:12:49,993
Darn, one of them should be eliminated?

2944
02:12:50,273 --> 02:12:51,273
(Bitter smiling)

2945
02:12:52,443 --> 02:12:55,743
I was completely shocked.
That's not what I've guessed.

2946
02:12:55,844 --> 02:12:57,812
I was nervous, as there was no clue...

2947
02:12:57,813 --> 02:12:59,544
about individual performance scores.

2948
02:12:59,584 --> 02:13:00,914
No one should be eliminated!

2949
02:13:01,153 --> 02:13:02,914
It was pretty shocking.

2950
02:13:03,384 --> 02:13:05,183
I realized...

2951
02:13:05,924 --> 02:13:07,604
there's no safety line for Second as well.

2952
02:13:08,754 --> 02:13:10,424
Jin Ho just became Second!

2953
02:13:10,764 --> 02:13:12,392
In the last Second Class Movement Ceremony,

2954
02:13:12,393 --> 02:13:14,192
Under Park Jin Ho was promoted,

2955
02:13:14,193 --> 02:13:17,403
proving his great ability.

2956
02:13:17,664 --> 02:13:19,334
Kyung Won got a lot of positive feedback.

2957
02:13:19,533 --> 02:13:21,533
Kyung Won was amazing on the stage.

2958
02:13:21,704 --> 02:13:24,072
Dancer Kim Kyung Won has secured...

2959
02:13:24,073 --> 02:13:26,813
his seat in the Class Battle.

2960
02:13:27,813 --> 02:13:29,573
No one should be eliminated!

2961
02:13:30,414 --> 02:13:31,584
How this will end?

2962
02:13:32,183 --> 02:13:34,013
As my teammates and I know very well...

2963
02:13:34,014 --> 02:13:36,054
how hard I tried to prove myself,

2964
02:13:36,214 --> 02:13:37,983
I thought I was the right one to step up.

2965
02:13:38,323 --> 02:13:39,884
If there's no unexpected event,

2966
02:13:40,323 --> 02:13:42,852
Jin Ho should go home now.

2967
02:13:42,853 --> 02:13:44,724
That's what I was thinking.

2968
02:13:44,924 --> 02:13:46,733
The dancer, who is eliminated, is...

2969
02:13:50,863 --> 02:13:53,674
Dancer Park Jin Ho.

2970
02:13:56,204 --> 02:13:57,704
(Shocked)

2971
02:13:58,874 --> 02:13:59,974
He's eliminated?

2972
02:14:00,914 --> 02:14:02,572
(No way!)

2973
02:14:02,573 --> 02:14:04,612
(Dancer Park Jin Ho's
elimination is confirmed.)

2974
02:14:04,613 --> 02:14:05,844
His score is 1,698, though.

2975
02:14:06,113 --> 02:14:08,113
I couldn't believe what happened there.

2976
02:14:08,313 --> 02:14:10,183
"Is it real?" That's how I felt.

2977
02:14:10,653 --> 02:14:13,124
I was thinking of
challenging for the final.

2978
02:14:13,454 --> 02:14:16,094
There were other
performances I wanted to show.

2979
02:14:16,353 --> 02:14:18,393
That's why I felt more disappointed.

2980
02:14:18,594 --> 02:14:19,764
How Jin Ho...

2981
02:14:20,933 --> 02:14:22,392
I never expected this.

2982
02:14:22,393 --> 02:14:23,964
(Kim Kyung Won remains in Second.)

2983
02:14:24,004 --> 02:14:26,633
As soon as he wrote a history of Under,

2984
02:14:26,634 --> 02:14:28,554
- That's what I mean!
- Then what's all of this?

2985
02:14:29,603 --> 02:14:31,103
I never knew this.

2986
02:14:32,174 --> 02:14:35,013
We continue to reveal the results.

2987
02:14:35,014 --> 02:14:37,543
Second Yun Hyeok Jung, Kim Si Won,

2988
02:14:37,544 --> 02:14:40,014
Kim Hyo Joon, and Ryu Tae Young.

2989
02:14:40,153 --> 02:14:42,754
Under Shin Min Kwon.
Please all come out here.

2990
02:14:43,014 --> 02:14:44,282
Gosh.

2991
02:14:44,283 --> 02:14:45,603
All of them are going to survive?

2992
02:14:46,384 --> 02:14:48,294
Oh, so there are many in Second.

2993
02:14:48,393 --> 02:14:50,600
All of them may be eliminated
except Hyeok Jung and Hyo Joon.

2994
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,192
Among all the five dancers,

2995
02:14:52,193 --> 02:14:54,334
we announce the one who is promoted.

2996
02:14:54,764 --> 02:14:56,733
I guess Min Kwon may be promoted.

2997
02:14:56,903 --> 02:14:59,203
I had a benefit score, so
I was feeling something.

2998
02:14:59,204 --> 02:15:00,272
"It's for me!"

2999
02:15:00,273 --> 02:15:01,304
Si Won?

3000
02:15:01,504 --> 02:15:04,273
I was guessing it was me,
as I was also the Best Dancer.

3001
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:06,174
It may be Hyeok Jung.

3002
02:15:06,773 --> 02:15:09,174
I expected them to
announce good news for me.

3003
02:15:09,313 --> 02:15:10,483
The promoted dancer is...

3004
02:15:13,754 --> 02:15:15,153
Dancer Shin Min Kwon.

3005
02:15:15,283 --> 02:15:18,283
(Congratulations!)

3006
02:15:18,323 --> 02:15:19,522
Nice!

3007
02:15:19,523 --> 02:15:20,893
(Nice, Min Kwon!)

3008
02:15:21,853 --> 02:15:24,723
Dancer Shin Min Kwon is
promoted from Under to Second,

3009
02:15:24,724 --> 02:15:26,833
receiving a total score of 1,840.

3010
02:15:26,834 --> 02:15:28,893
He also goes to the final. Congratulations.

3011
02:15:29,794 --> 02:15:31,263
I had mixed feelings.

3012
02:15:31,264 --> 02:15:33,433
"Am I eligible for this?"

3013
02:15:33,504 --> 02:15:34,974
I received generous treatment.

3014
02:15:35,073 --> 02:15:36,673
But it's the result, anyway.

3015
02:15:36,674 --> 02:15:39,772
I'll give my best as I
try to perform well...

3016
02:15:39,773 --> 02:15:41,243
and not disappoint others.

3017
02:15:41,773 --> 02:15:44,044
Without the benefit, Min
Kwon wouldn't have made it.

3018
02:15:44,214 --> 02:15:45,544
The benefit is very important.

3019
02:15:45,844 --> 02:15:48,482
Among the remaining dancers in Second,

3020
02:15:48,483 --> 02:15:50,523
one is promoted to First.

3021
02:15:50,624 --> 02:15:51,754
(Another promotion?)

3022
02:15:51,823 --> 02:15:53,152
It may be Hyeok Jung.

3023
02:15:53,153 --> 02:15:55,623
He has a good team benefit.

3024
02:15:55,624 --> 02:15:57,823
Si Won's score could be high enough.

3025
02:15:57,964 --> 02:16:00,093
He's in second among all.

3026
02:16:00,094 --> 02:16:03,264
The promoted dancer to First is...

3027
02:16:04,704 --> 02:16:06,164
Dancer Yun Hyeok Jung.

3028
02:16:07,433 --> 02:16:09,532
(I'm disappointed, but
still, congratulations!)

3029
02:16:09,533 --> 02:16:12,303
His total score is 2,340,
including the personal score.

3030
02:16:12,304 --> 02:16:14,842
So, he is promoted to First from Second.

3031
02:16:14,843 --> 02:16:17,283
(He deserves it!)

3032
02:16:17,413 --> 02:16:18,513
I'm jealous!

3033
02:16:20,654 --> 02:16:22,154
I'm ready to enjoy on the stage.

3034
02:16:22,583 --> 02:16:23,922
I'm well prepared too.

3035
02:16:23,923 --> 02:16:25,403
I'll give my best shot until the end.

3036
02:16:25,624 --> 02:16:27,753
Among the three dancers in Second,

3037
02:16:28,294 --> 02:16:31,064
one should be eliminated,
being demoted to Under.

3038
02:16:31,093 --> 02:16:32,494
Elimination?

3039
02:16:32,564 --> 02:16:33,692
This is too tough.

3040
02:16:33,693 --> 02:16:35,734
As there aren't enough
Under, this is what happens.

3041
02:16:36,363 --> 02:16:39,663
The demoted dancer who is eliminated is...

3042
02:16:40,134 --> 02:16:41,733
Dancer Ryu Tae Young.

3043
02:16:41,734 --> 02:16:43,373
(Dancer Ryu Tae Young is eliminated.)

3044
02:16:43,374 --> 02:16:44,503
The time has come.

3045
02:16:45,603 --> 02:16:47,813
(I can't believe this.)

3046
02:16:47,814 --> 02:16:49,474
(Sighing)

3047
02:16:49,814 --> 02:16:52,582
Dancer Kim Si Won
got a total score of 2,180,

3048
02:16:52,583 --> 02:16:55,412
so he remains in Second.

3049
02:16:55,413 --> 02:16:58,824
Dancer Kim Hyo Joon's score is 2,092.

3050
02:16:58,984 --> 02:17:00,624
He goes to the final.

3051
02:17:03,294 --> 02:17:06,063
We continue to announce the result.

3052
02:17:06,064 --> 02:17:08,994
Under Jeon Tae Hu, Jang Sung Bum,

3053
02:17:09,263 --> 02:17:12,663
Choi Kyu Tae, Baek
Sang Ha, and Kim Jae Jin.

3054
02:17:14,103 --> 02:17:15,273
Has anyone got a benefit?

3055
02:17:15,404 --> 02:17:16,574
No one!

3056
02:17:17,044 --> 02:17:18,044
(Dancer Jeon Tae Hu's
elimination is confirmed.)

3057
02:17:18,045 --> 02:17:21,574
Dancer Jeon Tae Hu
couldn't get a promotion.

3058
02:17:21,814 --> 02:17:22,842
(Dancer Jang Sung Bum's
elimination is confirmed.)

3059
02:17:22,843 --> 02:17:25,643
Jang Sung Bum has a total score of 1,270,

3060
02:17:25,644 --> 02:17:26,984
so he's eliminated.

3061
02:17:27,654 --> 02:17:30,922
Under Choi Kyu Tae
has a total score of 1,090,

3062
02:17:30,923 --> 02:17:32,984
so he's also eliminated.

3063
02:17:33,283 --> 02:17:36,752
Under Baek Sang Ha
has a total score of 1,250,

3064
02:17:36,753 --> 02:17:38,363
so he's eliminated.

3065
02:17:38,564 --> 02:17:41,493
Under Kim Jae Jin couldn't be promoted...

3066
02:17:41,494 --> 02:17:42,833
and was eliminated.

3067
02:17:43,134 --> 02:17:45,134
Literally, all of them
are being eliminated.

3068
02:17:45,634 --> 02:17:47,033
It hurts me a lot.

3069
02:17:47,974 --> 02:17:51,272
The next five dancers for
the class movement are ready.

3070
02:17:51,273 --> 02:17:54,342
First Kim Hye Hyun, Choi
Ho Jong, Kang Gyeong Ho,

3071
02:17:54,343 --> 02:17:56,473
Kim Hyun Ho, and Ki Moo Gan.

3072
02:17:56,474 --> 02:17:58,314
Please come out here upfront.

3073
02:17:58,443 --> 02:17:59,443
All First are going out.

3074
02:17:59,444 --> 02:18:00,790
Aren't they a photo-shooting team?

3075
02:18:00,814 --> 02:18:02,953
- What are you talking about?
- It relieves me.

3076
02:18:02,954 --> 02:18:04,283
That's just a safe zone.

3077
02:18:04,724 --> 02:18:07,022
- But one should be demoted. - What?

3078
02:18:07,023 --> 02:18:09,593
As Hyeok Jung is in First
now, one should be kicked out.

3079
02:18:10,423 --> 02:18:13,734
(As Second Hyeok Jung's promoted, )

3080
02:18:14,163 --> 02:18:16,133
(there are only 4
remaining seats in First.)

3081
02:18:16,134 --> 02:18:19,333
Among all the dancers in First,

3082
02:18:19,663 --> 02:18:22,003
one should be demoted to Second.

3083
02:18:22,234 --> 02:18:23,574
There's a gap in the team score.

3084
02:18:23,773 --> 02:18:25,803
The team benefit will make...

3085
02:18:25,804 --> 02:18:27,350
It will be Hyun Ho,
considering the situation.

3086
02:18:27,374 --> 02:18:29,443
Hye Hyun got a benefit as well.

3087
02:18:29,814 --> 02:18:32,044
Hyun Ho got lower views too.

3088
02:18:32,214 --> 02:18:34,413
We should protect the War Boy captain.

3089
02:18:35,654 --> 02:18:39,083
The dancer who's demoted
to Second from First is...

3090
02:18:40,283 --> 02:18:41,723
Dancer Kim Hyun Ho.

3091
02:18:41,724 --> 02:18:43,553
(Dancer Kim Hyun Ho is
demoted to Second from First.)

3092
02:18:43,554 --> 02:18:45,569
- According to the score...
- Each of them are way too strong.

3093
02:18:45,593 --> 02:18:48,762
Dancer Kim Hyun Ho
has a total score of 2,170...

3094
02:18:48,763 --> 02:18:50,803
including a personal score of 1,320.

3095
02:18:50,804 --> 02:18:53,333
So, he's demoted to Second from First.

3096
02:18:53,634 --> 02:18:55,633
Despite being demoted,

3097
02:18:55,634 --> 02:18:57,343
he goes to the final.

3098
02:18:57,644 --> 02:18:59,904
- Surely! - Old soldiers never die!

3099
02:19:00,173 --> 02:19:03,342
I was ready to accept whatever came.

3100
02:19:03,343 --> 02:19:04,813
This time again,

3101
02:19:04,814 --> 02:19:08,283
I'll make sure what I can
show and perform well.

3102
02:19:09,113 --> 02:19:12,453
Now we have four dancers from First.

3103
02:19:12,454 --> 02:19:14,893
Among the four, we announce the one...

3104
02:19:14,894 --> 02:19:17,163
who goes to the final
with the highest score.

3105
02:19:17,564 --> 02:19:18,592
It'll be Hye Hyun.

3106
02:19:18,593 --> 02:19:19,794
No, it's Ho Jong.

3107
02:19:20,224 --> 02:19:22,693
The role benefit score
of 300 is important here.

3108
02:19:22,833 --> 02:19:26,163
Not sure. Ho Jong's personal
score can be dominant.

3109
02:19:26,704 --> 02:19:28,234
(At the Best Director announcement)

3110
02:19:28,673 --> 02:19:30,272
(Kim Hye Hyun was selected
as the Best Director...)

3111
02:19:30,273 --> 02:19:31,620
(and got the main role benefits of 300.)

3112
02:19:31,644 --> 02:19:32,703
(At the team benefit announcement)

3113
02:19:32,704 --> 02:19:36,343
(Choi Ho Jong got the
maximum score of 1,000.)

3114
02:19:37,083 --> 02:19:38,814
(Personal scores are left now.)

3115
02:19:38,943 --> 02:19:42,054
The dancer, who goes to the final...

3116
02:19:42,083 --> 02:19:43,353
with the highest score, is...

3117
02:19:43,783 --> 02:19:44,853
Who will it be?

3118
02:19:45,353 --> 02:19:46,624
(Who?)

3119
02:19:46,783 --> 02:19:49,054
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun. Congratulations!

3120
02:19:50,193 --> 02:19:51,423
(Yu Chan is shocked.)

3121
02:19:51,593 --> 02:19:52,723
(Startled)

3122
02:19:52,724 --> 02:19:54,163
it's a history!

3123
02:19:54,333 --> 02:19:55,662
He defeated Ho Jong?

3124
02:19:55,663 --> 02:19:57,363
He killed the final boss!

3125
02:19:58,103 --> 02:20:01,502
Dancer Kim Hye Hyun got
the highest total score of 2,620,

3126
02:20:01,503 --> 02:20:04,873
including a personal score of 1,410.

3127
02:20:04,874 --> 02:20:06,143
With all of these, he goes to the final.

3128
02:20:06,144 --> 02:20:08,814
- He shoots up.
- I've never been in the first.

3129
02:20:09,173 --> 02:20:12,082
I think it's time to enjoy being here.

3130
02:20:12,083 --> 02:20:13,282
(Enjoying the moment)

3131
02:20:13,283 --> 02:20:15,813
After Kim Hye Hyun, the next
dancer who goes to the final...

3132
02:20:15,814 --> 02:20:18,454
with the second highest score...

3133
02:20:18,484 --> 02:20:19,922
is Dancer Choi Ho Jong.

3134
02:20:19,923 --> 02:20:22,163
(3rd Class Movement Ceremony
Second place: Choi Ho Jong)

3135
02:20:22,193 --> 02:20:25,223
Dancer Choi Ho Jong got the
maximum personal score of 1,500.

3136
02:20:25,224 --> 02:20:26,664
He's in first place with that score!

3137
02:20:27,964 --> 02:20:29,634
The score is high enough,

3138
02:20:29,794 --> 02:20:31,234
but the benefits go to Hye Hyun.

3139
02:20:31,933 --> 02:20:33,503
I should go down at least once.

3140
02:20:33,533 --> 02:20:34,672
Second place? It's nothing.

3141
02:20:34,673 --> 02:20:35,673
(It's not a thing.)

3142
02:20:36,503 --> 02:20:38,772
Dancer Kang Gyeong Ho
got the third-highest score,

3143
02:20:38,773 --> 02:20:40,613
so he remains in First.

3144
02:20:40,943 --> 02:20:43,073
Dancer Ki Moo Gan got
the final score of 2,410,

3145
02:20:43,074 --> 02:20:45,314
so it's the same with Kang Gyeong Ho.

3146
02:20:45,943 --> 02:20:48,583
Then, Moo Gan has a higher personal score.

3147
02:20:48,954 --> 02:20:50,384
If I got the benefits...

3148
02:20:50,984 --> 02:20:53,083
(I could have been in third only.)

3149
02:20:53,154 --> 02:20:55,554
Now two groups are waiting?

3150
02:20:56,023 --> 02:20:58,193
The next five dancers are ready.

3151
02:20:58,523 --> 02:21:01,363
Second Park Jun Woo and Kim Kyu Nyeon.

3152
02:21:01,593 --> 02:21:04,102
Under Lee Jin Woo, Kim Sang Gil,

3153
02:21:04,103 --> 02:21:06,002
and Kim Do Hyun. Please come out here.

3154
02:21:06,003 --> 02:21:07,203
- Let's go. - It's time for us.

3155
02:21:07,204 --> 02:21:08,573
- Let's go! - You got this!

3156
02:21:08,574 --> 02:21:10,334
- You both should come back!
- You got this!

3157
02:21:10,874 --> 02:21:12,773
All of them are talented.

3158
02:21:13,103 --> 02:21:15,172
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon couldn't come today...

3159
02:21:15,173 --> 02:21:17,044
due to personal reasons.

3160
02:21:17,513 --> 02:21:20,913
Among the five dancers,

3161
02:21:21,513 --> 02:21:22,783
only two go to the final.

3162
02:21:24,083 --> 02:21:25,683
Do Hyun will get the chance.

3163
02:21:26,154 --> 02:21:27,353
It's 940.

3164
02:21:27,824 --> 02:21:29,994
Jun Woo got at least the benefits.

3165
02:21:30,294 --> 02:21:31,363
It's 300.

3166
02:21:31,964 --> 02:21:34,833
The three couldn't get
the weighting factor.

3167
02:21:35,163 --> 02:21:37,503
Sang Gil isn't safe either.

3168
02:21:37,964 --> 02:21:39,602
(Kim Sang Gil is eliminated.)

3169
02:21:39,603 --> 02:21:43,133
Under Kim Sang Gil
has a total score of 1,290,

3170
02:21:43,134 --> 02:21:44,842
so he's eliminated...

3171
02:21:44,843 --> 02:21:47,073
and can't go to the final.

3172
02:21:47,074 --> 02:21:50,374
Now we announce the result for Lee Jin Woo.

3173
02:21:50,644 --> 02:21:52,483
He got the benefit of 940.

3174
02:21:52,484 --> 02:21:54,214
If only he were in Second.

3175
02:21:54,353 --> 02:21:56,954
He was demoted last
time. That's a bummer too.

3176
02:21:57,324 --> 02:21:58,984
(Dancer Lee Jin Woo's total score: 1,520)

3177
02:21:59,083 --> 02:22:00,523
(What a bummer.)

3178
02:22:01,023 --> 02:22:02,092
It's bitter.

3179
02:22:02,093 --> 02:22:04,262
Dancer Lee Jin Woo couldn't get promoted...

3180
02:22:04,263 --> 02:22:05,624
and was eliminated.

3181
02:22:05,863 --> 02:22:07,393
If only his skill blossoms early.

3182
02:22:07,394 --> 02:22:08,493
(I'm sorry.)

3183
02:22:08,494 --> 02:22:11,002
Now Dancer Park Jun Woo,
Kim Do Hyun, and Kim Kyu Nyeon.

3184
02:22:11,003 --> 02:22:13,464
We will proceed with the
Class Movement for them.

3185
02:22:13,704 --> 02:22:15,532
I will reveal the dancer who
will be in Second Class...

3186
02:22:15,533 --> 02:22:17,874
and make it to the final.

3187
02:22:18,204 --> 02:22:21,473
Jun Woo received benefits
and the response was good.

3188
02:22:21,474 --> 02:22:23,594
- I think he'll stay.
- Park Jun Woo in Second Class.

3189
02:22:23,843 --> 02:22:26,643
Do Hyun might be promoted to Second Class.

3190
02:22:26,644 --> 02:22:30,683
I think Jun Woo and Do
Hyun will be in Second Class.

3191
02:22:30,853 --> 02:22:34,894
The dancer who will be in Second
Class and make it to the final is...

3192
02:22:36,693 --> 02:22:38,163
Dancer Park Jun Woo.

3193
02:22:38,894 --> 02:22:40,662
(Dancer Park Jun Woo: From 2nd to 2nd)

3194
02:22:40,663 --> 02:22:41,963
Jun Woo might've not made it...

3195
02:22:41,964 --> 02:22:43,262
- if it weren't for the benefit. - Oh, my.

3196
02:22:43,263 --> 02:22:45,804
He survived thanks to the benefit.

3197
02:22:46,304 --> 02:22:47,824
But there's a weighting factor of 1.3.

3198
02:22:47,874 --> 02:22:51,043
Dancer Park Jun Woo has
made it to the final with...

3199
02:22:51,044 --> 02:22:52,672
- Congratulations.
- A total score of 2,026 points.

3200
02:22:52,673 --> 02:22:54,113
Congratulations.

3201
02:22:54,714 --> 02:22:56,744
I managed to come this far.

3202
02:22:56,874 --> 02:22:59,182
The last hurdle is left.

3203
02:22:59,183 --> 02:23:01,884
I'll finish it well.

3204
02:23:02,283 --> 02:23:05,483
The remaining dancers are
Kim Do Hyun in Under Class...

3205
02:23:05,484 --> 02:23:07,724
and Kim Kyu Nyeon in Second Class.

3206
02:23:08,023 --> 02:23:11,162
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon was
cast for the main lead role...

3207
02:23:11,163 --> 02:23:13,092
for the Stage Choice by Public Mission,

3208
02:23:13,093 --> 02:23:14,432
but his team ranked last, at eighth place,

3209
02:23:14,433 --> 02:23:16,863
in the Seat Class Evaluation.

3210
02:23:17,093 --> 02:23:19,863
He didn't receive the benefit
for the Best Director either.

3211
02:23:20,304 --> 02:23:23,573
Dancer Kim Do Hyun in Under
Class didn't receive any extra points...

3212
02:23:23,574 --> 02:23:26,103
as there's no weighting
factor for Under Class.

3213
02:23:26,804 --> 02:23:27,814
The weighting factor.

3214
02:23:27,913 --> 02:23:30,012
The gap between their
team benefits is quite big.

3215
02:23:30,013 --> 02:23:31,182
I know. That's why.

3216
02:23:31,183 --> 02:23:34,654
It already makes a 150-point difference.

3217
02:23:34,954 --> 02:23:37,683
His score is likely to be only
slightly different from Kyu Nyeon's.

3218
02:23:37,853 --> 02:23:39,453
I will announce the dancer...

3219
02:23:39,454 --> 02:23:42,023
who will be demoted to
Under Class and eliminated...

3220
02:23:42,154 --> 02:23:44,234
between Dancer Kim Do Hyun
and Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon.

3221
02:23:44,824 --> 02:23:46,464
- This is really tough. - The finalist...

3222
02:23:46,523 --> 02:23:47,634
I don't know.

3223
02:23:47,734 --> 02:23:48,964
Dancer Kim Do Hyun...

3224
02:23:50,593 --> 02:23:52,163
is eliminated.

3225
02:23:52,304 --> 02:23:55,033
(Dancer Kim Do Hyun has been eliminated.)

3226
02:23:55,204 --> 02:23:56,432
(Kim Do Hyun: From
Under to Under, Eliminated)

3227
02:23:56,433 --> 02:23:57,744
His score is high.

3228
02:23:59,374 --> 02:24:00,773
It was so close.

3229
02:24:00,913 --> 02:24:05,442
Dancer Kim Do Hyun has been
eliminated from Stage Fighter...

3230
02:24:05,443 --> 02:24:08,159
with a total score of 1,680 points,
including 740 individual points.

3231
02:24:08,183 --> 02:24:10,083
- It was close. - It was so close.

3232
02:24:10,214 --> 02:24:11,453
(Kim Kyu Nyeon: From 2nd to 2nd, Finalist)

3233
02:24:11,454 --> 02:24:12,852
Dancer Kim Kyu Nyeon...

3234
02:24:12,853 --> 02:24:17,592
has made it to the final as
he stayed in Second Class...

3235
02:24:17,593 --> 02:24:19,963
with a total of 1,778 points,

3236
02:24:19,964 --> 02:24:22,433
including 988 individual
points. Congratulations.

3237
02:24:22,693 --> 02:24:24,304
- It was dangerous for him. - Yes.

3238
02:24:24,603 --> 02:24:28,234
First of all, I'm grateful I've survived.

3239
02:24:28,474 --> 02:24:31,943
I think I should dance with
a sense of responsibility.

3240
02:24:32,343 --> 02:24:35,043
Seong Yun and Young Woong are left.

3241
02:24:35,044 --> 02:24:36,413
Let's go.

3242
02:24:36,613 --> 02:24:37,613
(Holding hands)

3243
02:24:37,614 --> 02:24:40,083
- Dong Hoon. - Hye Seong too.

3244
02:24:41,154 --> 02:24:44,484
Next, Go Dong Hoon, Kim Young Woong,

3245
02:24:44,683 --> 02:24:46,654
Yang Seong Yun, and Ha
Won Jun in Second Class

3246
02:24:46,884 --> 02:24:48,752
Jung Hye Seong in Under Class.

3247
02:24:48,753 --> 02:24:50,993
Please go to the Class Announcement Zone.

3248
02:24:50,994 --> 02:24:52,064
This is intense.

3249
02:24:52,263 --> 02:24:53,824
This is hard to predict.

3250
02:24:54,093 --> 02:24:55,634
How many of them will be eliminated?

3251
02:24:55,763 --> 02:24:58,003
- None of them will be eliminated. - Right.

3252
02:24:58,863 --> 02:25:01,134
This place is so cruel.

3253
02:25:02,134 --> 02:25:04,204
I think Young Woong will stay.

3254
02:25:04,904 --> 02:25:06,474
Seong Yu received benefits.

3255
02:25:06,804 --> 02:25:08,612
I think my individual
points would be very low.

3256
02:25:08,613 --> 02:25:09,744
But you received benefits.

3257
02:25:10,074 --> 02:25:12,244
It'll be crazy if Hye Seong is eliminated.

3258
02:25:12,884 --> 02:25:14,764
Dong Hoon is probably
going to be promoted. No?

3259
02:25:14,954 --> 02:25:16,153
I will announce the dancer...

3260
02:25:16,154 --> 02:25:18,724
who will be in Second
Class and make it to the final.

3261
02:25:19,253 --> 02:25:20,423
Young Woong might stay.

3262
02:25:22,294 --> 02:25:23,653
Dancer Kim Young Woong.

3263
02:25:23,654 --> 02:25:25,593
(Kim Young Woong: From 2nd to 2nd)

3264
02:25:26,163 --> 02:25:27,363
His score is high.

3265
02:25:27,564 --> 02:25:31,133
Dancer Kim Young Woong
has stayed in Second Class...

3266
02:25:31,134 --> 02:25:34,502
and has made it to the final...

3267
02:25:34,503 --> 02:25:36,610
with a total score of 2,118 points,
including 1,118 individual points.

3268
02:25:36,634 --> 02:25:39,704
He almost became First
Class. His score is 2,118 points.

3269
02:25:40,443 --> 02:25:41,512
The guys...

3270
02:25:41,513 --> 02:25:42,513
(Half relieved, half worried)

3271
02:25:42,514 --> 02:25:44,643
Dancer Yang Seong Yun
and Dancer Jung Hye Seong...

3272
02:25:44,644 --> 02:25:46,324
who received benefits for the Best Dancer.

3273
02:25:46,443 --> 02:25:48,483
Dancer Ha Won Jun and
Dancer Go Dong Hoon...

3274
02:25:48,484 --> 02:25:50,524
who were promoted from
Under Class to Second Class.

3275
02:25:50,554 --> 02:25:53,283
I will now reveal the eliminated dancer.

3276
02:25:53,624 --> 02:25:56,453
Seong Yun is in 2nd Class
and received 600 benefit points.

3277
02:25:56,454 --> 02:25:58,374
- Won Jun might be eliminated.
- Which dancer...

3278
02:25:58,523 --> 02:26:00,270
- It's dangerous for Dong Hoon too.
- Will be...

3279
02:26:00,294 --> 02:26:02,894
- Hye Seong.
- But there's no weighting factor.

3280
02:26:03,294 --> 02:26:05,032
The eliminated dancer is...

3281
02:26:05,033 --> 02:26:06,839
(Which dancer will be
eliminated before the final?)

3282
02:26:06,863 --> 02:26:08,332
Ha Won Jun.

3283
02:26:08,333 --> 02:26:10,704
(Dancer Ha Won Jun has been eliminated.)

3284
02:26:11,204 --> 02:26:12,442
(Disappointed)

3285
02:26:12,443 --> 02:26:14,373
- You worked hard, Won Jun.
- Dancer Ha Won Jun...

3286
02:26:14,374 --> 02:26:16,612
has been demoted to Under Class...

3287
02:26:16,613 --> 02:26:20,013
with a total score of 1,478 points
and failed to advance to the final.

3288
02:26:20,314 --> 02:26:22,154
It's finally over.

3289
02:26:22,484 --> 02:26:25,723
I feel relieved because I left
a few good pieces of work...

3290
02:26:25,724 --> 02:26:28,252
and had a good experience.

3291
02:26:28,253 --> 02:26:29,293
(I feel relieved.)

3292
02:26:29,294 --> 02:26:32,394
The finalist among the three dancers...

3293
02:26:33,064 --> 02:26:34,393
is Dancer Yang Seong Yun.

3294
02:26:34,394 --> 02:26:35,563
(Dancer Yang Seong Yun is the finalist.)

3295
02:26:35,564 --> 02:26:36,662
(Surprised)

3296
02:26:36,663 --> 02:26:39,234
I told you he would make it.

3297
02:26:39,333 --> 02:26:40,403
Dancer Yang Seong Yun...

3298
02:26:40,404 --> 02:26:43,903
has advanced to the final with
a total score of 1,796 points.

3299
02:26:43,904 --> 02:26:45,172
(Yang Seong Yun: From 2nd to 2nd)

3300
02:26:45,173 --> 02:26:47,473
My nightmare.

3301
02:26:47,474 --> 02:26:48,644
My Karina.

3302
02:26:49,244 --> 02:26:50,672
There are only two remaining dancers.

3303
02:26:50,673 --> 02:26:53,744
Dancer Jung Hye Seong
and Dancer Go Dong Hoon.

3304
02:26:54,154 --> 02:26:56,183
But only one of them...

3305
02:26:57,113 --> 02:26:59,523
will make it to the final.

3306
02:27:00,384 --> 02:27:02,353
- It's cruel. - No way.

3307
02:27:03,154 --> 02:27:04,262
Both are my team.

3308
02:27:04,263 --> 02:27:05,739
They received the same
points for the team benefit.

3309
02:27:05,763 --> 02:27:08,163
But Hye Seong received the role benefit.

3310
02:27:08,894 --> 02:27:10,270
(Jung Hye Seong: Role benefit 300 points)

3311
02:27:10,294 --> 02:27:13,703
(Jung Hye Seong received
300 points for the role benefit.)

3312
02:27:13,704 --> 02:27:15,103
(This is bad.)

3313
02:27:15,404 --> 02:27:17,474
There's a weighting
factor of 1.3 for Dong Hoon.

3314
02:27:18,404 --> 02:27:19,520
(Based on the result of
the last Class Movement, )

3315
02:27:19,544 --> 02:27:21,520
(a weighting factor is applied
to Dong Hoon for his class.)

3316
02:27:21,544 --> 02:27:23,913
The last finalist is...

3317
02:27:24,314 --> 02:27:26,434
- Who earned 300 points? Hye Seong?
- It's Hye Seong.

3318
02:27:26,613 --> 02:27:28,913
Dong Hoon's video has a higher view count.

3319
02:27:29,253 --> 02:27:31,884
His video has 5,000 more views.

3320
02:27:32,253 --> 02:27:34,523
Gosh, both are so good.

3321
02:27:34,753 --> 02:27:36,700
It wouldn't be strange
if either of them made it.

3322
02:27:36,724 --> 02:27:39,593
I was literally panicking.

3323
02:27:40,193 --> 02:27:42,563
I feel so nervous when
I make it at the end.

3324
02:27:42,564 --> 02:27:43,693
I'm very anxious.

3325
02:27:44,503 --> 02:27:47,833
(Who is the one dancer
that will make it to the final?)

3326
02:27:48,234 --> 02:27:50,503
The last finalist is...

3327
02:27:50,734 --> 02:27:51,974
Three hundred points is huge.

3328
02:27:52,003 --> 02:27:54,123
- Who earned 300 points? Hye Seong?
- It's Hye Seong.

3329
02:27:54,273 --> 02:27:56,773
Dong Hoon's video has a higher view count.

3330
02:27:56,874 --> 02:27:59,484
His video has 5,000 more views.

3331
02:27:59,814 --> 02:28:02,183
Gosh, both are so good.

3332
02:28:02,484 --> 02:28:04,399
It wouldn't be strange
if either of them made it.

3333
02:28:04,423 --> 02:28:07,283
I was literally panicking.

3334
02:28:07,824 --> 02:28:10,323
I feel so nervous when
I make it at the end.

3335
02:28:10,324 --> 02:28:11,394
I'm very anxious.

3336
02:28:12,124 --> 02:28:13,723
Dong Hoon? Hye Seong?

3337
02:28:13,724 --> 02:28:15,169
(Which one will make it to the final?)

3338
02:28:15,193 --> 02:28:16,362
Dancer Jung Hye Seong.

3339
02:28:16,363 --> 02:28:19,564
(Jung Hye Seong is the last finalist.)

3340
02:28:20,363 --> 02:28:21,373
(Nodding)

3341
02:28:21,374 --> 02:28:23,655
- What will happen to Dong Hoon?
- He will be eliminated.

3342
02:28:24,343 --> 02:28:27,243
Dancer Jung Hye Seong
has advanced to the final with...

3343
02:28:27,244 --> 02:28:28,912
- a total score of 1,750 points.
- Good luck.

3344
02:28:28,913 --> 02:28:30,544
- Congratulations. - Don't cry.

3345
02:28:31,644 --> 02:28:33,413
So Hye Seong is in 20th place.

3346
02:28:33,683 --> 02:28:36,214
Kyu Nyeon received 1,770 points, didn't he?

3347
02:28:36,384 --> 02:28:38,523
Hye Seong is really the last one.

3348
02:28:38,683 --> 02:28:41,154
- Congratulations. - You worked hard.

3349
02:28:41,523 --> 02:28:43,654
- Good luck. - Don't get hurt.

3350
02:28:43,923 --> 02:28:46,362
My prediction was right.

3351
02:28:46,363 --> 02:28:47,464
Oh, my gosh.

3352
02:28:48,564 --> 02:28:51,204
(Go Dong Hoon: From
Second to Under, Eliminated)

3353
02:28:51,804 --> 02:28:52,884
It's an 8-point difference.

3354
02:28:53,464 --> 02:28:55,032
- It's an 8-point difference.
- I was right.

3355
02:28:55,033 --> 02:28:57,233
I was right. It's because I
didn't receive the benefit.

3356
02:28:57,704 --> 02:28:59,403
(Feeling sorry for no reason)

3357
02:28:59,404 --> 02:29:00,442
No. Let them congratulate you.

3358
02:29:00,443 --> 02:29:02,374
You should just work hard.

3359
02:29:03,443 --> 02:29:06,083
I don't know what I'm feeling,

3360
02:29:06,214 --> 02:29:08,714
but I felt more sorry than happy.

3361
02:29:09,554 --> 02:29:10,683
You worked hard.

3362
02:29:10,753 --> 02:29:14,294
They were upset and perplexed.

3363
02:29:14,654 --> 02:29:16,193
Watching their reactions,

3364
02:29:16,423 --> 02:29:18,863
I wasn't disappointed or
frustrated when I was eliminated.

3365
02:29:19,124 --> 02:29:22,093
I felt complimented and comforted.

3366
02:29:22,933 --> 02:29:25,303
The results of the Class
Movement have been announced.

3367
02:29:25,304 --> 02:29:27,634
- Let's go home. - Good luck for tomorrow.

3368
02:29:27,933 --> 02:29:29,204
I think I'm going to cry.

3369
02:29:29,734 --> 02:29:31,173
Sang Ha is crying.

3370
02:29:32,244 --> 02:29:33,304
You worked hard.

3371
02:29:33,904 --> 02:29:35,813
You worked hard, my partner.

3372
02:29:35,814 --> 02:29:36,814
(Hugging tightly)

3373
02:29:36,815 --> 02:29:39,443
I learned a lot from you.

3374
02:29:39,613 --> 02:29:41,213
(Oh, my friend)

3375
02:29:41,214 --> 02:29:42,682
- Good luck. - I love you.

3376
02:29:42,683 --> 02:29:45,283
- I love you too.
- Congratulations. Good luck.

3377
02:29:46,054 --> 02:29:48,554
I feel bad because all my
teammates are eliminated.

3378
02:29:49,093 --> 02:29:50,253
Why are you crying?

3379
02:29:51,093 --> 02:29:52,124
(He's crying as well.)

3380
02:29:52,863 --> 02:29:54,493
- I'm sorry. - Why are you sorry?

3381
02:29:54,494 --> 02:29:55,593
I'm sorry.

3382
02:29:55,763 --> 02:29:57,540
You made it to the final
because you did well.

3383
02:29:57,564 --> 02:30:00,234
I want to cry if you cry. Don't cry.

3384
02:30:00,964 --> 02:30:03,673
You worked hard. You were so cool.

3385
02:30:03,933 --> 02:30:05,573
I took this show very seriously.

3386
02:30:05,574 --> 02:30:07,303
I had to leave,

3387
02:30:07,304 --> 02:30:09,013
and it didn't feel real.

3388
02:30:09,843 --> 02:30:12,442
On hot days, we practiced,
ran, and sweated...

3389
02:30:12,443 --> 02:30:14,082
for hours.

3390
02:30:14,083 --> 02:30:16,853
It was hot and fierce.

3391
02:30:17,413 --> 02:30:20,884
It was so hard, but
even that felt so precious.

3392
02:30:21,654 --> 02:30:24,593
I'll remember this moment
for the rest of my life.

3393
02:30:26,724 --> 02:30:28,063
I thought we'd make it to the final.

3394
02:30:28,064 --> 02:30:29,263
I'm tearing up.

3395
02:30:29,363 --> 02:30:31,734
Right? It's because you went through a lot.

3396
02:30:31,964 --> 02:30:33,033
(Glancing)

3397
02:30:34,603 --> 02:30:36,574
- I'm not crying. - What?

3398
02:30:36,933 --> 02:30:38,644
I didn't know you could cry.

3399
02:30:39,304 --> 02:30:40,649
(He finds it funny in the meantime.)

3400
02:30:40,673 --> 02:30:41,974
Why does this make me cry?

3401
02:30:42,644 --> 02:30:45,543
We started to rely on
one another at some point.

3402
02:30:45,544 --> 02:30:47,825
We were determined to advance
to the next round together.

3403
02:30:47,884 --> 02:30:48,954
I'll get going.

3404
02:30:50,613 --> 02:30:52,253
- You worked hard. - Bye.

3405
02:30:52,954 --> 02:30:54,454
(Upset)

3406
02:30:57,494 --> 02:30:59,262
(The stories of 20 dancers
who should say goodbye)

3407
02:30:59,263 --> 02:31:01,303
It feels like I made it to
this round not long ago.

3408
02:31:02,833 --> 02:31:03,863
What?

3409
02:31:05,003 --> 02:31:06,063
(Class Confirmation Zone)

3410
02:31:06,064 --> 02:31:07,503
(Emotional)

3411
02:31:08,603 --> 02:31:10,102
(The ballet master An Si On who
showcased stable ballet techniques)

3412
02:31:10,103 --> 02:31:11,819
"The passionate youngest
member in Stage Fighter."

3413
02:31:11,843 --> 02:31:13,903
"Your endless passion
and ambition for dance."

3414
02:31:13,904 --> 02:31:15,573
"A quiet but strong dancer."

3415
02:31:15,574 --> 02:31:17,813
"Someone with an
unstoppable spirit of challenge."

3416
02:31:17,814 --> 02:31:18,912
"Stage Fighter's treasure."

3417
02:31:18,913 --> 02:31:20,413
"The Princess of Contemporary Dance."

3418
02:31:20,443 --> 02:31:23,352
- "Dancer Kang Yun Gu."
- "Dancer Kim Jae Jin."

3419
02:31:23,353 --> 02:31:25,323
"I hope you have a bright future."

3420
02:31:25,324 --> 02:31:27,582
"I hope you continue to dance
through life without giving up."

3421
02:31:27,583 --> 02:31:29,183
"I remember your all-consuming passion."

3422
02:31:29,753 --> 02:31:31,794
This feels so weird.

3423
02:31:32,523 --> 02:31:33,523
I had fun.

3424
02:31:34,394 --> 02:31:37,964
I was happy as I managed to
make it. I'm a little disappointed.

3425
02:31:38,363 --> 02:31:40,833
The summer was hot...

3426
02:31:40,933 --> 02:31:42,833
with 64 dancers.

3427
02:31:43,273 --> 02:31:44,573
I could do the dance I wanted...

3428
02:31:44,574 --> 02:31:47,543
through Stage Fighter.

3429
02:31:47,544 --> 02:31:50,574
It was an honor to be a part of it.

3430
02:31:50,673 --> 02:31:51,714
I was happy...

3431
02:31:52,144 --> 02:31:53,943
to show you my dance.

3432
02:31:54,554 --> 02:31:55,853
You worked hard, everyone.

3433
02:31:59,853 --> 02:32:02,654
I felt I was alone. I thought I did well.

3434
02:32:02,753 --> 02:32:05,093
I think I'll take dance
even more seriously.

3435
02:32:05,294 --> 02:32:06,994
I learned about life in Stage Fighter.

3436
02:32:07,724 --> 02:32:09,262
I'd like to thank the viewers...

3437
02:32:09,263 --> 02:32:11,763
who have been supporting
me even though I lack.

3438
02:32:13,564 --> 02:32:14,734
I love you guys.

3439
02:32:15,003 --> 02:32:16,233
- Good luck, everyone.
- Keep going until the end.

3440
02:32:16,234 --> 02:32:22,512
(Stage Fighter nationwide concert
tour kicks off on December 25.)

3441
02:32:22,513 --> 02:32:24,842
- We got this! - We got this!

3442
02:32:24,843 --> 02:32:27,523
(Check out our official social
media account for more information!)

3443
02:32:28,384 --> 02:32:30,852
- We got this! - We got this!

3444
02:32:30,853 --> 02:32:32,554
(Adieu, Stage Fighter.)

3445
02:32:32,824 --> 02:32:34,253
(And there's another person.)

3446
02:32:34,824 --> 02:32:38,363
Hello, I'm a person who is alive.

3447
02:32:38,693 --> 02:32:40,263
My name is Ki Moo Gan.

3448
02:32:41,863 --> 02:32:44,634
With a sense of regret,

3449
02:32:44,734 --> 02:32:47,763
I will return to being...

3450
02:32:48,474 --> 02:32:50,074
the utterly ordinary person I was.

3451
02:32:52,103 --> 02:32:55,013
"Why am I..."

3452
02:32:55,214 --> 02:32:57,374
"not as talented as the others?"

3453
02:32:57,773 --> 02:32:59,814
I've been facing many obstacles.

3454
02:33:00,714 --> 02:33:02,512
And I've reached my limit.

3455
02:33:02,513 --> 02:33:03,513
(In the end, he reached his limit.)

3456
02:33:03,514 --> 02:33:05,683
I thought I should give up.

3457
02:33:07,824 --> 02:33:10,523
I think a perfectionist
who isn't perfect...

3458
02:33:13,763 --> 02:33:16,464
ends up being like this.

3459
02:33:19,704 --> 02:33:23,103
I couldn't show an extraordinary talent.

3460
02:33:23,433 --> 02:33:27,244
I'm not incredibly handsome either.

3461
02:33:28,074 --> 02:33:31,173
But you've been supporting
me and loving me,

3462
02:33:31,943 --> 02:33:34,583
which I don't think I
deserve. Thank you so much.

3463
02:33:34,913 --> 02:33:37,083
And I'm truly sorry.

3464
02:33:38,224 --> 02:33:40,223
Please hate my stubbornness with me...

3465
02:33:40,224 --> 02:33:42,193
for not being able to change my mind.

3466
02:33:44,564 --> 02:33:47,724
I'll go back to where I was...

3467
02:33:49,093 --> 02:33:50,494
and support the other dancers.

3468
02:33:51,663 --> 02:33:52,763
I was happy to meet you.

3469
02:33:53,704 --> 02:33:55,734
I was thankful and grateful.

3470
02:33:58,103 --> 02:33:59,144

Dancer Go Dong Hoon
who had the highest score...

3474
02:34:07,644 --> 02:34:09,853
among the eliminated
dancers will advance to the final.

3475
02:34:09,954 --> 02:34:12,724
Dancer Kim Jong Cheol who had
the highest score in Second Class...

3476
02:34:13,083 --> 02:34:14,592
will be promoted to First Class.

3477
02:34:14,593 --> 02:34:15,913

02:34:38,884 --> 02:34:41,813

3489

3490
02:34:47,523 --> 02:34:48,793
(STF Online Casting Voting Process)

3491
02:34:48,794 --> 02:34:51,624
If you want to give a higher
score for your favorite dancer,

3492
02:34:51,724 --> 02:34:55,234
please vote for a higher
Seat Class by ticketing.

3493
02:34:55,394 --> 02:34:56,432
(Voting for Individual Dancers)

3494
02:34:56,433 --> 02:34:57,832
The STF Online Casting Voting...

3495
02:34:57,833 --> 02:35:00,133
is open on the Mnet Plus app now.

3496
02:35:00,134 --> 02:35:02,474
Please cast your favorite dancer.

3497
02:35:02,704 --> 02:35:05,843
Who will be the dancers
joining the STF Dance Team,

3498
02:35:05,974 --> 02:35:07,273
a global dance company?

3499
02:35:07,644 --> 02:35:08,714
Next week,

3500
02:35:09,273 --> 02:35:11,783
the final live stage will be broadcast.

3501
02:35:12,113 --> 02:35:14,913
You can watch special
performances of the 20 finalists.

3502
02:35:15,283 --> 02:35:17,553
Korean dance, contemporary
dance, and ballet.

3503
02:35:17,554 --> 02:35:19,829
You can watch the stage versions
of the Dance Films by genre.

3504
02:35:19,853 --> 02:35:21,593
The last mission in Stage Fighter.

3505
02:35:22,054 --> 02:35:23,422
You can also watch the last performances...

3506
02:35:23,423 --> 02:35:24,703
of the STF Last Casting Mission.

3507
02:35:24,863 --> 02:35:27,464
You can watch the final
performance at the mega stage level.

3508
02:35:28,533 --> 02:35:31,033
We invite the fans who
are supporting the dancers...

3509
02:35:31,134 --> 02:35:32,503
to the final stage.

3510
02:35:33,333 --> 02:35:36,573
The families of the
dancers are here as well.

3511
02:35:36,574 --> 02:35:37,950
(Their families watched their
performances near the stage.)

3512
02:35:37,974 --> 02:35:41,002
I hope you cheer for them as well.

3513
02:35:41,003 --> 02:35:43,874
(We hope their families
cheer for them as well.)

3514
02:35:44,714 --> 02:35:47,413
(My family)

3515
02:35:47,714 --> 02:35:49,213
My parents...

3516
02:35:49,214 --> 02:35:51,884
are my guide sign and a beam of light.

3517
02:35:52,224 --> 02:35:54,484
I don't need to say anything.
They're my everything.

3518
02:35:55,494 --> 02:35:58,393
"My family has come. There
are as many as two people..."

3519
02:35:58,394 --> 02:36:01,224
"who will support me even if I
make mistakes." That's what I thought.

3520
02:36:01,964 --> 02:36:05,064
I know my family will
take my side for sure.

3521
02:36:05,503 --> 02:36:06,563
They're like heroes...

3522
02:36:06,564 --> 02:36:07,662
(My heroes)

3523
02:36:07,663 --> 02:36:08,672
to me.

3524
02:36:08,673 --> 02:36:10,603
(My parents)

3525
02:36:11,744 --> 02:36:13,673
I was very stubborn.

3526
02:36:14,343 --> 02:36:17,044
I was young, so I wondered why
they couldn't do something for me...

3527
02:36:17,644 --> 02:36:19,720
when the other parents do
anything for their children.

3528
02:36:19,744 --> 02:36:21,412
Even though I was
childish, they helped me a lot.

3529
02:36:21,413 --> 02:36:23,930
(Despite his childish complaints,
his parents supported him quietly.)

3530
02:36:23,954 --> 02:36:26,182
I always feel happy and grateful...

3531
02:36:26,183 --> 02:36:28,124
when I dance.

3532
02:36:28,353 --> 02:36:30,192
I know it would've been impossible...

3533
02:36:30,193 --> 02:36:32,263
without my parents.

3534
02:36:32,894 --> 02:36:34,393
They're my saviors.

3535
02:36:34,394 --> 02:36:35,464
(My parents, my saviors)

3536
02:36:35,734 --> 02:36:37,663
They were the reason for me to live.

3537
02:36:37,933 --> 02:36:40,263
Now,

3538
02:36:40,603 --> 02:36:42,003
I feel sorry for them.

3539
02:36:42,974 --> 02:36:46,374
I can't say I did ballet all by myself.

3540
02:36:46,574 --> 02:36:49,044
It was possible because
my parents were there for me.

3541
02:36:50,374 --> 02:36:53,544
I don't know why I feel sorry...

3542
02:36:53,644 --> 02:36:55,113
when I see them happy.

3543
02:36:56,154 --> 02:36:59,423
I should tell them to
wait just a little more.

3544
02:36:59,824 --> 02:37:01,623
But it's just impossible...

3545
02:37:01,624 --> 02:37:03,923
for me to say it.

3546
02:37:04,253 --> 02:37:06,092
When I got accepted
into the arts middle school,

3547
02:37:06,093 --> 02:37:07,933
my mother and older
brother moved for my sake.

3548
02:37:08,093 --> 02:37:11,033
They always sacrificed and
supported me from behind.

3549
02:37:11,734 --> 02:37:13,503
I'm so thankful for them.

3550
02:37:13,964 --> 02:37:16,233
Now, I want...

3551
02:37:16,234 --> 02:37:18,404
to be their hope.

3552
02:37:19,273 --> 02:37:21,043
(Gyeong Ho's father posts his
children's dance on YouTube.)

3553
02:37:21,044 --> 02:37:23,943
I think he started posting
videos when I became an adult.

3554
02:37:24,173 --> 02:37:27,744
My father doesn't have
many joys in his life.

3555
02:37:28,083 --> 02:37:30,282
He posts our dance videos...

3556
02:37:30,283 --> 02:37:33,053
and is proud of our achievements.

3557
02:37:33,054 --> 02:37:36,394
And he wants to show them off to others.

3558
02:37:37,294 --> 02:37:40,262
That's so precious.

3559
02:37:40,263 --> 02:37:42,263
(Parents are always
proud of their children.)

3560
02:37:42,363 --> 02:37:44,432
They always come to watch my performance.

3561
02:37:44,433 --> 02:37:45,703
I started late in dance.

3562
02:37:45,704 --> 02:37:47,603
So they were very worried.

3563
02:37:48,003 --> 02:37:51,134
But they watched the show...

3564
02:37:51,644 --> 02:37:53,974
and saw how people called
me "The King of Dance."

3565
02:37:54,443 --> 02:37:56,714
They were like, "You
were very humble at home."

3566
02:37:57,413 --> 02:37:59,012
"Why didn't you tell us about it?"

3567
02:37:59,013 --> 02:38:00,043
(His parents realized
their son's true side.)

3568
02:38:00,044 --> 02:38:02,783
- Do I look pretty? - You're the prettiest.

3569
02:38:03,753 --> 02:38:07,124
I didn't know he was
this good. I was surprised.

3570
02:38:08,353 --> 02:38:10,692
I thought I could learn from my son...

3571
02:38:10,693 --> 02:38:14,193
as a father. He's very thoughtful.

3572
02:38:14,994 --> 02:38:16,993
Tell me you love me.

3573
02:38:16,994 --> 02:38:18,533
- I love you. - I love you.

3574
02:38:19,163 --> 02:38:21,574
The ensembles were in the back.

3575
02:38:22,074 --> 02:38:24,874
As we painted our faces red...

3576
02:38:25,003 --> 02:38:27,443
and we were all wearing black,

3577
02:38:27,744 --> 02:38:30,474
I thought they might
not be able to spot me.

3578
02:38:31,173 --> 02:38:34,412
But it seemed they recognized
me somehow and only looked at me.

3579
02:38:34,413 --> 02:38:35,753
(Kim Hyo Joon is the best!)

3580
02:38:35,853 --> 02:38:38,724
Today? I fell in love.

3581
02:38:39,484 --> 02:38:42,323
Even though he's my son, he
was so cool that my heart fluttered.

3582
02:38:42,324 --> 02:38:45,324
Even among the amazing dancers,

3583
02:38:45,663 --> 02:38:47,593
he shined the most. He was incredible.

3584
02:38:48,163 --> 02:38:50,532
- Really? - Your picky brother liked it.

3585
02:38:50,533 --> 02:38:52,363
- I teared up. - You did?

3586
02:38:52,704 --> 02:38:53,944
I can't believe I made you cry.

3587
02:38:55,304 --> 02:38:56,904
I was going in.

3588
02:38:57,273 --> 02:38:59,244
They were filming the audience.

3589
02:38:59,474 --> 02:39:01,450
There were people who
obviously looked like my mother...

3590
02:39:01,474 --> 02:39:02,773
and my sibling.

3591
02:39:03,013 --> 02:39:05,012
I got emotional when I saw my mom.

3592
02:39:05,013 --> 02:39:06,043
- You got emotional? - Yes.

3593
02:39:06,044 --> 02:39:08,384
(Go Dong Hoon is the best.)

3594
02:39:08,513 --> 02:39:09,582
(Dong Hoon's mother was
supporting him from afar.)

3595
02:39:09,583 --> 02:39:11,583
(Emotional)

3596
02:39:11,884 --> 02:39:13,724
How was your mother looking at you?

3597
02:39:14,124 --> 02:39:15,824
At first, she was worried.

3598
02:39:15,954 --> 02:39:18,824
She was so happy about my
performance when it was over.

3599
02:39:18,923 --> 02:39:21,563
Our eyes met when I was on stage.

3600
02:39:21,564 --> 02:39:23,032
(Dong Hoon and his mother
recognized each other from afar.)

3601
02:39:23,033 --> 02:39:25,103
- It was so cool. - Was it okay?

3602
02:39:25,904 --> 02:39:27,204
I loved it.

3603
02:39:28,773 --> 02:39:30,673
It feels like the stress
is instantly relieved.

3604
02:39:31,234 --> 02:39:32,304
Mnet is the best.

3605
02:39:33,374 --> 02:39:36,343
She was so happy and had a lot of fun.

3606
02:39:36,443 --> 02:39:39,443
I was relieved and happy as well.

3607
02:39:40,413 --> 02:39:43,484
I'm happy to be able to show my dance...

3608
02:39:43,884 --> 02:39:45,023
on a stage like this.

3609
02:39:46,023 --> 02:39:48,994
We made good memories.

3610
02:39:49,894 --> 02:39:52,794
So I think my parents will be proud of me.

3611
02:39:54,663 --> 02:39:57,794
It does make me happy.

3612
02:39:59,704 --> 02:40:02,532
- You worked hard. - You worked hard.

3613
02:40:02,533 --> 02:40:05,103
- Go, Kim Jong Cheol! - You got this!

3614
02:40:05,503 --> 02:40:06,544
You're the best.

3615
02:40:07,404 --> 02:40:10,013
(We'd like to thank all the
families of the dancers.)
